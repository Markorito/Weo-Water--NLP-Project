Big Sandy Lake should crest June near record highs, the Army Corps says

Some places in Minnesota and Wisconsin still under flooding warnings

Roads and parks are closed after intense flash flooding

Days after torrential rains caused intense flash flooding, residents of northeastern Minnesota and neighboring Wisconsin spent Friday coping with the aftermath -- including numerous road closures and continued worries about still dangerously high waters.

Flood warnings remained in effect for parts of Burnett, Pine and Carlton counties in Minnesota, as well as in Ashland County, Wisconsin, even though waters in some creeks and rivers were receding, the National Weather Service said.

Many of these warnings extend through Sunday, though the flooding concerns may not abate then. Water levels in Big Sandy Lake, which is about 60 miles west of Duluth, are rising at a rate of one foot per day, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports. The lake is expected to crest June 30 just above or below record highs.

In Ashland County, emergency management officials were discouraging travel because most roads in the county had been compromised by water, according to the National Weather Service.

Hundreds of people in the cities of Barnum, Moose Lake and Thomson were either partially or fully evacuated, and the city of Willow River was under a boil-water order, state officials said.

""It feels like a whale is swallowing us, like we're swimming in an ocean,"" Kris Huse, a city council member in Moose Lake whose own backyard was inundated by water, told CNN affiliate KBJR . ""I feel like I have to save the town.""

Minnesota officials have requested federal damage assessment assistance in 14 counties, the first step in deciding whether Gov. Mark Dayton will ask for federal disaster assistance funding, according to the Minnesota Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.

More than 150 people remained in Minnesota shelters on Friday, according to the state Department of Public Safety.

The floods followed heavy storms Sunday through Tuesday that dropped as much as 10 inches of rain on Duluth and neighboring communities, according to the weather service.

The flooding washed out roads and bridges, inundated neighborhoods and killed 11 animals at the Duluth zoo.

No people were reported dead in Minnesota, but three fatalities were reported in Clark County, Wisconsin. Those three were in two cars that crashed Wednesday on a washed-out road, the state emergency management agency said.

A calamity was averted near Proctor, Minnesota, when an 8-year-old boy was swept into a culvert while playing in flood waters. But after floating six or seven blocks, he survived the ordeal except for a few scrapes, the National Weather Service said.

Numerous roads remained closed in Minnesota, and Jay Cooke, Moose Lake and Savanna Portage state parks were closed until further notice due to flooding damage, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said.

Recovery will be a long process, KBJR quoted Duluth Chief Administrative Officer David Montgomery as saying.

""This is going to take months in many cases,"" he said. ""It'll take upwards to a year and into next year for some of the major items.""

Officials at Lake Superior Zoo were tallying damage there after water surged through the park, leaving 11 animals dead and allowing several others to briefly escape their enclosures.

CNN iReporter Ellie Burcar snapped a picture of one of the escaped animals, a seal, on the road outside the zoo early Wednesday morning.

""The amazing thing is that the seal was moving across Grand Ave heading (toward) the Lake Superior Zoo as if it just wanted to go home,"" Burcar said.

The zoo moved some animals to other facilities, and some were being kept in quarantine inside the zoo's animal care building during cleanup efforts, the zoo said in a statement posted to its website.

The zoo is planning a volunteer cleanup project this weekend.

Despite the damage, Minnesota officials stressed that Duluth and many state parks in the northwest part of the state are open for tourism and tried to highlight at least one positive effect from the recent storms.

Between 38 and 41 people were missing as of press time on Thursday in the aftermath of rain-triggered mudslides in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

From Wednesday night to early Thursday morning, downpours lashed Ningnan county in the Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture of Sichuan. The heavy rains caused mudslides around 6:15 am in the Aizigou Valley, where construction workers from Three Gorges Co were staying as they worked on Baihetan Hydropower Station.

""Eight workers were rescued from the site, and 38 to 41 were missing,"" said Zhou Junjia, chief of the information office of Ningnan county government.

Six of the eight rescued workers had minor injuries and were treated at a hospital near the hydropower station, she said.

More than 1,000 people were searching for the missing workers, said Xu Zhiwen, deputy chief of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Land and Resources.

""After the landslides, a disaster relief group led by executive vice-governor Wei Hong headed to the site, 75 km from the county seat of Ningnan,"" he said.

Ningnan, a mostly mountainous county 642 km from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, and bordering Yunnan province, has a high incidence of mudslides in the rainy season.

""Judging from experience, the missing workers have a very slim chance of surviving,"" Zhou told China Daily in a telephone interview. ""The mud and rocks in the landslide area are unstable, and it's likely to rain more in the next three days.""

Aside from the workers, there were no casualties from the mudslides. But damage was extensive.

The houses of 17 families were significantly damaged or destroyed and 133 hectares of farmland, 20 km of irrigation ditches, more than 30 km of rural highways and five makeshift bridges on highways were destroyed, said Hu Qi'an, an official of the Ningnan county flood control office.

The Baihetan Hydropower Station on the Jinsha River, a tributary of the Yangtze on its upper reaches, helps prevent floods in addition to generate electricity.

It is expected to become the nation's second-largest hydropower station, after the Three Gorges Dam, upon its completion in 2022, with an installed capacity of 14 million kilowatts.

It's construction, and that of three other hydropower stations on the Jinsha River, is part of the country's West-to-East Electricity Transmission Project. The four power stations would help retain silt to reduce sedimentation in the Three Gorges reservoir.

They will also increase water flow in the dry season to increase the power-generating capacity of the Three Gorges and Gezhouba stations in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

4,4,FL-2012-000111-CHN,China's Other Sleeping Giant Is the Other White Meat - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/food/2012/06/chinese-pork-export/,"Since the dawn of the Great Recession, Americans have been eating less meat, including pork. Meanwhile, prices of corn and soy—the main components of US livestock feed—have been high.

Lower demand, high feed costs: Basic economics tells us that US factory farms should be cutting back, slowing down, producing less. And that would be a good thing, because as I’ve written so many times before, our style of meat production sucks up huge amounts of resources and creates vast amounts of pollution.

Yet look what’s happening in Iowa, by far the nation’s leading hog-producing state. There, the Des Moines Register reports, there’s been a boom in state-issued permits for new factory-scale hog confinements. As the chart to the right shows, new permits fell off dramatically in 2009, driven down by the low hog prices, but are now charging back up.

Why would the meat industry be investing so heavily in new hog capacity if the economics aren’t working out? Grist food editor Twilight Greenaway proposes an answer: The industry is looking toward a boom in pork exports. Greenaway points to a recent article in Iowa Farmer Today showing that the US pork industry is salivating at the prospect. Recent free trade pacts with South Korea and Colombia, plus an expected one with Panama, will likely boost that number.

Indeed, the pork export explosion is already underway. The industry currently exports nearly 28 percent of of the pork produced in the United States, Iowa Farmer Today reports. According to this recent USDA report, pork exports in the first four months of 2012 jumped 13.5 percent compared to the same period of 2011. The biggest driver was China, with its rapidly expanding demand for meat. Pork exports to China reached 259 million pounds in the first 4 months of 2012*—a 142 percent leap. If present trends continue, China will soon surpass Mexico and Japan as the largest export market for US pork.

And that could happen quickly. According to a hog-industry official quoted by Iowa Farmer Today, the United States produces hogs much more cheaply than its Chinese counterparts—$63 per hundred pounds of animal for US producers vs. $113 for Chinese farmers.

The difference quite likely lies in the degree of industrialization of hog farming in the two countries. In the US, nearly all hog production takes place in factory-scale facilities. Small-scale, diversified farms have been all but wiped out by the consolidation of meat packing, replaced by gigantic confinement operations. Between 1990 and 2010, this USDA report shows, the number of farms that keep hogs has plunged from about 260,00 to about 69,100, and about 97 percent of pork comes from facilities with at least 500 hogs.

China, too, has made a major push to industrialize farming. As recently as 1985, 95 percent of Chinese pork came from backyard operations distributed across the country, a 2011 report for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade policy found. Today, as the charts below show, 27 percent of hog production still takes place in traditional backyard farming; another 51 percent takes place in small operations with between 50 and 200 pigs. The other 22 percent comes from US-style factory production, in many cases in partnership with US hog giant Smithfield.

Of course, huge operations cut costs by replacing human labor with machines, buying feed in great bulk, and foisting the cost of dealing with massive concentrations of hog waste onto society at as a whole. The mighty US pork machine has much to teach China’s food planners on these topics. A flood of cheap pork imports from the US could be the death knell for what’s left of China’s small-scale hog farmers.

Here in the States, the export boom means that even if we continue eating less meat, we can expect no slowdown in industrial-scale livestock production. Both our poultry and beef industries are experiencing similar export surges. Indeed, the Obama administration has actively encouraged it as part of the effort to double all US exports under the president’s watch. It would be a singular irony if the United States, the most powerful nation on earth, emerged as the place where lax regulations and low wages made it the hog (and chicken and cow) butcher for the world.

Severe flooding continued in Minnesota's south on Thursday while flood-ravaged Duluth started the slow clean up after two of the area's wettest days in history.

Hundreds of residents who were evacuated from their homes in low-lying neighbourhoods including Fon du Lac were still waiting to hear when they could return as much of the town was still underwater and nearly 80 roads around St Louis County remained closed until midday.



Meanwhile, areas further south continued to fight rising waters.

The town of Moose Lake, about 40 miles southwest of Duluth, was described as 'an island' today as officials declared a state of emergency after watching flood waters swamp one road after another.

Touring the water-logged parts of the state today, Governor Mark Dayton vowed to provide state resources and said he would push federal officials to release appropriate aid as soon as possible.

'It's just horrific to see the wipeouts of whole roads that I've been traveling on for years,' Mr Dayton said.



No one has died or been injured in the Minnesota soaking, which Mr Dayton called 'remarkable', but there has been extensive damage.



Duluth's mayor, Don Ness, estimated the floods would cost the city $50 million to $80 million to repair destroyed public infrastructure alone.

Official rain totals show 7.2 inches of rain fell on Duluth on Tuesday and Wednesday, breaking a two-day record set in July 1909. There were reports of up to 10 inches of rainfall in some areas.

The National Weather Service in Duluth said there's no significant rainfall in the forecast for at least the next few days, but many rivers and streams in northeast Minnesota would remain above flood stage well into next week as water continues to flow downstream.

Nicole Lamphier and her family planned to ride out the flooding inundating their Duluth neighborhood at a friend's home nearby but on Thursday they called in the Coast Guard to get them and their three kids, including a nine-month-old, out.

'The damage is indescribable,' said Ms Lamphier. Search: Search and Rescue helicopters conducted search operations over a flooded neighborhood near Duluth

'It's kind of heartbreaking. You see people down there that have lost everything. I'm just glad to be out.'

She said she saw tipped over cars in her neighborhood, floating sheds, smashed decks and a neighbor's yard that now looked like a 'raging river'. 'Yesterday it was kind of like `Oh my God, we are going to lose everything,'' Ms Lamphier said. 'Now I'm just thankful my kids are OK.' The Red Cross said nearly 200 people stayed in shelters on Wednesday night in Duluth. About 250 residents of the city's Fond du Lac neighborhood were told to evacuate on Wednesday night, but 49 of them stayed put, St. Louis County Emergency Services Manager Scott Camps said. Shelters were also set up in Scanlon and Askov, both towns south of Duluth.

Moose Lake city Administrator Mark Vahlsing said at least 30 per cent of the town was flooded and that many homes and businesses had problems with standing water. About 20 families evacuated voluntarily.



'I would say it's the worst flooding the city has ever seen,' Mr Vahlsing said.

In nearby Sturgeon Lake, Pine County authorities rescued a man after floodwaters swept his panel truck off a highway. Near the town of Rutledge, deputies in a boat rescued an elderly man from his trailer after floodwaters knocked it off its foundation.

'It's still a flash flood situation here, and we don't know where it will pop,' said Pine County Chief Deputy Steve Blackwell.



'We're just trying to anticipate problem areas.'

Mr Blackwell said the areas worst affected were close to swollen streams, rivers and lakes.

Many state parks and recreational areas were temporarily closed to visitors in a region that relies heavily on tourism. The assistant manager at Savanna Portage State Park, where seven campers were stranded for a night but able to leave on Thursday afternoon, said the 16,000-acre park would remain closed at least throughout the weekend.

Officials said the rise and fall of the floodwaters was unpredictable and that many areas saw numerous crests. Authorities in Duluth and in rural areas in the region were warning people to stay away from streams and culverts and to not under any circumstances drive around barricades or through flooded parts of roads.

Officials in most areas said they expected flooding problems to persist at least into the coming weekend, and they were hoping for continued sunny weather. After his tour, Mr Dayton said a special legislative session could be an option to respond to flood damage.

He said the region's economy could take a hit with paper mills and taconite plants affected by flooding.



Mr Dayton said he would do everything he could to make sure that state and federal aid flowed quickly, but he warned people they would have to be patient.



'I wish there were a magic wand and all these roads could be repaired,' Mr Dayton said.



Mike Smith was one of many Fond du Lac neighbors who went up to the police barricades on Thursday, asking when he might be able to return home.

Police had no answers.

She drove as far as deputies would let her and then she parked on Trouble Creek Road, rolled up her jeans, held her tennis shoes in her hands and started sloshing through knee-high water. She passed two snakes. She walked faster.

""This area never floods,"" she said Tuesday afternoon, as Tropical Storm Debby lingered off the coast, sputtering rain. Debby dumped 15 to 20 inches of rain in recent days, causing flooding and massive evacuations that west Pasco hasn't seen since the hurricane season of 2004.

Gioeli hadn't been home since Saturday, when her husband mysteriously passed out and was taken to the hospital. She has been with him since, she said. She talked to neighbors Tuesday, heard about the flooding and raced home to get her cat.

""They said we're under water,"" said Gioeli, 39. She hoped her cat had jumped to a high, dry spot in the house. ""I'll find out soon.""

Her house is near the Cotee River, which flooded along with the Anclote River, which often floods. The Cotee rarely floods.

""Never,"" said Dottie Ackerman, 63, who has lived in the Mill Run subdivision for 12 years. ""This is the worst we've ever had it.""

Ackerman was one of an estimated 14,000 to 20,000 people living along the Anclote and Cotee rivers who were told to evacuate Tuesday. Rescue workers went door to door, telling people they needed to leave. Though it was called a mandatory evacuation, residents were not forced out if they chose to stay, but they were warned floodwaters could continue to rise.

""Our main goal is to get people out of harm's way,"" said Doug Tobin, spokesman for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.

The power was shut down in the evacuation zone, which was Plathe Road on the north, Little Road on the east, Mitchell Ranch and Perrine Ranch roads on the south and Thys and Voorhees roads on the west. There were more than 7,000 residential and commercial addresses within that zone, said Pasco County spokesman Eric Keaton. He said the power was shut down because of the dangers of mixing electricity with the rising flood waters.

""It's a safety concern,"" he said.

The zone is expected to expand, with reports Tuesday of flooding east of Little Road.

Two shelters were available for evacuees. By Tuesday night, 33 people had fled to Chasco Elementary School in Port Richey and 47 were staying at the Mike Fasano Regional Hurricane Shelter in Hudson, Keaton said.

As Debby moves toward land at a glacial pace, the wind from the storm pushes the sea water toward land, giving resistance to flooded rivers trying to drain into the gulf. This means the flood waters here won't have an avenue of escape for some time, Keaton said.

""The problem is with Debby not moving, it's not allowing the tide to go out,"" said Port Richey City Manager Tom O'Neill.

The county also expects to get another 3 to 6 inches of rain this week, said Annette Doying, director of emergency management for Pasco County.

""We are still in it for a while,"" she said.

And with the area so saturated, even a few inches of rain could exacerbate the flooding problem, New Port Richey City Manager John Schneiger said.

""Our public works is showing we received 15 inches of rain,"" said Schneiger. ""We're still very concerned there will be more flooding, and we think there is a good chance it may get worse. We're anticipating the problem will continue through the weekend.""

Isolated tornadoes are possible this week, Doying said. Authorities suspect tornadoes caused damage on Sunday to areas in Pasco, including blowing the roof off the post office in Elfers, battering Centennial Library in Holiday and damaging several homes in the Tanglewood Terrace subdivision in New Port Richey.

By Sunday night, U.S. 19 became a terrifying river. Many low-lying areas in west Pasco have been flooded for days. On Monday, residents of Thousand Oaks in Trinity took sledgehammers to the wall surrounding their community, punching holes in the concrete to relieve the waist-high water trapped inside. There were reports of citizens outside the evacuation zone calling rescuers to be helped to safety, including Suncoast Gateway Mobile Village in Port Richey on Monday and Club Wildwood in Hudson on Tuesday.

Residents needing to be evacuated have been urged to call 911. Those with questions may call the county's resident information line at (727) 847-8959. At 2 p.m. Tuesday, the county reported it had been getting 200 calls every half hour, mostly from people who already called 911 and were stranded inside their homes, waiting to be rescued.

The city of New Port Richey also reported a voluntary evacuation order and shut off the power at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Harborview Mobile Home Park on Louisiana Avenue and Congress Street. Buses were available at Gulf Middle School to transport those residents to area shelters.

Although much of the focus of Debby has been in west Pasco, there have been reports of flooding in east Pasco, with a portion of Bellamy Brothers Boulevard closed Tuesday. Sections of many large, heavily trafficked roads in western Pasco remained closed Tuesday: State Road 54, Ridge Road, Trouble Creek Road, Mitchell Ranch Road.

Two sinkholes were reported Tuesday, one on Majestic Boulevard at the entrance to Beacon Woods in Bayonet Point, and another on Grand Boulevard in New Port Richey.

No injuries from the storm have been reported, Keaton said.

Xu Zechen discovers his niche as a writer, distancing himself from the shadows of his predecessors and successors. Yang Guang finds out more in Beijing.

Post-1970 writers have long been considered a shadow generation, falling behind both the literary quality of their predecessors born in the 1950s and 1960s, and the market influence of their post-1980 successors. Praised by literary magazine Master as ""the glory of the post-1970 writers"", Xu Zechen says his embarrassingly sandwiched cloud has a silver lining. ""Being the antagonists of the literary scene renders us more patience to toil in silence,"" the 34-year-old says. His silent toiling has given voice to the equally silent social classes struggling on the boundaries of the country's urban landscape.

The main characters of his novel, Running Through Zhongguancun, which propelled him into a recognized writer, are pirate DVD peddlers and fake certificate makers in Zhongguancun.

Zhongguancun, the electronics area known as the country's ""Silicon Valley"", has become a literary landmark due to his ""wandering in Beijing"" story series.

Running Through Zhongguancun, his 2006 novella about the love story of pirate DVD peddler Dun Huang, will soon be available in English.

Despite the pedigree of having obtained a master's degree from Peking University and working as an editor with China's longest running literary magazine People's Literature, Xu says his rural background connects himself with the underprivileged in his stories.

Growing up in the countryside of Donghai, Jiangsu province, he spent his childhood pasturing cattle, planting rice and running around in the fields.

He began reading seriously only after attending middle school, where he rented books from bookstores and borrowed from classmates.

Xu recalls reading over and over again Qian Zhongshu's Fortress Besieged and Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

His first ambition was to become a lawyer but his dream was shattered because he didn't perform well in the college entrance examination. When he ended up studying Chinese in a small town college, he felt ""tragically frustrated"".

""I read voraciously in the library day in, day out, but still I didn't know what I really wanted to do,"" he recalls.

The idea of being a writer struck him one afternoon in the summer vacation of 1997, when he finished reading Zhang Wei's novel Family Clan. (Family Clan was later included as the first volume of Zhang's 10-volume Mao Dun Literature Prize-winning novel You Are on the Highland.)

""I was excited to realize that it was so wonderful being a writer,"" he says. ""A good writer can convey all you have to say, in a more exact and beautiful way.""

Xu started writing and publishing, while staying in college to teach after graduation. He weaved the small town into the literary world he created in the ""Flower Street"" story series.

Built with blue stones on the bank of a canal, Flower Street is a fictional street where the series of idyllic stories took place, similar to William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County and Garcia Marquez's Macondo.

In 2002, Xu quit his job and went to Beijing to further his studies. ""I made the decision because the idea of leaving and exploring the world had been sizzling in my mind all those years,"" he says.

He got to know a group of pirate DVD peddlers and fake certificate makers, running their business furtively in Zhongguancun, so he started writing about them and their peers from across the country, rooting themselves in the concrete jungle of the capital.

Xu says the more he wrote, the more he found meaning in his work.

He sees Beijing as an example of urban centers confronted with the problems of urbanization, modernization and globalization.

""My writing has become a means for me to probe into these issues, in which I have great interest,"" he says.

For Xu, Zhongguancun bears the characteristics of a perfect specimen, inhabited by people from all walks of life. ""It's no exaggeration to say that once we understand about Zhongguancun, we understand about Beijing and the rest of the country,"" he says.

Xu says the dramatic social reality unfolding each day in China provides writers with exciting issues to ruminate.

""As a faithful and humble writer, I draw satisfaction from recording what my generation feels about our era.""

He is currently working on a novel portraying the confusion and anxiety confronting a group of post-1970 people, and their pursuit of security and inner peace.

London Mayor Boris Johnson and Seb Coe, chairman of organizers LOCOG, watched as a giant set of interlocking Olympic Rings were eased into place on Tower Bridge across the River Thames.

The rings, 25 meters wide and 11.5 meters tall, are a centerpiece of the ""2012 look"" that visitors from around the world will experience as they flood into the capital for the Games starting on July 27 and ending on Aug 12.

""Tower Bridge is recognized the world over and, adorned with the famous Olympic Rings, is the perfect choice to showcase what London has to offer this summer,"" declared Johnson.

""With just a month to go, we are making our final preparations and want to ensure each and every person in the capital gets a flavor of the celebrations and feels part of the Games.""

The Tower Bridge rings, which cost some 260,000 pounds ($405,500) to produce, have been paid for out of a 32 million pound 'Look and Celebration' budget with events scheduled across the capital.

Not everyone will be allowed to attend the party, however. Britain has already refused a visa for the head of Syria's national Olympic Committee, General Mowaffak Joumaa, to travel to London.

Mowaffak is seen as a close friend of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been strongly criticized by Britain and other Western and Arab nations for a crackdown on an opposition movement seeking his overthrow.

Sports Minister Hugh Robertson told BBC radio that he expected more exclusions in the days and weeks to come.

""Any (applications) that are controversial are referred to the Foreign Office, the Home Office and myself as the Sports Minister and we take decisions on a case by case basis,"" he said.

""If people apply for visas that have connections with regimes that are guilty of human rights abuses they will not be allowed in... nobody connected with the human rights abuses taking place in Syria at the moment should be part of our Games.""

The Olympics may be more of a background hum for many Londoners at present, with the Wimbledon tennis championships dominating current sports headlines, and England's failure to progress beyond the Euro 2012 soccer quarterfinals.

Once called Zhongdian, the county beat other places a decade ago in a contest to claim the designation of Shangri-La.

Shangri-La was originally the name given to a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by the British author James Hilton. Hilton described Shangri-La as being a mystical, harmonious valley enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains.

A number of places in China sought to take on the name of the fictional location and Zhongdian county won a contest for the right to it. In 2001, the county officially renamed itself Shangri-La in a step meant to attract tourists.

Following the renaming, the number of visitor who travel to the county has increased sixfold.

""The county received more than 6 million Chinese and foreign tourists last year,"" Liu Zhiguang, head of the county's tourism bureau, told China Daily.

""In 2002, the figure was about one million.

""Ten years ago, you could hardly find a nice hotel in Shangri-La. Today you can stay in a Shangri-La Hotel, a Sheraton or a Singapore Banyan Tree Hotel.""

Tourists used to leave the county after seeing its sights. But as the accommodations there have improved, tourists are staying around longer.

The booming tourism industry is also changing local people's lives.

Larong Qilin, a 68-year-old Tibetan man living in a village called Xiagei, spent about 400,000 yuan ($63,000) in Shangri-La in 2007 on a wooden house built in a Tibetan style.

He and his wife are selling crafts and homemade suyoucha, a local specialty made with flour and milk, to tourists and his son and daughter-in-law are working as cleaners at a tourist site.

Last year, millions of tourists brought the county almost 6 billion yuan in revenue, contributing about 40 percent of the county's GDP.

Shangri-La county has five national 4A-listed tourism destinations, including Pudacuo National Park, the Tiger Leaping Gorge, Songzanlin Lamaist Temple and Balazongge. The county is among China's eight most popular tourist destinations.","Sun, 24 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20121203/d4bed9d534551226d60647.jpg,"['celebrates', 'places', 'tourist', 'anniversary', 'tibetan', 'tourists', 'number', 'county', 'yuan', 'shangrila', 'renaming', 'tourism', 'zhongdian']", 
17,17,FL-2012-000111-CHN,Is China's Duanwu Festival the world's first gay Valentine's Day? - Shanghaiist,http://shanghaiist.com/2012/06/23/duanwu-festival-gay-valentines/,"By Kenneth Tan and Horace Lu

A growing chorus of voices is challenging the official narrative of the great Warring States poet Qu Yuan (屈原) as a patriot who, in an apparent suicide in 278 BC, threw himself into the Miluo River holding a heavy rock to protest against the alliance of the state of Chu with the hegemonic Qin state.

The poet’s memory is honoured annually today on Duanwu Festival (端午节) by millions of ethnic Chinese around the world with the eating of rice dumplings, which according to legend, were thrown off dragon boats by locals to feed the fish so they would not feed on his corpse.

Academics have proferred another reason for Qu Yuan’s suicide than his supposed love for the nation. The poet, they say, was more of a romantic than a patriot, and it was his love for — and subsequent abandonment — by the King Huai of Chu (楚怀王) that led him to immerse himself into the river.

The thesis that Qu Yuan was a homosexual and a lover of his king was first put forth in 1944 by the Sichuan scholar Sun Cizhou. In Li Sao 《离骚》 (“Departing in Sorrow”), an allegorical poem in the Chuci 《楚辞》 poetry anthology, Qu Yuan falls into depression after his rejection by his lord and slanderous attacks by jealous officials surrounding the king.

Qu Yuan’s references to the king as “美人” (beautiful man, or beautiful person) and “灵修” (restoration of the soul) were both terms widely used by women at that time to characterise their lovers, according to Sun. The poet’s eventual suicide because the king had found other new lovers was a love story, not a patriotic story, said Sun.

Sun’s views, while widely controversial at the time, came to be accepted by other notable academics. The Chuci expert Wen Yiduo (闻一多), for instance, described Sun’s thesis as “completely correct.”

“Sun’s idea that Qu Yuan was a ‘弄臣’ [Editor’s note: someone who offers entertainment to kings or emperors] is completely correct and grounded on historical facts…To be frank, Qu Yuan’s significance in literature will not only be diminished but might be enhanced. I believe we literature critics would welcome the facts Sun has presented, and not reject them.” wrote Wen at the time.

Chi Zhen (池桢), a history researcher at Tianjin-based Nankai University, later noted that Qu Yuan in fact had the ambition to improve his country’s politics through his relationship with the king.

“‘美政’ (beautiful politics) was Qu Yuan’s ultimate ideal. It was the politics based on his pure and everlasting love with King Huai of Chu. In this relationship, both people have a shared and noble political ideal and, pushed by love, both strive for the well-being of the country and people,” wrote Chi in an essay published in 2007.

Such an idea was once close to reality when Qu Yuan was, at the height of his career, loved by King Huai of Chu. However, as the king gradually deserted him and the power struggle worsened, Qu’s dream soon shattered, and his “ Utopia based on homosexual politics disappeared in the Miluo River.”

Fang Gang (方刚), associate professor of gender studies at Beijing Forestry University, believes that Duanwu Festival is the first gay Valentine’s Day in the history of civilisation, and that the recognisation of it as such would be a big move in “rectifying the name” (正名) of both Qu Yuan and the origins of the festival.

Sociologist Liu Chongshun (刘崇顺), however, remains cynical that Fang’s attempts to reposition the festival will be fruitful.

“The image of Qu Yuan (as a patriot) is one that has been formed over two millenia, and has become an immovable fixture in the history, culture and psyche of China,” wrote Liu. “Inasmuch as Fang Gang’s assertions may be grounded in reality, this is not something that can be changed overnight by anyone.”

The debate over whether Duanwu Festival can rightly be called a gay Valentine’s Day has ignited rancorous debate on microblogging platforms in China.

”This is an utter humiliation to years of traditional Chinese culture,” fumed one Sina Weibo user.

“Even if Qu Yuan was really gay, must we remember him based on his sexual orientation?” asked another.

“This makes me want to throw up!” wrote yet another. “Why should society celebrate a phenomenon so perverse and evil as homosexuality?”

The criticisms, however, have not dampened the enthusiasm of members of China’s LGBT community in claiming Duanwu Festival as their own Valentine’s Day.

A-qiang, a Guangdong-based gay activist, wished his followers a “Happy Gay Valentine’s Day!” on the morning of the festival, and others have been following suit.

Amidst the debate, a voice of reason was offered by Zhu Xueqin, a feminist and psychiatrist based in Shanghai.

“Some gay people in China have completely embraced gay festivals from abroad — Pride, and Stonewall and what have you. They’re ready to accept history as told to them by others because it has nothing to do with China,” she observed. “Whether Qu Yuan is gay or not is unimportant. The question here is why heterosexuals can have any day they want as Valentine’s — 2/14, 11/11, 5/20, 7/7 — but when gay people want just one day, they’re expected to provide a historical basis?”

“Why is it when people are told Qu Yuan committed suicide for the love of the nation, they are able to accept it without questioning, but when they’re told Qu Yuan committed suicide because of love (for another man), they demand that you show proof and evidence? Why is there this double standard?”

The blog attracted opposition from women, some of whom held signs and protested against the blog's comments in the Shanghai subway on Sunday, Shandong Business Daily reported.

Shanghai No 2 Subway Co published a micro blog attached with an image on Sina Weibo, saying it's not surprising for women to be harassed in the subway if they are wearing revealing clothing and called on women to cherish themselves.

The blog post attracted much opposition from netizens and some commented by saying a women's choice to wear what she chooses can not be an excuse for sexual harassment.

""According to this logic, all men can harass women in swimming pools?"" wrote netizen Dajiangjoejiu.

But still some supported the metro's blog post and said it's common sense and public ethic to dress conservatively in public places.

""Some young women wear miniskirts or low-cut shirts and make some men dream away or even conduct sexual harassment. Besides criticizing the men, shouldn't the women reflect on their physical signal?"" Was one comment left on the blog.

As the debate goes on, two young women covered their faces and held signs to protest against the Shanghai metro's speech in subway Line 2 on Sunday.

22,22,FL-2012-000111-CHN,Brownville storm damage likely to top $4 million - Bangor Daily News,https://bangordailynews.com/2012/06/26/news/lepage-en-route-to-brownville-as-town-continues-flood-repairs/,"BROWNVILLE, Maine — The impact of the damage created by a thunderstorm that stalled over a three-mile section of town last weekend likely will top more than $4 million when repairs are finished next week, officials said Tuesday.

As Gov. Paul LePage toured flood-damaged areas, including the area in Milo where a 29-year-old man died Sunday, a railroad official estimated Tuesday that the section of rail line wiped out by flooding will cost his railroad $500,000 to fix and its customers $500,000 a day.

Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway CEO Robert Grindrod said the storm hit the state rail network at “the neck of the bottle” — a single track three miles south of Brownville Junction, a key connection for all rail traffic between Aroostook County and southern Maine.





The rail damage, Grindrod said, is among the worst he has seen and in an amazingly small area. Seventeen spots totaling only 1,000 feet were washed away, but effectively forced rail service users ranging from Old Town Fuel and Fiber to Searsport’s GAC Chemical to do without rail service or seek other transportation, he said.

“It’s very much like a hurricane, but very localized,” Grindrod said Tuesday. “If you drew a circle about three miles in diameter using Brownville as a center, you would have gotten just about the whole storm.”

LePage stopped short of agreeing with Grindrod’s estimates but his deputy press secretary, Evan Beal, predicted that the area easily would find the almost $1.8 million in documented infrastructure damage needed to qualify for disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The rail damage won’t qualify for aid, but the economic impact of $500,000 a day will, Beal said.

“I want to let the people of Brownville know that we are going to keep working hard to get things fixed,” LePage said in a statement. “The process is under way by MEMA to find a way forward and they are doing a great job.”

Documenting the damage to meet or exceed the nearly $1.8 million minimum to qualify for federal aid is important, LePage said, and will take awhile.

“It’s more important,” LePage said, “to get the roads open and repaired so people can get moving, get the railroads repaired, get the trains moving. That’s what we are here for.”

LePage met with Town Manager Matthew Pineo and Maine Emergency Management Agency officials at the town office. Pineo spent much of Tuesday polling other communities hard-hit by rains in order to increase Brownville’s chances of getting disaster relief aid.

The 1.5 inches of rain that fell on Brownville overnight Monday didn’t appear to add to damage already inflicted by the 6 to 8 inches of rain that fell overnight Saturday, said Walter Cook, chairman of the Board of Selectmen.

All of the road and rail repairs that have been made since Sunday “stayed in place,” Pineo said, “but we still have some heavy water flows. Nothing was carried away.”

“I think they are doing pretty well. The DOT has stepped up and done a very, very remarkable job,” Cook said.

More than 50 workers from the Maine Department of Transportation, Brownville, MM&A, area municipalities and private have been working since Sunday to reopen four roads and the rail line.

Only Route 11 has been reopened. The other damaged roads remain closed except to local and emergency traffic, Pineo said. He anticipates having the roads reopened by 5 p.m. Friday, just in time for the Fourth of July holiday. Full damage repair might take longer.

The section of track that runs from Brownville south, which MM&A owns, will reopen sometime Thursday, with the northern connection opening Monday or Tuesday, Grindrod said.

State transportation workers are shoring up roads, installing rainwater control ditches and replacing guardrails first to help get traffic flowing, Pineo said.

“I think we are in the clear right now,” he said.

The weekend’s flooding began, National Weather Service meteorologists said, when a large line of rainstorms and microbursts stalled for several hours overnight Saturday, pouring at least 6 inches of rain onto Brownville within two or three hours, mostly within the town’s center. The town’s flood defenses were overwhelmed.

Pineo expressed fears Monday that long-term rail repairs could lead to layoffs by several northern Maine manufacturers and farmers who rely on the rail line, a main artery connecting northern and southern Maine.

Grindrod said he hadn’t heard anything like that from the line’s customers. One of the customers, East Millinocket’s Great Northern Paper Co. LLC, won’t be hurt too much by the track washout, company spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne said.

“We rely partially on the rail line to ship our paper products, but we are currently delivering a strong majority of our orders via trucks,” he said.

Town officials have pegged damage repair estimates at $200,000 in Brownville alone. Milo and Patten also were hard-hit by the rains of the last several days, Beal said.

Flood watches were posted for northern Washington, Penobscot, Piscataquis and southern Aroostook counties, with 2 to 3 inches of rainfall expected by Tuesday night.

LePage was accompanied by Maine Emergency Management Commissioner Robert McAleer, Beal and LePage’s legal counsel on the trip.

Workers at Joe’s Repair Shop in Brownville expressed astonishment that LePage never got out of his car during his tour of the neighborhood. They said it was rather unfeeling of the governor.

“He was 10 feet away. He could have come in and looked at the destruction,” business owner Joe Washburn said. “ We’re probably the worst hit of all the private businesses here.”

LePage was Pineo’s guest during the tour and didn’t control where the long line of vehicles stopped, Beal said. LePage did get out of his car and talk to people in the area where Charles Bromiley IV, 29, of Milo was killed when his vehicle ran into a washed-out section of road on Sunday morning, Beal said.

Grindrod said he was pleased with LePage’s visit.

“There are a lot of other things going on in the state of Maine and let’s face it, five miles away there wasn’t even any flooding damage,” Grindrod said.","Tue, 26 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/06/BDN-Web-Masthead-01.png?fit=5000%2C3200&ssl=1,"['line', 'damage', 'northern', 'beal', 'roads', 'likely', 'rail', 'lepage', 'maine', 'pineo', 'storm', 'brownville', 'million']",

At least 14 animals have drowned at a Minnesota zoo after torrential rain ravaged the northeast corner of the state.



Keepers at the Lake Superior Zoo, which sits at the foot of a hill in Duluth, fear the actual number of drowned animals could be much higher as some cages remain entirely submerged in rain water.

All but one of the zoo's barnyard animals died in the flood, which claimed six sheep, four goats, one donkey, one raven, one snowy owl and one turkey vulture.

Amid the chaos, a polar bear escaped her flooded enclosure and needed to be tranquilised, while two seals were found washed up along nearby roads.



Great escape: A seal whose enclosure flooded at a zoo is caught in a nearby road. At least 14 animals drowned at the zoo after torrential rain battered Duluth, Minnesota

Found: The seal was found swimming in a shallow stream in a nearby road and taken back to the zoo

Zoo spokeswoman Keely Johnson told the Duluth News Tribune that the flooding has prevented a further count of drowned animals but the raven and vulture cages are still entirely submerged.



'Two thirds of the zoo is under water, marketing director Holly Henry told msnbc.com .

The zoo's director of animal management, Peter Pruett, added: 'Our entire staff is devastated.'

Two seals, Helen and Feisty, were able to swim out of the zoo after their tank flooded but were found in a nearby road and brought back to the zoo. Residents snapped photos of the animals trying to cross the road.

The zoo's polar bear, Berlin, also escaped but was caught just as she left her enclosure.



'When they first spotted her, she was on her exhibit - but on the wall of her exhibit,' Henry added. 'She was really quite pleased with herself.'

Devastated: Images show the zoo submerged under water following the flashflood

Tragic: A full count of the animals has not been possible as two-thirds of the zoo is still under water

Police officers helped keepers tranquilise the bear with a dart, and she became increasingly agitated before she fell over and was taken to quarantine.



'Even though it’s a large white object, it’s pretty nerve racking,' police spokesman Jim Hansen.

A creek flows through the 16-acre property, which means torrential rains can cause 'severe, severe flooding', spokesperson Holly Henry said.



The zoo was hit by a devastating flood in 2010, and staff noted it as the worst in memory. Yet no animals were killed in that incident, and only one was moved.

Scores of people took to the zoo's Facebook page to express sadness at the loss of the animals, while others angrily accused the keepers of failing to have adequate precautions to save them.

Staff wrote on the Facebook page: 'What has happened at the zoo is extremely traumatic for our staff and animals. Our hearts are broken.

Tragic: Ashley, the zoo's only donkey, drowned in the flood with all but one of the zoo's barn animals

Site: The seal escaped its enclosure at the Lake Superior Zoo flooded after eight inches of rain in 24 hours

Runaway: Berlin the polar bear also escaped her enclosure but police helped keepers locate and dart her

'We ask for your patience and continued support. We assure you we are continually working to maintain the safety and well-being of our beloved animals.'

The tragedy occurred after nearly nine inches of rain fell on the city in 24 hours, swamping business and homes, and sparking sinkholes, mudslides and flooded roads.

Duluth Mayor Don Ness said he would declare a state of emergency after the deluge caused extensive damage to the port city of about 86,000.

Ness said the order would start the process to obtain federal aid. Governor Mark Dayton said he would travel to Duluth on Thursday to discuss how the state can help.

But Mayor Ness warned there would be no let up. 'There is another band of rain on our way, so it is likely to get worse before it gets better,' he said.

Flashfloods: A man gets dangerously close to the raging Miller Creek near to the zoo

Severe weather: A car is stranded in a flooded road in Duluth, Minnesota after the night of heavy rain

Damage: The rain also opened up sinkholes, above, and caused mudslides throughout Duluth

He added that many residents are spread along a steep hill overlooking Lake Superior, so the water rolls downhill and carries debris with it.

One eight-year-old boy was rescued after being swept six blocks in the floods and escaped with just scrapes and bruises.



Neighbourhoods were being evacuated as a flash flood warning remained in effect Wednesday night. Many reported flooded basements, while others said water reached their first floor windows.

'Fortunately it is a relatively small number of households that are being evacuated,' Ness said. 'Most homes in Duluth are farther up the hill.'



The rain also caused the city's new sewage overflow system to fail.

'We don’t even know the extent of it yet because it’s too dangerous to be out checking in some spots,' Karen Anderson, a spokeswoman for the sanitation district, told the News Tribune.

The fact that China's been building up its military with speed and agility recently is nothing new, but Beijing is now going head-to-head with one of the U.S. Navy's most troubled programs

The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is meant to be part of the fleet being moved to the Pacific, and though a couple versions of the ship were put to sea four years ago, the program is still beset by problems and nowhere near combat ready.

China Defense

Michael Fabey at Aviation Week acquired Navy documents that show the following components had issues on the LCS USS Freedom's recent voyage:

USS Freedom Wikipedia Commons

Heat, flame, smoke and flood alarms; hydraulic power unit systems, airborne mission zone lift hoist and platform; lifting capstan; gypsy winch; oily water separator and transfer pump; reverse osmosis system; watertight doors, degaussing system, gas-turbine intake plenum space; and blow-in doors.

The ship also appears to be minus one of its four engines, upon which repair and reassembly work was started this month, according to the documents.

This is a ship that's been in service for four years, cost over $600 million dollars, and is still having trouble performing basic functions — and now China has launched a littoral ship of its own.

Christian Le Miere at Naval Forces and Maritime Security reports Beijing put its first Type 056 craft into the water a few weeks ago where it will become part of a four-ship team patrolling China's coast.

Apart from looking very similar to the U.S. LCS, the 056 will have stealth characteristics and carry some impressive weaponry like Type 87 anti-submarine rockets, AK-176 Russian 76 mm gun systems, and C-803 anti-ship missiles.

It's these ships that China may look to when enforcing the exclusive economic zones in the country's territorial waters.","Mon, 25 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/4fe8e3d869bedd7b08000002?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['china', 'program', '056', 'water', 'chinas', 'type', 'warship', 'coastal', 'struggling', 'response', 'navys', 'systems', 'system', 'littoral', 'ship', 'lcs']",

HONG KONG - Chinese President Hu Jintao Friday afternoon inspected the Chinese People's Liberation Army ( PLA) Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( HKSAR) at Shek Kong barracks.

Hu, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission, arrived Friday morning to attend celebrations marking the 15th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and the swearing-in ceremony of the fourth-term government of the HKSAR.

In the company of Zhang Shibo, commander of the PLA Garrison in the HKSAR, Hu consecutively inspected troops in 15 formations of more than 3,000 soldiers, including guard of honor, army, navy, air force, women soldiers, infantry, armored force and helicopters.

About 4,000 spectators, including Hong Kong youths attending the garrison's military summer camp and college students who received military training in recent years, were present on the occasion.

The PLA Hong Kong garrison is responsible for defense in Hong Kong since its return to the motherland in 1997.

The garrison has made major contribution to securing Hong Kong's prosperity and stability over the past 15 years, China's defense ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng told a press conference in Beijing on Thursday.

""The garrison has been focusing on combat readiness training, marine and air patrol missions, joint military drills, while successfully carrying out joint rescue and anti-terrorism training programs,"" said Geng.","Fri, 29 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/HK15th/attachement/jpg/site1/20120629/f04da2db14491157eef804.jpg,"['shek', 'region', 'hk1', 'pla', 'reviews', 'garrison', 'hong', 'military', 'chinese', 'army', 'kong', 'special', 'hu', 'peoples']",

Well-wishers arrive at Shanghai Blue Cross Brain Hospital on Tuesday to visit 7-year-old Wang Yan, who remains in critical condition after trying to protect her mother from an attacker. She suffered severe brain injuries after being hit with a spade. Shanghai Blue Cross Brain Hospital / Provided to China Daily

Wang Yan has been in a coma since April 21 when she was hit on the head with a spade.

According to police and relatives, the girl had been walking with her mother in Zhangli village, Anhui province, when a man suddenly attacked them. Her 47-year-old mother was hit in the head with the spade before Wang threw herself in the way, resulting in her injuries.

Wang's mother died at the scene, while the girl suffered severe trauma to her brain and brain stem, as well as multiple skull fractures.

Zhangli police detained a suspect identified as Shi Chao on the day of the attack, but said the case is still under investigation. Shi is suspected of having a mental illness, they said.

""My sister suffered respiratory failure two hours after the tragedy and could only be taken off the ventilator 10 days later,"" said Wang's 22-year-old brother Wang Yongma, who added that he spent his entire savings — 70,000 yuan ($11,000) — to pay for the first 45 days of treatment.

The girl was originally admitted to Huainan Xinhua Hospital in Anhui, but medics there said they were unable to cope, so she was transferred to Shanghai Blue Cross Brain Hospital on June 3.

Surgeons operated on Wang Yan on June 13 to reduce a build up of water on the brain.

""Her vital signs are stable, but the condition is far from substantially improved,"" Zhou Kexiang, the attending physician, said on Friday. ""She has just been transferred from intensive care to an ordinary ward, and her physiological responses indicate signs of recovery, but we can't say she is out of danger yet.""

Although in a coma, the patient is responding to sounds and pain, he said.

""Clapping or calling her name will make her eyes follow the sound, and she cried and shouted when I inserted the gastric tube,"" added nurse Sheng Yu. ""I can sense a strong desire to survive.""

Zhou said the top priority is for Wang Yan to regain consciousness.

""We're trying to wake her and aid the recovery of her brain functions with drugs. A lasting coma may lead to deterioration or complications in other body systems,"" he said.

Wang Yongma and his 62-year-old father have stayed at the girl's bedside every day. However, their biggest concern is paying for further treatment.

The father underwent surgery for advanced esophageal cancer last year, which had already put the family in debt. The brother did not finish junior high school and been doing odd jobs since he was 17 years old.

To continue paying for her treatment, the family said it has raised 8,000 yuan by selling everything at home.

After media reports on the girl's bravery, scores of Shanghai residents have visited her and made donations. A middle-aged woman dropped in on Friday afternoon and left 1,000 yuan without revealing her name, the brother said.

""We're really grateful to these kind-hearted people, but the doctors have told us we might need 300,000 yuan for future treatment,"" he said. ""I don't want to beg, but I do hope my sister can survive.""

28,28,FL-2012-000111-CHN,King's hill mausoleum points to lavish dreams |Heritage |chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012-06/25/content_15521526.htm,"While most ancient imperial mausoleum sites draw tourists with their grand scale or extravagant treasures, the royal tombs of King Liangxiao and his wife in Mangdang Mountain of Yongcheng, Henan province, offer an added attraction.

Instead of piling up huge mounds over the burial sites, tens of thousands of workers chiseled out these tombs from the rocky hills, in effect making the hills the exterior of the mausoleum.

The mausoleums of King Liangxiao and his queen, who lived in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24), also amaze visitors with complex inner layouts.

One sunny day, we started our underground adventure by first visiting the queen's final resting place. Traces of hew were still visible on the ground and sidewalls at the entrance, along stacks of square stones used to seal the tomb entrance.

The queen's tomb, which was discovered in 1990, is considered to be the largest stone cave tomb found in China. It is 210 meters long and covers an area of 1,600 square meters with a volume of 6,500 cubic meters in space, all symmetrically laid out.

The site is made up of two halls connected by an axial path going from east to west, and has three side corridors and 34 lateral chambers - all these were built before the advent of gunpowder.

Visitors can easily get lost in the corridors without guides.

To prevent the mausoleum from raiders, the whole underground site was sealed and blocked with nearly 3,000 enormous stones. Each stone was also inscribed with an order number and the name of its manufacturer.

In line with the Chinese idea of ""treating the dead as the living"", there is also a whole set of features, such as a meeting room, bedroom, bathroom, closet, barn, weapons storehouse and toilet.

Besides offering insights into ancient people's lives, some of the facilities are also believed to be the oldest relics of their kind, including a delicately carved ice-storage chamber and stone pedestal pan.

The tomb also features a sophisticated drainage system. There is an underground passage from the queen's tomb to the king's, said to be a shortcut for the couple to meet each other in the afterworld. However, it was not completed due to the presence of spring waters.

Surprisingly, the king's mausoleum, which is next to his queen's and similar in structure, is of a smaller scale and covers 700 sq m.

The Liang State was one of the most affluent areas during its time, and the king was said to be even richer than his brother - the emperor. But King Liangxiao's ambition did not end there. His ultimate goal was the throne.

His dream was unfulfilled as he died unexpectedly of disease. The construction of his luxurious tomb, which tens of thousands of laborers already started to work when he was still young, stopped abruptly.

To maintain a lavish life in the afterworld, the king ordered all his wealth to be buried with him. But his dream ended up in vain again. This time, according to historical records, Cao Cao, a warlord who lived several hundred years later, led his huge army to raid the tomb. Cao looted tons of treasures from it. It took 72 ships to transport them.

Time and frequent tomb raids continued to wash away the past glory of the king's tomb, leaving only its stone rooms for visitors's imagination.

Delicate jade clothes, heaps of ancient coins, terracotta cavalrymen, gold-decorated chariots and many rare relics have since been unearthed in other royal tombs nearby.

One of the most precious relics consists of a 2,000-year-old giant fresco, which surprised many Chinese archaeologists when it was excavated. Painted on the ceiling of a room in the Shiyuan Tomb, the fresco of about 30 sq m, simple and fluid in style, vividly depicts an imagined heaven with Chinese mythological animals surrounded by auspicious clouds.","Mon, 25 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120625/0023ae69624d1152371c0f.jpg,"['tombs', 'underground', 'stone', 'meters', 'lavish', 'points', 'tomb', 'dreams', 'hill', 'relics', 'kings', 'mausoleum', 'king', 'queens']",

In Shropshire yesterday, a 66-year-old retired schoolteacher was swept to his death when a normally gentle brook burst its banks after two hours of torrential rain causing a flash flood.

Michael Ellis, 66, a retired deputy headteacher had been driving home after having blood tests at a nearby doctor's surgery when the sudden floods cut him off in the village of Bittlerley, near Ludlow, just half-a-mile from his home.

Mr Ellis, who lived in the village with his wife Judith, 68, for more than 10 years, abandoned the silver Ford Ka by some farm buildings and attempted to make his way back home by foot.

But he only managed to walk 100 yards before he was swept away.

Witnesses said the man's body was found nearby after the emergency services launched a huge search as heavy rain hit.

Local councillor and farmer Richard Huffer, 50, said he had known Mr Ellis since he was taught by him at a secondary school in nearby Ludlow more than three decades ago.

He said: 'He taught me maths at Ludlow School and I am 50, he has been in the village that amount of time.

'He was a very well respected member of the community. He has helped me a lot in my work as a councillor and I have very fond memories of him as a member of the community and as a friend.

'He will be deeply missed. His wife is in shock.'

Mr Huffer said Mr Ellis had parked his car - a Kia Sportage 4x4 - in a layby to avoid driving through the floods and attempted to walk through a field towards his home in the village.

He said: 'He's parked his car here and cut across through a gate on the right hand side and tried to cross the brook at a higher level.

'Obviously he has got swept away.

Flood alerts were issued across the North East as tributaries to the region's rivers threatened to burst.



In Northumberland, police warned motorists to take care as they received reports of flooding around Haltwhistle, Greenhead Bank and all along the A69 and A68.



Half a month's rain fell in just an hour this morning as the severe storm hit across the Midlands. In Scampton, Lincolnshire, 25.8mm of rain fell between 1pm and 2pm.

Rita Gatehouse, 66, said: 'Mike had been to doctors for blood tests and was driving home.



'He found himself stranded by the flood waters and couldn't drive through - so he got out and walked. He must have been trying to find a different way around when he got into difficulties.'



He also ran a Girl Guides group with his wife Judith. The couple did not have any children.

Earlier, 22.2m fell in Winterbourne, West Midlands, as a weather front moved across the country. And Shrobdon, Herefordshire, had 37mm of rain between 6am and midday today - with most of the wet weather coming during a three-hour period.

International research company Ipsos' report said makeup is viewed as one of the two most important elements used to create a fashionable image, the other being clothing. Jing Wei / For China Daily

Beauty products firm conducts ongoing research to meet demand

As the world's largest cosmetics group, L'Oreal knows that most people have a desire to pursue beauty. The company also believes in the power and significance of beauty in everyday life.

""Beauty has been part of the civilization of mankind,"" said Alexis Perakis-Valat, chief executive officer of L'Oreal China. ""It boosts personal charisma and confidence and gives added meaning to the personal and professional life of women and men all over the world.""

L'Oreal says it has always valued and understood customer demand in various markets and this is the source of its creativity and inspiration.

""We attach great importance to and have long been committed to China. To provide Chinese consumers with superior, efficient products and services, we have always kept a sharp eye on Chinese consumers' demand and desire and continuously improved our local research and production capabilities in China,"" said Perakis-Valat.

Human beings have always pursued beauty. Makeup plays an increasingly important role in Chinese women's lives and also has a deep significance.

To gain a better knowledge of modern Chinese women's perception of makeup and better grasp of how to help them understand and use makeup in a more scientific way, L'Oreal China and its cosmetics brands have conducted long-term, ongoing consumer research in various forms.

According to Perakis-Valat, the company carefully considers makeup for modern Chinese women from the various perspectives of culture, science, psychology and art in order to further improve awareness of it and an appreciation of beauty.

Recently, L'Oreal cooperated with consulting firm Ipsos to launch an online makeup survey for customers in eight major and medium-sized cities across China - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, Changsha, Shenyang and Xi'an - in an attempt to gain a deep understanding into people's makeup behavior, explore both men's and women's attitudes and thoughts about makeup and explore customers' understanding and usage of it.

The survey sampled 988 women and 966 men aged between 18 and 45. It showed makeup is viewed as one of the two most important elements used to create a fashionable image, the other being clothing.

Up to 93 percent of respondents said that makeup helps boost personal charisma, while 83 percent believe makeup enhances self-confidence. About 79 percent of male respondents say makeup can increase attraction from the opposite sex.

The findings of this survey also suggest that most women are already aware of the role and importance of makeup. The evidence is that 80 percent of female respondents say they use makeup in their daily life and 37 percent of them put on makeup three to four times each week.

On average, Chinese women start using makeup at 21 years old, with lipstick being the first makeup product for 60 percent of women.

""China is a fast-developing country with huge consumption potential and currently L'Oreal Group's third largest market in the world,"" said Perakis-Valat. ""With improvement in the standard of living and changes in lifestyle, Chinese women have a continuously growing demand for makeup. As the makeup market has huge potential in the future, it is one of L'Oreal's strategic focus areas. It is also the world's leading cosmetic company's mission to vigorously foster and develop the makeup sector in China.""

As such, L'Oreal announced at the end of last year an investment of 200 million yuan ($31.47 million) to upgrade its Tianmei plant in Yichang, Hubei province, making it the largest makeup production base in Asia.

Coupled with the L'Oreal Research and Innovation Center in Shanghai, L'Oreal will develop and make superior makeup products for Chinese consumers.

L'Oreal, together with seven beauty brands under its umbrella - Helena Rubinstein, Lancome, Giorgio Armani, Shu Uemura, Yue-Sai, L'Oreal Paris and Maybelline - is also finding ways to demonstrate the correct method of using makeup and, in combination with unique brand positioning, creating different themed makeup looks suitable for different occasions.

The aim is to help Chinese women further master and improve their makeup skills and allow them to be more beautiful and outstanding at all times, making their life more colorful, said Perakis-Valat.

Spain keeper Iker Casillas saved Joao Moutinho's penalty then Bruno Alves hit the bar to open the door for substitute Cesc Fabregas, who scored the decisive kick via the post after a 0-0 draw during normal and extra time.

""We lost because Spain were more efficient in the penalties, but it's true that we did not have any luck in this tournament,"" Bento told a news conference.

Asked why the world's most expensive player Ronaldo did not step up to take a penalty, Bento said it had been agreed that the captain would come forward for the final spotkick.

""We had this plan and if it would have been 4-4 and he would taken the last penalty we would be talking in a different way,"" he said.

The coach found much to praise in Portugal's battle with holders Spain, as well as their displays during the showcase in Ukraine and Poland.

""In my opinion we have played a very good tournament. If you consider how we played today I think we were better in the first 90 minutes, then in extra time we were less efficient,"" he said.

""If you don't have this little bit of luck then you miss it. We didn't have much luck in this game.""

Bento also hailed Portugal's Iberian neighbors. ""Spain really deserve to be in the final, but at the same time I want to thank my players for what they have shown in this tournament,"" he added.

""I think we played very competitively, we are an aggressive and cohesive team... the way we lost allows us to have a lot of confidence.""

Alves had looked set to take the third penalty but Nani suddenly appeared behind him, took it and scored. Alves then came back for the fourth spotkick but struck the bar, handing the initiative to Fabregas.

""There was some confusion with Bruno Alves and with Nani, then Bruno took the penalty...and it was decisive,"" the coach continued.

After the exit Van Marwijk and the Dutch football association had two evaluation meetings after which he decided to quit. He started as Dutch national team coach in 2008 and had a contract until 2016.

""The KNVB is grateful to Van Marwijk,"" said director Bert van Oostveen of the KNVB in a statement. ""He has performed exceptionally well at the World Cup and brought us to the first place in the FIFA ranking. Of course it is sad to leave early, but we must be realistic.""

The Netherlands were ousted in the group phase of the European Championship after defeats against Denmark (0-1), Germany (1-2) and Portugal (1-2). Van Marwijk was heavily criticized in Dutch media for his tactics and choices during the tournament.

The 60-year-old Van Marwijk took over from Marco van Basten after Euro 2008. When he took office in 2008 he promised to make 'Oranje' more stable and he did with a very conservative approach. He gave confidence to a select group of players and kept that trust for a long time.

The conservative style of play led to criticism, but thanks to the excellent results the critics remained relatively limited. He even led Holland to the World Cup final in 2010. These European Championships proved the formula did not work anymore. On top of that substitutes like Rafael van der Vaart and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar did no longer hide their discontent and the atmosphere in the squad was not good.

Under guidance of Van Marwijk 'Oranje' played 52 matches, of which they won 34, drew 10 and lost 8. The KNVB will start looking for a new coach immediately. The next match is a friendly against Belgium on August 15.","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/2012euro/attachement/jpg/site1/20120628/0022190dec45115633e906.jpg,"['knvb', 'bert', 'van', '2008', 'national', 'marwijk', 'euro', 'dutch', 'coach', 'group', 'world', 'team', 'quits']",

Jackie Chan is landing his last punch as an action star, but says he is stepping into retirement having made one of the most important films of his career.

The Hong Kong actor said that his latest film ""Chinese Zodiac"" will be his last action movie.

Chan, launching the movie at the Cannes Film Festival with co-stars Kwone Sang Woo, Yao Xingtong and Liao Fan, said that people don't believe him when he says he is going to retire.

""They say 'no, you're still young, you can still do it,' but I have to stop one day.""

The 58-year-old says he is bowing out with ""Chinese Zodiac"" - in which he plays a fortune hunter, travelling the world trying to track down missing astrological antiques - because it is one of the ""most important"" films in his career.

""For the last ten years I've been choosing the director to direct me. This one I direct myself."" he said. ""I hope this movie, 20 years later, people still remember it. For me, for the audience, for my future, for my history — it's very important.""

Chan says ""Chinese Zodiac,"" and the many films before it, have taken their toll on his body.

""It hurts, it really hurts,"" he says, flinching. ""The shoulder, the ankle, it really hurts. You don't know because I still look healthy.""

Not that he plans on putting his feet up - Chan shrugs off suggestions of taking up gardening, cooking or bowling in his spare time. He wants to work on his acting muscles instead.

""When I look at Hollywood, at Robert De Niro, he can do anything - comedy, drama,"" he says.

The world's most expensive player hit the woodwork twice on an initially frustrating evening but crowned Portugal's dominant second-half performance with his third goal of the tournament, nodding a right-wing Joao Moutinho cross down and into the net.

It was an impressive display from the Portuguese who were appearing in their fifth European Championship quarter-final in a row and will play Spain or France in the last four.

""It was a fantastic game for Portugal,"" said man of the match Ronaldo. ""In the first 20 minutes we weren't that good but then we improved a lot. We had a lot of opportunities. The Czechs didn't have any - that's a great game.""

""I think the chances (of reaching the final) are 50-50 and we just have to believe in it.""

Czech Republic coach Michal Bilek added: ""Well we knew this was going to be very difficult. Portugal have a great attack. In the second half, we lost our strength and our energy and one situation was enough to decide (the match).""

The Czechs made a lively start inspired by the clever prompting of Petr Jiracek and Portugal took time to settle.

Their simple gameplan was based around getting the ball to captain Ronaldo at every opportunity and he openly vented his frustration when his team mates failed to pick him out.

BRILLIANT TURN

Ronaldo failed to connect properly with an overhead kick to the delight of the Czech fans, smashed a 35-metre free kick well wide and just before halftime struck the post following a brilliant turn and firm shot.

Portugal's Nani and Miguel Veloso were booked as tempers frayed and they suffered another blow when striker Helder Postiga was carried off injured just before halftime and replaced by Hugo Almeida.

Almeida missed a great chance to open the scoring 19 minutes into the second half when he wastefully headed Raul Meireles's perfect cross over the bar.

Another long-range Ronaldo free kick grazed the outside of the post and the Real Madrid forward then lashed a half-volley over the bar.

Portugal were dominating and Nani forced Petr Cech into a sprawling save before Almeida was adjudged offside when he nodded Nani's cross into the net.

The Czechs earned a brief respite following a brilliant surging run down the left by Vaclav Pilar but Portugal hit back when Joao Moutinho's swerving drive was tipped over by Cech and Nani's shot was saved after good work by Meireles.

The match appeared to be drifting towards extra time when Portugal picked another hole on the left side of the Czech defence and Ronaldo stole in head the ball emphatically down into the ground with the bounce taking it high into the net.","Fri, 22 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/2012euro/attachement/jpg/site1/20120622/0013729e4ad9114df44b08.jpg,"['heads', 'czech', 'match', 'warsaw', 'portugal', 'quarterfinal', 'great', 'kick', 'minutes', 'republic', 'ronaldo']",

Buboltz, R, CRS, GRI – Recently, in the Honolulu Star Advertiser, there was a featured article called ‘The Climb’ by Mike Gordon. It triggered memories of my living out “Koko Head way” in the saddle between both Koko Head and Koko Crater.

It was back in the Territorial days when much was restricted and military was active at the summit. A real tram went up and down the rail, and as a child, I often sat on the back porch and watched it. Now that area and the tram rail has 1,048 steps to the top, filled with enthusiastic hikers enjoying the challenge.

Koko Crater’s tram line seen from the Visitor Lookout on Kalanianaole Hwy

Today, Hawaii Kai in East Oahu, is a prime, progressive community of residences, condominiums, schools, shopping, and other private and commercial activities.

Growing Up in Hawaii Kai

Back in the 1950′s, it was a totally different world. We lived directly on the mauka side of Kalanianaole Highway in the vicinity of today’s ’Lookout’ which has a noticeable drop off of the land with development below. Continuing on the highway and up around the bend is the entrance to the famous and very popular marine preserve and beach of Hanauma Bay of Koko Head. Many decades ago, it was never very crowded and on weekends there was sometimes a shaved ice stand at the upper entrance. A simple, steep walkway road curved way down to the beach.

Sometimes, my sisters and I followed our big brother who had his own ‘short cut’ from the house – we just crossed the highway and hiked through the kiawe bushes on a trail he had made – up the side of Koko Head, over and then down to the walkway…we spent hours playing and swimming to our hearts content with all the pretty fish. A wonderland for children in this beautiful crater with its crescent of sand and clear blue water, and seemingly our parents knew we would be just fine. A different era, for sure.

My father had leased an acre of land from the Bishop Estate and we had our home. One of our neighbors had a carnation flower farm business and the aroma of those flowers was wonderful. Keeping with the surrounding agricultural use, we had many papaya trees planted in the spacious land behind our house. Eventually, my job was to climb a ladder and get papayas for that day. My youngest sister, Malia, was usually right by my side.

New papaya patch – Koko Head mountain in background

Henry J. Kaiser’s concept of Hawaii Kai was just a dream then, and we were not aware of it. The Kuapa fish pond would often flood over the highway from Maunalua Bay.

At the bottom of the Kalanianaole Hill from Hanauma Bay was where “Da Bus” route ended and it turned around to go back to Kaimuki, where riders had to transfer for either Waikiki or Honolulu. I would often take a walk with my little sisters down to get a soda pop from the pub/store (the only one) at the corner of Lunalilo Home Road.

Jeanne with little sisters walking down old Kalanianaole Hwy.

Then ’Hawaii Kai’ became a reality and East Hawaii was changed totally; the early years of development, the carving out of land from along the highway to build and mold all the new areas, caused lives to be changed forever, especially those living on leased lands! Our homes and the farms eventually all disappeared, for seldom was there recourse. It was both a Territory and leased land. Kaiser now owned the leases and we all had to move.

Hawaii Kai Today

60 years later, it’s the same hill going down toward Portlock Road and the ocean, but now there are multi-hundreds of properties to consider in greater Hawaii Kai. The growth and success through the decades is astounding. A lifestyle of luxurious oceanfront residences, waterfront condominium living, houses deep in the valley, and others with up slope views.

With its diversity and wide range of values and prices on the properties available to purchase, an average example might be best for what is For Sale. I linked a fine residence located in the section of Hawaii Kai known as ”The Portlock Triangle”. Its particular location is on Nawiliwili Street as it opens to Kalanianaole Hwy. That intersection seems to be pretty near the place our house and acreage would have been, across on the other side.

Since this is ‘Talk Story’ about a past lifestyle and today’s world, and the chosen house for sale also has a ’view’ of Koko Crater and its tram tracks to the summit (albeit – sideways from the pool), it seemed to be a perfect match to feature. Check it out!

Don’t panic—yet. Yes, the new National Research Council report says that Californian tidal waters could rise as much as 5.5 feet by 2100. But the process will start slowly. In 20 years, sea levels will only have gone up by about a foot—in 40, about two feet.

Can we trust these eggheads?

Unfortunately, yes. The study is peer reviewed, government funded, and sponsored by the three Pacific coast states, as well as seven independent research institutions. It’s the most comprehensive report of its kind centering on the West Coast. It’s not John Cusack misreading Mayans.

So our most prosperous state is slowly sliding into the ocean?

Yes, and some of the best parts of it, too. Santa Barbara, San Diego, Monterey, and Marin will all lose acres of beautiful coastline. Los Angeles will lose its best beaches: Long Beach, Venice, Santa Monica. And (sorry, Seth and Summer) Orange County will have to relocate more than 110,000 people.

What’s the upshot?

Rising sea levels and sinking shores will worsen flooding and damage the already-ailing California economy. Climate Central predicts that a five-and-a-half-foot sea-level rise in San Francisco would displace 1.6 percent of the urban population there. That’s billions of dollars in lost land, and the whole Bay Area would suffer. San Mateo, for example, has 110,000 people at risk. Worse still, Courteney Cox's classy Malibu beach house could effectively become a cruise ship as early as 2050.

Yes, but she and other Left Coasters have a century to escape to dry land, right?

Actually, if this study is right, San Francisco International Airport could be underwater within two decades.

Well, at least San Franciscans stuck in the city could take solace in the 49ers.

Unfortunately, by century’s end, Candlestick Park would probably be partially flooded as well. In fact, many of the city’s best sights, from San Carlos to Alcatraz, would have to build new levees or face flooding. If sea levels keep rising after 2100, we might even have to worry about the famously picturesque Flood Building. (Really.) Wetland wildlife would get unhealthily wet, damaging unique ecosystems.

Would San Fran still be worth the trip? And what about the rest of California?

Fortunately, San Francisco’s historic boats would float free. In Long Beach, the good old Queen Mary and Spruce Goose could finally sail again. Since the Monterrey Aquarium is a comfortable 29 feet above sea level, the fish likely won’t escape Free Willy style. And on the new, pavement beaches, surfers would enjoy the highest, gnarliest waves in history.

More worrisome: along the coast, the Pacific Institute predicts flood risk to more than 30 hospitals, 80 schools, 17 police stations, 16 fire stations, and hundreds of protected environmental sites.

Why is California, in particular, so up the creek? Is this somehow Arnie’s fault?

Geology is to blame. Parts of the Golden State are actually sinking, tens of centimeters a year, due to tectonic plate slides and drained underground aquifers. By contrast, Washingtonians and Oregonians are seeing a nice 1mm uplift per year—great for downhill skiing. (And by the way, this study was commissioned by a 2008 executive order from none other than then-governor Schwarzenegger.)

How could this get any worse?

If there’s a big earthquake in the Pacific Northwest, it will all happen even faster.

So should Californians cut their losses and head to the cold, pushy Northeast?

Well, according to another recent study, sea levels along the East Coast are rising 3 to 4 times faster than the rest of the world.

Nepal it is, then.","Sat, 30 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1493048405/articles/2012/06/30/california-sinkin-what-rising-sea-levels-will-mean-for-the-golden-state/california-rising-sea-levels-klein_wa4wjp","['study', 'state', 'golden', 'california', 'pacific', 'san', 'sinkin', 'thats', 'sea', 'best', 'rising', 'yes', 'levels', 'coast', 'beach', 'mean']",

Restaurants desperate for workers offered signing bonuses of $3,000. The surrounding county’s unemployment rate was 3 percent. Today, it stands at 9.1 percent, compared with 7.8 percent statewide. Home foreclosures, falling across Colorado, are rising here.

But the region is more resilient than it was during a devastating downturn in 1982, set into motion when Exxon announced it was closing down an oil-shale project near Parachute, Colo., leaving thousands of people from oil crews and support companies out of work. About 24,000 people abandoned two of the hardest-hit counties over the next two years, according to a history by the Center of the American West, creating a string of modern-day ghost towns.

That calamity has not happened this time. Drilling has continued even during the downturn, and a new pipeline bound for the Pacific Northwest was completed last year. Officials say the regional economy is less reliant on oil and gas, and is bolstered by growing tourism as well as aviation, health care and green energy.

For all its energy problems, Rio Blanco County — which encompasses Meeker — has only a 6 percent unemployment rate. But that is sharply higher than the 2.8 percent jobless rate during the 2008 presidential elections, and Mr. Bolton, the county commissioner, said an exodus of workers and families made the economy look healthier on paper than it really was.","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/29/us/BUST-1/BUST-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=931ddddc5c0c3368856fe9cc674542fdc14f9155a2a4830b66a4c682ba09c4b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['rate', 'jobs', 'workers', 'officials', 'economy', 'western', 'downturn', 'fade', 'unemployment', 'county', 'oil', 'colorado', 'struggles', 'energy']",

Two Los Angeles police officers won't face criminal charges alleging they leaked a photo of pop star Rihanna's bruised and beaten face after she was assaulted by singer Chris Brown, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said.

An internal report by prosecutors says that after a three-year investigation, they didn't have enough evidence to show celebrity news website TMZ paid the accused officers for the photo, and that became an obstacle in charging them.

The Associated Press report obtained a copy of the March 28 report on Thursday after its contents were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.

Officers Blanca Lopez and Rebecca Reyes may still get fired. They are slated to appear before disciplinary panels in August.

Brown, who was Rihanna's boyfriend at the time, was arrested on suspicion of beating the Grammy winner on Feb. 8, 2009, leaving her bloody and bruised.

The ""Umbrella"" and ""Only Girl (In The World)"" songstress, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, canceled her Grammy performance that year after the incident.

Brown pleaded guilty to attacking Rihanna and was ordered to serve five years on supervised probation and to complete six months of community service including roadside cleanup, graffiti removal and manual labor.

Prosecutors allege the photo was leaked after a stack of photographs of Rihanna's injuries was left lying on a desk at the Wilshire police station and Reyes took a picture of the top photo with her phone.

Prosecutors say Reyes later emailed the image from her LAPD email address to her personal email address.

Reyes and Lopez were roommates at the time, and phone records showed that they made multiple phone calls to Fox Television and TMZ in February.

The photo shocked fans and prompted a national conversation about domestic violence after it spread through the media.

But despite a search of Reyes' and Lopez's bank accounts, a money trail was not discovered tying the leak to them, prosecutors said.

In order to prove the officers broke the law, prosecutors said in the report they ""must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Reyes and Lopez disclosed the image of Robyn F. (Rihanna) to TMZ and obtained money in exchange for this disclosure.""

The prosecutors' report noted that other LAPD personnel had access to the photos.

""As such, although both Reyes and Lopez's actions are suspicious, they are insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,"" the report says.

Rihanna's attorney Donald Etra said Thursday he does not know at this time whether the singer wants to pursue any further legal action.

""Apparently this was an internal decision by the district attorney. A victim's privacy should be protected,"" Etra said.","Fri, 29 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120629/00221910da6c115784cb0d.jpg,"['lopez', 'reyes', 'prosecutors', 'tmz', 'rihanna', 'report', 'rihannas', 'angeles', 'los', 'charges', 'leak', 'officers']", 
48,48,FL-2012-000111-CHN,Ancient Nabatean Wisdom to Push Back Desertification Today - Green Prophet,https://www.greenprophet.com/2012/06/ancient-nabatean-wisdom-deserts/,"Petra’s pink city was built by water smart Nabateans.

Ancient Jewish prayers still recited today include special mention of dew in the summer and rain in the winter. Survival of Israelites back then, and of the Israelis in modern times, rests largely on how much water is available for agriculture. While Israel has answers to drought such as desalinating water, researchers in Israel’s Negev Desert look for more sustainable solutions that have been in use on the land since time immemorial.Based on techniques used by the ancient Nabateans, Prof. Pedro Berliner, director of Israel’s Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research at Ben-Gurion University in the Negev, is reviving effective and natural desert farming methods from 2,000 years ago.

The Nabateans settled the lands of present-day Israel, Jordan (where they built the glorious pink city of Petra), Saudi Arabia and Syria. Berliner believes that their system for making the most of rare desert rain, when put into a modern framework, could save people in developing countries from desertification, drought and famine. His updated technique is already in use worldwide.



Prof. Pedro Berliner at Wadi Mashash, one of the areas in the Negev Desert using the updated ancient system for conserving floodwater.

Altering the ecosystem

The Nabatean approach altered the ecosystem of the land by collecting and channeling floodwaters through desert canals to provide food, firewood and fodder for animals.

“They developed their system and it was copied westward during the Byzantine Empire,” says Berliner. “In the end a very large part of North Africa was being cultivated using this technique, which is still seen today in Tunisia.”

Berliner’s contemporary version, the runoff agroforestry system, involves planting rows of trees with crops in between the rows that help prevent floodwater from evaporating. Adding legume plants provides composted leaves that are an excellent fertilizer for the crops in between the trees.

People under threat of desertification can use this sustainable method to ensure they can produce grain, fodder from the leaves of the trees for grazing animals, and firewood using the branches.

An entire community can be built around winter rain runoff, as Berliner explains when he travels around the world showing researchers and farmers in countries such as Kenya, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, India and Mexico how they can fight against desertification looking to Mother Nature, the way the Nabateans did.

“It’s difficult to assess where this is being used today because it is a technique that can be used by any farmer,” he says. “It’s one of the techniques to combat dry lands in developing countries. They don’t need to build a pipeline for the water.”

Sustainable, simple, low energy solution

In Israel, the runoff agroforestry system is currently being used by Bedouins to farm olive groves and in Wadi Mashash, the desert research farm maintained by Ben Gurion University, where Berliner does his field work.

Desertification – the encroachment of non-arable land into areas once suitable for farming and grazing — is expected to get worse as the effects of global warming intensify. As the planet’s population increases, so does the need for wood for fuel and land for grazing, two more factors that greatly increase desertification.

Winter flood runoff techniques helped the Nabateans survive and protect their trade routes — they specialized in transporting perfumes and spices from Saudi Arabia via camel caravans through to the Gaza port — until they were conquered by the more powerful Romans. But their legacy in water on the land of Israel lives on.

49,49,FL-2012-000111-CHN,Cruises: Thailand's river of kings - Telegraph - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/articles/Cruises-Thailands-river-of-kings/,"Johnny, my “chief butler”, padded up to my sun lounger unbidden to offer me a pair of binoculars – he had obviously come across plenty of squinting guests in his eight years aboard Anantara Dream.

Training the binoculars on the wooden houses clustered on stilts along the banks of the Chao Phraya river, I asked him: “Surely that can’t be the tide mark from the floods? It’s at least 10ft high.” Johnny nodded gravely. “Yes, ma’am, the water was indeed very high for a long time.”

I had been due to sail with Anantara Cruises along the Chao Phraya to the former capital city of Ayutthaya last October. However, after months of unusually heavy monsoon rainfall, the river burst its banks that month in what Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra described as “the most critical natural disaster in Thai history”. The floods claimed 815 lives and affected 13.6 million people across the country.

While flood waters reached central Bangkok, with the army recruited to pump water from the Grand Palace, the damage was largely contained. Four months on, relatively few visible signs of destruction remained in the city centre and locals seemed keen to put the floods behind them.

But, as I finally started my navigation of the “River of Kings”, sailing north from the bougainvillea-festooned pier of the Anantara Riverside Resort through the high-rise heart of Bangkok and on past the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the Grand Palace and Wat Po, the tangled ruins of wooden homes, piles of debris and sandbags languishing on the river banks showed that the scars were still healing.

Nonetheless, the Chao Phraya was busy as ever: brightly painted long-tail boats sped noisily along the river, multicoloured canopies and floral garlands fluttering in the breeze; strings of heavily laden commercial barges lumbered upstream as their empty sisters bobbed in the opposite direction; and water taxis zipped between them, laden with camera-toting visitors.

Captain “Daddy” calmly negotiated this colourful chaos to deliver me to Wat Arun, where I was met by the friendly and informative Eki Chai, my guide for the three-day voyage. Wat Arun is known as the “Temple of Dawn” after the way in which the morning light reflects off its intricate central prang, or reliquary tower, which is encrusted with numerous pieces of coloured porcelain, originally used as ballast by boats sailing from China in the 17th century.

I felt a little smug as Johnny welcomed me back on-board with a cool, lemon grass-infused facecloth and tumbler of iced water, as all the other farangs (foreigners), squeezed into their long-tail boats, cast admiring glances at “my” Anantara Dream.

Although exquisite, with her rounded mahogany belly and snub stern, Anantara Dream still lacked the elegance of the gilded and bejewelled boats housed at our next stop, the Royal Barges Museum. But then, Anantara Dream didn’t suffer from illusions of grandeur when she was built 100 years ago as a rice barge – until her lavish conversion into a boutique two-cabin cruising boat.

Anantara Dream

In keeping with her traditional exterior, Anantara Dream’s mahogany interiors are complemented by solid teak furniture, Siamese antiques and spun silk.

Together with his deputy butler Tawny, Johnny created fresh floral displays whose scent wafted through the spacious seating and dining area on the breezy top deck, covered by an arched roof and lined by open windows. The river breeze kept the sundeck cool but, to ensure restful nights, the spacious two-storey cabins (with impressive en-suite bathrooms located below decks) were air-conditioned.

Shortly after passing under the golden suspension cables of the Rama VIII bridge, we left Bangkok’s skyscrapers behind and local commuters began to outnumber visitors in the long-tail boats. Settling into life on-board, I enjoyed the first of chef Jeffrey’s mouth-watering meals: crispy prawns with chilli sauce, succulent shredded chicken and banana-flower salad, fragrant chicken noodle soup and fresh mango served with sticky coconut rice.

Captain Daddy then deposited me for a post-prandial stroll on the island of Koh Kret, inhabited by the Mon people of Burma, famed for their skilled creation of kwan aman – baked, unglazed red clay pottery carved with intricate patterns. In addition to several pottery workshops, a temple and museum, stalls and cafés sold pottery, textiles and traditional street food.

The afternoon was spent on Anantara Dream, passing temples and giant Buddhas, and waving to children playing amid floating carpets of lotus flowers. Having moored for the night by a Mon temple, Johnny and Tawny prepared the deck for candlelit Thai cocktails, canapés and dinner, enjoyed to the sound of carp jumping in the river, crickets chirping and waves lapping the belly of the boat.

The following morning, as we resumed our voyage towards Ayutthaya, Johnny and Tawny taught me the traditional art of folding the petals of lotus flowers. We passed a happy hour in this meditative endeavour, preparing the flowers to offer in prayer at Wat Panancherng, the temple that houses Thailand’s largest ancient image of Buddha, a 668-year-old, golden giant 62ft tall (in the sitting pose) and 46ft wide. With Eki Chai content that I would return in the afterlife more beautiful than in the current one (a bonus of lotus flower-supported prayers), our driver whisked us to Ayutthaya.

Wat Arun stands in the background

Founded in 1350 on an island at the confluence of three rivers, the majestic former Siamese capital, a Unesco World Heritage Site, was one of the world’s largest cities by 1700, home to more than a million inhabitants and more than 400 temples and palaces. However, when the Burmese invaded in 1767, they razed the city, leaving only ruined monasteries, temples, stupas and prangs to hint at its ancient splendour.

One could easily spend days exploring the parklike site. Eki Chai ushered me to some of his favourite spots: Wat Mahathat, where the disembodied head of a Buddha statue hovers hauntingly, caught hundreds of years ago in the roots of a banyan tree; to Wat Chaiwatthanaram, with its relatively well-preserved Khmer-style prangs and chedi-shaped chapels; and to Wat Phra Si Sanphet, known for its forlorn rows of headless Buddhas.

As evening fell, Eki Chai returned me to Anantara Dream – amused by my confusion when we reached the Chao Phraya to discover the boat moored by a small island with no apparent way of getting across. Giggling, he pointed out an ingenious pulley-operated chair lift, manned by a young monk from Wat Niwet Thammaprawat, an unusual Buddhist temple constructed in the style of an English Gothic church in 1878.

Looking up from his book, the monk cranked the lift into action and we glided above the water towards the boat, waved on by Johnny and Tawny on deck. Back on board, Johnny had arranged a surprise: a tiny yet wincingly strong lady had come to massage my tired tourist feet. As she massaged, an electric-blue kingfisher darted from a nearby tree into the river to catch its dinner, undisturbed by the young novice monks zipping across the river after their studies, saffron robes billowing in the dusky evening light.

Rising early next morning, I walked around the peaceful island, marvelling at the juxtaposition of the Gothic, with its ornate pistachio, pink and gilded décor, and the simple shrine next to it – a small golden Buddha glimmering in the morning sunlight, adorned by orchids and lotus flowers. I was apprehensive at the thought of our return to the noise, heat and chaos of Bangkok.

My dread was misplaced – Bangkok was chaotic yet wonderful, particularly with the “culture shock” softened by immersion in the sanctuary of the inimitable Mandarin Oriental hotel.

Over dinner in the Terrace Rim Naam restaurant on the banks of the Chao Phraya, I closed my eyes, listened for the familiar river noises and was soon back on Anantara Dream.

DID YOU KNOW?

The Chao Phraya was once known as the Mae Nam, from 'Mae’ (mother) and 'Nam’ (water)



WHAT TO AVOID

Don’t assume that tuk-tuks in Bangkok are less expensive than taxis – their popularity with visitors has made the former more costly, while also being less safe.

It’s illegal to take Buddha statues out of Thailand, so don’t purchase any in the hope of bringing them home.

Be prepared to queue for at least an hour to get through immigration on arrival in Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport and the same to get through security when leaving the capital.

Don’t misjudge the cost of wine in restaurants: government taxes on wine are high and are not reflected in the prices shown on wine lists but are charged additionally (along with a standard 10 per cent service charge).

Avoid the elephant rides in Ayutthaya – the welfare of the animals is questionable, the ride only lasts about 10 minutes and “drivers” become unpleasant if you don’t tip them handsomely.

GETTING THERE

Children's charity Barnardo's fears growth in child sex trafficking to London



Fears that prostitution and sex trafficking will rise in the capital during the Olympics are growing, as it emerged escort agencies are adopting the Olympic name, laying on extra women and offering special 'gold medal services'.



Furthermore, Barnardo's, Britain's largest children’s charity, has revealed that internal trafficking of UK children to London for sexual exploitation during the games is a 'very real concern', and is calling on people to be extra vigilant - particularly those working in the hospitality industry.

On the rise: Prostitution and sex crimes tend to increase sharply whenever there is a major sporting event

Major sporting events always tend to precipitate a boom in the sex industry, with hundreds of thousands of visitors - including site workers, spectators and athletes - flooding an area.

Sex trafficking almost doubled during the 2004 Athens Olympics, and there were reports of sex attacks in the athletes' village at Sydney in 2000.

And, one month before the games begin, many London-based escort agencies are cashing in on this.

Some online organisations have adopted themed names, such as Olympic Escorts, Olympic Escorts Agency and Olympic Escorts 2012.

Others - including Sunny Escorts, Exotic Secret, Dream Rush and Luxury Liasons - are all offering extra women in east London around the Stratford stadium and Olympic Village, themed services, 'gold' packages and special offers.

Olympic boom: Hundreds of thousands of site workers, spectators and athletes will flood the Stratford stadium, causing increased demand within the sex trade all over London 'Come to win a gold medal with this Olympic London Escort!' advertises Olympic Escorts 2012, while Sunny Escorts' online Olympic page says: 'Our Stratford escorts are on standby for some very busy days, and our Hackney escorts are leaving their diaries open ready for the influx of calls for Olympics escort services. 'The London Olympics will see millions of visitors flood into London over the course of the games. Many of these visitors will be gentlemen who desire the company of a beautiful woman over dinner or for some interesting and exciting female company during the course of their stay in the Capital.'

Cashing in: Online agencies such as Olympic Escorts 2012 are using the games' name to increase traffic flow to their sites

Taking the name: London agencies such as Olympic Escorts are adopting the word 'Olympic' and are offering special promotions to coincide with the games



Extra business: Sunny Escorts expect their female staff to be 'extremely busy during the Olympic Games in London'

But east London residents in the Olympic borough of Tower Hamlets are petitioning for the local authority and police to stop targeting street prostitutes with banning orders and focus instead on the pimps and organised gangs they say are controlling prostitution and sex trafficking.

Meanwhile, children's charity Barnardo's have called for people to be 'extra vigilant during the games', since 'anecdotal evidence shows that whenever there is a major event with a ""party atmosphere"" child sexual exploitation can occur'.

Anne Marie Carrie, the charity's chief executive, said: 'We know from the work we do on the ground with children that the risk of boys and girls being trafficked and sexually exploited during major events is a very real threat.

'With a huge influx of visitors to the capital everyone needs to play their part in spotting the signs that sexual exploitation is taking place.'

They are 'trying to cover all eventualities' over fears of another 'Michael Fish' incident, owners claim



BBC weather forecasters have been accused of driving away tourists from seaside resorts with 'alarmist' reports of floods and storms.

One holiday park owner in Devon criticised meteorologists for 'trying to cover all eventualities' to avoid a repeat of the infamous 1987 hurricane blooper by Michael Fish.

Another, who runs resorts in Suffolk, said staycationers were 'terrified' to come to his sites because of fears their caravans would be left 'bobbing around' on flood water.

'Alarmist': Seaside resorts have accused BBC forecasters of driving away tourists with overly negative predictions, but in some areas such as Bracklesham Caravan Park (pictured) in West Sussex they have proved accurate

Angry: One resort owner in Suffolk said meteorologists were tarnishing the whole country with a 'single wet weather symbol' by making it seem like floods such as this one in a Welsh caravan park would affect all tourist hotspots

They are now asking for weathermen to not tarnish the whole country with a 'single wet-weather symbol' and be 'more careful with their phrasing'.

Claire Jeavons, who runs the Beverley Park holiday site in Paignton, Devon, said 'alarmist' forecasts, which often proved groundless, were having a major impact on bookings across the West Country.

She said: 'It is already causing holiday-makers to stay away. Just a few days ago we were hearing that all caravan parks in the West Country were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case.

'We've been receiving many calls from worried customers, but we assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire English Riviera was hundreds of feet underwater.'

'Trying to cover all eventualities': Waves crash into Porthcawl lighthouse during a storm. Forecasters have been accused of over-egging reports to ensure they don't end up with another 'Michael Fish' incident

Tony Clish, director of Park Holidays UK, which has more than 700 caravans at Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Suffolk Sands Holiday Park, said: 'Just last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern England were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case.

'Some parks in Wales did flood recently, but that's no reason to suggest that caravans in Suffolk would soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before.'

He added: 'Coastal holiday parks in Suffolk often stay dry when it is raining inland, yet forecasters frequently tarnish the whole county with a single wet-weather symbol.'

BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said there was no reason why forecasters would want to 'dampen the sprits or be deliberately pessimistic.'



'Our job to focus of negatives': BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said forecasters needed to warn people of any dangers

Mr Schafernaker, who predicts the weather on BBC South East Today, said: 'I understand the frustration and there is a tendency for weather forecasters to emphasise on the negative aspects of the weather.

'It's just that our job is to pick out the most important parts of the weather which can affect people's lives.

Our visit to Sderot came after a tour of Israel’s largest desalination plant located in the neighboring town of Ashkelon on Israel’s Mediterranean coast. Israel is chronically short of water, consuming 2 billion cubic meters of water per year where the nation’s natural hydrology is capable of producing, on average, 1.2 billion cubic meters per year, according to Abraham Tenne, head of the Desalination Division of the Israel Water Authority. Mr. Tenne was blunt in reporting the facts. The Israel Water Authority expects average rainfall to decline by 15 percent by 2040, while Israel’s population is expected to continue to grow by 1.7 percent each year. The drought of 2008, where rainfall was only 65 percent of the current average, was a powerful reminder that today’s water situation is bad, and unchecked, it will only get worse.

Mr. Tenne is understandably proud of the building or upgrades to Israel’s three desalination facilities, which are key to solving the problem, but he is quick to remind us that, as important as this technology is to Israel’s future, it is a last resort. Israel’s consumption of 2 billion cubic meters of water by a population of roughly 8 million stands in sharp contrast to Arizona’s consumption of 8 billion cubic meters of water by a population of roughly 7 million. He visited Arizona last year for an international water conference where he was asked to speak on desalination, and was shocked to see flood irrigation – the practice of watering crops by flooding the field – commonly practiced. He contrasts this with Israel, where drip irrigation is standard practice for 95 percent of all agricultural production, and where the amount of water used is precisely controlled by technology that monitors the moisture at the root of the plant, delivering only what is required to maintain healthy growth. He then tells us about London, which just inaugurated its first desalination plant, while doing little to fix the local water system where 40 percent of the water flowing through the system is lost to leaks. And then, for the second time in two days, I hear of smart grid technology being deployed in Israel to pinpoint leaks.

Although recent discoveries of significant natural gas reserves off the Israeli coast suggest that Israel may be able to completely wean itself off coal, over 35 percent of the nation’s installed electric generation capacity comes from coal-fired power plants, including one right next door to the Ashkelon desalination plant we visited today. But even when the desalination process is driven by natural gas-fired power plants, as this facility is (it generates its own electricity and actually sells some excess production back to the grid) the fact of the matter is that Israel’s total water system – not just desalination, but the pumps necessary to move water around the country – consumers 6 percent of the total electricity produced in Israel. Thus, the battle to conserve water is also a battle to save energy, which in turn is a battle to avoid carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, and make Israel’s water situation worse.

We are spending tomorrow with some of Israel’s leading experts in solar energy, but already I am wondering why a nation so obviously blessed with ample, strong sunlight, seems to have so little invested in deploying solar power. Solar hot water heaters have been required here since 1980, and as my friend, and EDF consultant, Roger Duncan, often reminds me, solar hot water heating is often the most overlooked cost-effective solar technology, but given Israel’s pressing challenge of finding both secure and sustainable supplies of electricity, the government’s policy of 10 percent renewable energy by 2020 seems incredibly modest. A nation with the determination and technological prowess to erect the world’s most sophisticated missile defense system surely should be able to do better and tomorrow will be about finding out why not.","Wed, 20 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2012/06/Israel-postcard-credit-www.allnumis.com_-300x213.jpg,"['solar', 'cubic', 'meters', 'water', 'israels', 'technology', 'desalination', 'sderot', 'israel', 'mark', 'system', 'postcard', 'plant', 'brownstein']",

For the first five or six years, our attendees were almost entirely freelance or newspaper staff photographers. During that time, we trained more than eight Pulitzer Prize winners. Then, we began to see our classes fill with educators and producers from many organizations such as NPR, for instance. We even started to see network shooters, of all people, show up. They wanted to learn storytelling, rather than simply doing their daily turns. Now, in the last two years, we have suddenly seen a flood of military photojournalists take the classes. We were curious about that until one told us, ""We can learn more about video and storytelling in one week of Platypus than we could in months of military classes."" At our most recent workshop at Texas State University in San Marcos, we had photojournalists attending from the U.S. Army and Air Force Combat Camera. And a team from Canada - the Canadian Forces Combat Camera.

Festival children enjoy a lark as June heads to a soggy record

Young ones enjoy the mud on the Isle of Wight, but four-wheel-drive vehicles are needed to help free festival-goers' cars from the sludge



Promoter John Giddings apologised for muddy chaos, but said that he had been amazed by the resilience of the 55,000-strong crowd



Festival was affected by a deluge which saw gridlocked drivers forced to sleep in their cars as the car parks became inaccessible with mud

The grown-ups had to grin and bear it. The children, however, just grinned and enjoyed the mud and rain that swamped the Isle of Wight festival over the weekend.

Rain clouds may have left 55,000 music fans’ tents awash, but they brought a silver lining to youngsters who pulled on their wellies and had fun.

It was the only thing to do in a June which forecasters say could end up being one of the wettest for 100 years. Although the heavy rain is set to settle down this week there is still no sign of sustained summer weather.

After washing away much of the Jubilee spirit during the Queen’s celebrations earlier this month, the weather did its worst to the Isle of Wight festival. It had begun on Friday amid chaos, and when campers woke up yesterday morning it was to a sea of mud.

Anyone planning to cut and run early before the festival’s scheduled end this morning certainly faced a struggle if they had a car with them. In some cases Land Rovers pulling cars required another four-wheel-drive vehicle to drag them both free of the quagmire.

Extra police were due to be on duty from last night to help the getaway and avoid a repeat of Friday’s problems, when those arriving amid the mud and rain ended up in such huge traffic jams that ferry services from the mainland had to be suspended.

Festival organiser John Giddings apologised but proclaimed the event, whose acts included Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen, a success.

He said: ‘We knew it was going to happen. We were prepared. We knew there would be adverse weather conditions – it was just slow and we caused a great traffic jam and I am sorry to all those who got stuck in it.

‘I hope that I have made up for it by providing one of the best weekends of music ever.

‘There is something about adverse conditions that makes people enjoy themselves. There’s something about British people – they are going to have a good time whatever and I love them for it.’

He said 100 four-wheel-drive vehicles would be on hand to help drag the vehicles of those leaving out of the mud in the car parks.

Matt Dobson, senior forecaster at the Meteo-Group weather centre, said: ‘This is one of the wettest Junes since 2007, which was exceptional. It could be one of the wettest Junes of the last 100 years.’

On the plus side, Britain is set for a few drier days with temperatures approaching the June average.

But Met Office forecaster Rebecca Sherwin said things looked like remaining unsettled ‘for the next couple of weeks’.

The festival was affected by a deluge which saw gridlocked drivers forced to sleep in their cars as the car parks at Seaclose Park, Newport, had become flooded and inaccessible with mud.

The queues caused ferry companies to suspend their services and about 600 people were stranded on ferries on the Solent as the cars could not disembark because of backed-up traffic on the island.



But after emergency car parks were opened off-site on Friday the backlog was cleared and sunshine even broke through for the rest of the day.

Police have warned festival-goers and local residents to expect delays after the event finishes.



The traffic plan being put into place will control traffic leaving the site during today's rush hour to enable commuters to reach their workplace and schools as freely as possible.



Transport operators have already reported an increased flow in people leaving the festival early to avoid the expected slow exit.



Ferry companies Wightlink and Red Funnel are both operating extra sailings to help people leave the island more easily.

Stuart Love, Isle of Wight Council director of economy and the environment, said: 'This is a constantly evolving situation but I can assure residents and festival-goers that all agencies are working together to implement arrangements designed to keep disruption to minimum.



'Regulating movement from the car parks should mean that the situation today and Monday will be very different to that on Thursday and Friday when the congestion was unacceptable.'

Chief Inspector Nick Heelan, of Hampshire and Isle of Wight police, said: 'Getting people home safely and returning the local roads and community to normality as quickly as we can is our priority.



'We have extra officers drafted in from the mainland today to work with marshals to keep traffic moving.



'We are working very closely with the organisers, the council and other agencies to minimise disruption, and have every resource available doing everything possible to keep people safe and moving.'

TAKING TO THE BOATS AS FLOODS SWEEP NORTH

Householders and businesses in Cumbria, Lancashire and West Yorkshire were clearing up yesterday after widespread flooding.

At Keswick in Cumbria, where up to an inch of rain fell on Saturday night, a campsite warden took to a canoe to examine a caravan left deep in flood water.

In West Yorkshire the River Calder reached record levels and Hebden Bridge town centre was inundated. Mytholmroyd was also badly affected.

At Croston in Lancashire the Yarrow burst its banks and 70 homes were evacuated.

At one point, 23 flood warnings and 65 ‘alerts’ – many of them in the South-West – were in place. Forecaster Matt Dobson, of MeteoGroup, said: ‘There could well be more flash-flooding later in the week, though it doesn’t look as bad as it has been.’

58,58,FL-2012-000111-CHN,"Walsh, May-Treanor looking for 3rd beach gold - Newsday",https://www.newsday.com/sports/olympics/kerri-walsh-misty-may-treanor-looking-for-3rd-beach-gold-1.3813640,"LONDON -- In Sydney, she was still just Misty May.

Her mother was seriously ill and her beach volleyball career was still maturing when the daughter of 1968 Olympian Butch May finished fifth in her Olympic debut. By the Athens Games, Barbara May had died of cancer. Misty memorialized her with an angel tattoo on her left shoulder and scattered some of the ashes on the sand before winning the gold medal with Kerri Walsh.

Beijing brought more change: She was married now, to ballplayer Matt Treanor. Her name had grown and so had her goals, and she talked of children and retirement and all the other things she wanted do when her beach volleyball career ended. A second gold medal came as smoothly as the first.

As it turned out, Walsh had the children and May-Treanor came out of TV's ""Dancing with the Stars"" with a repaired Achilles tendon but also a renewed desire for another Olympic run.

The two are together again and heading to London, a fourth Olympics for each and their third as a team. And as they try for an unprecedented third consecutive victory -- no athlete had ever won even two beach golds before -- they can look back at one of the most successful partnerships in the history of the sport.

""We understand fully -- maybe too much -- how special our journey is,"" Walsh said. ""We know that London is our last tournament together for the rest of our careers. That's a really big deal after an amazing ride.

""There is an emotional toll to it, putting yourself out on the world's biggest stage. It's not a grieving process, but it's almost like that. And we're working through that."" May-Treanor, who will turn 35 while she's in London, has said she will retire from international competition following the games, a decision that opens a coveted spot as Walsh's future partner and creates a new dynamic in the sport. With young teams from the Netherlands, Italy and China -- including 2008 bronze medalists Xue Chen and Zhang Xi -- the Americans see themselves as part of an older generation that helped the sport grow from an Olympic also-ran into one of the most popular events at the games.

""When we started, we were girls,"" May-Treanor said. ""The older players, you idolized them; you want to be like them but you don't really understand the process. And now, kind of, we're here. We're where the players we looked up to were. We've been through a lot of life's transitions."" You can fit a lot into an Olympiad, the four-year gap between the games that feel like an extended offseason in a sport like beach volleyball.

The 33-year-old Walsh got started right away.

Nine months after winning the gold in 2008 she gave birth to her first son. Another son was born less than a year later. After each pregnancy she took time off before returning to the sand, usually with Joey and Sundance in tow.

""I feel like more life has been lived in these past four years than ever in my life,"" said Walsh, whose husband, Casey Jennings, is also a professional beach volleyball player. ""As you get older, more profound things happen to you. I'm a mother of two now, and with that comes so much love. We've just been living life as 30-year olds, mid-30s. It's way different than when you just turn 30, or when you're 26 in Athens."" After missing most of the 2009 season recovering from her torn Achilles tendon, May-Treanor spent part of 2010 watching her husband, a backup catcher, play in the World Series for the Texas Rangers. When she decided to return to the sand, recreating the delicate chemistry that made her and Walsh so dominant was more of a struggle than expected.

""I definitely feel older,"" May-Treanor said. ""Kerri won't say this, but I definitely feel older."" Having swept through the qualification process for Beijing and winning gold a second time without losing an Olympic set, the Americans head to London ranked No. 3, behind Xue and Zhang and the top-ranked Brazilian team of Larissa and Juliana that was thwarted in '08 when Juliana injured her knee.

The other U.S. team of April Ross and Jennifer Kessy, first-time Olympians, is right behind them at No. 4.

""Misty has been through so much, with her Achilles injury and rehab,"" Walsh said. ""We had a really terrible start to this year. We've played not our style of beach volleyball; we've played tentatively and we're thinking too much. It's just the mental aspect that we're having problems with.

""That's a terrible position to be in, where you're crossing the finish line and you feel like you're pulling back. That's not how we want to go out."" The top American men, the other half of the U.S. gold medal sweep in Beijing, are also plotting an exit strategy.

Although Phil Dalhausser is only 32, partner Todd Rogers is 38 and noticing that it takes more time to recover from injuries, or just plain workouts. Heights that were once within jumping distance are now beyond reach. And the travel on the international qualifying circuit doesn't have the allure it once did, especially when he has to leave the kids behind.

""I am missing stuff more,"" he said. ""From April through the end of summer, I'm really not around. I really want to be involved more in their lives.

""They're going to start getting into their own things, and doing their own things. I want to be around while they still want me to be around."" Rogers' daughter, Hannah, 13, and son Nate, 11, will be going with him to London; he had decided they were too young for Beijing. Like May-Treanor, Rogers is planning to stop playing internationally after these Olympics and hoping to retire to a rejuvenated domestic tour that would allow him to spend more time with his children.

""They understand it now,"" he said. ""When the kids were about 5 and 7, they just didn't have the full comprehension of why Daddy was gone for so long. My son wouldn't even talk to me on the phone. He was bitter. He was an angry kid, and my daughter responded by crying. It's tough to deal with that."" With its bikini-clad athletes and beach party atmosphere, no Olympic sport projects more of a youthful attitude than beach volleyball. Tanned and toned bodies frolicking in the sand are always a hit for spectators at the Olympics and television viewers back home.

This year's venue, Horse Guards Parade, could attract royal visitors from nearby Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square and even 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence.

But for the first time, some athletes might be playing down the sexy side of the sport: The international volleyball federation has given women permission to abandon the traditional bikini for a more expansive uniform -- an attempt to encourage athletes from more modest cultures to participate.

It is not yet clear whether any will take them up on the offer, but a change in the qualification process has democratized a sport that has been dominated by American and Brazilian teams. Combined, they've won seven of eight gold medals, and 16 of 24 overall. With two spots still remaining in the 24-team men's and women's fields, there are already three countries that will compete in the Olympic beach volleyball tournaments for the first time: Poland, Mauritius and Venezuela.

Dalhausser was just 28 and still relatively new to international competition when he and Rogers won gold in Beijing. He expects his Olympic experience will take some of the pressure off and give them an advantage against top-seeded Brazilians Emanuel and Alison, the bronze medalists in Beijing, and fellow Americans Jake Gibb and Sean Rosenthal, who finished tied for fifth in 2008.

""I think I'm going to take a more relaxed approached to the Olympics this year,"" Dalhausser said. ""We've already won the gold, so anything we do this year is really the cherry on top.

But then he quickly added: ""Obviously, the goal is to win the gold. I don't want to you get the wrong idea. We're still hungry to win the gold."" So is May-Treanor.

And she's equally hungry to see what comes next.

""This is my last Olympics. The Olympics is my last tournament,"" she said. ""I think it's selfish if you don't want to pass the torch to the younger players. That's the only way the sport can grow.""","Fri, 29 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.3813660.1340990855!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.JPG,"['gold', 'volleyball', 'olympics', 'misty', 'olympic', 'london', 'looking', 'maytreanor', 'really', '3rd', 'walsh', 'sport', 'beach', 'kerri']",

60,60,FL-2012-000111-CHN,Far out in North Carolina - RealClimate,https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/06/far-out-in-north-carolina/,"The extensive salt marshes on the Outer Banks of Carolina offer ideal conditions for unravelling the mysteries of sea level change during past centuries. Here is a short report from our field work there – plus some comments on strange North Carolina politics as well as two related new papers published today in Nature Climate Change.



The Outer Banks of Carolina are particularly vulnerable to coastal erosion and sea-level rise, partly because the land is subsiding and the banks are naturally moving landward. On the ocean front, land is continually being lost.



At 11.20 AM we get a walky-talky call from the research vessel Stanley Riggs which anchors a bit offshore from us: a few meters behind us is a shark in the water they say. They’ve been observing it through their binoculars. We haven’t noticed a thing and turn around, but only the student Ray catches a glimpse of the fin before it disappears. We’re standing on a bit of peat surrounded on three sides by water, drilling a core. Sharks don’t bother us – but the people on the ship are worried about our divers who plan to go in the water shortly. We don’t see the shark again – only little snakes elegantly gliding past through the water, heads above the surface, and some crabs, a popular local delicacy.



R/V Stanley Riggs lands our team at Sand Point.

To us as onshore crew, alligators would be far more interesting than sharks. Last week, not far from one of the study sites a man was injured by an alligator. My colleagues reassure me: alligators are nothing to worry about, as long as you can run faster than the slowest person in the group. But everything looks as peaceful as it can be now. The sun glitters on the lagoon, every now and then a group of pelicans patrols over our heads and convective clouds are billowing near the horizon. Sometimes we hear thunder rolling in the distance, but it stays dry all day. What a contrast to the previous day! A cold wind and constant rain bothered us and a series of technical failures meant that we did not even bring a useable core home. A dozen people worked a whole day in vain. (No hint that day of the fact that this May was the warmest on record in the Northern Hemisphere!)

The day I arrived on the Outer Banks I’d been greeted with news of a 50:50 chance of a tropical storm developing offshore. The same evening the first tropical storm of the season was called by the National Hurricane Center: Alberto. In mid-May – the hurricane season officially only starts in June (it turned out to be only the third May on record with two tropical storms in the Atlantic). The Outer Banks are very exposed. Several times in the last decades a hurricane caused a break in the barrier island and washed away the only road connection to the mainland. Luckily, Alberto turned offshore and passed far out at sea without bothering us.

We’re here because of the several metres thick peat layer which has accumulated during the past millennia behind the Outer Banks. The land here is still sinking since the end of the last Ice Age, because it is located on the glacial forebulge: a zone around the edges of the glacial ice sheets that was pushed up when the ice load was pushing down adjacent lands. So instead of getting post-glacial uplift it suffers from post-glacial subsidence. The subsidence has led to a continuous sea-level rise relative to the land of around one millimetre per year. The salt marsh is able to keep up with this rise by accumulating sediments and building up peat, about a metre per millennium. This provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct the speed of relative sea-level rise – and by subtracting out the land subsidence, also the absolute sea-level changes.

I’ve already reported here on the previous results of our collaboration with the team around Ben Horton of the University of Pennsilvania: it was possible to reconstruct sea level for the past 2,000 years and to link the variations of the last 1,000 years to the global temperature evolution (see graph in that earlier post). Now we’re here to look for even older, thicker peat. Some of the oldest peat may well have been flooded in the meantime and be sitting at the bottom of the lagoon, hence we’re also coring from aboard the research vessel run by East Carolina University. After more than a week of coring, the peat is looking promising – but only months-long efforts in the lab will show whether the new cores are suitable for reconstructing sea level.

North Carolina politics

On the last day we hold a stakeholder workshop in Nag’s Head. NOAA, the funding agency, requires this type of direct discussion of the project scientists with potential users of the results, e.g. from local planning authorities. Sea-level rise is right now a hot topic in North Carolina: an interest group called NC20 has proposed a rather bizarre piece of state legislation that would ban the use in planning of scenarios of accelerated future sea-level rise (as recommended e.g. by the guidance document of the US Army Corps of Engineers, who assume a “high” scenario of 1.5 metres – about five foot – sea-level rise by the year 2100). And yes – NC20 was represented at our stakeholder workshop. Here is a leaflet that they distribute. The group tries to discredit the credibility of science by propagating the myth that climate science predicted global cooling in the 1970s. In truth this cooling idea was never main-stream but a small minority view also in the 1970s. CO2-induced global warming was in fact correctly predicted in classic papers e.g. in 1972 (Sawyer in Nature) and 1975 (Broecker in Science).

Of course, global sea-level rise has already accelerated in the course of global warming (as many scientific papers have demonstrated – including the data from the peat cores in North Carolina), and will almost certainly accelerate further as the planet warms. After all, ice melts faster the warmer it gets, and the oceans also heat up faster. In other words, this law would have banned taking reality into account in planning. It was passed recently by the Senate of North Carolina, albeit with some rewording that softens up the central clause, but looks unlikely to become law this year. The Colbert Report has a rather funny comedy piece on the sea level law. This story was topped by a Senator from northern neighbour Virginia, who apparently said that “sea-level rise is a left-wing term”.

Two new papers

Nature Climate Change publishes two new sea-level papers today. One, by Sallenger et al., is an analysis of US tide gauge data. The main finding is that there is a “hotspot” of acceleration in sea level rise over the past sixty years on the US Atlantic coast, with the largest acceleration found between Cape Hatteras and Boston. The authors argue that this pattern is consistent with a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation (and hence their first reference is to our 2005 paper where we show this sea-level pattern in our model). In my opinion an intriguing possibility that warrants further investigation. There could be other causes, like interdecadal changes in the wind field.

The other paper, by Schaeffer et al. (disclosure: I am a co-author on this) estimates global sea-level rise up to the year 2300 using a semi-empirical approach. The paper exploits the observed relationship between global temperature and the rate of global sea-level rise and was calibrated using the sea-level proxy data from North Carolina for the past millennium. For the main results, see the graph below, which also includes the proxy data (click to enlarge). Ironically, it is thus the historic data from North Carolina that lead us to rather grim expectations of future sea-level rise.

New Delhi, Jun 26: Extradited gangster Abu Salem was today granted bail in a 2002 extortion case by a Delhi Court, which also praised his “above board” conduct in jail.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Yadav granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs one lakh and a surety of like amount.Salem would, however, still be in jail as he is facing trial in seven other cases for which he was extradited to India from Portugal.“This accused (Salem) has already undergone custody of almost five years in this case and even if he is ultimately convicted in this case he could be sentenced maximum for a period of seven years.“The provision of section 436 A CrPC which are couched in mandatory terminology command this court to release the accused on bail if he has undergone almost half of the period for which he could be sentenced in the matter,” the court said.The court noted Salem's counsel M S Khan's submission that the public witnesses have already been examined in this case and that the three co-accused, Chander Prakash, Sadiq Ali and Ishtiyaq are already on bail and there is no threat that the accused may influence remaining witnesses.“Considering the fact that accused has undergone more than half of the sentence which could be imposed upon him in this matter and the fact that the public witnesses have already been examined, I deem it a fit case for releasing the accused (Salem) on bail.The court went on to praise Salem's conduct in jail and said, “This is a matter of record that the conduct of this accused in judicial custody has remained above board and no complaint of any sort has been reported with regard to his conduct in jail by any authority.”

67,67,FL-2012-000111-CHN,The Retirement of Anita Sanchez - Cebu Daily News,https://globalnation.inquirer.net/40857/the-retirement-of-anita-sanchez,"SAN FRANCISCO—The Ella Hill Hutch Community Center in the Western Addition features an outdoor mural filled with portraits of past African American community leaders considered as role models for future generations of African-Americans. Five San Francisco public schools have been renamed to honor many of those in the mural including Ida B. Wells, Enola Maxwell and Charles Drew. The street directly in front of City Hall was renamed after another mural figure, Dr. Carlton P. Goodlett.

If a similar kind of mural is made featuring distinguished leaders of the Filipino American community, the portrait of Anita Sanchez, San Francisco city government’s only current department head, will certainly be on it. On Friday, June 29, she will be honored at San Francisco’s City Hall on the occasion of her retirement as Executive Director of the San Francisco Civil Service Commission which oversees the merit system for the employment of the city’s 25,000 employees.

Anita immigrated to San Francisco in 1960 when she was barely10 years old. Her father, Bonifacio Sanchez, was recruited into the US Navy from his native Iloilo in 1924 when he was 17. After an absence of 23 years serving the US Navy in various ships throughout the world, Bonifacio, by then a naturalized US citizen, returned to Iloilo in 1947 and married Adoracion Hubines, a young lass from his hometown. Two years later, Bonifacio retired from the US Navy and returned to Iloilo to live with his wife and build a family. Two boys and four girls later, Bonifacio relocated to the US in 1957. After securing a job in the US Postal Service in San Francisco, Bonifacio brought his family to join him in 1960.

When she first arrived in San Francisco, Anita could only speak Ilonggo (Hiligaynon) but she quickly learned English in school and Tagalog in the streets. There were very few Filipinos in those days as legal immigration to the US from the Philippines was limited by quota to just 50 a year – from 1935 until 1965 when it increased to 20,000. As Anita and her siblings were born as US citizens, they were not included in the annual quota.

While enrolled at San Francisco State University in 1968, Anita joined the student strike that was led by her friend, Ron Quidachay – then a leader of the Pilipino American Collegiate Endeavor (PACE) and now a Superior Court Judge – that successfully pushed for the creation of a School of Ethnic Studies that would offer classes like Philippine history and culture.

Her student activism led Anita to include community involvement as an integral part of her regular academic work. With a modest grant from the Real Alternative Program (RAP), Anita organized the United Filipino Youth Organization (UFYO) and set up a storefront on 14th and Valencia in the Mission District for young FilAm high school kids to hang out after school. When any of the FilAm kids would get in trouble with the law, Anita would trudge over to Juvenile Hall and speak with them and with their probation officers to work out a probation plan to secure their release.

“The hardest part was often dealing with disappointed Filipino parents who would turn their backs on their kids just when their kids needed them the most,” she recalls. “Many of the parents believed in the foolish notion that their kids should spend time in jail to teach them a lesson.” Anita explained to the parents that exposing their kids to hard-core criminals in jail would teach them lessons alright, but not the kind that would rehabilitate them.

Joe Robles was one of those hard-core kids I met at Anita’s UFYO office in 1971 when he was UFYO president. Joe was later drafted into the US Army where he survived Vietnam, and returned to become a distinguished San Francisco Police Officer who regularly organized summer basketball leagues for young FilAm kids.

In the course of working on her Master’s degree in Social Work, Anita was involved with the United Filipino Association (UFA) led by Rev. Tony Ubalde, Bulitt Marasigan and Emil De Guzman, the fiscal agency that operated the International Hotel that housed manongs who immigrated as farmworkers in the 1930s. In the South of Market (SOMA), Anita worked with Pete Almazol and Joe Labrador of Bayanihan House, Tony Grafilo and Lem Ignacio of the Pilipino Organizing Committee (POC) and four other FilAm service agencies to build a consortium of Filipino community service agencies that would apply for foundation grants and city funding. It would be called the West Bay Pilipino Multi-Service Center headed by Ed De la Cruz.

While lobbying in Sacramento for California accrediting agencies to officially recognize the college degrees of Foreign Medical Graduates (FMG), Anita met San Francisco Assemblyman Art Agnos who was so impressed with her advocacy work that he offered her a job as his aide which she accepted. Through her work in the California Assembly, Anita was able to secure the passage of legislation that benefited the Filipino community and other communities.

Anita was eager to return back to San Francisco so she accepted an offer from Mayor Dianne Feinstein, whom she met through FilAm community leader Jess Esteva, to be her Special Assistant for Administration. Anita once joked that Filipinos were Feinstein’s favorite ethnic community because, unlike other communities who would demand that the mayor appoint their members to to major commissions, or to head certain city departments and or to obtain major funding for their community programs, Filipinos would often go to her office with simple requests for photos with her and, if they were so bold, to have the photos autographed.

The photos of these FilAm community leaders posing with Mayor Feinstein would then appear on the front pages of local FilAm community newspapers to give the impression that they were close to the mayor. We called this self-deceiving practice “lumpia politics” which ensured a power-less community that was not at all a factor in local politics.

In the afterglow of People Power in 1986, Anita worked with community leaders who sought to unify the fractured Filipino community in the US that had been divided into “pro” and “anti” Marcos camps. As the group, under the leadership of Philippine News publisher Alex Esclamado, regularly met on Saturday mornings at a restaurant in Daly City, we informally called ourselves the “Lyon’s Club”. In those meetings, Anita was part of planning the National Unity Conference that was held in the summer of 1987 in Anaheim, California which drew 1,500 delegates from throughout the US. We formed the National Filipino American Council (NFAC) with Dennis Normandy as national chair and myself as national vice-chair.

Towards the end of Feinstein’s term as mayor, Anita enthusiastically backed the candidacy of her old boss, Art Agnos, in his bid to succeed Feinstein. Anita arranged a meeting for leaders of the Filipino community to meet Agnos and to tell him what we wanted to see in an Agnos administration. Anita aimed to steer our attention away from Philippine politics to local politics.

In that community meeting with Agnos, we expressed our disappointment with previous mayors who appointed Filipinos only to minor commissions and who never appointed any Filipino to head a city department. We also wanted our fair share of funding for our Filipino community programs. In short, we wanted to be empowered just like the other assertive communities. Agnos promised to support our goals.

During that 1987 mayoral campaign, we registered an unprecedented number of voters in the FilAm community, volunteered as precinct captains, held fundraisers, did phone banking and campaigned door-to-door in FilAm neighborhoods throughout the city for him. On election night, our hard work paid off – Agnos garnered 70% of the votes in a resounding victory.

After he assumed office, Agnos appointed Anita as Director of his Mayor’s Citizens’ Assistance Center. He also appointed not one but two Fil-Ams as department heads – Peter Jamero from Seattle as Director of the Human Rights Commission and Felipe Floresca from New York as Director of the Public Housing Authority. He also appointed Jim Arnold as Deputy Police Chief. He then appointed me to the city’s largest commission, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), where I served two terms as president, the first FilAm to be appointed to a major city commission.

Agnos also appointed 11 other FilAms to various city commissions, perhaps more than all the FilAm commissioners appointed by previous San Francisco mayors combined. Agnos also funded various FilAm community programs like the West Bay Pilipino Multi-Service Center. He also provided community block grant funding for the Filipino American Council to purchase a building on 17th Street in the Mission to house the Filipino Senior Citizens Center.

It was the golden age of Filipino empowerment in San Francisco and it inspired FilAms throughout the Bay Area to seek to also empower themselves. None of this would have been possible if it wasn’t for Anita’s guidance and her behind-the-scenes influence on Mayor Agnos.

After Agnos lost his bid for reelection 1991, Anita went across the Bay to work as Chief of Staff of Oakland Assemblywoman Barbara Lee from 1993 to 1996. In 1997, she returned to San Francisco to work as Assistant Executive Officer of the City’s Civil Service Commission. In that same year, she rose to the top post where she has served until her retirement this month.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who has personally known Anita for more than 30 years, has proclaimed June 29 as Anita Sanchez Day in San Francisco describing her as “one of the hardest working public servants committed to policies and procedures that impact thousands of San Franciscans.”

One day in the future when there is a park, a school or a street in San Francisco named after Anita Sanchez , a young Pinay immigrant will inquire about Anita. She will then be told about Anita’s work to improve the lives of San Franciscans and of her proud kababayans. That young Pinay will be inspired to grow up to become an Anita Sanchez.

As Mayor Lee said, “we wish her all the best for a well-deserved retirement.”

The story generated more than 3,000 comments, including these two:

David Nelson

It is sad that Jesus has been demoted to being a politician. Jesus plainly said ""My Kingdom is not of this world."" Movements to use Him to promote their agendas, whether they be on the Left or Right, are extremely suspect in the eyes of this Christian. kateslate

Jesus would SO have been a democrat. He taught us to care for the sick...not to profit off illness. I don't know how Republicans can live with themselves and call themselves Christian.

What’s your take?

By John Blake, CNN

(CNN) - He was a healer, a provider of universal health care, a man of compassion who treated those with preexisting medical conditions.

We don’t know what Jesus thought about the individual mandate or buying broccoli. But we do know how the New Testament describes him. The Gospels are filled with stories of Jesus physically healing the most vulnerable and despised people in his society.

References to Jesus, of course, didn’t make into the recent U.S. Supreme Court’s hearings on the constitutionality of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Yet there is a moral dimension to this epic legal debate:

How should the nation help its “least of these,” an estimated 50 million Americans who can’t afford health insurance, as well as those who could go broke or die because they can’t afford medical care?

Christians are as divided about this question as others. Many cite Jesus, but come up with completely different conclusions.

Trust God or government?

Tom Prichard, a Lutheran and president of the Minnesota Family Council, said it’s ultimately about faith. Who do we trust – God or government?

He opposes “Obamacare” because he has more faith in the market and people, than government.

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

“Here Jesus’ words come to mind about not worrying and trusting God to meet our basic needs,” Prichard wrote in an online post warning about the dangers of “government run health care.” “Or if we believe it all depends on us, we’ll look to government.”

When reached at his Minnesota office,Prichard elaborated: He said the nation should empower families and individuals to make health-care decisions. If families can’t afford health insurance, private and public entities like churches and nonprofits should step in, he said.

“We all have the same goal,”Prichard said. “We want all people to have health care, even people who can’t afford it. I would argue that having the government be the primary vehicle for providing it is not going to get us to that goal. It’s going to make the situation worse.”

Carl Raschke, a religious studies professor at the University of Denver, evoked Jesus’ words about Rome and taxation.

Raschke cited the New Testament passage when Jesus, after being asked if Jews should pay taxes to Rome, said that people should ""Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.""

Jesus was against strictly political or economic solutions because he thought they were too easy when it comes to the real challenges of human life, Raschke said.

“Writing checks won’t solve social problems,” Raschke said. “One has to get involved. If we see someone in need, we just don’t throw a dollar at him or her. You get to know them, you offer yourself, and ask what you can do for them.”

Helping the Good Samaritans of our day

There are some Christians, though, who say that charity isn’t enough to solve the nation’s health care problems.

An estimated 32 million Americans could lose health insurance if “Obamacare” is struck down, including children who can stay on their parents’ insurance until they are 26 and seniors who get help paying for their drug prescriptions. Most observers say health care costs would continue to rise.

Some people believe the health care situation in America would be scandalous to Jesus because he was a prophet concerned about social justice.

Steven Kraftchick, a religious scholar, said Jesus comes out of the tradition of Jewish prophets who preached that the health of a society could be measured by how well they took care of “its widows and orphans,” those who had the least power.

Kraftchick said there’s a famous story in the Gospel of Mark in which Jesus heals such a person. He was the man who called himself Legion. He might have been called homeless and mentally ill. The man roamed a graveyard, so tormented that even chains could not hold him and everyone feared him, Mark wrote.

Jesus healed the man not only physically, but socially as well, according to Mark. The man returned to his community with a sense of dignity, said Kraftchick, a professor at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta.

“A move toward universal health care would be fitting with the prophetic traditions,” Kraftchick said. “When you read the New Testament and look at the signs of the in-breaking of the Kingdom of God, it’s always connected to being physically healed.”

Yet Marcia Pally, an authority on evangelicals, said many evangelicals are wary of government doing the healing. Their reasons go back centuries.

Many are the descendants of people who fled Europe because of religious persecution from countries and state churches. They fought a revolution against a government in England. And they settled a frontier, where the virtue of self-reliance was critical, said Pally, author of “The New Evangelicals: Expanding the Vision of the Common Good.”

Suspicion of government is part of their historical and religious experience, said Pally, a professor at Fordham University and New York University.

Those attitudes, though, may be changing. Pally said she spent six years traveling across America to interview evangelicals. She discovered that a new generation of evangelists now believes that certain issues are too big and complex to be addressed by charity alone.

“Some note that charity is very good at the moment of emergency relief but it doesn’t change the underlying problem unless structures that keep people poor, sick or deny their access to health insurance are changed,” she said.

No matter what the Supreme Court decides, the legal debate will continue. If more Americans go broke or die because they do not have health insurance, more Americans may ask, what would Jesus do?

But don’t expect any easy answers from the Bible, said Raschke, the religious studies professor at the University of Denver.

“People are always looking for support from the Bible for American political positions,” Rashke said. “Would Jesus be against abortion, or would he support a woman’s right to choose? It’s almost become a standard joke in the theological world that you quote Jesus in American politics to support your political views.

“The teachings of Jesus do not fit into the views of any political party.""","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120328023539-jesus-healing-the-sick-story-top.jpg,"['political', 'insurance', 'professor', 'support', 'reform', 'care', 'religious', 'raschke', 'god', 'jesus', 'health', 'man']", 
69,69,FL-2012-000111-CHN,"A rabbi, a Mormon and a black Christian mayor walk into a room... - CNN",https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/23/a-rabbi-a-mormon-and-a-black-christian-mayor-walk-into-a-room/,"By Jessica Ravitz, CNN

Newark, New Jersey (CNN) – Mayor Cory Booker waits in his wood-paneled city hall office for his next visitors. His life, even on a Sunday, is tightly scheduled. He checks the time on his cell phone and lets the ribbing of his two friends, who are now late, begin.

“Jewish time is even worse than black time,” he says, “although I should never drag all the Jewish people down with Shmuley.” And then, about the other guy: “I thought Mormons were always 15 minutes early?”

If the friendship between these men – a black Christian mayor, a rabbi running for Congress and a Mormon university president – wasn't so real, this would sound like a bad joke. Instead, it’s a reflection of how three men from profoundly different backgrounds met 20 years ago, connected and changed one another.

So when this unusual trio got together for a rare meeting this spring, we jumped at the chance to join them.

But before the others arrive, let’s introduce the players.

There’s Booker, the 43-year-old Democratic mayor of Newark, a rising political star and headline grabber, a man who was recently lauded for saving a neighbor from a burning building and grilled for his perceived off-message remarks on a Sunday talk show. He was raised by parents who fought in the courts to integrate the northern New Jersey suburbs where he grew up.

The two men he’s waiting for are no schlubs themselves.

Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 45, is a TV personality, former radio host, prolific author - his books include “Kosher Sex” and “Kosher Jesus” - and now Republican congressional candidate in New Jersey. He was also an unofficial spiritual adviser to Michael Jackson. He was raised by a single mom in Miami.

And Michael Benson, a 47-year-old political scientist and president of Southern Utah University, comes from Mormon and Utah royalty, of sorts. His grandfather is the late Ezra Taft Benson, secretary of agriculture under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the 13th prophet and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

With his wife and two young children in tow, the Mormon shows up first.

“Brother Benson,” Booker booms, addressing his friend in Mormon-speak as he stands to give him a big hug.

The last time these two had seen each other was five years ago, when they both helped celebrate the rabbi’s 40th birthday in New York. The massive party, as described by the mayor, was “a mosh pit of yarmulkes and sweat.”

CNN's Belief Blog: the faith angles behind the big stories

Boteach, who lives in New Jersey and sees the mayor often, rushes into the room on this Sunday a half-hour late.

“Let the record reflect, the Mormon got me lost,” he says by way of hello. The rabbi then glances down at Benson’s two little ones, who sweetly peer up at him.

“They’re a little too Mormon perfect,” he quips. “When Mormons walk into a hurricane, does their hair move?”

Booker, whose nearby desk features a stack of religious texts including the Bhagavad Gita and the Quran, watches as a crowd streams in behind Boteach. The mayor has box seats for this afternoon’s Cirque du Soleil performance of “Michael Jackson The Immortal World Tour,” and he wants his friends and their families to join him. But first he demands to know of the rabbi, “How many people are with you? … They just multiply.”

“Are you kidding?” Boteach shoots back. “We have 30 kids.” Actually, he only has nine.

The three men and their very different worlds collided in the early 1990s at Oxford University in England, where they overlapped for two years. Booker was there on a Rhodes scholarship; Benson on a Rotary scholarship - ""but if I slurred, it sounded like Rhodes,” he says. Boteach was there as an emissary for Chabad Lubavitch, a Hasidic movement in Orthodox Judaism.

The first one to arrive at Oxford was Boteach, in 1988. His official mission was to serve as a rabbi to the students, but by 1990 he’d broadened his outreach by establishing the all-inclusive L’Chaim Society, a campus organization to promote the universal values of Judaism while celebrating differences. The society, whose Hebrew name means “To Life,” became the second largest student group on campus, surging to 5,000 members – no more than 800 of them Jewish.

The Mormon arrived in 1991, having spent six months in Israel at the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center. Benson, who earned a doctorate at Oxford, would write his dissertation on President Harry S. Truman and eventually write a book about the Jewish influences in Truman's life and his contributions to Israel’s founding. (The “Mormon perfect” son in the mayor’s office, it turns out, is named Truman.)

Shortly after Benson arrived at Oxford, a Jewish friend told him about Boteach, saying, “You have to meet this rabbi.”

Boteach admits his previous impressions of Mormons had been pretty negative. Then Benson walked into the L’Chaim Society – and the rabbi’s life – one Friday evening. “Not a hair was out of place,” a slightly disheveled and wild-bearded Boteach says, remembering when they met. “I was fascinated.”

Benson never budged from his own religious beliefs, but he became a devout member and officer of the L’Chaim Society, which held legendary Friday night dinners.

Booker arrived on campus a year later. He first met Benson through basketball - they both played for the Oxford Blues - then got to know Boteach with the help of a woman who stood him up for dinner. Booker was supposed to meet her outside the L’Chaim Society; when she never showed, he moseyed inside on his own to check out this mysterious place with a name he couldn’t pronounce.

Inside, hordes of people – many of them drunk – were dancing around with sacred scrolls containing the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. They were celebrating Simchat Torah, a holiday that marks the end of the annual Torah-reading cycle.

“I felt like I walked into a scene from ‘Yentl,’” Booker says.

Booker would go on to become president of the now-defunct organization, taking on tasks like lighting a Hanukkah menorah with Mikhail Gorbachev when the former Soviet leader visited Oxford.

Like Benson, Booker doesn’t drink; together they became allies as well as teammates. At the end of holidays like Simchat Torah or Purim – another raucous Jewish festival where celebrators often get drunk - they bonded as sober men in the room. They also led the Oxford Blues to win a British collegiate championship.

“I was their mascot,” boasts Boteach, whose friends tower above him.

The rabbi and Mormon say the mayor's humanity and heart inspire them. Booker says these two faithful men taught him to love and respect different religions, while helping him deepen his own beliefs and sense of awe. Likewise, both the mayor and Boteach say Benson changed how they and hundreds of others view Mormons.

Booker has been known to have his driver pull over when he spots young Mormon missionaries walking in pairs. He understands they’re often financially strapped, so he gives them some money for food and thanks them for being in his city.

“That’s something I never would have done if I hadn’t met Mike,” the mayor says.

And Booker certainly wouldn’t have pulled all-nighters studying Jewish texts before meeting Boteach. There’s a tradition, the rabbi explains, for a father to stay up and study the night before his son is circumcised. It was the middle of exams at Oxford when the rabbi first roped Booker in to join him the night before his first son Mendy's circumcision. Boteach came back again 11 years ago after the birth of Yosef, to which Booker responded, “Shmuley, you’re killing me” before he agreed to take part.

But the last time the rabbi issued his all-night study decree, Booker wasn’t having it.

“Forget it. Don’t even ask. I’m running for mayor,” the then-candidate told his friend six years ago, after Dovid Chaim was born. At 1 a.m., though, there was a knock on Boteach’s door. “You have 60 minutes. That’s it,” the mayor said as he rushed inside.

“Cory and I see each other whenever he needs advice,” the rabbi likes to say of Booker. And it's comments like this that prompt the mayor to retort, “He needs to get his head examined by a proctologist.”

All kidding aside, these three look out for each other's interests. After leaving Oxford for Yale Law School, Booker became a self-appointed kosher police officer, alerting the rabbi when he heard about Jewish L'Chaim Society members who had stopped keeping kosher. “You really need to do something,” he'd tell the rabbi.

Ever since Boteach learned that Benson’s older brother, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Steve Benson of The Arizona Republic, had shrugged off religion, the rabbi has said he’s on a mission to bring the older Benson back to the LDS Church.

The Mormon can’t help but marvel at the rabbi’s chutzpah, but he’s happy to let him give it his best shot. So far Boteach has only e-mailed with the older Benson, but he looks forward to a face-to-face meeting so he, the Jew, can give the ex-Mormon the proper Latter-day Saint sell.

Boteach has fallen for the national parks of Utah, where the LDS Church is headquartered. He has lectured a handful of times at universities where Benson has been affiliated. Benson has led the way in scrambling to find kosher food for the rabbi before the two have headed out for weekend hikes.

Booker reflects on his old friends and says, “I love the fact that those two have kept such a good friendship. They’re very different. Mike is humble and soft-spoken; Shmuley is loud and bordering on obnoxious.”

Noticing the time, Booker rushes off to squeeze in a meeting before Cirque du Soleil.

The mayor's friends, at home in his office, take their time leaving. They stroll down the empty and echoing hallways toward the exit of Newark City Hall. The Mormon throws his arm around the rabbi's shoulder.

“I have to get back to Utah soon,” Boteach says. “It's been too long.”

“This time, we'll get you baptized,” Benson tells him.

The suggestion of a Mormon conversion, even in jest, might stop other rabbis in their tracks. But Boteach doesn’t skip a beat: “If it'll get me votes, fine.”","Sat, 23 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120619065038-booker-benson-boteach-story-top.jpg,"['christian', 'boteach', 'mayor', 'men', 'benson', 'room', 'society', 'president', 'black', 'oxford', 'walk', 'mormon', 'booker', 'rabbi']",

Washington (CNN) – She went from atheist to Catholic in just over 1,000 words.

Leah Libresco, who’d been a prominent atheist blogger for the religion website Patheos, announced on her blog this week that after years of debating many “smart Christians,” she has decided to become one herself, and that she has begun the process of converting to Catholicism.

Libresco, who had long blogged under the banner “Unequally Yoked: A geeky atheist picks fights with her Catholic boyfriend,” said that at the heart of her decision were questions of morality and how one finds a moral compass.

“I had one thing that I was most certain of, which is that morality is something we have a duty to,” Libresco told CNN in an interview this week, a small cross dangling from her neck. “And it is external from us. And when push came to shove, that is the belief I wouldn’t let go of. And that is something I can’t prove.”

CNN's Belief Blog: the faith angles behind the big stories

According to a Patheos post she wrote on Monday, entitled “This is my last post for the Patheos Atheist Portal,” she began to see parts of Christianity and Catholicism that fit her moral system. Though she now identifies as a Catholic, Libresco questions certain aspects of Catholicism, including the church’s positions on homosexuality, contraception and some aspects of religious liberty.

“There was one religion that seemed like the most promising way to reach back to that living Truth,” Libresco wrote about Catholicism in her conversion announcement post, which has been shared over 18,000 times on Facebook. “I asked my friend what he suggests we do now, and we prayed the night office of the Liturgy of the Hours together.”

At the end of the post, Libresco announces that she is in a Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults class and is preparing for baptism. She will continue to blog for Patheos, but under the banner, “A geeky convert picks fights in good faith.”

According to Dan Welch, director of marketing for Patheos, Libresco’s post has received around 150,000 page views so far.

“Leah's blog has gotten steadily more popular since she arrived at Patheos, but a typical post on her blog is probably closer to the range of 5,000 page views,” Welch wrote in an email. “Even now, a few days later, her blog is probably getting 20-30 times its normal traffic.”

Libresco’s announcement has left some atheists scratching their heads.

“I think atheists were surprised that she went with Catholicism, which seems like a very specific choice,” Hemant Mehta, an atheist blogger at Patheos, told CNN. “I have a hard time believing how someone could jump from I don’t believe in God to a very specific church and a very specific God.”

Mehta says that Libresco’s conversion is a “one-off thing” and not something that signals any trend in atheism. “The trends are very clear, the conversions from Catholicism to atheism are much more likely to happen than the other way around,” he said.

But while atheists were puzzled by the conversion, others commended Libresco.

“I know I’ve prayed for her conversion several times, always thinking she would make a great Catholic,” wrote Brandon Vogt, a Catholic blogger. “And with this news, it looks like that will happen. Today heaven is roaring with joy.”

Thomas L. McDonald, a Catholic Patheos blogger, welcomed Libresco to the fold: “Welcome. I know this was hard, and will continue to be so. Don’t worry if the Catholics make it as for difficult for you as the atheists. We only do it to people we love.”

Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter

Libresco says one of the most common questions she has received is how she'll deal with atheists now.

“The great thing about a lot of the atheist and skeptic community is that people talk more critically about ideas and want to see proof provided,” Libresco said. “That kind of analytical thinking is completely useful and the Catholic Church doesn’t need to and should not be afraid of because if you’ve got the facts on your side, you hope they win.”

Libresco is just switching the side she thinks the facts are on.","Fri, 22 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120624075318-intv-atheist-catholic-00002401-horizontal-gallery.jpg,"['libresco', 'prominent', 'catholic', 'post', 'catholicism', 'wrote', 'blog', 'conversion', 'atheist', 'converts', 'blogger', 'patheos', 'atheists']",

Small town of Salem, Connecticut, rallies to family



A small town has united in grief at the horrific death of a six-year-old boy sucked into a wood chipper.

Jeffrey Bourgeois died after getting pulled into the machine while helping his father on a landscaping job one morning during his school holiday in Salem, Connecticut.

The boy was putting a branch into the industrial-sized chipper when it yanked him when his father Scott, 39, momentarily turned his back.

Tragic: Jeffrey Bourgeois, six, was killed after being pulled into a wood chipper while on his school holiday

The family has been helped to cope with their loss by the community of Salem, a town with fewer than 4,000 residents, in the form of cash and meals.

Erin Cummings, who lives near the scene of the accident in Salem, told the Hartford Courant : 'It affected the whole community so much. It was just so tragic.'



Mrs Cummings is helping to organise a picnic for the whole community to support the family, which is taking place tomorrow.

Food and items for an auction were donated by local people and businesses.

All proceeds will go to a fund set up for the Bourgeois family.

Mrs Cummings added: 'It's really amazing to see how people have responded.

'This is to give the family some peace of mind, so they don't have to worry about how to pay their bills and can focus on healing and family.'

In the week after Jeffrey's death in April, thousands of people gathered on Salem's town green for a candlelight vigil to pray for the boy and his family .



Speaking shortly after Jeffrey died, Lieutenant J. Paul Vance, spokesman for Connecticut state police spokesman, said the accident was so horrific that counsellors had to be immediately called to the scene.



'The little guy was apparently trying to help his dad,' he said at the time.



'It's a very tragic and difficult scene for everybody.'

The Bourgeois family live just half a mile from where the accident happened.

Jeffrey was a first-grader at Salem Elementary School, where he was honoured in its newsletter with a 'Caught Being Good' award in December.



He, his two older siblings and their mother Corinne also enjoyed running in road races.



Salem First Selectman Kevin Lynden said Jeffrey's death was 'a very, very sad day for our Salem residents'.



He added: 'This was a Salem family, very good family in town, a well-known family.'

Her choice might be a 1997 or '98 vintage Falcon that in the current depressed market can be had, she says, for a mere $15 to $16 million. Buy a 2010 model and the price tag soars to $30 million. Of course, if the sky is the limit . . . why not?

Europe is one quick refueling stop away. Who wouldn't appreciate that ease of travel? But wait, there's more.

Iannarelli favors the Falcon over other private aircraft for its range that easily gets the Houston jetsetter to a favorite ski resort in just a few hours or to New York, perhaps for dinner at Petrossian, in three and a half hours. Europe is one quick refueling stop away. Who wouldn't appreciate that ease of travel? But wait, there's more.

""I love the cabin,"" Iannarelli says. ""It's fabulous.""

Depending on the owner's preferences, the plane can sit four in the front compartment, four in the mid-cabin where a dining table is at play and four to six more in the back cabin, which closes off to offer complete privacy. Two facing divans at the rear of the aircraft can be converted into comfortable sleepers as can the seats in the other cabins. That means you can sleep your way, at full recline, to London or Paris on your Porthault linens with your own down-filled pillows beneath your head.

Lavatories in both the front and back of the aircraft are another plus, particularly considering that the jet can carry 12 to 14 passengers, though Iannarelli says eight is the more likely load.

Innarelli says that the typical Falcon 900EX is outfitted with a swank galley, often done in rich burl, that includes a microwave, a warming oven, perhaps a mini-fridge, the all-important Nespresso machine and custom-designed storage for crystal, china and silverware. And, of course, flying in a French-manufactured jet, one would want only the best in French accoutrements such as Saint-Louis Crystal.

If you really want yours to be the most fabulous jet in the sky, redecorating would probably be in order. Your baby goes to a ""completion center"" for new upholstery, carpeting, wall and window treatments, refinishing of fixtures and cabinetry.

On the low end, the redo would cost between $400,000 and $800,000 depending on your wants. If you plan to take it to the limit of refurbishing including updating the cabin entertainment system (wifi and boardband at 35,000 feet), the cost could reach as much as $1 million.","Mon, 25 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://houston.culturemap.com/favicon.ico,"['jet', 'aircraft', 'better', 'falcon', '900ex', 'cabin', 'wait', 'air', 'wouldnt', 'travel', 'doesnt', 'iannarelli', 'private', 'theres', 'million']",

Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee met with the city manager earlier in the day to discuss the terms of his employment, officials said.

“I have determined the police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community,” City Manager Norton Bonaparte said in a statement Wednesday night. “We need to move forward with a police chief that all the citizens of Sanford can support. I have come to this decision in light of the escalating divisiveness that has taken hold of the city.”

Lee took a leave of absence after Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, was shot Feb. 26. George Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense.

Lee offered to quit in April, but the City Council rejected his resignation on a 3-2 vote.

“Since February, the discussions have been whether it was feasible for him to come back and whether the city could move on, quote unquote, if he does come back,” Lonnie Groot, a lawyer from Lake Mary, Fla., who represents Sanford, told The Times just before he heard of Lee’s firing. “Everything that you [have] seen, read and heard since he stepped aside – that’s been the continuing conversation within the city.”

Lee will receive three months and one week’s worth of severance pay, in addition to any earned time off, officials said. The search for a new police chief will begin immediately.

Zimmerman, 28, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated community, had called police to report Martin as a suspicious person, then followed him. Martin was visiting the home of his father’s fiance, who also lives in the gated community, and had gone for a walk to buy Skittles and an iced tea.

A confrontation ensued and Zimmerman fatally shot Martin. Police took Zimmerman to the station that night but did not arrest him.

After a nationwide uproar, Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, who charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder in April. He was arrested April 11, and had been free on $150,000 bail. He was rearrested June 3, when the judge learned he and his wife had lied about their finances during a bond hearing.

Shellie Zimmerman had testified that they had little money, but it was later revealed that a website George Zimmerman set up to receive donations had raised more than $200,000.

She has been charged with perjury and is free on bond. Her husband remains behind bars.

""We wanted to help in some way,"" he said. ""We figured we'd use our tech skills to help, since not many people in Colorado Springs have the skills to do this quickly. The pictures are the best part so far. They're really powerful.""

Colorado Springs has a fairly small tech community, and most people there don't use social media much, aside from Facebook, Trencheny said. His online tool is something can can give anyone with Web access a window onto the public discourse about this emergency, whether or not they use Twitter.

Most people think of ""apps"" as programs that you download and install on a mobile device or computer. But this is a ""Web app,"" delivered entirely through the Web browser.

""The first time you check it out, be prepared: This fire is moving fast!"" Trencheny said. To make it less overwhelming, he suggests making sure the ""retweets enabled"" checkbox near the top is unchecked to eliminate duplicate tweets that occur as people interested in the fire copy updates to share with their own Twitter followers.

The information from Twitter comes from all sorts of places: from official agencies such as the Colorado Springs Fire Department to people in and near the city sharing what they're witnessing with other people around the state and the nation.

""Part of what makes this compelling is not so much reading every tweet but just getting a real-time sense of how fast this is moving,"" he said.

Trencheny could add Instagram photos to this app, since like Twitter, Instagram offers an open application programming interface. But he hasn't, because not many people in Colorado Springs appear to be using Instagram much. However, Instagram photos bearing the #WaldoCanyonFire hashtag and cross-posted to Twitter are appearing in the app.

""I can't add Facebook posts, of course, because that's a closed network,"" he said.

While this Web app can be viewed on a computer, it also works fairly well on smartphones and tablets. Trencheny says he will continue to improve the mobile interface Wednesday.

This project isn't just about Colorado Springs. People in other cities facing wildfires (or any type of emergency) can reuse Trencheny's code base, for free, to spin off their own iteration. He's posted this open source code to GitHub , a popular resource for programmers who like to share what they create.

In fact, Trencheny plans to spin off a version of the Web app to track other current wildfires in Colorado, such as the High Park Fire outside Fort Collins, which has burned more than 87,000 acres, or the Flagstaff Fire burning just outside Boulder. And he'll explore adding more features, such as a map or integrating photos posted to Flickr.

Trencheny is part of the growing movement of ""civic coders"": programmers who enjoy building free tools and services to help communities. Sometimes these are solo efforts, but often civic coders collaborate, either online through resources like GitHub or in person at events called ""hackathons"" where coders self-organize into teams and compete to build software over the course of a day or a weekend.

The nonprofit Code for America initiative is helping accelerate civic coding by fostering collaboration between coders, local or state governments, and community groups to solve problems. Some of this happens by deploying teams of coders to help government agencies, but Code for America also supports civic hackathons around the nation.

Similarly, last year the Apps for Communities Challenge (a contest run jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation) awarded more than $100,000 in prizes to coders who built apps to ""make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans."" ( See the winners .)

Trencheny, who hails from the San Francisco Bay Area, participated in Code for Oakland , a civic hackathon for Oakland, California, now entering its second year. And the company he works with, Momentum , is building a platform to make it easier for nonprofits, government agencies and relief organizations to accept online and mobile donations.

""We're currently reaching out to fire departments and other agencies helping to fight the Colorado wildfires and provide relief services,"" he said. ""They all are seeking donations right now.""

Trencheny also applauds local officials in Colorado Springs for doing an excellent job with communicating about the Waldo Canyon Fire via social media.

""They were on it right away. The declared a hashtag and encouraged people to adopt it. And they're being responsive to questions on social media and very open with the community there. That makes the content of the Waldo Canyon Fire Tracker so much more useful,"" he said.","Fri, 29 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120620023644-wildfire-roundup-colorado-1-story-top.jpg,"['springs', 'devastate', 'western', 'caption', 'app', 'wildfires', 'photos', '51', 'tracks', 'colorado', 'states', 'hide']", 
81,81,FL-2012-000111-CHN,"Bulgarian bones could be John the Baptist's as claimed, scientists say - CNN",https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/22/bulgarian-bones-could-be-john-the-baptists-as-claimed-scientists-say/,"By Richard Allen Greene, CNN

(CNN)– When the tools of modern science are applied to religious relics, the results are almost always the same: Science says the relics aren't what their supporters claim.

The most famous of them all, the Turin Shroud, is widely regarded as a Middle Ages forgery, and even the Catholic Church does not insist the shroud was actually used to wrap the body of Jesus himself.

So when Bulgarian archeologists announced two years ago that they had found the bones of John the Baptist, Tom Higham was skeptical.

He got a surprise.

Higham, an Oxford University scientist and an atheist who doesn't believe in ""any kind of religion or God or anything like that,"" was asked to test six small bone fragments found on an island named Sveti Ivan - St. John.

CNN's Belief Blog: the faith angles behind the big stories

The bones turned out to be from a man who lived in the Middle East at the same time as Jesus, Higham said.

""We got a date that was exactly where it should be, right in the middle of the first century,"" said Higham, a radiocarbon dating expert.

It's not proof that they belonged to John the Baptist, since there's no DNA database of early Christian saints, the archeologist who found the bones said.

But the mere fact that the testing didn't prove the bones are fakes is unusual.

Archeologist Kazimir Popkonstantinov led the team that found them under the altar of a fifth century basilica on Sveti Ivan, a Black Sea island off Sozopol on the south coast of Bulgaria.

The bones were in a reliquary, a container for holy relics, with a tiny sandstone box.

Written on the box in Greek were the words, ""God, save your servant Thomas. To St. John. June 24.""

The date is the Christian feast day of John the Baptist, believed to be his birthday.

When the bones were found in 2010, Popkonstantinov said it was ""logical to suggest that the founders of the monastery did their best to bring relics of its patron saint.""

Higham, the deputy director of Oxford's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, got involved because a colleague knew the Bulgarian archeologists. National Geographic was also interested, so it provided funding for more extensive testing than Higham originally planned, and made a film about the project.

Radiocarbon dating showed that the bones were from the right period to be from John the Baptist, Higham said, while genetic testing showed it was a man and all the bones were from the same person.

DNA testing by colleagues at the University of Copenhagen suggested that the person was most likely to have been from the Middle East, he said.

Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter

More detailed nuclear DNA testing could pin down his location even more accurately, Higham said, but ""does cost quite a lot of money.""

There is reasonably good historical evidence that John the Baptist, whom Christians believe baptized his cousin Jesus, did exist, said Paul Middleton, a senior lecturer in Biblical studies at the University of Chester.

All four gospels and the contemporary Jewish historian Josephus say he was beheaded on the orders of the ruler Herod Antipas, Middleton said when the bones were found.

The six small bones are far from the only relics purporting to belong to him.

Four locations, from a mosque in Damascus, Syria, to a museum in Munich, Germany, claim to have his head, while the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul, Turkey, has a relic alleged to be his right arm.

A monastery in Montenegro says it has his right hand, while another in Egypt has a crypt containing relics of the saint.

Tom Higham says he can test them to see if they match.

""We have a complete genome. It's possible that we could step this a step further and see if there is any similarity,"" in the genetic material of all the relics.

""We've sort of got interested in this. It's not beyond the realms of possibility, and we know that there were relics moving out of the Middle East in the fourth and fifth century,"" he said.

But for him, the project remains a purely scientific one.

""I'm an atheist,"" he said. ""I perceive this as an archeological dating problem. We have some bones and we're trying to get as much information out of them as we can.""

How the world's biggest salt flat turns into giant reflective surface

A spot of reflection is always good for the soul. And judging by these pictures, there's plenty of room for that.



For this is the world's largest natural mirror, created when a thin film of water gathers on a vast plain of salt deposits.

So magnificent is the dream-like sight that the salt pans in the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia have been dubbed 'heaven on earth'.

Photographer Takaki Watanabe captured a series of pictures of spellbound travellers as they took in natural wonder and played around with their reflections.

Mirror, mirror: A number of tourists enjoy the stunning sights of the salt flats in Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, where the mineral deposits create the world's biggest natural mirror

Takaki journeyed to the Potosm and Oruro departments in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes, where the magnificent sight can be found at an elevation of 11,995 feet above sea level.

In one stunning picture, a woman appears to be hanging above the clouds thanks to the amazing mirror effect.

In another shot, a couple walking hand in hand seem to be floating effortlessly through the soft white clouds.

The amazing natural phenomenon is created when small amounts of water flood the plain makes it appear like people are walking on the sky.

The salt flats stretch 6,500 miles making them the biggest in the world. They are even larger than Lake Titicaca, the vast stretch of water shared by Bolivia and neighbouring Peru.

Pearly gates: The region has been dubbed 'heaven on earth' because of the way people like this appear to be walking in the clouds - just like heaven is portrayed

Stunning: These two people appear to be hanging above the clouds in the picture taken by photographer Takaki Watanabe

Posing: This group of women have their picture taken as they each stand on one leg and their reflection shines below them. The giant mirror stretches 6,500 miles

The South American geological wonder is so flat NASA use its surface to calibrate satellite orbits.

Salt pans occur in areas which would otherwise be lakes or ponds if the climate did not evaporate the water quicker than the rate of rainfall. The result if the liquid can't drain is massive deposits of minerals.

But despite the dry nature of Salar de Uyuni - which is 100 times larger than the famous Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA - there is a rare phenomenon when a true natural wonder brings the desert to life.

The Salar as well as being stunning also contains the highest concentration of lithium - vital for computer and phone batteries - in the world.

Between half and 70 percent of the planet's supply of the precious metal is contained in the area.

Reaching for the sky: The salt flats are created when water collects on the vast deposits of salt. Tourists are able to walk across the surface... with wellies, of course



Precious: The salt flats contain more than half of the world's supply of lithium, the mineral used in computers, phone batteries and electric cars

Popular: The salt flats have become more popular with tourists in recent years who are captivated by the shimmering reflections. The area is even used by NASA to calibrate satellite orbits

Hypnotic: The salt flats are some 12,000ft above sea level and temperatures reach 21C in the summer





As well as the rich mineral wealth of the area it also plays host to stunning wildlife in the shape of some massive flocks of pink flamingos.

Despite the dry nature of the salt plain because of its height in the mountains the average temperature is steady around 21C in the summer.

The impact of mining on the tourism industry remains uncertain.

However it has yet to deter tourists from staying with the locals in Atulcha, Villamar and San Juan, all located around the salt flats.

Visitors to the area can take in the vast white expanse of salt and the stunning surrounding vistas, while staying with locals in an area which feels cut off from the modern world.

For just $15 a day, tourists can lodge with peasant families in homes without running water or electricity - and outhouses used as bathrooms.

But despite the loss of home comforts, they can join in with local activities - such as the annual llama-shearing season in August, or joining llama caravans that deliver salt blocks to remote villages in exchange for food and other goods.","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/28/article-2165924-13D46040000005DC-501_1024x615_large.jpg,"['giant', 'mirror', 'biggest', 'water', 'salar', 'tourists', 'worlds', 'surface', 'bolivia', 'flat', 'salt', 'turns', 'stunning', 'reflective', 'flats', 'natural']",

Now, all the rest of us are going to find out a lot more about what’s in the 2,700-page health overhaul law.

The president now must spend the next four months defending a law that the majority of Americans dislike, and the more they learn about it, the more they dislike it. Worse, the part of the law that is the least popular — the individual mandate — has now been declared a tax.

That’s double jeopardy for the president: The unpopular mandate stands, and it is called a tax. (And this is only one of the 20 new and higher taxes in the law.) Either the president admits it’s a tax as a way of keeping the law on the books, or he says that the Supreme Court is wrong, that it’s not a tax, in which case his law would be invalid.

It’s important to note that the Court did not “uphold Obamacare.” Two specific provisions were being challenged before the Court — the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion. If either had been struck, then the Court could have decided whether or not to take down the whole law.

Instead, it reached a very narrow decision. The individual mandate is valid as a tax, says the Court. Now, otherwise free citizens will be required to spend our own personal, after-tax money to purchase an expensive private product — $20,000 a year for an average family — or pay a tax. And the Court said the federal government can tell states to dramatically expand their Medicaid programs but that they can’t be coerced with the threat of losing all of their federal Medicaid money if they refuse.

So let’s get ready for the debate. About seven in ten Americans had told pollsters they wanted the Supreme Court to strike down all or part of the health overhaul law. Since it didn’t do that, we all must be armed with the facts as the battles continue at least into November so the voters can issue the final verdict.

Here’s a quick checklist of the ten worst things in the law — in addition to the individual and Medicaid mandates:

1. Employer mandate. Most companies will have to provide and pay for expensive government-determined health insurance for their employees or face federal fines.

2. Anti-conscience mandate. Religious organizations will be required to provide free sterilization, contraceptives, and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees, even if it violates their religious beliefs.

3. New and higher taxes.The law contains at least 20 new taxes totaling $500 billion that will hit medical innovators, health insurance, and even the sale of your home.

4. The Independent Payment Advisory Board. IPAB will still stand, with its rationing power over Medicare.

5. State exchanges. States will be compelled to set up vast new bureaucracies to check into our finances and families so they can hand out generous taxpayer subsidies for health insurance to families earning up to $90,000 a year.

6. Medicare payment cuts. $575 billion in payment reductions to Medicare providers and Medicare Advantage plans will cause more and more physicians to stop seeing Medicare patients, exacerbating access problems.

7. Higher health-care costs. The Kaiser Family Foundation says the average price of a family policy has risen by $2,200 during the Obama administration. The president promised premiums would be $2,500 lower by this year. Hospitals, doctors, businesses, and consumers all expect their taxes and health costs to rise under Obamacare.

8. Government control over doctor decisions.Value-based payments, quality reporting requirements, and government comparative-effectiveness boards will dictate how doctors practice medicine. Nearly half of all physicians are seriously considering leaving practice, leading to a severe doctor shortage.

9. Huge deficits. The CBO has raised its cost estimate for the law to $1.76 trillion over ten years, but that is only the opening bid as more and more people lose their job-based coverage and flood into taxpayer-subsidized insurance. At this rate, the cost will be $2 trillion, not the less than $1 trillion the president promised.

10. 159 new boards, agencies, and programs: The Obama administration will work quickly to set up as many of the law’s new bureaucracies as fast as it can so they can take root before the election.

The November elections are the last hope — we must elect a Congress and a president committed to repealing Obamacare. They, and all of us, will need to be armed with the facts to explain to the American people exactly what is in this monstrous law.","Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['medicaid', 'insurance', 'court', 'worst', 'law', 'medicare', 'tax', 'president', 'things', 'mandate', 'health', 'individual', 'obamacare']",
