DHAKA: At least 100 people have died and 250,000 left stranded by flash floods and landslides in Bangladesh set off by the heaviest rain in years, police and officials said on Wednesday.

The low-lying and densely populated country, which is in its wet season, has been battered by five days of torrential downpours.

The deaths took place late on Tuesday and on Wednesday. Most were caused by landslides, others by wall collapses, lightning strikes and surges of floodwater. Army, police and fire brigade personnel were helping in rescue efforts.

Weather officials said more rain was expected over the next few days.

Hundreds of homes have been washed away, while authorities have moved many families from shanty housing and told others to leave quickly.

At least 23 people were killed in and around the southeastern port city of Chittagong, while 36 died in Bandarban in an area known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

“Several more people are feared trapped in hillside homes buried under heaps of mud. Rescue operations are continuing,” Chittagong Deputy Commissioner Faiz Ahmed said.

A further 38 died in the coastal district of Cox's Bazar near the Myanmar border, officials and police said.

Officials in the affected areas said about 100 people were missing, many swept away by floodwater, and about 200 injured.

In Sylhet, a rice and tea-growing area in the northeast, houses were filled by up to three feet (one metre) of floodwater, and residents were forced to perch on boats or scramble to high ground. Three children were reported killed.

Flooding also hit districts northwest of the capital Dhaka.

The downpours lashed the borders with Myanmar and India, with the weather office recording 463 mm (18.2 inches) in Chittagong over the past 24 hours.

“We are having the worst rainfall in many years,” said Jainul Bari, district commissioner for Cox's Bazar.

Disaster control officials said about 150,000 people had been marooned by the floods in the southeast while 50,000 were stranded in Sylhet.

About 50,000 were reported stranded in their flooded homes in the northern districts of Gaibandha and Kurigram.

Local television showed villagers trudging through waist-high water to relief camps while some moved their cattle on to the roofs of buildings for safety.

Farming officials said it was too early to gauge crop damage. “In flash floods, water recedes soon after the rain stops, so we don't anticipate any major damage to rice and other crops,” one official said.

Most road and rail links between Chittagong and the rest of the country were suspended late on Tuesday, while Chittagong airport was closed after part of the runway was flooded.

Authorities have started distributing food, drinking water and medicine among survivors. “The government has allocated about 750 tonnes of rice and 6.6 million taka ($80,500) for the affected people,” Atiqur Rahman, a senior disaster ministry official, said.","Wed, 27 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/2012/06/bangladesh-landslide-reuters-300.jpg,"['officials', 'water', 'rain', 'rice', '100', 'chittagong', 'leave', 'homes', 'floodwater', 'bangladesh', '250000', 'died', 'stranded', 'dead', 'floods']",

Police find more bodies as flood waters recede in the Krymsk district

Floodwaters rose sharply and inundated homes as people slept, reports say

At least 141 people have died as floodwaters surge through southern Russia's Krasnodar region, state-run media reported Sunday, citing Russia's Interior Ministry.

Of those killed, 130 are in the Krymsk district, nine in Gelendzhik district and two in the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, the ministry said, according to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency.

The flash floods follow heavy rains since Friday.

Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the affected areas, meeting with local officials and surveying damage from the air.

The Krymsk district is a mostly rural area with many one-story homes, Russia's state news agency Itar-Tass reported.

Floodwaters rose 7 meters (23 feet) overnight in Krymsk, the news agency said, flooding homes while most people were still asleep. Others were rescued by police after seeking refuge on roofs and in trees, it said.

The death toll has climbed steadily through the day as the waters have gradually subsided, allowing police to find more bodies in flooded buildings in Krymsk.

Television footage from the Krasnodar region showed scenes of flooded streets, stranded vehicles and people wading through torrents of knee-deep muddy water outside homes.

The state-run Ria Novosti news agency said dozens of passenger trains have been diverted in the region as the water level remains 19 inches above the tracks.

Krasnodar also suffered deadly flooding in October 2010, when torrential rains in mountainous areas caused rivers to overflow, flooding villages nearby.","Sun, 08 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120708052412-russia-flood-story-top.jpg,"['waters', 'russia', 'scores', 'water', 'district', 'flooding', 'region', 'homes', 'agency', 'krymsk', 'killed', 'vladimir', 'russias']",

As much of India baked in blistering temperatures, anxiously awaiting the belated monsoon rains, the landlocked northeast struggled with the exact opposite problem.

An unprecedented surge of continuous rain – the worst in over a decade – led to heavy flooding in Assam, which has submerged thousands of villages, swept humans and livestock away, wrecked homes, property and villages and displaced nearly a quarter of a million people.

The flood crisis was significant enough for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to flee Delhi discussions about the country’s next president and rush to the landlocked state, and has once again focused attention on the contentious issue of using, and controlling, the northeast’s valuable and deadly waters.

Mr. Singh is a nominated lawmaker from the ruling Congress Party who represents Assam in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house, of India’s Parliament. Mr. Singh has never lived there, but he is expected to raise issues relating to Assam as a whole and work for their resolution.

Mr. Singh swiftly announced a 5 billion rupee ($90 million) aid package for the state, which the opposition dismissed as too meager, demanding instead that the central government declare the floods in the state a national disaster. The powerful All Assam Students Union denounced Mr. Singh as a “total failure in addressing floods and erosion.”

The criticism may not be completely warranted. As prime minister, Mr. Singh tried to start an umbrella organization that would have placed all states under a single regional water authority, which would work on controlling floods, among other issues. He dropped the idea after stiff opposition from a number of states, which felt the idea either favored upper riparians or sought an unacceptable level of central control.

The northeast, which shares 96 percent of its borders with China, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Bhutan, is one of the world’s most diverse regions, inhabited by at least 220 ethnic groups speaking almost as many languages. Still, it has just three percent of India’s 1.2 billion population, most of them packed into the narrow state of Assam.

For decades, the region has been better known to outsiders as a place where small insurgent groups have struggled against Indian forces in a quest for independence. With time, public fatigue and fragmentation of the rebels, as well as incorporation by the state, these movements are abating.

The flooding has shown once again the inadequacy of the system to handle the region’s most powerful entity, which respects neither borders nor barrages. Assam has the country’s greatest number of river embankments, despite its relatively small size. Yet these have failed to stem the deluge.

Experts like Professor Dulal Goswami of Gauhati University have consistently contended that the embankments are poorly designed and maintained and end up as human shelters, since they are among the few patches of dry land, instead of flood control measures.

Others, like Chandan Mahanta of the Indian Institute of Technology at Guwahati, favor an inclusive approach through a proposed Brahmaputra River Conservancy Commission, which would take a regional approach to issues, based on the river basin. Water from Tibet and downstream Arunachal Pradesh state sweeps into the Assam valley, before debouching into the flatlands of Bangladesh.

“We need to know what is happening in this little area between Tibet and Bangladesh and how we can sustainably use the waters without losing them forever,” said Mr. Mahanta in an interview. “We need not just a reservoir-driven approach, but a hydraulic one, where you assess both inflows and ground water aquifers which are recharged by floods.”

Such a broad-based approach could mitigate the opposition of anti-dam groups, but it wouldn’t resolve their concerns. The groups have long battled projects for a network of dams, arguing that such policies are environmentally unsound and harm farmers’ rights.","Mon, 09 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png,"['approach', 'state', 'brahmaputra', 'issues', 'water', 'groups', 'opposition', 'mr', 'singh', 'uncontrollable', 'remains', 'assam', 'river']",

Guwahati, Jun 27: Incessant rainfall in Assam has led to worsening of the flood situation in the state today triggering fresh inundation and landslides in 23 districts that left 10 more dead, taking the toll in this wave of floods to 20.









While a woman and her two children were buried in a landslide at Dhirenpara area of the city, two others met a similar fate in Dima Hasao district and one each in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Nagaon, Kamrup(Rural) and Cachar districts, official sources said.



The 23 affected districts are Tinsukia, Darrang, Bongaigaon, Jorhat, Kamrup (Metro), Golaghat, Cachar, Kokrajhar, Nalbari, Sonitpur, Karbi Anglong, Dima Hasao, Nagaon, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Dhubri, Kamrup(Rural), Karimganj, Hailakandi, Morigaon, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji and Goalpara, the sources said.



Heavy rainfall has caused Brahmaputra to swell and is threatening to submerge Majuli,Asia's largest river island in Jorhat district, where a red alert has been sounded after the river breached its embankments at Sonowal Kachari.



The island's famous Vaishnavite monasteries are now under threat of total submergence, the sources said.



Water levels of various rivers are rising in both Brahmaputra and Barak valleys, while landslides have disrupted road and rail networks at the Dima Hasao hill district.

Burma’s Misled Righteous

Sectarian rioting in western Burma has pitted the majority Buddhist population against a small Muslim minority group. Dozens of people on both sides have been killed, and countless homes destroyed. Thousands of refugees have taken flight.

This ethnic conflict has also had other, less conspicuous effects. Most importantly, it has triggered a dramatic realignment of political allegiances in the country. In a spectacular volte-face, a number of prominent members of Burma’s pro-democracy opposition have begun calling for collaboration between civilians and the military in a bid to drive out what they claim are illegal Muslim immigrants who threaten the delicate fabric of Burmese society.

This recasting of the armed forces as protectors of the nation amounts to something of a coup for the quasi-military government that came to power a little over a year ago. Numbers of parliamentarians and exiled activists consider the Rohingya, an 800,000-strong Muslim group of South Asian descent who inhabit a pocket of Arakan state, to be a greater threat to the overall health of the country than a reinvigorated military. Yet this is the very same military that has spent decades persecuting the political opposition, forcing tens of thousands into prison or exile. It also happens to be one of the few institutions in Burma not touched by the reform program, as demonstrated by the army’s continuing war against some of the country’s restive ethnic minorities.

The government will see the flood of nationalist sentiment as a gift. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that officials may have had a role in whipping it up, as they did prior to the anti-Chinese riots of 1967 and the bouts of communal unrest involving Rohingya in 1978 and 1992. According to a Human Rights Watch report, security forces are actively persecuting ethnic Rohingya during this most recent bout of violence. The current riots serve to distract from ongoing ethnic conflicts in the north, public anger at rising electricity prices, and industrial workers’ strikes in Rangoon, all of which have threatened the government’s standing in recent months. The conflict also puts Aung San Suu Kyi in an awkward position, forcing her to choose between the morally unassailable but politically unpalatable high ground (since defending the Rohingya likely entails losing a large number of votes), or a more populist stand that yields to widespread bigotry. In the event, she has chosen to split the difference, speaking vaguely of a need to reform Burma’s citizenship law as a way of resolving the conflict.

Currently leading the anti-Rohingya charge is the Rakhine [Arakan] Nationalities Development Party, which came in second in the province in the last general election of November 2010. They released a statement last week warning that the population of the Rohingya — whom they label ""Bengali immigrants"" — has reached ""very alarming"" levels, and called for swift action to segregate them from Arakanese and eventually resettle them overseas. Party Head Dr. Aye Maung, who had welcomed Suu Kyi’s win in parliamentary by-elections in April ""as a great chance for all of us to change Burma to a democratic country,"" recently called for Burma ""to be like Israel"" — apparently a reference to the oppressive controls placed on Palestinians to ‘protect’ Israelis. He urged civilians to work with the government to craft a policy to ""defend this region"" against the Rohingya, who ""will be repeatedly trespassing on our territory.""

Aye Maung is not alone. Religious figures and veterans of the pro-democracy movement have played a firm hand in stirring tensions, using language reminiscent of that which accompanied the Nazi pogroms. Ko Ko Gyi, a dissident who spent years behind bars for his leading role in the 1988 student uprising against military rule, has referred to the Rohingya as terrorists, and asserted that they are not an ethnic Burmese group but rather ""[infringe] on our sovereignty."" Such comments provide succor to the likes of Htay Oo, the powerful agriculture minister and a leading political hardliner. He has mooted the re-launch of Operation Dragon King, which was deployed under the guise of an anti-mujahideen campaign in the late 1970s to round up, arrest, and torture thousands of Rohingya, eventually forcing more than 200,000 into Bangladesh.

Playing the ""terrorism"" card conveniently separates the Rohingya, whose armed struggle ended a decade ago, from the ethnic ""freedom fighters"" elsewhere in the country. Few have asked how this distinction was reached, although unsubstantiated claims that Rohingya had been recruited by Al Qaeda gathered steam in the wake of 9/11, helping to cast the group as a malevolent force without needing to showcase evidence.

So what explains this apparent breakdown in the moral logic of Burma’s internationally vaunted opposition force? There may be an issue with our perceptions of the pro-democracy movement. We have to ask ourselves whether we may have over-romanticized its battles against the junta as a broader quest to bring pure, universal human rights to Burma, when in fact we had little evidence of a wholesale commitment to the principle of tolerance. ""Once the Burmese opposition no longer was confined to simply opposing (saying the right things), and actually had to suggest policies, what occurred was a sort of ‘return of the real,’"" Elliott Prasse-Freeman, of Harvard’s Carr Center for Human Rights, wrote in an email. ""It became clear that ‘Human Rights’ were just demands against power, and they didn’t mean anything in terms of the kind of politics the opposition actually stood for.""

What does the opposition then stand for? The picture has become somewhat clouded. To be sure, it is not the entire opposition that has taken this stance — though many of its members, including Aung San Suu Kyi herself, have assumed positions of ambivalence about whether the Rohingya should be granted equal rights.

But for those wanting heavy-handed treatment of the Rohingya, the traditional notions of equality and universal human rights have already been discarded, and replaced by a demagogic brand of democracy contaminated by xenophobia. This fear of ""the other"" within Burmese society, a fear that has reared its head sporadically in the anti-Chinese and anti-Indian riots of the past century, has largely been overlooked in black-and-white depictions of the past 50 years as a struggle between military and civilian forces.

At the far end of the spectrum, many so-called democrats have moved to vilify an entire minority group, employ apartheid-like segregationist measures, and forge reactionary ties with their traditional enemy, the Burmese military. This stance presumes that the Rohingya are a threat to the entire country without really explaining why. In fact, most Rohingya are essentially held in an open prison in northern Arakan state, subject to a system of travel permits that tightly controls their movements, and which leaves them little opportunity to mobilize should they have any intention of doing so. But such considerations appear to matter little.

It seems that the Burmese have combined a longstanding fear of outsiders — aided by decades of isolation — with an internalization of the regime’s propaganda, which casts the Rohingya as jihadists, uncivilized, proselytizing, and of detestable appearance. In a now-infamous letter to heads of foreign missions in Hong Kong, Burma’s former consul-general, Ye Myint Aung, described the minority group as ""ugly as ogres"" in comparison with the ""fair and soft"" complexion of the Burman majority.

Their statehood will always be debated. Opponents of the minority cite the 1960s as the date of their arrival in Burma, while Rohingya leaders claim a millennia-old lineage dating from the time Muslim traders arrived in Arakan. This discussion, however, is somewhat extraneous to the key issue, which is why they should have earned such brutal treatment by both the government and civil society. Even if one accepts the argument that the Rohingya are comparatively recent migrants, this hardly justifies subjecting them to the same sort of persecution that the ""democrats"" have been resisting for years when it was imposed on them by the government.

There are clear double standards at play here. Rohingya are not accorded the same rights as others living in Burma, including the country’s Chinese population, most of whom came more recently (even if one accepts the most conservative estimates for the Rohingya’s arrival), and whose population dwarfs the Rohingya in size. Is this Muslim minority more of a ""threat"" than the Chinese immigrants? We can’t answer until someone can properly articulate what this ""threat"" actually consists of. Groups like the UK-based Burma Democratic Concern, however, have resorted to wild fear-mongering, alleging that the Rohingya have massacred ""tens of thousands of Burmese Buddhist Arakanese in the past,"" while others argue that Burma cannot support a ""refugee"" population.

Burma’s first dictator, Ne Win, engineered citizenship laws to justify the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya — a policy he proposed in the wake of the mass expulsion of Indians in the 1960s and a ban on Muslims joining the army and government. This was an ideological crusade led by a notorious xenophobe who orchestrated Burma’s retreat into isolation and economic ruin. That the pro-democracy forces now call for similar measures against the Rohingya has merely helped to rekindle his legacy.

These are sobering times indeed. Burma’s opposition movement has won international admiration for its stoicism, and rightly so: After all, thousands have died or endured long prison terms in order to bring about a transition to democracy. The prospect of this delicate process being unraveled by the hypocrisy of those who fought for it is deeply saddening.","Thu, 05 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/rohingyaracism1463749258.jpg?w=625,"['thousands', 'military', 'ethnic', 'burmese', 'rohingya', 'burmas', 'opposition', 'righteous', 'group', 'rights', 'misled', 'burma']",

13,13,FL-2012-000106-BGD,Library auditorium turns wedding hall - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/library-auditorium-turns-wedding-hall/article3592195.ece,"Officials term marriage ‘cultural programme’ to allow such functions at Anna Centenary Library

On Sunday evening, the path leading to the auditorium at Anna Centenary Library in Kotturpuram was decked with festive lilac satin ribbons and visitors were greeted by a band of traditional musicians. The occasion — a wedding reception.

The auditorium, considered one of the finest in the city, was also the chosen venue when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed a huge gathering in the city last July.

However, conduct of wedding receptions, with caterers taking up space under a shamiana for cooking and serving, have raised questions about maintenance of the auditorium.

According to a Government Order issued by the Tamil Development, Religious Endowments and Information Department on August 30, 2011, the auditorium can be let out for government functions, university convocations, school annual days, cultural programmes, music programmes, business conferences (state and national), embassy meetings, general body meetings of multi-national companies, lectures by eminent scholars, and other functions permitted by the government.

On how a wedding qualified under these categories, the official said that though it was a private function, it could be considered a cultural programme. “Permission was given only for the reception and not the wedding which would involve conducting pujas and lighting the ceremonial fire. And the programme began only late in the evening, so that it did not disturb those using the library,” he said.

According to him, only three to four functions are held in the auditorium every month, as not many can afford it — Rs. 2 lakh a day. As per the GO, the rental charge for a day is Rs. 1 lakh, the airconditioner charge is Rs. 30,000, electricity costs Rs. 25,000 per day, sound system comes at Rs. 25,000, conservancy charge is Rs. 10,000, and internet and LCD costs Rs. 10,000 — totalling Rs. 2 lakh.

While the official maintained that cooking was not allowed on the premises and only heating of food purchased from outside was permitted, on Sunday, cooks were seen preparing cutlets and dosas on huge pans, as their assistants sat nearby cutting vegetables.

When this was pointed out, the official said that events of such a scale were a rarity and that maintenance was done systematically.

About the torn curtain screen inside the auditorium and the broken glass door at the entrance, he said that both were being repaired and the glass would be replaced by Thursday.

Earlier, bookings for the auditorium were made through the Department of Public Libraries, but now, they are handled by the Tamil Development, Religious Endowments and Information Department.

Parking, a hassle

Though regular users of the library say that the sound from the music bands or the programmes did not disturb them, finding parking space is a bit of hassle when big functions take place at the auditorium.

“We cannot hear the music inside the library but the parking lots are mostly full. When I saw so many cars parked, I wondered if so many people had come to the library, only to find that there was a programme being held at the auditorium,” said a C.A. aspirant who uses the library regularly.

Though both the auditorium and the library have allocated parking space, some staff members allege that the spill-over from the auditorium programme is usually directed to the library’s parking space.

In November 2011, the state government announced that the library would be converted into a super-specialty paediatric hospital. The issue is pending in the court.","Mon, 02 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12578891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH-AUDI2,"['state', 'parking', 'hall', 'turns', 'functions', 'library', 'space', 'wedding', 'programmes', 'auditorium', 'rs', 'programme']", 
14,14,FL-2012-000106-BGD,Colorado Fire Threatens Thousands of Residences - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2012/06/28/253645.htm,"The Waldo Canyon Wildfire in Colorado in the state’s second most populous city has reportedly destroyed hundreds of homes – and that number may get much higher.

The fire, which forced the evacuation of more than 32,000 people, has consumed 18,500 acres and is only 5 percent contained.

According to officials roughly 20,000 residences and 160 commercial structures are threatened.

Based on the rapid growth of the fire perimeters and the amount of unburned fuel in those areas shown by recent infrared aerial photography, there could be many more than a few hundred homes eventually destroyed by the fire, according to an executive at Boston, Mass.-based risk analysis firm RiskMeter Online.

“There’s a lot of houses in harm’s way,” said Dan Munson, RiskMeter’s founder. “My gut says they’re going to lose a lot of houses in this. I could be wrong; I’m hoping I’m wrong.”

The wildfire is Colorado’s second major burn. The High Park Fire, considered the state’s second largest and its most destructive to date, has burned 87,284 acres and destroyed 257 homes. The fire, which was caused by a lighting strike, is 75 percent contained. The cost of the fire to date is $33.1 million. Gov. John Hickenlooper has authorized roughly $25 million in emergency funds for the fire.

But Munson says that based on the Waldo Canyon Fire’s growth and the number of residences being threatened, the damages could exceed the High Park Fire.

“This one I think is going to be even bigger than that,” he said.

Munson said that while tools like RiskMeter’s have been available for some time, underwriters have been reluctant to establish any rigorous rules about insuring homes so close to unburned fuel – especially in a state like Colorado, where people seek out lifestyles so close to nature.

“In Colorado with the whole wild land-urban interface, you’d knock out a lot of the opportunity in the market if you have a very conservative tool,” he said.

However, with the High Park Fire and Waldo Canyon Fire in recent memory, those attitudes may change, he added.

“With these big losses facing the industry in Colorado, I think you’ll see that changing,” said Munson, who noted that insurance professionals can gain access to a burn map and a list of ZIP codes that have been burning or may burn based upon the company’s current model by emailing Paul Ptashnick at pptashnick@cdsys.com.

In addition to high winds, continued hot weather and low relative humidity, along with massive amounts of unburned fuel, have contributed to increase fire dangers in Colorado. The Waldo Canyon Fire has the state faced with what could become one of the worst fires to hit the American West in decades.

However, the Associated Press reported the weather forecast offered some optimism for firefighters to make progress with the temperature expected to reach into the mid-80s and humidity at between 15 to 20 percent, which was about 5 points higher than Wednesday and much higher than the single digits the area had seen last week. Winds were forecast to be 10 to 15 mph.

No estimates on insured losses have been made available. Several communities have been under siege by the fire, as has landmarks like Pikes Peak, and more than 120 soldiers helped stop flames advancing on the U.S. Air Force Academy, the AP reported.

Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley announced the settlement on Tuesday.



Under the terms of the settlements, filed in Suffolk Superior Court Monday, Massachusetts cities and towns will receive $207,000 from Walmart and $25,000 from Target.



The payments include double damages for violations of the state’s False Claims Act as well as restitution for alleged overcharges. The terms also require the chains to put procedures in place to guard against future overcharges.



Cities and towns affected by the allegations against Walmart and Target include Amherst, Boston, Concord, Everett, Fall River, Framingham, Hingham, Lowell, Plymouth, Springfield and Worcester.

The settlements with Walmart and Target follow actions by the attorney general’s office against major pharmacy chains CVS, Rite-Aid, and Walgreens, which Coakley alleged also overcharged towns and cities for drugs under the workers’ comp system. The attorney general’s office has also obtained recoveries from both Shaw’s Supermarkets and Stop & Shop regarding their workers’ comp municipal prescription businesses.

The investigation of prescription overcharges to municipalities under the workers’ comp system is ongoing. Combining the major pharmacy chain cases and the settlements with lower-volume alternative retailers, investigations have recovered over $8 million thus far, according to the attorney general’s office.

“Cities and towns are under a great deal of economic pressure to provide much needed services to their residents,” Coakley said. “We are proud of our work to get money back for cities and towns and to prevent such overcharges from happening in the future.”

After years of trying to get Ukrainian citizenship, the man pictured here has given up hope but his partner is determined to find a way to regularise his status so that he can live the rest of his life in peace and avoid deportation. “I’ve lost all hope to get my passport. My only problem is that I cannot move because I cannot go beyond this town. Even in this region I can be arrested. I’m always concerned that I will be arrested and detained somewhere and that would cause me problems to find my way back home here. That’s why I almost never leave my house.”

IT IS ESTIMATED that about 12 million people across the world are in a similar situation to the man pictured because they do not have a nationality. This little-publicised state of statelessness is being highlighted by the Irish office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees this month.

Through his exhibition, ‘Nowhere People. The World’s Stateless’ (beginning today at The Atrium in the Department of Justice and Equality at St Stephen’s Green), photographer Greg Constantine shows that despite perceptions, nationality is not a universal birthright.

Stateless people have no legal identity, are citizens of no country and are some of the most vulnerable and invisible people in the world

People without a formal nationality are often unable to obtain identity documents and can be detained because of their statelessness. Access to education and health services, as well as employment can also be greatly limited.

Parents are not able to register the birth of their children, own property or travel freely. According to the UNHCR, statelessness often leaves a person without a sense of identity and with little or no voice. “Nowhere People serves as a reminder of why it is so urgent to resolve this global problem,” the Irish office says.

Making someone extremely vulnerable, statelessness occurs for a number of reasons. Discrimination against minority groups in nationality legislations, failure to include all residents in the body of citizens when a state becomes independent and conflicts of laws between states have all been factors for those who do not possess a nationality.

A well-known photographer in the US, Constantine decided to move to Asia in 2005 to document the plight of stateless people around the world. Sine then, his work has received a number of awards and has been published in a number of countries.

He has also released a book Exiled to Nowhere: Burma’s Rohingya which tells the stories of some of the world’s most oppressed and forgotten people, providing evidence of their courage – whatever the ground beneath their feet.

The UNHCR has a mandate to work with governments to prevent statelessness and to resolve those cases that already exist. This can be achieved through simple, low-cost actions, say staff. The global agency also works to protect the rights of stateless people and helps them to acquire nationality and documentation.

Among the groups featured in this month’s exhibition are the minority Rohingya from Western Myanmar. With a long history of statelessness and displacement, they have been among the thousands affected by recent violence in Rakhine State. More than 80 Rohingya refugees came to Ireland in 2009 as part of the Government’s resettlement programme.

“Still we don’t have nationality, we don’t have any right to call any land our home,” explains one refugee who is currently living in Bangladesh. “We can’t live in peace. People view us as if we don’t exist.”

The Dublin exhibition is free of charge and open to the public Monday to Friday from 9am to 6.30pm. The images of the world’s most vulnerable and forgotten people, like the one below, are also part of the PhotoIreland Festival from 5 to 19 July.

A stateless woman, pictured by Constantine in eastern Ukraine, holds her expired Soviet passport. She has been trying to receive Ukrainian citizenship for more than 10 years. Meanwhile, she does not get a pension despite working for more than 30 years.

PAKISTAN: A Hindu girl was forced to convert to Islam and is now missing – the judge and police have sided with the perpetrators

Dear friends,

The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has received information that a 14-year-old girl, from the Hindu religious minority community was abducted by gangsters and forcibly converted to Islam. When a police case was filed against the abductors the girl was produced before a Magistrate’s Court by the gangsters to record a statement that she has embraced Islam as her religion. The irony of the judicial process is that the judicial magistrate has accepted her subsequent marriage as legal in spite of the Pakistan law which does not allow the marriage of girls before the age of 16 years. Her age was forged from 14 to 18 by the police and perpetrators before the judicial magistrate who had never asked for evidence about her age.

The father of the victim received information from the police that girl has been shifted to the tribal areas of the Pakistan, close to Afghanistan border for nefarious designs.

The police took five days to file the First Information Report (FIR) providing good time to the perpetrators to manage a forced marriage. The three young sisters, their mother and one brother of the victim were terminated from the employment from the same factory where their sister was employed because the parents of the victim had mentioned the registration number of the car of the factory in which their daughter was abducted.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Rekha alias Pubi (14) was working at a factory for the manufacturing of bottles for beverages at Gadap Karachi, Sindh province. She was abducted by a driver, Mr. Ahmed Nawaz son of Mohib Ali, and factory supervisor, Mr. Asghar Din son of Khadin Shah, in the official vehicle of the factory at 5.30 PM when she was going back to her home with her three sisters and mother. Her father, Mr. Soda, use to pick and drop their family members, three sisters and her mother, from the factory. On the day of the incident, after dropping his two sisters by his motor bike at their house he returned to the factory and was told that Rekha has been forcibly abducted by the driver and supervisor in the factory’s vehicle to unknown place.

The brother, father and mother immediately rushed to the Gadap city police station, Karachi, to file the case of abduction of Rekha. The police refused to entertain the complaint and told them not to worry as she will be returned and the police will take action the next day. When the father and brother insisted that police should follow them as they would not be far from the factory, the police asked for money for fuel for using police van which was not possible from the poor family as they were from the Hindu minority group, the Kohli-Dalit and they have migrated from a remote area of Sindh province, the Mirpur Khas, where they were facing the problems after the recent flood.

The police took five days to file the First Information Report (FIR). The perpetrators and the owner after knowing that on November 5, 2011, the family of the victim successfully filed the FIR they quickly approached a judicial magistrate of Malir city, Mr. Naweed Asghar and took some workers from the nearby Madressa, the Muslim seminary and asked the court to accept the court marriage as Miss Rekha has embraced Islam and has changed her name from Rekha to Aasia. The judge never asked the girl if they did so of her own free will and approved the marriage. Her age was mentioned during the process as 18 because the magistrate told them that Pakistan law does not allow marriage of minors. At this moment the mother and other family member reached the court after knowing that she has been produced before the court but the magistrate did not allow them to meet Rekha. The workers from the seminary have also used force to push the girl into the van which was waiting outside the court. The lawyer from the perpetrators, Mr. Naeem Khan threatened before the magistrate that if they created problems over the change of religion then their two sisters will also face the same situation. The judge just ignored the threats.

Since November 5, 2011 her whereabouts are unknown. On the other hand the owner of the factory has terminated the employment of her brother, mother and three other sisters, who are minors, for mentioning the registration number of the car of the factory, saying that the vicitm’s family is destroying the honour of the factory.

It is also informed by the father of the girl that they have been told by seminary people that the girl has been shifted to a tribal area of Pakistan close to Afghanistan border. He apprehends that like other Hindu girls she would have been sold for nefarious designs.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This a common factor in the Sindh province that girls from the religious minority groups particularly from Dalit community of the Hindu, are abducted, raped and then sold for prostitutions. The Muslim Madressas along the borders with India are busy in this business and Sindh government though claims that it is in favour of minority rights never acted to stop such activities of the Muslim fundamentalists groups in its appeasement policies.

Every month in the Sindh province it is reported that more than 200 girls are forced to marry after their abduction and when perpetrators are caught or police reports are filed they use the fictitious marriage certificates from Muslim seminaries and courts have to follow them. Even the Chief Justice of Supreme Court has not taken the consent from the three Hindu girls when they were presented before the court and ordered the registrar to take their statement who recorded their statements before the police and so called husbands. Then on Friday prayers the chief justice has congratulated a perpetrator, the so called husband of one Hindu girl for converting the girl to Islam, the photo of the incident was published next day in many newspapers.



SUGGESTED ACTION:

Please write the letters to the given authorities calling them to safe recovery of Rekha and arrest of the perpetrators including the Naveed Asghar, judicial magistrate of the Malir city courts. Please urge them to take actions against those Muslim seminaries who are instrumental in the forcibly conversion to Islam of the girls from the religious minority groups and helping the criminals in the name of Islam. Please also urge them to prosecute the station house officers of the Gadap police station Karachi for his negligence from the official duty and helping the perpetrators for kidnapping and rape of Rekha.

The AHRC writes a separate letter to the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief calling for his intervention into this matter.

Grief-stricken: Miss Baker posted a series of heartbreaking Tweets (above) on the day her boyfriend died An inquest has been opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court - with Dr Shirley Radcliffe saying 'extensive investigations' were continuing. It emerged last night that Rory Hamilton-Brown, the Surrey captain who today helped carry Mr Maynard's coffin into church, is to take an indefinite break from cricket after struggling to cope with the death of his close friend. The 24-year-old, who shared a house with Mr Maynard, will distance himself from the sport as he tries to come to terms with the tragedy. Following the death, Surrey immediately told its players they did not have to play on if they felt they could not. After initially returning to action against Hampshire on Sunday, Mr Hamilton-Brown has decided he now needs to withdraw from the game. He said: ‘I am grateful to the club for their support and understanding of my decision. I look forward to returning to the game when I hope I can continue my form of recent seasons.’ Jade Dernbach and Stuart Meaker were this week released from the England squad on compassionate grounds ahead of today’s one-day international against Australia at Edgbaston and both attended the funeral along with the whole of the Surrey squad.

CCTV footage shows a police car in the search for the Surrey cricketer minutes before he was found dead on a London train line

Cordoned off: The black Mercedes belonging to Maynard was left just a few streets from where he died Detectives probing Mr Maynard's death, which took place while he was fleeing police, want to find out what happened during 50 minutes when officers lost him. The sportsman was suspected of drink-driving after police spotted his Mercedes C250 coupe swerving across the road near Wimbledon Park underground station just after 4am on June 18.

Mr Maynard, who was believed to have been heading to his girlfriend Miss Baker's home, was then chased by a police car.

But after getting out of the car and running away on foot, officers and their sniffer dogs lost the talented cricketer.

Fifty minutes later Mr Maynard stepped on a high-voltage rail before being struck by the first Tube train of the day at Wimbledon Park.

The police watchdog, which routinely investigates any potential wrongdoing by officers when a suspect dies, were notified about the incident the same day.

The following day they referred the case back to Scotland Yard and asked them to examine what happened during the ‘lost’ 50 minutes because it may shed light on why Mr Maynard died.



The IPCC said it has assessed the incident, and referred it back to Scotland Yard because the pursuing officers had lost sight of Mr Maynard and had no further contact with him before his death.



About 50 minutes passed between the start of the police chase and Mr Maynard being hit by the train.

After leaving his car the cricketer ran off on foot, leaving his BlackBerry and other personal items behind.

Worshippers at a nearby mosque said the two officers did not give chase, but radioed details of the incident to their control room. Colleagues arrived with sniffer dogs and began searching gardens.



Shortly after 5am, the driver of a District line Tube train saw a body lying across the tracks a short distance from the station.","Wed, 04 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/04/article-2168622-13EC4608000005DC-309_1024x615_large.jpg,"['england', 'left', 'turn', 'funeral', 'train', 'wimbledon', 'tom', 'stars', 'pay', 'mr', 'surrey', 'cricket', 'maynards', 'maynard', 'respects']",

Earlier, Express News had reported that the Punjab government had dismissed the doctors who were on strike, which are around 6,000 in number among a total of more than 15,000 in the province. However, reports emerged later clarifying that the Punjab government, in a meeting with senior doctors, has stressed on an end to the strike and that no doctors were dismissed.



The senior doctors also urged Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to give them 24-hours time to end the strike.



Meanwhile, the YDA Punjab threatened to withdraw it services at indoors if the government decided to open outpatient departments (OPDs) by any means.



This was decided after YDA Punjab held a seminar and a meeting of its General Council to discuss its future strategy.



“YDA condemns Punjab government’s maligning and coward tactics to deprive doctors of their rights through force and decides unanimously to confront any kind of evil move to oppress any doctor in the province. If government tried to open the OPDs by any means, we shall withdraw services from indoors straightaway and go further,” said YDA General Council member Dr Mudassir Razaq Khan.



The YDA Punjab held a protest at the Mayo Hospital on Friday, shouting slogans against the government and vowing to continue their “struggle” until their demand for a service structure was met. The Punjab Medical Association (PMA) has also been holding protests in the province.","Sat, 30 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/401559-doctor-1341052599.jpg,"['public', 'continues', 'withdraw', 'punjab', 'strike', 'services', 'senior', 'yda', 'army', 'called', 'help', 'request', 'province', 'doctors']",
