by Mahmoud Fouly, Abdel-Meguid Kamal

CAIRO, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Nile River flooding poses no serious threat to Egypt despite the damage and casualties it caused to fellow downstream Nile basin country Sudan, said an Egyptian official.

""The flooding situation in Egypt is different and the society here will not be seriously affected as it happened in other Nile basin states,"" Mohamed al-Sebai, spokesman of the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, told Xinhua.

The ministry's monitoring and forecasting center said that the Nile flooding is rather useful to Egypt this year, since there is an opportunity to use quantities of the flood water to refresh and improve the quality of the Nile water as well as reduce its pollution and the amount of ammonia in Egypt's Nile delta Rosetta branch, the spokesman added.

The Nile River is the main source of fresh water in Egypt, providing the country with 55.5 billion cubic meters of water annually.

Sebai pointed out that the flooding will continue in Egypt until the end of October, in light of the continuous rainfalls in upstream Nile basin countries.

The ministry has recently announced that the Nile flooding this year is ""high and likely to continue increasing,"" while the government assigned the ministry to set up an ""emergency plan.""

Egypt has 13 riparian provinces along the Nile River that would be first affected by the flooding, located between Aswan in the south and Damietta in the north.

The biggest issue about these provinces is their encroachments in the course of the Nile, whether through construction or plantation on adjacent lands, making them the most vulnerable.

The encroachments lead to bottlenecks in the course of the river, and thus the incoming amount of water cannot be absorbed.

However, the water ministry's spokesman told Xinhua that ""any possible damage will be limited in the Nile islands and riparian lands of the river, which are considered an integral part of the river's course itself.""

Experts expect the Nile water level in Egypt to rise by about 120 centimeters, overwhelming the lowlands including islands and riparian buildings and crops.

Abbas Sharaqi, a professor of water resources at Cairo University, emphasized that the current flooding is not the most violent in the history of Egypt compared with those occurred in 1999 and 2000.

""But the difference is that Nasser Lake, the reservoir of Egypt's Aswan High Dam, has been filled early this year during the current flooding,"" said the Egyptian professor, attributing the current rise of the Nile water level in Egypt to the increasing water flow coming from the Ethiopian high central plateau.

Although Egypt and Sudan are the two downstream Nile basin states, this year's flooding caused deadly damage in Sudan while Egypt is likely to pass it safely, mainly due to its giant High Dam that helps contain a large quantity of the flooding water.

""Sudan was exposed to a greater flooding that submerged some states due to the heavy rains there amid increasing water flow coming from upstream Ethiopia,"" Sharaqi told Xinhua.

He explained that the capabilities of Sudanese dams are limited that they cannot reserve large quantities of water.

The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation has other ways to deal with such a flooding, as it can resort to using the Edfina Barrage on the Rosetta branch of the Nile, which releases excess water to the Mediterranean Sea, or other northern barrages in case of continuing water flow.

""The situation is under the control of the ministry, because it can increase or decrease the Nile water level, which is still at a safe level, or increase the amount of water discharged into the sea when necessary,"" said the Egyptian professor.

BEIRUT: Calls for Syrians in Lebanon to return to their country have become a deeply divisive politicized issue over the decade-long civil war in Syria, one which has recently been exacerbated by the upcoming election in Syria.



On Thursday, groups of angry Lebanese beat up Syrian expatriates and refugees heading to the Syrian embassy to cast their votes for next Wednesday's election, and threw stones at their vehicles, outraged over what they perceive as an organized vote for Assad. There have been rumors that Hezbollah organized transport for voters from across Lebanon to the embassy.



Assad is running for a fourth term, facing symbolic competition from two other candidates in a vote that is all but guaranteed to see him continue as president.



The Syrian opposition — as well as many Western and Arab countries — see the election as a sham designed to give Assad’s reign a veneer of legitimacy. The election also violates UN resolutions that call for a new constitution before a presidential vote.



Lebanon hosts 865,531 registered Syrian refugees, and there are several hundred thousand Syrians residing in Lebanon with their families as daily or seasonal workers.



Syrians in Lebanon include regime supporters and opposition figures who fled to Lebanon because of the war. Lebanon is in the midst of a severe economic crisis and is calling for Syrian refugees to return to their country because of the high cost of hosting them.



The roads leading to the embassy area in Yarzeh were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Assad and the regime army, waving Syrian flags and carrying pictures of Assad. They confirmed to the media before and after the polls that they had voted for Assad.



Many Lebanese people reacted angrily to this. Members of the Lebanese Forces party went to the coastal highway that connects northern Lebanon with Beirut, and blocked cars carrying pictures of Assad, or Syrian flags, or banners for the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) — an ally of the Syrian regime, smashed car windows, and assaulted their occupants.

FAST FACT The roads leading to the Syrian Embassy area in Lebanon were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Bashar Assad.

They told the media: “They are loyal to Assad, so why are they still in Lebanon as refugees?”



Members of the Lebanese Forces party also said that Assad-supporting Syrians should have their refugee status removed.



Similar scenes took place in Beirut’s Ashrafieh neighborhood, where young Lebanese men chased a car displaying the Syrian flag. The Lebanese army intervened to separate the two sides.



Fifty-four-year-old Mohsen Saleh Al-Ahmad died while traveling by bus from Chtaura, Bekaa, to the embassy. According to official preliminary investigations, he had a heart attack.



Since Thursday morning’s events, the army has tightened security in and around the Syrian Embassy, which is located in the vicinity of the Ministry of Defense and the Army Command, and on the roads leading to it.



But further clashes broke out in the afternoon, this time instigated by Syrians, who reportedly got off the buses transporting them along the coastal road near Nahr Al-Kalb and proceeded to assault passers-by and throw stones at cars, injuring several people, including journalists from MTV.



Some Lebanese politicians were quick to condemn the actions of pro-Assad Syrian voters.



Former minister May Chidiac said: “They claim to be displaced and are calling on the international community to support them with fresh dollars while they are an additional burden on Lebanon’s overstretched economy! At the doors of the Syrian embassy, ​​they are chanting for Bashar Assad. As long as you are not threatened, go back to where you came from.”



Another former minister, Richard Kouyoumdjian, said: “Swear allegiance to Bashar Assad in your country, not in ours. You are opportunists and you are not displaced.”



But former Hezbollah MP Nawar Al-Sahili described attacks on Syrian voters as demonstrating “racism and a lack of integrity.”



Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Abdul Karim Ali said those attacks were “painful, and we refer (them) to the concerned authorities” and called on Lebanon “to cooperate to find quick exits for the return of the Syrians to their country.”



The Syrian diplomat said that the large number of voters “reflects the desire of Syrian people to return to a safety that they have not found outside Syria.”



Lisa Abu Khaled, spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Arab News: “The UNHCR has received reports of incidents involving pressure, threats, and harassment affecting Syrian refugees in Lebanon and in relation to the Syrian presidential elections. The reported incidents range from confiscation of documents to threats of physical harm.”



She added: “Voting is a personal choice and is not linked to refugee status, nor to a person’s need for international protection. Voting will not lead to the loss of refugee status. The UNHCR has received reports of intimidation and pressure, which may have pushed a number of refugees to participate in the elections.



“The UNHCR is a non-political humanitarian organization, and therefore does not play any role in the Syrian elections,” she continued. “That said, if and when incidents of threats and pressure are reported by refugees, we work with the concerned stakeholders in Lebanon to ensure that refugees continue to be protected in Lebanon.”



Not all Syrian refugees in Lebanon exercised their right to vote. Abu Ahmad, a camp supervisor in a refugee camp in Arsal, told Arab News: “Most people are not interested. There may be some who voted at the embassy, ​​but they do not (symbolize) a collective conviction. Refugees are frustrated and cannot forget their suffering and the horrors they experienced during their displacement.



“What has changed now? How can Assad be re-elected? On what basis? People were hoping for some change to happen, but what is happening is the polishing of the image of Bashar Assad in front of the international community,” he continued. “Maintaining my strength today is more beneficial than wasting my time in front of the ballot box. Here, I feel safe even though I am homeless.”



Caretaker Social Affairs and Tourism Minister Ramzi Musharrafieh, who visited Syria a few weeks ago and discussed the return of refugees, denounced “all the infringements that have occurred and are unjustified,” and said that “protecting (Syrian voters) is our priority.”



Former MP Khaled Al-Daher, who has been a major advocate for Syrian refugees in Lebanon in the past, said on Thursday: “Anyone who wants to elect Bashar Assad from among the refugees in Lebanon will not have refugee status and must leave the Lebanese territories because they have no problem with the Syrian regime, but are in Lebanon for specific goals and objectives.”","Sun, 13 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2020/09/13/2269191-641817887.jpg,"['floods', 'lebanon', 'egypt', 'alert', 'refugee', 'high', 'syrians', 'sudan', 'lebanese', 'embassy', 'voters', 'assad', 'return', 'refugees', 'following', 'syrian']",

Thunderstorms packing heavy rains and lightning have caused widespread flooding across Egypt, killing at least five people and injuring five others, officials have said, as authorities shuttered schools, government offices and an airport.

Thursday was declared a paid holiday to keep streets clear, closing schools and government offices, with officials urging people to stay at home and not to park near trees or in low-lying areas that would be at risk of flooding.

A driver died when strong winds blew his car into a canal in the southern province of Sohag, and a technician was electrocuted in New Valley province while trying to repair a lighting column that had lost power due to the heavy rain.

A child and five people were wounded when floods demolished their houses in a rural area in the southern province of Qena. Lightning also ignited several fires.

A state of emergency began on Wednesday as a powerful storm developed over the Mediterranean Sea, prompting authorities to issue warnings to residents.

On Thursday, authorities closed down the Luxor International Airport, a key hub for tourists, as well as the Mediterranean port of Alexandria and the Red Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh.

The city of Ismailia, situated on the west bank of the Suez Canal, recorded 25 millimetres of rain in 24 hours. Mersa Matruh, a resort town on the country’s Mediterranean coast, reported 20mm.

Despite such relatively small rainfall totals, many parts of the capital, Cairo, were underwater.

Chaos generally accompanies bad weather in Egypt, raising questions about the country’s poor infrastructure and dilapidated sewage and drainage systems.

Late on Thursday, Cairo’s Water Authority announced it had suspended water service to the entire city because heavy rain had overwhelmed the vast sewage system. It said water would return when the weather improved, without offering an exact time.

Mahmoud Shahin, director of the analysis department at the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, said: “This level of instability in weather conditions has not occurred with such force since 1994.”

Egypt has no comprehensive rainwater drainage system and relies on a 105-year-old drainage network to siphon rainwater.

In an earlier statement on the floods that brought Cairo to a standstill last October, the cabinet said that Egyptian cities were built without rainwater drainage networks.","Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/e97a1b6583e244ccb661817c73f44194_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['mediterranean', 'heavy', 'storms', 'killing', 'floods', 'egypt', 'water', 'weather', 'authorities', 'bring', 'widespread', 'system', 'drainage', 'southern', 'rain', 'province']",

The initial indicators were based on the incoming Revenue during August; however, it is still too early to make a final judgment on the type and size of this year’s flood, pending the months of September and October; the Committee said.

According to an official statement issued by the Ministry of Irrigation, the River Revenue Regulatory Committee reviewed the position of the Nile flood, and the measures taken by the Nile Water Affairs Sector and the Ministry's Planning Sector Forecasting Center, including monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the flood situation, and the quantities of water expected to arrive until the end of the current water year 2021-2022.

Moreover, the country depends on a 105-year-old drainage network and has no comprehensive rainfall drainage system2The bad weather wave that has hit the country, causing heavy losses, but the biggest loss was the death of at least 20 people, including children, houses collapse and electrical transistors explode3. People lost their lives and at least six children died, either from electrocution or rubble after heavy rains knocked down their houses4. In addition, 20 people were seriously injured while trying to escape of the enormously strong gush of the downpours. Here, lightning also ignited several fires. A technician was also said to have been electrocuted while trying to fix a lightning column that went off due to the rain in the Western New Valley province, local authorities said.

Another driver died when storm winds blew his car into a water canal in the southern province of Sohag. meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have also closed down the Luxor International airport, as well as the Mediterranean port of Alexandria and the Red Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh.

Electrical transistors exploded and many homes were left with no electricity, and one 60-year-old man was electrocuted as he walked down the street in Menoufia and a woman appeared to have drowned in Heliopolis.

The country’s railway authorities suspended train service nationwide, citing the bad weather. The announcement came shortly after two Cairo-bound trains collided near their final destination, injuring 13 people, according to health officials.

The official figures reported by the MoSS on the number of people affected by the floods in the country estimates 20,000 people (4,000 families). BLESS field workers acknowledged that hundred people have been gravely affected, losing houses, lacking of medical attention, and material goods. Moreover, the flood has caused almost-radical sweeping of vast areas of agricultural land which means that too many farmers have lost their source of income.","Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1523502-RRF03-Floods-Emergency-in-Egypt.png?itok=V2guCGPz,"['floods', 'egypt', 'country', 'transistors', 'trying', 'rapid', 'sohag', 'valley', 'authorities', 'province', 'port', 'rainfall', 'rrf032020', 'act', 'fund', 'emergency', 'weather', 'alliance', 'response']",

The River Nile has crested to its highest level in one hundred years. At least 103 people have been killed by drowning, houses collapsing and road accidents caused by the flooding.

Now, thousands of Sudanese families are sleeping in the outdoors, waiting for shelter, food and medicine.

40-year-old widow Aisha Adam is one of them.

Adam says she is sleeping in the street after the river suddenly destroyed her house in Northern Khartoum; she says she is looking after her sister and five children, and waiting for shelter and aid.

The Sudanese government has made an urgent call for organizations and civil society to provide assistance. U.N. agencies started efforts this week to supply medicine, tents and safe drinking water.

This is Tinago Chikoto, deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan.

He says help is definitely required from the government and their partners in the U.N. and NGOs besides civil society. The urgent needs are for plastic sheets, tents, health supplies and the provision of safe drinking water.

Egyptian authorities are on alert for the upcoming flood season, which will start soon, said Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati.

Abdel Ati met on Sunday with the permanent Committee for Regulating the Revenue of the Nile River and urged the need to continuously follow up on possible flooding.

Nile waters are higher than average this season.

Mohamed El-Sebaei, spokesman for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, said the flood season began in August and will last three months.

Flooding will likely begin soon, he said, adding that the ministry was monitoring the accumulation of water at the Aswan High Dam on a daily basis. The ministry has already started the regular maintenance of 117 flood drains.

“Egypt stands by her brothers in Sudan to counter the ramifications of this accident on the basis of the brotherly ties between the people of the Nile Valley, the historical relations and the sharing of the same course and destiny that all bring the two countries together,” the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a Sunday statement.



The dam contained about 5 million cubic meters of irrigation and drinking water.

Local authorities patrolled the streets in cars equipped with loudspeakers, urging those who live on the alluvial fans (soil deposits from the Nile river) to evacuate.

Governor Hisham Amna sent a letter to the heads of the local cities located on the Nile, urging them to ready themselves for the possibility of flooding throughout the next three days.

The letter was issued to the cities of Kom Hamada, Itay al-Barud, Shoubrakhit, Rahmaniyah, Mahmoudeya, and Rashid.

The governor called on the cities to immediately evacuate all at-risk buildings — including houses, farms, retail stores, and fish cages — located on the river’s soil deposits.

Additionally, Amna prompted the cities to inform all citizens of the risk of possible property damage and/or loss due to the floods.

More than 40,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as torrential rain sparked dangerous flash floods, and authorities issued new evacuation orders for residents of Sydney’s western regions to move to safety.

In some other areas, a massive clean-up operation began as sunny skies returned for the first time in days, and food and other emergency supplies were flown in over swamped roads.

Authorities were trying to contact the family of a Pakistani national whose body was found by emergency services in a car under six meters of water in Sydney’s northwest.

Police had determined the man was driving a brand new car, on the first day of a new job and unfamiliar with the rural area, New South Wales Police Detective Inspector Chris Laird told media. The reason he could not get out of the vehicle was being investigated.

“It could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car which is an absolute tragedy,” Laird said.

Media reported police found a second body in an upturned utility vehicle in floodwaters in Queensland state.

Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales, the worst-hit state, warned that water levels would keep rising in some areas as major dams overflowed and rivers bulged, with thousands of people were on evacuation watch.

“Catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,” Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

The Insurance Council of Australia, the main industry body, said about 17,000 damages claims worth about A$254.2 million ($193.32 million) had been lodged by Wednesday morning across New South Wales and Queensland.

Homes have been submerged, livestock swept away and crops inundated.

There have also been many animal rescues, with craft used to move dogs, cattle, and even an emu, away from the flood waters. In the country’s arid center, water cascaded down the Uluru rock formation, a rare phenomenon described by the national park as “unique and extraordinary”.

RECOVERY BEGINS

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said heavy-load helicopters would transport food to supermarkets where supplies were running short.

“The expanse of water that went right across that region was quite devastating to see,” Morrison said in parliament after he toured flood-affected areas by helicopter.

Several hundred defense force personnel would be sent to flood-affected areas over the next few days to help in the recovery, said Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud.

“Their job will be out there cleaning up, making sure that we get rid of the debris, having boots on the ground,” Littleproud said.

Australian Rail Track Corp (ARTC) partially reopened Hunter Valley coal rail lines to Newcastle, the world’s biggest coal export port, but not before supply concerns lifted thermal coal prices to two year highs near $100 a tonne.

The Hunter Valley rail network serves mines run by BHP Group, Glencore Plc, New Hope Corp, Whitehaven Coal and Yancoal Australia, among others.

The Port of Newcastle, which last year shipped 158 million tonnes of coal, slowed ship movements this week but said on Wednesday it was continuing to operate.

Forecasters said the weather system that brought the rain would shift to the island state of Tasmania on Wednesday, bringing downpours and flooding.

It was the ship that launched a thousand memes, with social media users sharing viral images of a giant container vessel wedged into the banks of the Suez Canal in Egypt.

The Ever Given first got stuck across the vital shipping route on Tuesday, with Egyptian authorities still desperately trying to shift the 59-metre (193-foot) wide and 400-metre (1,312-foot) long ship.

Another tweet captioned an image of the Ever Given as “My COVID depression & anxiety” while next to the vessel, a bulldozer dwarfed by the ship was captioned “Going on a daily walk”.

Procrastination was another popular theme.

“Me dutifully chipping away at my tasks,” read one tweet, overlaying an image of the container ship dwarfing a lone digger attempting to dislodge it.

Another image shared was a drawing where the banks of the Suez Canal were tagged as “procrastination”, the canal itself as “workflow”, and the diagonally blocked Ever Given as “me”.

A GIF from the film, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery – where the main character is stuck in a shuttle car reversing back and forth in a narrow tunnel – was captioned with quips about the vessel.

17,17,FL-2020-000038-EGY,The Nile Was a Lifeline in the Desert for Ancient Nubia and Egypt - Discover Magazine,https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-nile-was-a-lifeline-in-the-desert-for-ancient-nubia-and-egypt,"Ancient Egypt was a powerhouse civilization at a time when much of the world had yet to start building the first cities. Why did Egypt rise to power so early, and how did a society with so little rainfall support a population sufficient to build the pyramids? The answer can be traced back to a simple, but powerful force: the Nile River.

The Nile is the longest river in the world, stretching more than 4,000 miles. It fueled civilization in ancient Egypt as well as neighboring Nubia, another ancient civilization along the Nile River in what’s now Sudan and Egypt.

A Liquid Lifeline

After Northern Africa emerged from the Ice Age more than 10,000 years ago, monsoons moved into the region, creating seasonal oases. In the millennia that followed, the climate dried out, leaving the Sahara Desert. Today, Egypt gets little precipitation throughout the year. It’s surrounded by desert on three sides, with the Mediterranean to the north. So ancient societies learned to rely on another source for water — the Nile River. People who lived along the Nile River Valley found they could still farm, even without rain.

Eventually, these ancient civilizations realized that the Nile was prone to an annual “flood of a hundred days,” as spring rains hit the Ethiopian highlands, according to a 2009 collection of studies into the river's history, geology, biology and climate. The floods left behind nutrient-packed silt carried down from the mountains, lakes and forests upstream.

At first, these floods served as natural irrigation for crops in the days of predynastic Egypt, researchers believe. But as Egyptian and Nubian civilization advanced, they learned new ways to farm in this silt. Ultimately, the ancient Egyptians and Nubians built canals and irrigation systems to control the water for their crops.

Researchers believe that this advanced agricultural system gave birth to the ancient Egyptian civilization we remember today — the one of pharaohs and pyramids.

Making the Pyramids

In time, the Nile became an aquatic highway, hastening trade throughout the country and the world at large. Traders used it to bring goods from farther south in Africa, as well as upriver from the Mediterranean. And soon, Egypt’s influence spread across the ancient world.

Ancient Egyptians also moved pyramid-building supplies via the Nile River. Scientists think many of the stones for the pyramids were transported from neighboring regions using the colossal waterway. Archaeologists suspect that the granite beams used in the inner chambers of the Great Pyramid at Giza were actually quarried hundreds of miles to the south.

The Nile floods came in handy, too. When the river entered its annual floods — typically from August until October — the water actually pushed right up to the pyramid construction site. Thanks to canals and passageways dug along the floodplain, the pyramid stones could be dropped off using boats.

Nubia and the Nile

Egypt wasn’t the only civilization that benefited from having the Nile in their backyard. People throughout Africa were drawn to the Nile, and they traveled from throughout the region to settle in Nubia. As a result, Nubia — one of Africa’s earliest kingdoms — became a cultural melting pot.

In ancient times, this area was called the Kingdom of Kush, and is even referred to by that name in the Bible. But by Roman times, the name Nubia had come into common use.

Nubian society consisted of farmers, cattle herders, miners and makers who all depended on the Nile to support their way of life. And the people who lived there frequently traded with their Egyptian neighbors.

Nubia was known for its gold, ivory, ebony and incense. Many of these luxury goods came from sub-Saharan Africa and passed through Nubia to reach the larger world, traveling via the Nile River.

Two Ancient Greats

Much of what we now know about ancient Nubia comes from the things Egyptians wrote about it, as well as from archaeological excavations.

These insights paint a picture of two ancient civilizations who alternated between being at peace and at war with each other. Nubia thrived for over a thousand years until it was conquered by Egypt. But Egypt didn’t always win these fights. Nearly 3,000 years ago, Nubian kings conquered and became pharaohs in Egypt, where they ruled for centuries.

These two great societies thrived along the Nile River, farming its fertile soil and using its vast waterways to expand their reach across the ancient world.","Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/6SyhhYoXjJiYLnH67luqy2/bd02a4ff1b5a9b13573dcc6d47b6d35e/shutterstock_1626788158.jpg,"['world', 'floods', 'desert', 'egypt', 'lifeline', 'civilization', 'nile', 'africa', 'nubia', 'pyramids', 'ancient', 'river']",

Egyptian technicians accompanying the bread production lines will train Sudanese teams to efficiently use the equipment according to operating standards.

The Egyptian and Sudanese teams will install the bakeries in Sudan’s most affected areas.

In September, Egypt sent multiple planes loaded with large quantities of food and medical supplies to Sudan, as well as a team of 20 physicians, nurses, and epidemic control specialists, to help the Sudanese people facing the disaster.

Sudan’s devastating floods began when continuous heavy rainfall caused the Nile River to reach its highest level in over a century.

The Sudanese government declared a nationwide state of emergency over the flooding, and quickly formed a crisis response committee to help mitigate its impact.

The country’s flood crisis has left 102 people dead, dozens injured, and over 100,000 homes destroyed.

The Instagram account Assault Police said more than 100 women had given testimonies since it was set up to target the man on July 1, and the public prosecution office said on Monday that the man was under arrest as it carried out investigations.

Lawyer Tarek Elawady said the events of the last few days showed that Egypt was starting to take sex crimes seriously and women should have the courage to speak out, even though it was difficult in the patriarchal society.

“This is now the start of an opportunity (for change) that we must take advantage of,” said Elawady, who represented his own daughter in a harassment case and won.

“We must shed our culture of victim blaming. We cannot keep telling girls, ‘It’s because you were walking wrong or were dressed inappropriately’.”

A 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll found Cairo to be the most dangerous megacity for women and 99% of women in Egypt interviewed by the United Nations in 2013 reported sexual harassment.

An outcry over attacks on women near Cairo’s Tahrir Square during President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s inauguration celebrations in 2014 prompted a new law punishing sexual harassment with at least six months in jail.

Seeing convictions under this law has gradually encouraged the public to be more sympathetic toward victims, Elawady said.

PRIVACY

Egypt’s public prosecution office said that the man targeted by the Instagram account Assault Police was being held for 15 days while it investigated the allegations made by four women, one under the age of 18.

Women’s rights activists said Egyptian women were now finding their voice because they saw the legal system was protecting their identities.

“With the public prosecution protecting the right of the girls to privacy of their data, they have been encouraged to go and testify,” said Nehad Abul-Komsan, director of the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights, an advoacy group.

“It will also encourage other girls and will pave the way for other sexual harassment cases to be revealed.”

The government’s National Council for Women said on Tuesday that it had received 400 complaints and enquiries about violence against women from 1 to 5 July.

The country’s top Islamic clerical authority al-Azhar also encouraged women to report incidents, saying that silence posed a threat to society and led to more violations.

PROUD

Despite having been shunned by her family for accusing her father of abusing her, Egyptian-American journalist Reem Abdellatif joined the online campaign in a video message of encouragement for women sharing their stories.

“The fact that these girls are speaking out this loudly with this kind of momentum - I’ve never seen it before,” she said by phone from the Netherlands where she is currently based.

“And it’s not just this guy. Like I said in my video, he’s only a symbol for what we’ve been having to deal with for decades.”

There has been some backlash on social media, with some calling the accusers liars and hypocrites and others saying women who were raised properly should know to dress appropriately.

But most comments were supportive, with many using the #MeToo hashtag - used to reveal sexual misconduct by powerful men, including now jailed former movie producer Harvey Weinstein - to highlight the taboo issue of sexual harassment in Egypt.

“I am very proud of this new generation of young girls who speak up. Harassment and rape are shameful for those who commit it, not the victim,” tweeted Cairo-based Tunisian actress and lawyer Hend Sabry.","Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['flood', 'public', 'harassment', 'egyptian', 'suspect', 'elawady', 'instagram', 'prosecution', 'encouraged', 'man', 'metoo', 'arrested', 'women', 'girls', 'sexual']",

In Sudan, the intense flooding has killed over 100 people and damaged tens of thousands of houses over the past days.

Ministry spokesman Mohamed Al-Sebaie told Al-Hekaya program on MBC Masr that the excess water will be collected in the Lake Nasser reservoir in Upper Egypt’s Aswan, and that it will be utilised to meet the country’s water needs, especially in times of drought.

The extent of the flooding, which has started in Egypt since August, can only be determined in late September, he added.

The annual Nile flood, which takes place in August, September and October, is caused by heavy rain in the Ethiopian highlands.

In an August meeting of the committee for regulating the flow of the Nile, Minister of Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Aty ordered officials to continue removing illegal structures along waterways, especially those on the Nile.

He warned that such encroachments limit the ability of water networks to contain excess water in times of emergency and flooding.

Ministry spokesman Al-Sebaie said that since the launch of the national campaign to save the Nile River in 2015, over 276,000 illegal structures along waterways, including the river, have been demolished. He added that this number includes more than 57,000 illegal structures on the Nile.

Egypt also signalled support for Sudan in a dispute with Ethiopia over an area on the border between the two countries where there have recently been armed skirmishes.

Both Egypt and Sudan lie downstream from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Addis Ababa says is crucial to its economic development.

Ethiopia, which says it has every right to use Nile waters long exploited by Egypt, started filling the reservoir behind the dam last summer after Egypt and Sudan failed to secure a legally binding agreement on how the dam will be operated.

Khartoum fears the dam, which lies on the Blue Nile close to the border with Sudan, could increase the risk of flooding and affect the safe operation of its own Nile dams, while water-scarce Egypt fears its supplies from the Nile could be hit.

Years of diplomatic talks over the project have repeatedly stalled. Egypt and Sudan’s positions have drawn closer as Cairo has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy over the issue in the past two years.

This week Egypt’s chief of staff signed a military cooperation agreement with his Sudanese counterpart during a visit to Sudan.

“We affirmed the necessity of returning to serious and effective negotiations with the aim of reaching, as soon as possible and before the next flood season, a just, balanced and legally binding agreement,” Sisi said after meeting Sudan’s leaders.

Sudan recently proposed that the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union should actively mediate in the dispute, rather than simply observing talks, a suggestion that Egypt supports.

Ethiopia this week indicated its opposition to adding mediators to an existing African Union-led process.

Sisi’s call came a day after Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a return to “serious” negotiations over the dam, according to Egypt’s foreign ministry.

Meeting with the head of Sudan’s ruling council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sisi also discussed “recent Sudanese moves to extend state sovereignty on its eastern borders with Ethiopia, which come within the context of Sudan’s respect for international agreements”, a statement from Egypt’s presidency said.

Sudan and Ethiopia have blamed each other over unrest in the border area of Al-Fashqa, long settled by Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopia has rejected Sudan’s claims to be asserting its rights to control the area under a border agreement from 1903.

Since Bashir was toppled following mass protests, a military-civilian council has held power in Sudan under a political transition expected to last until the end of 2023.","Sun, 07 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210308&t=2&i=1554098305&r=LYNXMPEH270AX&w=800,"['fattah', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'ethiopia', 'deal', 'agreement', 'pressure', 'ups', 'sudan', 'visit', 'nile', 'egypts', 'dam', 'border', 'abdel', 'sudans']",

Papyrus depicting Isis and Osiris



Habi the Blue Nile God



Ancient Egyptian crocodile deity Sobek

CAIRO – 28 June 2020: When many contemplate the name ""Nile"", the first thing that comes to their minds is Egypt, which is easy to explain, given the great importance of this river to Egypt throughout history.The famous Greek historian Herodotus summarized the importance of the river to the Egyptians by saying ""Egypt is the gift of the Nile"".There are many myths associated with the Nile, including that the Nile is the gift of the gods, and that its flood season begins with the appearance of the brightest star; when it overflows, it brings prosperity and fertility; the gods control the river, and the deity Khnum is the lord of the water who brings prosperity and creates humans from the mud of the Nile River flood; the deity Habi controls the flood of the Nile because he is both genders and therefore very fertile; parts of the body of the severed god Osiris is in the Nile; and that the Nile’s flood and its decline were linked to the death and resurrection of Osiris and the myth of worshiping the Nile animals (the crocodile deity Sobek).The ancient Egyptians thought that the Nile is the gift of the gods. They equated it with life itself, and they organized their daily lives according to the high and low levels of its water. The Egyptian calendar was based on the three seasons of the Nile: The flood, agriculture, and harvest.The flood season began with the appearance of ""Al-Shaary Al-Yamani"" or ""Sirius"", which is the brightest star. Its appearance also means the beginning of a new Egyptian year.Herodotus' sayings and recordings show that the flood of the Nile was coincident with the summer solstice phenomenon, that is, June 22/23 of every year.Because the Nile means life, when it overflows it brings prosperity and fertility to the soil and people around it, but if its water level rises too much, people lose their mud houses, and if the level does not rise enough, drought and famine occur.Thus it was important for the gods to control the river. The two main deities involved in organizing this process are Khnum and Hapi, according to legend.Khnum, the Nile god with a ram's head, was the god of water, who brings life to the banks of the river, where plants grow and animals reproduce, and since silt forms after the flood, Khnum was also thought to create humans.Elephantine Island, now in Aswan, was home to worshipping Khnum, while his temple is located in the city of Esna, located 60 km south of Luxor Governorate in Upper Egypt.As for the god Habi, he was the one in control of the flood of the Nile. Usually, this god appears in both genders, having male features and a female upper body, which reflects both the personality of the father and mother of the Nile, and so he/she is able to achieve fertility. Surprisingly, the word “Habi” means ""happy"" in the ancient Egyptian language.In multiple scenes in different temples, such as Karnak and Luxor temples, Habi can be seen with lotus and papyrus. This indicates the union of Upper Egypt, represented in its logo, the lotus flower; and the lower represented in its logo, the papyrus.In addition, God Osiris played a role in one of the famous legends of the Nile, and this legend says that Osiris was killed by his brother Set because of jealousy. His body was cut into 40 pieces, and thrown into the Nile, which, in turn, threw shredded parts of Osiris' body in the Mediterranean.However, his wife, Isis, succeeded in finding and collecting his body parts, and thanks to the magic powers she possessed, Isis managed to revive Osiris and conceive a child, and then gave birth to Horus who grew up in the papyrus field in the delta, far from his malevolent uncle Set.Later, the god Horus succeeded in avenging his father, Osiris, by killing his uncle Set, and from here the death and resurrection of Osiris became associated with the flood of the Nile and the decline of its water level.Some sources say that the ancient Egyptians believed that the flood of the Nile was the tears of Isis, mourning the death of her husband Osiris, which is what is now called in Egypt “Wafaa el-Nile” [Loyalty of the Nile], which the Egyptians celebrate for two weeks starting from August 15.For this reason too, sources indicated that Egyptians threw similar items into the River Nile ""until it calms down and stops flooding.""Furthermore, many Nile animals played a major role in ancient myths indicating that the ancient Egyptians' fear of crocodiles and hippos pushed them to worship them, so as to ensure their protection from attacks and from evil in general.The crocodile ""Sobek"" was a god worshiped in Fayoum, and in Kom Ombo in Aswan. Some fish and birds of the Nile were seen as a sign of abundance, livelihood and resurrection in the afterlife.In 1954, the Egyptian leader at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, decided to build the High Dam in Aswan on the banks of the Nile. However, the artificial lake behind the dam threatened the monumental temples of Abu Simbel as well as other Pharaonic treasures.Therefore, Egypt and Sudan launched an urgent appeal to UNESCO in 1959 to protect antiquities. Indeed, 22 artifacts have been saved, including the Abu Simbel Temple, which has been dismantled to 16,000 pieces and moved to a new location in a process that required the participation of some 2,000 scientists, engineers, experts, and workers.","Sun, 28 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/77239.jpg,"['flood', 'egypt', 'gift', 'water', 'egyptian', 'egyptians', 'nile', 'khnum', 'god', 'osiris', 'river']", 
23,23,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt expects above-average Nile flood amid GERD crisis - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/379086/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-expects-aboveaverage-Nile-flood-amid-GERD-cr.aspx,"The Egyptian irrigation ministry expects the Nile flood to be higher than average this year due to rain adding to the Blue Nile’s flow, but noted it is still too early to confirm the extent of the flooding.

The comments came during a meeting of the committee for regulating the flow of the Nile, headed by Irrigation Minister Mohamed Abdel Aty.

As Egypt last year witnessed the strongest flooding in 50 years, according to an earlier statement by the ministry, without reported harm, it is likely that the expected increase in this year’s flood will be good news.

The news comes as Egypt is embroiled in a long-standing dispute with Ethiopia over the massive dam it is building on the Blue Nile, which Cairo worries could cut its water supply.

Addis Ababa completed the first filling of the dam’s reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, earlier this summer, retaining 4.9 billion cubic metres of water.

In addition, flooding in Sudan in recent weeks has killed dozens of people and destroyed more than 35,000 houses.

The average level of the Blue Nile has reached 17.43 metres, the highest since the country started measuring in 1912, Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said last week.

The Nile flood takes place in August, September and October, caused by heavy rain in the Ethiopian highlands.

The rate of rainfall is growing, the Egyptian ministry said in its Monday statement, adding that a final confirmation of the extent of the floods can only be given in September and October.

The ministry referenced floods in Khartoum and the increased water level, saying it coordinates and exchanges information with the Sudanese irrigation ministry and carries out joint water level measurements.

Abdel Aty ordered officials to continue removing illegal structures on waterways, especially those on the Nile, as such encroachments limit the capability of the water networks to contain excess water in the times of emergency and flooding.

GERD filling

Ethiopia started filling the reservoir of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in July despite the lack of a legal binding agreement with the downstream countries Sudan and Egypt.

Egypt and Sudan hope to secure a legal agreement with Ethiopia to secure their water shares during periods of drought.

Abdel Aty also warned in July warned that Sudan would be totally destroyed if the mega-dam collapses.

Egyptian irrigation ministry spokesman Mohamed El-Sebaie expects the first filling of the reservoir not to harm Egypt this year, thanks to water reserves at Lake Nasser.

The filling “will not affect [Egypt] this year… because we have taken [water] from the reserves of Lake Nasser that had been saved over the past years,"" El-Sebaie said.

He said plans adopted by Egypt to reduce water consumption have helped increase reserves in Lake Nasser, which can be used in case of drought.

24,24,FL-2020-000038-EGY,50-year-old Nile dam altered lives - Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2021/jan/17/50-year-old-nile-dam-altered-lives/,"MANIAL SULTAN, Egypt -- Yassin Saeed remembers when the Nile's annual flooding drenched his village in the years before the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Now, former flood lands are green fields year-round.

""Our lives were very hard,"" said the 76-year-old Egyptian, recounting how his father, his brothers and other farmers had to use the traditional felucca sailboats to harvest the corn crops in the flooded fields.

The area was flooded at least a third of the year; the villagers would erect mud barriers to prevent waters from reaching their homes. Then came the dam, which officially opened on Jan. 15, 1971.

Built in the 1950s and 1960s under the country's leader, the charismatic Gamal Abdel-Nasser, the Soviet Union helped in its construction after the United States and Britain withdrew financial support.

Their withdrawal was a factor in Nasser's subsequent decision to nationalize the Suez Canal, taking it from British and French companies. He planned to use canal revenue to finance the dam. Egyptians hailed it as the moment when their country finally threw off decades of imperialist control, and Nasser was called a patriot.

The move angered France and Britain. They, along with Israel, invaded and briefly took the canal in the 1956 Mideast war. But the United States and the Soviet Union ordered them to pull back, in what was seen across the Arab world as a defining victory for Nasser and Arab nationalism.

The dam's construction changed the very landscape of Egypt. It spared the farmers from seasonal droughts and flooding, and generated electricity, spurring Egypt's rapid development. For years, the dam served as the main source of power for the country, which has recently needed to invest in other sources to meet the needs of its booming population.

""It is the greatest Egyptian project since the time of the pharaohs,"" said Abbas Sharaky, a water resources professor at Cairo University, describing how the Nile was tamed.

The river is formed by its two tributaries, the Blue Nile, originating from Lake Tana in Ethiopia and the White Nile, from Lake Victoria in Uganda. The tributaries meet in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The project ensured an adequate water supply all year, Sharaky said. In the 1980s, a prolonged drought dropped the Nile to its lowest level since 1913 south of the dam, and upstream countries faced drought and famine. But Egypt was spared. Lake Nasser, created by the dam, provided an alternative source of water.

Today, as Egypt marks 50 years of the Aswan Dam, it is embroiled in stormy negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia to resolve a long-running dispute over another massive dam, one that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile.

Ethiopia hopes its dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will generate electricity critical to help pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, which relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its 100 million-strong population, fears a devastating effect if the Ethiopian dam is operated without taking its needs into account.

Despite the numerous benefits it brought, the Aswan High Dam also had negative side-effects. It increased the salt content of the soil used to grow food, holding back the rich silt that acted as a fertilizer, and drove thousands of villagers from their Nile Valley homes.

Some 50,000 Nubian people were subjected to forced resettlement in 1963 and 1964, to vacate the area where Lake Nasser, which covers 2,000 square miles, was created.

The world paid little attention to the displacement of the Nubians, who were moved to 44 new villages north of Aswan, but many still dream of returning to land along the lake, near their original homes.

There was, however, international uproar over antiquities dating to the times of the pharaohs that were endangered by the dam's encroaching reservoir. In 1960, the UNESCO issued an international appeal to save the temples of Abu Simbel, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions and a priceless treasure. More than 113 countries responded with funds or expertise at the time.

The temples were moved piece by piece to higher ground.

In a meeting officials, Abdel Aaty also urged removing illegal structures on the Nile’s northern branches of Damietta and Rashid, which he says obstruct the water network’s capability to contain excess water in the times of emergency and during annual Nile floods.

Earlier this month, Egyptian committee concerned with following up on the flow of the Nile River have reviewed procedures to monitor and assess the extent of the Nile flood this year.

The meeting, which was headed by Abdel Aaty, came as part of a series of meetings of the committee to follow up on the situation of rain on the Blue Nile and ways to deal with the flowing water.

The flood of Nile River this year will likely be higher than the average according to the committee affiliated with the Water Resources Ministry last month.

The initial indicators were based on the incoming water flow during August; however, it is still too early to make a final judgment on the type and size of this year’s flood, pending the months of September and October; the Committee said.

According to an official statement issued by the ministry, the committee reviewed the position of the Nile flood, and the measures taken by the Nile Water Affairs Sector and the Ministry's Planning Sector Forecasting Center, including monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the flood situation, and the quantities of water expected to arrive until the end of the current water year 2021-2022.

The statement pointed to the unprecedented high rates of rainfall in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and the high level of water in the waterway, explaining that coordination is taking place Egypt and Sudan in a framework of mutual cooperation, exchanging of data and information, and joint measurements in some measurement stations.","Thu, 17 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/20200917012205225.jpg,"['flood', 'expected', 'removing', 'higher', 'egyptian', 'water', 'abdel', 'waterways', 'committee', 'nile', 'ministry', 'minister', 'aaty', 'violations', 'statement', 'urges', 'urged', 'river']",

More than 100 people were killed due to the floods, 500 thousand families were affected, in 16 states, as the capital was the most affected.

The two planes have been sent for the second time to Sudan, the Military spokesman said, in an effort to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people.

Three Egyptian military aircraft loaded with foodstuffs and medical supplies arrived in Khartoum and Juba earlier in September, to help people in the flood-hit Sudan and South Sudan.

The moves come as part of directives issued by President Abdel Fattah El Sisi to launch an airlift offering urgent aid to the Sudanese and South Sudanese people who are badly affected by the crisis.

Sudanese and South Sudanese officials have expressed thanks and appreciation for the Egyptian leadership in light of Cairo's efforts to help the two countries overcome the current crisis.

Egypt’s Minster of Health Hala Zayed arrived in Sudan in September upon directives from President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, leading a high-profile medical delegation to offer medical assistance and help Sudanese to combat the torrential floods which hit the country recently.

The delegation groups 20 physicians of various specialties in addition to a nursing staff, Spokesman for the Health Ministry Khaled Megahed said, adding that Sudanese Health Minister Osama Abdel Rahim will receive the Egyptian delegation at Khartoum Airport.

The delegation will group specialized anti-epidemic teams to spray pesticides against rodents and mosquitoes in the affected areas and also train the Sudanese human cadres on spraying pesticides.

The medical delegation will be divided into four teams that will be distributed on four various areas in the capital to continue offer medical assistance to the affected people until the flood recedes, he pointed out.

Bilateral talks will be held between Egypt and Sudan during the visit to discuss the needs of Sudan’s health system. Megahed said the Egyptian minister will visit one of the affected areas to get acquainted with the health conditions in it, he said.

Sudanese Minister of Information Faisal Mohamed Saleh thanked Egyptians for supporting his country facing the floods impact which left over 100 people dead.

“We are greatly overwhelmed with the Egyptians love and support which reflected on social media” Saleh said in statements to TEN channel, Sunday.

He added that, “everyone knows the depth of relations between Egypt and Sudan and due to some political circumstances, that affected the two countries, the relationship between them remains deep, and we are grateful to the Egyptian government that sent our country urgent aid.”

Saleh explained that his country is facing the largest flood in 100 years, adding that to: “Some factors that led to this situation, however, everyone is working to fix everything.”

As Sudan has been hit by flash floods as a result of torrential rains, Egypt sent two military aircraft carrying foodstuffs, medical supplies and waterproof tents on Sunday for Khartoum.

The shipment has been dispatched upon directives of President Abdel Fattah El Sisi to ease the burden of the natural disaster, which left over 100 people dead and over 50 wounded and devastated several buildings.

Meanwhile, Sudanese officials expressed appreciation of Egypt's efforts in support of the Sudanese people at times of crisis.

Sisi expressed his full solidarity with the government and people of Sudan in the face of the floods.

“I express my sincere solidarity with the brotherly Sudanese government and people amid the heavy rains and flash floods that have ravaged their country, causing devastation and tragic loss of life,” Sisi tweeted on Saturday.

He stressed that “I affirm Egypt’s full readiness to provide all means of support to our Sudanese brothers during this critical period to deal with the devastating effects of the floods.”

“I pray to Allah Almighty to heal the wounded and give the families of the victims in Sudan solace and fortitude,” President Sisi added.

The flooding comes despite Ethiopia starting to fill the reservoir behind a giant new dam upstream on the Blue Nile in July. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is expected to help Sudan control future floods.

Flooding regularly hits Sudan in summer, but this year’s unprecedented water levels have left larger tracts of farmland submerged and residents around Khartoum are looking anxiously outside their homes for fear of the rising waters.

Flood waters have spilled over into major roads in Khartoum for the first time in living memory.

“The waters of the Nile flooded our house at midnight yesterday,” said Ahmed Bastawy, a resident of Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, who stayed up all night trying to protect his house only to see some of its mud brick walls collapse.

“We have never seen flooding like this. Authorities provided us with soil and sacks, but we failed to block the waters and the houses were destroyed.”

>> Renaissance dam : a regional controversy between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt

The average level of the Blue Nile has reached 17.43 metres, the highest since the country started measuring in 1912, Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said on Thursday.

Blue Nile waters would continue to rise in the coming days, said Abdelrahman Sughairun, head of the ministry’s flood committee.

As of Tuesday the floods had left 86 people dead, destroyed more than 18,000 homes and damaged a further 32,000, according to the interior ministry.

The reservoir behind the GERD is expected to be gradually filled over the next few years as the dam begins to operate, though Ethiopia is yet to agree on its operating terms with downstream countries Sudan and Egypt.

“After the filling of the Renaissance Dam it’s expected that floods won’t happen,” Abbas said.

At least 32 people have been killed and 165 injured after two trains collided in Egypt on Friday, according to government statements.

Seventy-two ambulances were sent to the scene and reinforcement medical teams were sent to the incident in the Tahta district of the Upper Egypt governorate of Sohag from the capital Cairo, the Health Ministry said.

Health Minister Hala Zayed said in a news conference that two planes were dispatched from Cairo with 52 medical teams from various specialties on board to treat the injured.

Images from the scene showed crowds of people gathered around the twisted wreckage of the trains.

The collision happened after an unidentified person pulled an emergency brake, Egypt’s railway authority said in a statement.

The authority said that at 11:42 a.m. local time (5:42 a.m. ET) a train heading from Aswan to Cairo hit the rear of a train heading from Luxor to Alexandria, which was stuck on the railway line after an emergency brake was activated.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that “whoever has caused the Sohag train accident, will receive the deterrent penalty.”

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly added that any “error or negligence will not be tolerated, and the perpetrator will be held accountable for the accident.”

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said that the country’s railway facilities have “witnessed decades of neglect, lack of development and maintenance, which is leaving it in a state that led to danger.”

“Control systems operate manually, train cars have run out of date,” he told Egyptian TV, while inspecting the site.

Egypt’s aging railway system has witnessed a deadly accident almost every year for the past 20 years. In 2018, Egypt recorded 2,044 train accidents and in 2017, 1,793 accidents were recorded according to data published by the official statistics agency Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS).

Two years ago, at least 25 people were killed and dozens injured in a fire at Ramses station in central Cairo, the country’s busiest, after a train collided with the platform, causing its fuel tank to explode.

A collision between two trains in Alexandria, Egypt’s second largest city, in August 2017 left more than 40 dead and many more injured.

In 2012, 44 children died after a train crashed into a school bus in Egypt’s Asyut governante.

The storm made landfall late Monday just north of Port O’Connor, Texas. Early Tuesday, Beta was 35 miles (56 kilometers) north northwest of the city with maximum winds of 40 mph (64 kph), the US National Hurricane Center said. The storm was moving toward the northwest near three mph (four kilometers) and is expected to stall inland over Texas.

“We currently have both storm surge and rainfall going on right now,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Amaryllis Cotto in Galveston, Texas.

Cotto said 6-12 inches (15-30 centimeters) of rain has fallen in the area, with isolated amounts of up to 18 inches (45 centimeters). Dangerous flash flooding is expected through Wednesday, Cotto said.

Beta was the ninth named storm that made landfall in the continental US this year. That tied a record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. It also was the first time a Greek letter named storm made landfall in the continental US Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.

Beta will move inland over southeastern Texas through Wednesday and then over Louisiana and Mississippi on Wednesday night through Friday, and the biggest unknown from Beta was how much rainfall it could produce. Beta was expected to weaken into a depression, but flash flooding was possible in Arkansas and Mississippi as the system moves farther inland.

Earlier predictions of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) in some areas were downgraded Monday to up to 15 inches (38 centimeters).

Forecasters and officials reassured residents Beta was not expected to be another Hurricane Harvey or Tropical Storm Imelda. Harvey in 2017 dumped more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain on Houston, causing $125 billion in damage in Texas. Imelda, which hit Southeast Texas last year, was one of the wettest cyclones on record.

Storm surge up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast from Port Aransas to Sabine Pass in Texas. In Galveston, an island city southeast of Houston, there was already some street flooding Monday from rising tides and part of a popular fishing pier collapsed due to strong waves.

Farther south on the Texas coast, Maria Serrano Culpepper along with her two daughters and dogs left their home in Magnolia Beach near Matagorda Bay on Sunday night.

Culpepper said she didn’t want to be trapped in her home, three blocks from the beach, with wind, rain and possibly no electricity. She and her family evacuated to a friend’s home in nearby Victoria.

Culpepper said her home should be fine as it’s on stilts 13 feet (4 meters) off the ground and was built to withstand strong storms.

“I’m feeling OK now. I had two nights without sleeping because I was worried about (Beta) being a Category 1 hurricane. I calmed down when the storm lost power,” said Culpepper, who works as an engineer at a nearby chemical plant.

On Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 29 Texas counties ahead of Beta’s arrival.

Beta is forecast to dump heavy rain on the southwestern corner of Louisiana three weeks after the same area got pounded by Hurricane Laura. The rainfall and storm surge prompted Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards to declare a state of emergency.

In Lake Charles, Mayor Nic Hunter worried about Beta’s rainfall could set back efforts in his Louisiana community to recover after Laura, which damaged about 95% of the city’s 30,000 structures. Hunter said the worry of another storm was “an emotional and mental toll for a lot of our citizens.”

Parts of the Alabama coast and Florida Panhandle were still reeling from Hurricane Sally, which roared ashore Wednesday, causing at least two deaths. Two Boston-based disaster modeling firms figured Sally caused about $2 billion in privately insured losses from wind and storm surge. Karen Clark & Company estimated losses at $2 billion, while AIR Worldwide said they were between $1 and $3 billion. The estimates don’t include uninsured losses, the National Flood Insurance Program claims or damage to offshore property, like oil rigs.

Hurricane Teddy was about 295 miles (475 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda Monday night as it heads toward Nova Scotia. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 kph) while moving north at 25 mph (40 kph) and away from the wealthy British territory, according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was expected to weaken and become a strong post-tropical cyclone before reaching Nova Scotia on Wednesday.

The government closed all air and sea ports, schools and government offices for the second time in a week. Hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda on Sept. 14, knocking down trees and leaving thousands without power.

A giant ship has blocked the famous Suez Canal but opened up a torrent of memes and gifs lampooning the hapless container carrier, which has been jammed in the waterway since Tuesday.

Elements of global commerce have been brought to a standstill, but no one was hurt, and the environment is so far undamaged. The lack of stakes surrounding the Ever Given's grounding has made it a prime target for jokes.

Nine tugs attempted to move it while getting some help from the shore with two workers and a digger clawing into the sandy embankment where the Ever Given's bow is dug in.

Images of them - dwarfed by the hull of the monster they were trying to dig out - circulated with comments on Twitter such as ""these two guys and their digger are currently trying to save global trade.""

loading

The Twitter account @SuezDiggerGuy, ""Guy With the Digger at Suez Canal,"" had nearly 15,000 followers by around 0600 GMT Friday and a profile line that read: ""Trying my best. No promises.""

Its timeline was replete with observations such as ""Thinking of naming my digger, Ever Digging"" and bemoaning having his leave rescinded by managers.

Netizens also conjured up Lego images of the digger and the bow of the container ship, which is carrying consumer goods from Chinese factories to European households.

Once it became clear the ship could be stuck for weeks, a website quickly spun up, https://istheshipstillstuck.com.

And the memes filled the internet like cargo ships piling up in the Red Sea. Many of the most popular touched on the angst of the last pandemic-filled year; one labelled the hulking ship “my COVID depression & anxiety” and the tiny digger on shore as “going on a daily walk.”

For Ethiopia, the project is meant to offer a solution to its severe power problem, providing electricity access for an estimated 65 million Ethiopians. Ethiopia also says its neighbours will benefit from cheap energy exports.

Egypt relies on the Blue Nile for freshwater, and maintains that the dam represents an existential threat.

For its part, Sudan has had to balance its own concerns about water supply with the dam’s promise of cheap power and flood control. Recently it appears that Sudan has firmed up on its opposition to the Dam.

For my doctoral thesis, I am studying the geopolitical realities on the governance of the Nile’s resources. This isn’t the first time that relations in the region have been strained by dam politics – its history is a long one and the tensions felt today are rooted in the imperial past.

The beginning

It started with the occupation of Egypt by Britain in 1882. Egypt became independent in 1922, though British influence remained strong for another three decades until the last British troops left in 1956.

Great Britain ’s textile industries depended on Egyptian cotton, which relied on irrigation using the River Nile’s water. To conserve water during the rainy seasons for dry seasons, British hydrologists developed a plan called the Century Storage Scheme.

The plan envisaged the regulation of the Nile waters along different seasons and years (drought and flood) by building several dams and reservoirs in Ethiopia and other upstream countries. The plan ruled out storing the Nile waters in downstream countries, mainly because of immense water losses that could happen due to evaporation.

But the plan had one major flaw. It didn’t consider the interests of nine upstream countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Its aim was to safeguard Great Britain’s interests.

Aswan High Dam

The biggest project on the Nile was initiated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt’s prime minister between 1954-56 and then president until 1970. Nasser wanted to build a dam which would end Egypt’s dependency on upstream countries by storing the Nile waters in Egypt. It would also end flooding and bring more electricity to Egyptians.

Nasser decided to build the dam at Aswan, creating a big reservoir in the northern border between Sudan and Egypt. The reservoir, called Lake Nasser, stretches about 125 miles from Egypt into Sudan where it is called Lake Nubia.

The Aswan High Dam was initially described by British hydrologists as “not worthy of serious consideration” and “full of mad ideas for the Nile.” This was because it was the antithesis of the Century Storage Scheme and the basin-wide approach that dominated water management on the Nile under the British.

Read more: Plans for a dam across the Nile triggered a war in 1956: will it happen again?

Sudan gained its independence in 1956. The new government opposed the colonial treaties, which Great Britain signed with Egypt on behalf Sudan and favoured Egypt.

It also opposed the construction of the Aswan High Dam because of the high social, economic and environmental costs. These, according to an American historian of East Africa and Nile expert Professor Robert Collin, included the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Sudanese Nubians, the destruction of historical cities, the threat of increased in soil salinity and water-logging, and increase seismic activity from the weight of the reservoir on fault lines.

Sudan instead favoured the Century Storage Scheme which involved a series of smaller dams in Uganda and Ethiopia, together with the Jonglei Canal. The canal was meant to divert the flow of the White Nile, bypassing the vast swamps of the Sudd, in South Sudan, where water is lost to evaporation. The construction of the Jonglei Canal started in 1978 but was suspended in 1983.

As part of the Century Storage Scheme, in 1956 Sudan went ahead with plans to construct the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile and expand the country’s Gezira irrigation scheme.

To implement their respective projects, both Egypt and Sudan tried to get funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, later to become the World Bank. However, since the Roseires Dam would alter the flow of the Nile, and the Aswan High Dam would have significant socio-economic impacts on Sudan, the bank required the two countries reach an agreement to get the funds.

This proved impossible. The Sudanese parliament refused to consent to the construction of the Aswan High Dam while Egypt was committed to start the construction work.

A dramatic turn of events in 1958 changed the course of history. General Ibrahim Abboud deposed the Sudanese government and Abboud signed the 1959 Nile Waters Treaty with Egypt and consented to the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

Egypt completed the construction of Aswan High Dam in 1971. The dam continued to operate in favour of Egypt, providing water for irrigation and generating a huge amount of electricity.

The Grand Renaissance Dam

Aswan High Dam and the 1959 Nile Waters Treaty, which totally disregarded the interest of upstream countries, also frustrated Ethiopia. The dam, which evaporates 10-15 BCM of waters annually, would also foreclose Ethiopia’s future use of the Nile.

In 1959 Ethiopia commissioned a survey on the Blue Nile for irrigation and hydropower. The survey, carried out by the US Bureau of Reclamation, issued its final report in 1964 which proposed various projects including a “border dam,” which later became the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.

Ethiopia was not immediately able to implement the project due to a lack of finance. Egypt also used extensive diplomatic connections and the colonial-era 1929 and 1959 agreements to prevent the construction of any major infrastructure projects on the tributaries of the Nile.

Finally, after decades of political stability and economic growth, Ethiopia managed to raise a significant portion of money for the dam’s construction from people locally and from its diaspora. The construction of the dam eventually began in 2011.

Basin-wide cooperation

The dam now joins a number of existing dams, including the Aswan High Dam and the Roseires Dam. This makes a basin-wide cooperation and management imperative.

Given the ever increasing importance of coordinated management and operation downstream and upstream dams due to climate change, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt should manage all dams through the Nile Basin Commission – an organisation envisaged in the Cooperative Framework Agreement.

By Menna A. Farouk

MANSOURIYA, Egypt, Sept 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hassan Abdel Salam knew he was wasting a lot of water every time he flooded his fields to irrigate his mango crop, but wasn't aware of any alternative.

Then the farmer from northern Egypt learned about drip irrigation - putting tiny amounts of water just where it's needed - through a new government scheme.

Now pipes with small holes snake around his 10-feddan (10-acre) farm, dripping water directly to the base of each plant.

Since adopting the method at the start of the year, the 53-year-old said his farm in the village of Mansouriya, near Giza, uses at least 25% less water, fertiliser and energy and his harvests have increased by nearly 20%.

""It was a difficult decision for me at first because I was not familiar with the new system,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""But, when I was told by other farmers that it has a lot of benefits, I started applying it and it turned out to be beneficial, as I was told.""

Abel Salam is among hundreds of farmers in the country's north who have turned to water-saving sprinklers and drip irrigation in the latest phase of a government strategy to reduce water consumption and improve agricultural productivity.

Egypt suffers from significant water shortages, due to the combined effects of climate change, pollution and a growing population with increasing water demands, water and development experts say.

A new mega-dam upstream on the Nile River in Ethiopia also makes the country's access to river water - which it heavily depends on - less certain, officials say.

Negotiations have not yet resulted in an agreement on how much and when the hydropower dam can be filled and discharged.

According to Egypt's statistical agency, about 70% of the country's total water comes from its share of the Nile River, which amounts to 55.5 billion cubic meters a year based on a 1959 deal with upstream Sudan.

Egypt's farmers used more than 61 billion cubic meters of water in the fiscal year 2016/2017, making them by far the biggest water consumers, according to the agency.

But the 1959 deal isn't recognised by Ethiopia, which has now started filling the reservoir behind its new Grand Renaissance Dam.

MORE PEOPLE, LESS WATER

The governments new irrigation initiative, launched in January, is part of a wider 20-year water management plan that started in 2017, said Mohamed el-Sebaei, a spokesman for the water ministry.

The aim is to convert 5 million feddans to drip and sprinkler irrigation, up from the 1 million currently using those methods, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The responsibility for paying for, overseeing and maintaining the switch to more modern irrigation systems falls to the farmers. But to help, the government is offering loans farmers can pay off in instalments, Sebaei said.

Farmers who adopt the new methods will also get smart cards that give access to subsidized fertilizers, pesticides and seeds, he added.

""Through this, we want to encourage farmers to do the transition and lower costs for them,"" the spokesman said.

Agriculture provides work for more than half of Egypt's population, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

Abbas Sharaky, an associate professor of economic geology at Cairo University, said the fixed amount of water provided in the now-imperiled water-sharing agreement with Sudan is one of the challenges Egypt faces as it tries to tackle its shortages.

With a booming population and generally inefficient water management, that volume of Nile water is no longer enough, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The population is growing and demand is rising while at the same time the share is the same,"" he said.

The country currently has about 570 cubic meters (150,000 gallons) of water per person per year - just over half of the 1,000 cubic meters hydrologists say is the minimum to avoid water scarcity, according to the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation.

'WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED'

To deal with the growing shortfall, the government is building seawater desalination plants and constructing wastewater recycling facilities, as well as promoting water-smart irrigation, Sebaei said.

Sharaky noted that while sprinklers and drip irrigation can lower water use for many farmers, the techniques cannot be used on farms growing popular crops like wheat and sugarcane.

""The new methods can only be applied to crops of fruits and vegetables...they will not work with other water-hungry crops,"" he said.

Another challenge, Sharaky added, is convincing farmers to pay to switch to the new irrigation methods.

""Farmers are already struggling financially and asking them to pay extra money would increase burdens on them,"" he said.

Sayyed el-Azagi, a tomato farmer in el-Kanater el-Khairia, a city a few kilometres east of the village of Mansouriya, has not made the switch yet, saying it is too expensive.

""Converting from flood irrigation to sprinkler or drip irrigation would cost a lot of money and I am already suffering financially as a farmer. I will never be able to afford that,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The government has given farmers who use older irrigation methods a one-year grace period to move to the new systems or face a fine of 3,600 Egyptian pounds ($230).

According to Sebaei, moving to drip or sprinkler irrigation costs about 5,000-7,000 Egyptian pounds ($315-$445) for each feddan.

""The benefits of converting to these new methods are many and they are worth the money,"" he said.

Abdel Salam, the farmer who made the switch in Mansouriya, said he plans to spread the word to other farmers about how the method has transformed his farm.

""We do not know what tomorrow will bring. We have to be prepared,"" he said.

As the Mediterranean Sea becomes increasingly warm, extreme tropical weather could displace millions, and with that, alter the geography of North African countries.

Rising global temperatures, driven mainly by greenhouse gas emissions, will result in millions being displaced from the coastal cities of North Africa, according to a study published in the Nature Research Journal.

Melting glaciers and sea caps will raise the global sea levels by dangerous margins by the end of this century. This will mean increasingly extreme weather that could have the effect of displacing coastal communities in Tunisia and Egypt in particular.

The report warns that coastal cities in the Gulf of Tunis, which have a population of more than 2 million, are at higher risk from rising sea levels. They are expected to rise more than one metre by the end of the century.

Egypt, which is the Arab world's most populous nation, is another country that the report says is at a “very high risk” from population displacement as a result of rising sea levels.

Almost 40 million of Egypt’s 100 million population live in the Delta Region, where the Nile River, through hundreds of arteries, spills into the Meditterienian Sea.

This low-lying land has over the past few decades seen unplanned urban development with millions of people packed into land that could now be at risk from flooding.

Analysing the physical and social impact on the coastal areas of North Africa “is crucial for facilitating the implementation of flood risk management and protection for highly populated urban areas, as well as agricultural terrain,” the paper concluded.

“It is crucial to forecast these vulnerabilities in light of the predicted rise of sea surface temperatures, which are resulting in increased coastal flooding from severe weather events in the Mediterranean Basin,” the report added.

Tunisia and Egypt have more than a 70 percent chance of being impacted by rising sea levels. In contrast, Libya, which is nestled between the two states, only has a 7 percent chance.

The authors of the report focused on the increasing incidences of changing weather patterns in the region.

In September 2018, the Tunisian coastal governorate of Nabeul saw large flash floods with as much as 1.7 metres of rain, normally expected to fall in a six month period, falling within one day.

Again in October 2019, the coastal region of Ariana saw floods that brought an average of 90 to 220 mm of rainfall in one hour causing widespread material damage and loss of life.

The study at the Nature Research Journal also found that the Egyptian coastal areas in October 2019 were ravaged by “an extremely uncommon “medicane” bringing tropical-like storm-force winds, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding.”

Since the 1980s, the scientists conducting the study warned that the surface temperatures have increased between 1 and 2 degrees.

The rise in the temperatures is likely to act as a catalyst for future storms in the Mediterranean and in the Black Sea.

On the morning of Tuesday the 14 March 2020, Egypt was aggressively attacked by heavy rainfall caused flooding in multiple populated areas, causing massive property damages. More than 1000 houses were totally/ partially demolished by the wild effect of the strong gush of water. Also, extensive areas of agricultural land were destroyed by the effect of the downpours. Means of livelihood and income were negatively impacted. The floods claimed more than 30 human lives including children.

People lost their lives due to various causes e.g. electric shock, fall of the ceilings of their shelters, and fall from the above. In addition, 20 people were seriously injured while trying to escape of the enormously strong gush of the downpours. Nationwide, an estimation of 100,000 people are gravely affected, losing houses, lacking of medical attention, and material goods. Moreover, the flood has caused almost-radical sweeping of vast areas of agricultural land which means that too many farmers have lost their source of income.","Mon, 23 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1482468-Egypt_Floods_Emergency.png?itok=AVYh7rsP,"['houses', 'floods', 'alert', 'egypt', 'means', 'act', 'strong', 'lives', 'emergency', 'areas', '2020', 'lost', 'income', 'gush', 'fall', 'land', 'alliance', '22']",

Satellite image ©2020 Maxar Technologies via REUTERS

CAIRO – 18 March 2021: Ethiopia has shown, through its latest statements on the rules of filling and operating the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), its intention to impose a fait accompli on the Nile downstream countries (Egypt and Sudan), said Egyptian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ahmed Hafez in a statement on Thursday.

On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the inauguration of the GERD in a symposium in Addis Ababa on Wednesday, the Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs that his country is proceeding with the second phase of filing the controversial dam’s reservoir due in July 2021 although the three countries did not reach a legal and binding agreement on the dam operation and filling the dam.

“Completing the flagship project is a matter of assuring the sovereignty of the country,” said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, H.E. Demeke Mekonnen during the symposium.

""Egypt voiced its rejection of the Ethiopian statements because of the threat it poses to the interests of the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples and the impact of such unilateral measures on security and stability in the region,"" Hafez said.

“Ethiopian officials use the language of sovereignty in their talks about exploiting the resources of a cross-border river,” Hafez said, adding “it is impermissible to extend sovereignty over them [cross border rivers] or seek to monopolize them.”

The natural resources should be fairly shared on the basis of the rules of international law, without causing harm to any party, he added.

The Ethiopian statements reflect the absence of political desire in negotiation in time during which the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the current leader of the African Union, is making appreciable efforts to relaunch the path of negotiations and reach an agreement before the next season of the flood.

“Egypt and Sudan emphasized the importance of an active involvement of the international community in negotiations led and conducted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo through an international quartet that includes the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the negotiation process and to push the three countries and help them reach an agreement on the Renaissance Dam in the coming months,” he said.

However, Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry said two days ago that they haven’t received an official proposal to form a quartet committee that includes the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and the African Union to mediate the talks.

Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry also informed Congo delegation earlier this week that they ‘reject the quartet mediation proposal’ and that other parties cannot be involved in the Renaissance Dam negotiations.

Egypt and Sudan have voiced their concern about the possible harms and threats of the GERD and how the dam will negatively after their water share of the Nile in case Ethiopia abstained from signing a binding and legal agreement on the dam operation and filling its reservoir.

Early March, 2021, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi made a one-day visit to Sudan, during which he and the Sudanese leaders have affirmed rejection to Ethiopia’s unilateral plans to implement the second phase of the GERD filling whether or not an agreement among the three countries is reached.

Ethiopia has frequently affirmed it would implement the second filling of the dam next July under any circumstances.

Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel-Atti has said previously hat Sudan worried because of what happened last year when Ethiopia began filling the dam reservoir without notifying Sudan, adding that Sudan was negatively affected.

In mid-July 2020, Ethiopian authorities unilaterally carried out the first phase of the filling process with 4.9 billion cubic meters; and it is expected that the second phase of the filling would reach 13 billion cubic meters in July.

The dispute among Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia dates back to May 2011 when Ethiopia started building the dam; Egypt voiced concern over its water share [55.5 billion cubic meters].

As Democratic Congo is chairing the AU for the year 2021, it is attempting to revive stalling negotiations between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. However, few hours before Sisi’s official visit to Sudan, Ethiopian Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy Seleshi Bekele said on Thursday that his country is looking forward to a “win-win solution” for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam through trilateral negotiation.

Bekele’s remarks came after he hosted a delegation from the Democratic Republic of Congo to discuss the ongoing negotiations with Egypt and Sudan to reach a deal on GERD.

In 2015, the three countries signed the Declaration of Principles, per which the downstream countries should not be negatively affected by the construction of the dam.

In October 2019, Egypt blamed Addis Ababa for hindering a final agreement concerning a technical problem, calling for activating Article No. 10 of the Declaration of Principles, which stipulates that if the three countries could not find a solution to these disputes, they have to ask for mediation.

Washington had brokered tripartite negotiations among the three countries, in the presence of the President of the World Bank (WB) starting from November 6, 2019 until February 27 and 28, 2020.

During these rounds of talks, tangible outcomes were agreed on among the three parties concerning the rules and mechanism of operating the dam and the filling process of the reservoir during drought and prolonged drought; however, an agreement was not sealed.

Constructions in the Grand Renaissance Dam started on April 2, 2011 at a cost of $4.8 billion. The dam is located on the Blue Nile with a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters and is expected to generate up to 6,000 megawatts of power.","Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202007260255115511.jpg,"['egypt', 'ethiopia', 'agreement', 'downstream', 'sudan', 'nile', 'fait', 'countries', 'ethiopian', 'reach', 'renaissance', 'dam', 'accompli', 'imposes', 'filling']",

The 6.2 magnitude earthquake Friday that killed at least 84 people was one of multiple recent disasters in Indonesia.

President Joko Widodo, who visited a flood-hit area on Borneo island on Monday, visited the quake-hit areas of West Sulawesi province Tuesday to reassure people the government’s response is reaching those who are struggling.

He pledged to rebuild government buildings that collapsed and to help people rebuild their damaged houses with aid of up to 50 million rupiah ($3,560) as he toured the hard-hit city of Mamuju, a city of nearly 300,000 people and the provincial capital.

“We hope with the assistance by the central government can hasten recovery of collapsed houses and economy,” he said in a speech after visiting survivors being housed in shelters on a soccer field. “The government services should be returned to normal,” he said.

The National Search and Rescue Agency counted at least 30,000 survivors who have moved to shelters in Mamuju and its neighboring district of Majene in West Sulawesi, as the government and aid agencies pooled efforts to meet the survival needs of shaken communities.

Four days after the disaster, the streets of Mamuju were still covered in debris and most people have slept outdoors, fearful their homes would crumble if strong aftershocks come. Sniffer dogs were being used to search for bodies and possible survivors.

The president had traveled Monday to flood-affected areas in South Kalimantan province on Borneo, the island known for rainforests and orangutans where floods since last week have inundated several regions. The floods killed several villagers and forced tens thousands of people to flee their homes. Floods also reported in many other provinces in the vast archipelago nation.

Widodo said rainfall caused the floods in South Kalimantan, but environmentalists blame deforestation by mining, palm oil and agricultural industries.

The quake and flood disasters follow a deadly landslide in West Java on Jan. 9 that left 40 people buried in tons of mud. On the same day, a Sriwijaya Air jet nosedived into the Java Sea, killing all 62 people on board.

Indonesia also last week began vaccinating health workers with a COVID-19 vaccine in a campaign that aims to immunize two-thirds of the population in the world’s fourth most populous country. It has confirmed more than 917,000 infections and 26,000 deaths from the pandemic, the most in Southeast Asia.

And on Saturday, Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely populated island of Java, spewed hot clouds as far away as 4.5 kilometers (nearly three miles). The eruption caused panic but no casualties.

Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is lined with seismic faults and is frequently hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. Annual monsoon flooding also causes problems, and its transit infrastructure is often weak and stretched beyond its capacity.

American and Egyptian archaeologists have unearthed what could be the oldest known beer factory at one of the most prominent archaeological sites of ancient Egypt, a top antiquities official said Saturday.

Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the factory was found in Abydos, an ancient burial ground located in the desert west of the Nile River, over 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Cairo.

He said the factory apparently dates back to the region of King Narmer, who is widely known for his unification of ancient Egypt at the beginning of the First Dynastic Period (3150 B.C.- 2613 B.C.).

Archaeologists found eight huge units — each is 20 meters (about 65 feet) long and 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) wide. Each unit includes some 40 pottery basins in two rows, which had been used to heat up a mixture of grains and water to produce beer, Waziri said.

The joint mission is co-chaired by Dr. Matthew Adams of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and Deborah Vischak, assistant professor of ancient Egyptian art history and archaeology at Princeton University.

Adams said the factory was apparently built in this area to provide royal rituals with beer, given that archaeologists found evidences showing the use of beer in sacrificial rites of ancient Egyptians.

British archaeologists were the first to mention the existence of that factory early 1900s, but they couldn't determine its location, the antiquities ministry said.

With its vast cemeteries and temples from the earliest times of ancient Egypt, Abydos was known for monuments honoring Osiris, ancient Egypt's god of underworld and the deity responsible for judging souls in the afterlife.

The necropolis had been used in every period of early Egyptian history, from the prehistoric age to Roman times.

BEIRUT: Calls for Syrians in Lebanon to return to their country have become a deeply divisive politicized issue over the decade-long civil war in Syria, one which has recently been exacerbated by the upcoming election in Syria.



On Thursday, groups of angry Lebanese beat up Syrian expatriates and refugees heading to the Syrian embassy to cast their votes for next Wednesday's election, and threw stones at their vehicles, outraged over what they perceive as an organized vote for Assad. There have been rumors that Hezbollah organized transport for voters from across Lebanon to the embassy.



Assad is running for a fourth term, facing symbolic competition from two other candidates in a vote that is all but guaranteed to see him continue as president.



The Syrian opposition — as well as many Western and Arab countries — see the election as a sham designed to give Assad’s reign a veneer of legitimacy. The election also violates UN resolutions that call for a new constitution before a presidential vote.



Lebanon hosts 865,531 registered Syrian refugees, and there are several hundred thousand Syrians residing in Lebanon with their families as daily or seasonal workers.



Syrians in Lebanon include regime supporters and opposition figures who fled to Lebanon because of the war. Lebanon is in the midst of a severe economic crisis and is calling for Syrian refugees to return to their country because of the high cost of hosting them.



The roads leading to the embassy area in Yarzeh were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Assad and the regime army, waving Syrian flags and carrying pictures of Assad. They confirmed to the media before and after the polls that they had voted for Assad.



Many Lebanese people reacted angrily to this. Members of the Lebanese Forces party went to the coastal highway that connects northern Lebanon with Beirut, and blocked cars carrying pictures of Assad, or Syrian flags, or banners for the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) — an ally of the Syrian regime, smashed car windows, and assaulted their occupants.

FAST FACT The roads leading to the Syrian Embassy area in Lebanon were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Bashar Assad.

They told the media: “They are loyal to Assad, so why are they still in Lebanon as refugees?”



Members of the Lebanese Forces party also said that Assad-supporting Syrians should have their refugee status removed.



Similar scenes took place in Beirut’s Ashrafieh neighborhood, where young Lebanese men chased a car displaying the Syrian flag. The Lebanese army intervened to separate the two sides.



Fifty-four-year-old Mohsen Saleh Al-Ahmad died while traveling by bus from Chtaura, Bekaa, to the embassy. According to official preliminary investigations, he had a heart attack.



Since Thursday morning’s events, the army has tightened security in and around the Syrian Embassy, which is located in the vicinity of the Ministry of Defense and the Army Command, and on the roads leading to it.



But further clashes broke out in the afternoon, this time instigated by Syrians, who reportedly got off the buses transporting them along the coastal road near Nahr Al-Kalb and proceeded to assault passers-by and throw stones at cars, injuring several people, including journalists from MTV.



Some Lebanese politicians were quick to condemn the actions of pro-Assad Syrian voters.



Former minister May Chidiac said: “They claim to be displaced and are calling on the international community to support them with fresh dollars while they are an additional burden on Lebanon’s overstretched economy! At the doors of the Syrian embassy, ​​they are chanting for Bashar Assad. As long as you are not threatened, go back to where you came from.”



Another former minister, Richard Kouyoumdjian, said: “Swear allegiance to Bashar Assad in your country, not in ours. You are opportunists and you are not displaced.”



But former Hezbollah MP Nawar Al-Sahili described attacks on Syrian voters as demonstrating “racism and a lack of integrity.”



Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Abdul Karim Ali said those attacks were “painful, and we refer (them) to the concerned authorities” and called on Lebanon “to cooperate to find quick exits for the return of the Syrians to their country.”



The Syrian diplomat said that the large number of voters “reflects the desire of Syrian people to return to a safety that they have not found outside Syria.”



Lisa Abu Khaled, spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Arab News: “The UNHCR has received reports of incidents involving pressure, threats, and harassment affecting Syrian refugees in Lebanon and in relation to the Syrian presidential elections. The reported incidents range from confiscation of documents to threats of physical harm.”



She added: “Voting is a personal choice and is not linked to refugee status, nor to a person’s need for international protection. Voting will not lead to the loss of refugee status. The UNHCR has received reports of intimidation and pressure, which may have pushed a number of refugees to participate in the elections.



“The UNHCR is a non-political humanitarian organization, and therefore does not play any role in the Syrian elections,” she continued. “That said, if and when incidents of threats and pressure are reported by refugees, we work with the concerned stakeholders in Lebanon to ensure that refugees continue to be protected in Lebanon.”



Not all Syrian refugees in Lebanon exercised their right to vote. Abu Ahmad, a camp supervisor in a refugee camp in Arsal, told Arab News: “Most people are not interested. There may be some who voted at the embassy, ​​but they do not (symbolize) a collective conviction. Refugees are frustrated and cannot forget their suffering and the horrors they experienced during their displacement.



“What has changed now? How can Assad be re-elected? On what basis? People were hoping for some change to happen, but what is happening is the polishing of the image of Bashar Assad in front of the international community,” he continued. “Maintaining my strength today is more beneficial than wasting my time in front of the ballot box. Here, I feel safe even though I am homeless.”



Caretaker Social Affairs and Tourism Minister Ramzi Musharrafieh, who visited Syria a few weeks ago and discussed the return of refugees, denounced “all the infringements that have occurred and are unjustified,” and said that “protecting (Syrian voters) is our priority.”



Former MP Khaled Al-Daher, who has been a major advocate for Syrian refugees in Lebanon in the past, said on Thursday: “Anyone who wants to elect Bashar Assad from among the refugees in Lebanon will not have refugee status and must leave the Lebanese territories because they have no problem with the Syrian regime, but are in Lebanon for specific goals and objectives.”","Sat, 03 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2020/10/03/2295711-1240275788.png,"['lebanon', 'gift', 'egypt', 'refugee', 'floodhit', 'syrians', 'bread', 'sudan', 'lebanese', 'bridge', 'helps', 'air', 'embassy', 'voters', 'assad', 'return', 'refugees', 'syrian']", 
43,43,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Typhoon Vamco triggers worst floods in Philippine capital in years - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/typhoon-vamco-triggers-worst-floods-in-philippine-capital-in-years/,"MANILA (Reuters) – Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered government agencies to rush aid to people affected by Typhoon Vamco, after the storm killed at least two people and brought the worst flooding in the capital Manila in years.

Tens of thousands of homes in low-lying suburbs were submerged by the floods, prompting residents to scramble onto rooftops awaiting rescue.

Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, battered a nation still reeling from Goni, the world’s most powerful typhoon this year that killed 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes early in November.

“Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind,” Duterte said in a national address, pledging shelter, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counselling.

The latest typhoon, which has also left four missing, comes as the Philippines is still grappling with a wave of COVID-19 infections and a battered economy.

In some suburbs east of Manila residents took refuge on their flooded homes.

“Just a few steps remaining on our third floor and we have yet to see any rescuer,” Carla Mhaye Suico, a resident in Pasig City, told DZBB radio, while sheltering with 15 family members and neighbours.

Roughly 40,000 homes had been either fully or partially submerged in Marikina City, its mayor, Marcelino Teodoro, told DZMM radio station, calling the situation “overwhelming” and the worst since a typhoon flooded large swathes of Manila in 2009.

“The local government cannot handle this,” Teodoro said, requesting motorized boats and airlifts.

Nearly three million households in and around Manila were without power as people waded through waist-high floods, carrying valuables and pets.

Coast guards had to swim in flood waters as high as electricity poles, while rescue workers used rubber boats and makeshift floats to carry children and the elderly to safety.

Big waves and strong winds in Manila Bay budged a tanker, damaging a bridge.

Flights and mass transit in Manila were suspended while the coast guard stopped port operations. Government work was suspended and financial markets were shut.

Vamco has now weakened, with sustained winds of 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), after exiting Luzon island, home to half of the Philippines’ 108 million people.

The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, experiences around 20 tropical storms a year that often continue on their track to hit Vietnam, China and Taiwan.

Vamco is forecast to head towards Vietnam. Floods and mudslides over the past month have killed at least 160 people in central Vietnam, left dozens missing and damaged 390,000 houses.","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020/11/11.jpg,"['philippines', 'vamco', 'floods', 'killed', 'capital', 'homes', 'vietnam', 'thousands', 'told', 'typhoon', 'triggers', 'worst', 'winds']",

The ministry of water resources and irrigation has announced a state of public alert for dealing with the rainy season, stressing the readiness for the protection facilities against the dangers of torrents.

“Over the past few years, the ministry has been carrying out a plan for establishing dams and artificial lakes to avoid flooding catastrophes that often badly impact some cities in southern Egypt,” Mohamed Ghanem, spokesperson of the ministry of water resources and irrigation told Xinhua in a recent interview.

“We have founded a large number of dams in Sinai, Red Sea and Matrouh provinces and other areas with a cost of 127 million U.S. dollars,” Ghanem said, noting that there are still some other projects under construction.

He explained that several artificial lakes for reserving the water have been established in front of the dams and proved effective especially in the Bedouin areas in Sinai over a long period of time.

He added that the government not only works to prevent the torrents from destroying the water facilities but also aims at controlling the watercourse for people living near the dams and lakes.

Meanwhile, Ahmad Fawzy, professor of water resources with the Cairo-based Desert Research Center, said that the country’s preparedness plan works on increase the water storage by diverting the course of the torrents to the Nile River, the canals and the ground tanks.

He explained that redirecting the water required establishing more dams, cleaning the sewers and torrent trajectories to turn the rainfalls into a blessing for the farmers.

“The heavy rainfalls have negative effects on the substructure system in Egypt,” he added, deeming that climate change will cause more rains in the coming years.

Egypt saves around 1 billion cubic meters of water annually from the rain and torrents, which constitutes less than 2 percent of the country’s renewable water resources, according to Abbas Sharaqy, professor of water resources at Cairo University.

He said that Egypt has a fixed share of Nile water over the past 50 years despite the double increase of the population, and the government has to protect the people from the dangers of flood and make best use of the water storage.

He said rainfalls threaten the cities along the Red Sea and the provinces of Upper Egypt from October to March each year and their impacts depend on the quantities of rains, the degree of downhill, and the distance from the towns.

He hailed the government precautionary plans over the past years, however, he called for establishing a speed emergency unit to deal with the torrent dangers.

On Tuesday, the Egyptian army announced that the people and military defense forces have implemented joint exercises in cooperation with the country’s executive bodies for tackling the crisis of forecasted rainfalls, floods and torrents in several provinces.","Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://africa.cgtn.com/wp-content/photo-gallery/2020/03/138871421_15840596185081n.jpg,"['egypt', 'challenges', 'water', 'rainfalls', 'plan', 'adopts', 'provinces', 'torrents', 'dams', 'resources', 'ministry', 'tackle', 'rain', 'past', 'measures']", 
45,45,FL-2020-000038-EGY,South Asia counts losses from devastating monsoon floods - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/south-asia-counts-losses-from-devastating-monsoon-floods/,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — When the Dharala River burst its banks in early July, Kamal Hossain left his home with five members of his family to take shelter in a school in northern Bangladesh, carrying their most prized belongings: cattle, a few sacks of rice and clothes.

Like him, an estimated 17.5 million people across South Asia are suffering as a result of the devastation of this year’s monsoon floods. Nearly 700 have died.

A third of Bangladesh went underwater, including Hossain’s district of Kurigram, after most of its 16 rivers overflowed following torrential rains and violent onrush of waters from upstream India, which was also tormented by the floods as rivers cut their ways from as far as the Himalayan nation of Nepal. Bangladesh, which is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, is the last channel through which waters are drained into the Bay of Bengal.

Experts have long been warning that a densely populated delta country like Bangladesh is one of the worst victims of climate change, and severe and frequent floods indicate that something has gone wrong.

“The current major floods affecting millions of people in Bangladesh along with super cyclone Amphan that hit the country a few months ago are both linked to human induced climate now becoming a reality,” said Saleemul Huq, a Bangladeshi expert on climate change and director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development.

He said Bangladesh needs to ramp up its diplomacy to convince global powers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as many countries had agreed in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.

The impact of global warming in South Asia is evident by a steady sea level rise, changes in ambient temperature and rainfall patterns and an increase in cyclonic activity, experts say. More landslides and flooding are projected across the region, which is home to almost one-fourth of the world’s population. Thousands have already been displaced from low-lying islands in the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India.

When upstream countries like India or Nepal flush out waters, a district like Kurigram pays the price.

“Some 300,000 people have either lost their homes or crops. Some 400 small river islands were completely under water,” said Mohammed Rezaul Karim, a top government official in Kurigram. “This is a great worry for us.”

Azmat Ulla, the Bangladesh head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said disasters like floods are becoming more frequent and dangerous.

“Waters are going down, but people’s homes and other infrastructures are being devoured by river erosion,” he said. “Rebuilding their lives is not so easy.”

While the national governments are assessing the extent of damage, the European Union said this week it will provide US$1.94 million in aid. The support comes on top of the $2.21 million announced earlier this year to support those affected by a series of disasters, including Cyclone Amphan that ravaged India and Bangladesh in May.

In Nepal, a repeat of the deadly 1993 floods that were caused by the biggest rainfall on record could be catastrophic, said Shreekamal Dwivedi, a senior engineering geologist at the government’s Venerable Landslides Management Project.

Authorities in one of India’s worst-hit states are also counting losses.

About 5.7 million out of Assam’s 30 million people have been hit by the deluge with the total loss of property and crops estimated at $306 million. Assam faces floods every year when waters of the Brahmaputra, one of Asia’s largest rivers that originates in the Tibetan Himalayas, and its tributaries overflow.

After more than 1.5 months in shelter, Hossain is preparing to return home, but faces uncertainty over how to rebuild with almost no money in hand. His only choice is to wait for the next harvest two months away.

“I have lost everything. I don’t know what will happen next,” he said.

47,47,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Suez Canal unblocked: Hilarious memes flood social media as Ever Given floats again - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/suez-canal-unblocked-social-media-flooded-with-memes-as-ever-given-is-freed-7251131/,"Even though the crisis at a key maritime route came to an end, memes and jokes continues on social media.

Almost after a week after the Ever Given container ship blocked the essential Suez Canal, it was dislodged and floating again on Monday. Thanks to the congregation of tugboats and dredgers that freed the cargo ship from Egypt’s coast, traffic resumed in crucial shipping route that had severely affected global supply chains and economy. As videos of the ship moving went viral, so did memes and jokes, and strangely many people on the internet revolted saying: “put it back”.

At dawn on Monday, rescue workers from the SCA working with a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage partially refloated the ship and straightened it in the canal. After several hours, it shifted briefly back across the canal before being manoeuvred free by tugs as the tide changed, Reuters reported.

Video of the cargo ship leaving canal, with all the crew involved in the operation blowing horns after the route was unblocked, flooded social media. The Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.

The canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Monday’s events after days of silence about the blockage. “Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis,” he wrote on Facebook, “despite the massive technical complexity.”

However, as most celebrated the occasion, mostly trade and maritime officials, rescue crews, and politicians, netizens were upset that the entertaining subject which spewed torrents of memes and jokes, came to an end, urging salvage teams to “put it back”. Twitter was flooded with memes and GIFs and ‘Put it back’ dominated social media trends.

Soon, #SuezUnblocked started to trend on Twitter and many jokes followed. While some cracked jokes to compare the unblocking scenes with that from Mama Mia! others debated who should be credited for the important mission, from cast of Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle to Superman, people came up with many names leaving social media abuzz. Some even compared what it must feel like now that the canal is freed.

Farther downstream, the water inches up the concrete wall of a towering, $4.5 billion hydroelectric dam across the Nile, the largest in Africa, now moving closer to completion. A moment that Ethiopians have anticipated eagerly for a decade — and which Egyptians have come to dread — has finally arrived.

Satellite images released this week showed water pouring into the reservoir behind the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam — which will be nearly twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Ethiopia hopes the project will double its electricity production, bolster its economy, and help unify its people at a time of often-violent divisions.

#FillTheDam read one popular hashtag on Ethiopian social media this week.

In remarks to Egypt Today, Mahmoud Nafei, chairman of the relevant sewerage company, said 300,000 drains have been cleaned, making up 98 percent of drains across the governorate.

Heavy rains in the northern governorate and also Cairo caused floods, obstructed traffic and inundated cars several times during rainy seasons over the past years.

In March this year, several people died as heavy rains hit the capital.

The preparations in Alexandria come two weeks after Upper Egypt and the Red Sea coast have been struck with floods after heavy rain, prompting the police traffic department to close off several highways in the area.

The western Sohag-Qena road, Sheikh-Fadl-Ras Ghareb road, Qift-Quseir road, Safaga-Sohag road, Luxor-Nag Hammadi road, Luxor-Wadi Gedid road, Ghareb-Minya were closed.

In western Luxor, rain falling down from Ruzaiqat mountain caused floods. The city council dispatched equipment to change the course of the torrent into flood drainage systems so it does not reach homes in this mountainous area.

Sharaqy stated during a Zoom meeting with African journalists that Egypt has been trying to reach an agreement between itself, Ethiopia, and Sudan for a full decade now with help from the African Union, and the matter has been brought forth to the United Nations Security Council.

Sharaqy also discussed during the meeting Sudan’s flood crisis that began in July and left much of the country in complete disaster.

He asserted a list of recommendations to Sudan to confront the catastrophe, at the top of which is the country’s need for an emergency rapid relief plan to help the country through its annual flood season.

The need for Egyptian-Sudanese cooperation to implement water projects in Sudan also ranked high on the list.

Additionally, Sharaqy recommended organizing urban and agricultural expansion in relation to waterways in Sudan, and avoiding building close to the Nile.

He stressed the need to construct a number of small dams along the Nile and modernize existing ones in accordance with global engineering standards.

Sudan’s devastating floods began when continuous heavy rainfall caused the Nile River to reach its highest level in over a century.

The country’s flood crisis has left 102 people dead, dozens injured, and over 100,000 homes destroyed.

Egypt’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources announced in late August that negotiations on the GERD have once again stalled, due to continued disagreements between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan on legal and technical points.

Egypt, which relies considerably on freshwater from the Nile, has voiced fears that the GERD would negatively impact the country’s water supply, and has insisted that measures be put in place to protect downstream countries in case of drought during the dam’s filling process.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, has stressed the importance of the project to bolster its economy, where more than half of the population currently lives without access to electricity.

Sudan is somewhat caught in the middle of the conflicting interests of Egypt and Ethiopia. There is potential for the country to develop further with the GERD’s operation, but government officials worry that it could also threaten preexisting dams.

A meeting between the water ministers from the three countries on August 28 did not result in a unified draft proposal to be presented to the African Union bureau, headed by South Africa.

Mr. Zaki has not publicly addressed the accusations but the prosecutor-general said Monday that he had denied most of them. A prominent television host who said he had spoken with Mr. Zaki’s father, a telecommunications executive, also said that Mr. Zaki rejected the allegations.

The wave of outrage against Mr. Zaki was invigorated by his status as a member of Egypt’s elite.

After graduating from the American International School, one of the most expensive high schools in Cairo, he attended the American University in Cairo starting in 2016, where fellow students say that he quickly gained a reputation for bad behavior toward women.

As a freshman, he was pushed out of the college salsa club after numerous women complained of harassment, said Kareem Elhosseni, who was then vice president of the club.

According to several accounts posted in the past week, Mr. Zaki used numerous ruses to gain women’s phone numbers, sometimes claiming to belong to social clubs that did not exist. He pressured women to provide intimate photos that he later used to coerce them into sex, threatening to send the images to their parents if the women refused.

Or he “attracted their sympathy by claiming he was going through a crisis,” the prosecutor said, then lured them to his home in a gated community where he sexually assaulted them.

One accuser, an 18-year-old woman he met on Tinder, said he seemed like “a decent guy.” But the conversation quickly turned to demands that she come to his house to perform sex acts.

52,52,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt has genuine intention to reach an agreement on GERD before flood season: Sisi - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/408479/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-has-genuine-intention-to-reach-an-agreement-.aspx,"Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Sunday that Egypt has a genuine political intention to reach an agreement on the Ethiopian dam (GERD) at the earliest opportunity and before the flood season.

El-Sisi’s remarks came in a message handed by Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry to Congolese President and Chair of the African Union this year Félix Antoine Tshisekedi, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry read.

The Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Sudanese foreign and irrigation ministers are currently holding meetings in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa to resume talks on the GERD dispute under the auspices of the African Union.

Egypt and Sudan have warned of serious implications to their people and water interests if the second phase of filling the GERD is implemented without an agreement next July.

Ethiopia, however, reiterated its plans to complete the filling in that date whether or not an agreement is reached.

In his message, El-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support to the efforts made by the Congolese president to help reach an agreement on the GERD.

El-Sisi said Egypt hopes that the current African Union-sponsored meetings succeed in launching an effective path for negotiations with the participation of international partners.

This effective path of negotiations should enable the three concerned countries to find solutions to the disputed technical and legal issues, with the aim of formulating a comprehensive agreement on the filling and operation of the dam, El-Sisi said in the message.

Egypt has welcomed and endorsed a Sudanese proposal in February to involve international partners as mediators in the talks. This includes a quartet of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and the African Union. Ethiopia rejected the proposal, saying it is ready to talk only under the auspices of the African Union.

El-Sisi’s message hailed the Congolese efforts aiming to reach a balanced, legally binding agreement on the dam that would secure the interests of the three countries and enhance integrity and cooperation among them.

Sisi’s remarks come only a week after he took a hard line on the GERD dispute, warning that a compromise in Egypt’s water share was a “red line.” He pledged action if the country’s share of water from the Nile is jeopardised.

“No one can take a drop of water from Egypt,” El-Sisi said, warning of “inconceivable instability in the region that no one could imagine” if that is to happen.

Taking part in the Kinshasa talks, scheduled for 4-5 April, FM Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has maintained a genuine political will over the past 10 years to reach an agreement on the GERD.

He said this agreement should achieve Ethiopian developmental goals and, at the same time, protect the interests of Egypt and Sudan.

Shoukry “stressed the necessity that the Kinshasa meetings lead to launching a new round of negotiations that are characterised with efficiency and seriousness,” the foreign ministry said.

The FM also affirmed the need for international partners to attend the desired round of talks to guarantee their success.

These negotiations are considered the last chance that has to be exploited by the three countries in order to reach an agreement during the coming months and before the next flood season, Shoukry said.

Shoukry affirmed Egypt’s keenness to resolve the controversial issues that have obstructed previous rounds of negotiations.

Egypt’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Ati also attended the talks and the meeting with the Congolese president.

Shoukry and Abdel-Ati reviewed with President Tshisekedi Egypt’s efforts over the last decade to reach an agreement on the GERD.

Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has consistently introduced solutions and proposals on the issue in a way that addresses Ethiopian concerns.

These solutions and proposals were meant to guarantee the achievement of Ethiopian developmental goals and also protect the interests of the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan, Shoukry added.

The success of the current efforts to settle the GERD issue and avoid the aggravation of the situation in a region already suffering from turmoil and instability, however, requires a political will from all parties to reach a just agreement, Shoukry said.

Tshisekedi on Sunday said the goal of the Kinshasa talks is to revive the negotiation process among the three countries on the GERD, Al-Arabiya reported.

He affirmed the necessity to reach solutions to the issue within the framework of the African Union.

Tshisekedi also called for taking into account the humanitarian dimension of the GERD issue and working to achieve the interests of the three countries’ peoples.

Egyptian swimmer Omar Sayed Shaaban soared to success when he set a new record for the highest jump out of water while wearing a monofin.

The 21-year-old from Ismailia reached the unusual event’s new best height when he made a spectacular leap of 7 feet 11 inches (2.3 meters), according to Guinness World Records.

A monofin is a single fin that fits over both feet.

Guinness World Records showcased Shaaban’s achievement Thursday in a TikTok post.

Shaaban powered past a record held since 2011 by three men, Italy’s Cesare Fumarola and Stefano Figini and Egypt’s Soliman Sayed, who each managed jumps of 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters).

Shaaban’s jump took place at an Egyptian Diving and Lifesaving Federation event in Cairo in November.

In a report published by the Guinness World Records, Shaaban explained the workout routine that gives him his merman-like abilities.

“Bigger muscles make it hard to sprint in water, so I work out to … increase flexibility, enhance muscle reflexes and of course build stronger legs,” he said.

Shaaban is also one of the world’s fastest underwater sprinters, the report said.

“Swimming is peaceful. A rush of unexplainable thoughts crosses your mind underwater, but it’s certainly different and healing,” Shaaban told Guinness World Records.

“As a sprinter, I understand that even thinking burns oxygen so I tend to focus on the present moment.

Ancient mummies of Egypt’s royal pharaohs will emerge from their resting places this weekend and parade through the streets of Cairo in search of a new home.

What sounds like the plot of a movie is in fact part of a lavish celebration of Egypt’s history and a project to relocate some of its greatest treasures to a new high tech facility.

On Saturday, the mummies of Ramses the Great and 21 of his fellow pharaohs will take part in what is being billed as “The Pharaoh’s Golden Parade,” a highly anticipated event organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

It’s reported that the celebrations will include horse-drawn chariots, choirs singing in ancient languages and a plethora of movie stars and dignitaries, but Egyptian authorities have kept official details of the event under lock and key.

“It is a surprise,” Ahmed Ghoneim, executive director of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, the institution which will be the final resting place for the mummies, tells CNN.

Nevertheless, it’s hard to keep an event of this magnitude a surprise, especially when dress rehearsals recently took place in the center of Cairo. Excited Egyptians snapped photos of custom-made mummy vehicles adorned with golden ancient motifs and hastily uploaded them to social media.

The final move

The aim of the parade is to move the 18 kings and four queens of Egypt, along with their coffins and belongings, from their old home at The Egyptian Museum.

They’ll be transported five kilometers (three miles) south, to their new high-tech resting place at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC).

No, not the vast Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza which is also due to open to the public later this year. The NMEC is a completely different museum in Cairo’s Fustat neighborhood that will complete a trio of must-see Egyptian-themed museums in and around Cairo.

Although the NMEC had a partial opening in 2017, the parade will signify the grand opening.

“It’s a presidential opening,” says Ghoneim. And the completion of the Hall of Royal Mummies which looks to be a unique museum experience.

“The whole idea is not the mummies, the whole idea is how you display the mummies… It’s how you tell the story, it’s the environment, it’s the ambiance that you feel when you’re getting in,” he adds.

Ghoneim says visitors entering the Hall of Royal Mummies will experience something akin to entering a tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

All 22 royal mummies are from the New Kingdom, an era where tombs were built underground with hidden entrances to ward off grave robbers. A world apart, and about 600 years, from their flamboyant Old Kingdom royal counterparts who built colossal pyramid tombs.

Preparing the mummies

Dr. Mostafa Ismail, head of conservation at the Mummies Conservation Lab and Storeroom at the NMEC, led a team of 48 people to prepare the royal mummies.

The conservation process, he tells CNN, involves placing each mummy in an oxygen-free, nitrogen capsule “which can keep it preserved without being damaged from the effects of humidity, especially we’re talking about bacteria, fungi, and insects.”

The capsule is surrounded by soft material that distributes pressure and reduces vibrations during transportation.

When the mummies arrive at the NMEC, the display units will have the exact same conditions as the nitrogen capsules. “So there will not be any shock for the mummy when we take it from the box and put it in these units,” Ismail adds.

Accompanying each mummy will be any belongings discovered alongside them, including their coffins.

Displays will also show CT scans which reveal what is beneath the wraps, and sometimes any breaks in bones or diseases that afflicted the royals.

“The main thing that we want the visitors to know about these mummies, is how they have been mummified and preserved for a long time.”

When asked if his team discovered anything new about the mummies in preparing them for the move, Ismail remarked: “a lot of things,” but none that he would reveal before the parade. So there are more surprises to come.

A new cultural hub in Cairo

Undoubtedly the Hall of Royal Mummies will be the star attraction for visitors to The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, but Executive Director Ahmed Ghoneim hopes to position the museum differently to its neighboring institutions.

“I’m not focusing on the Pharaonic era as most people would think,” he says. “Most Egyptians and non-Egyptians, whenever they go to an Egyptian museum then they think they’re going to see the pharaohs.

“Here I’m setting myself differently, I’m telling a different story, going across history and coming to the present.”

The first temporary exhibition will focus on Egyptian textiles and fashion. “All of the history from carpets to clothing” says Ghoneim.

Through the exhibits the museum will tell a richer story of the achievements of Egyptian civilization but the museum will also be a cultural hub.

“A place that offers everything, part educational, part cultural, part amusement, part night time dining place, and so on. It’s something that’s unique.”

And at last, 3,234 years after his death, Rameses II may finally be laid to rest.

The museum will be open to the public the day after the parade, on April 4, with the Hall of Royal Mummies opening two weeks later on April 18. The Pharaoh’s Golden Parade will be streamed live on the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ YouTube channel.","Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['museum', 'streets', 'egyptian', 'parade', 'place', 'royal', 'hall', 'mummies', 'mummy', 'pharaohs', 'cairo', 'ancient', 'nmec']",

When archaeologists, funded by University of California benefactor Phoebe A. Hearst, found hundreds of crocodile mummies on an expedition to Northern Egypt in 1899, they were annoyed. They were searching for human mummies and artifacts, fueled by Egyptomania — the Western obsession with all things Egyptian.

When they found papyri — paper’s earliest ancestor — stuffed inside of the mummies with text written on it by Egyptians thousands of years before, they were suddenly interested. But instead of collecting the mummies, they began to break them open, remove the papyri and discard the crocodiles.

Now, more than 100 years later, 19 mummified crocodiles are part of the Egyptian collection at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at UC Berkeley. These mummies, along with a collection of papyri held by the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri at the Bancroft Library, give us clues about how everyday ancient Egyptians lived and how far they went to appease crocodiles, hoping their devotion would win them some good will toward humankind.

Read an extended written version of Fiat Vox episode #70: “What crocodile mummies can tell us about everyday life in ancient Egypt.”

In 1899, two archaeologists — Arthur Hunt and Bernard Grenfell — were on an expedition in Northern Egypt in an ancient town called Tebtunis. (It’s now Umm el-Baragat.) With funding from famed University of California benefactor Phoebe A. Hearst, they were searching for human mummies and other ancient artifacts.

At the time, there was a Western fascination with ancient Egypt, later coined Egyptomania. Americans and Europeans were after all things Egyptian — especially human mummies, partly because the mummies represented the Western obsession with bringing the dead back to life.

While the archaeologists and their team were excavating the town’s subterranean cemeteries, they did find human mummies, but they also found other mummies — ones they didn’t expect to find: crocodile mummies.

Instead of being excited about the discovery, they saw the reptilian mummies as a nuisance, getting in the way of what they really wanted.

Rita Lucarelli is a professor of Egyptology in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at UC Berkeley.

“There’s even a story that, at a certain point, a workman was super frustrated that he found yet another crocodile mummy,” says Lucarelli. “When he threw it away, the mummy broke open and revealed that it was stuffed with papyri.”

Papyri is paper’s earliest ancestor, made from the papyrus plant. On the papyri that was stuffed inside of the mummies was text written by Egyptians thousands of years before.

Suddenly, the archeologists were interested in the crocodile mummies. But only for the papyri. So, the team began to break open the mummies, remove the papyri and then discard the crocodiles.

Two years later, in 1901, what today is called the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology was founded at the University of California. Lucarelli is the museum’s faculty curator of Egyptology.

She says that up to 17,000 ancient Egyptian artifacts from various sites, including from that expedition in Tebtunis, are kept at the museum. It’s the largest Egyptian collection in North America. Among the artifacts are 19 crocodile mummies and mummy parts.

Although the mummified crocodiles at the Hearst Museum are just a fraction of those discovered in Tebtunis, they can still tell us a lot about the lives of everyday people in ancient Egypt.

Crocodiles were a constant threat to the ancient Egyptians. They lived in all regions — in swamps and marshes and along the Nile River. And there were a ton of them.

Some Egyptian tomb walls are decorated with scenes that show herdsmen performing magical spells to ward off crocodiles before they crossed the Nile with their cattle on wooden boats or platforms.

“The crocodile was seen as a very powerful animal,” says Lucarelli. “It could live on earth and in water. It could attack very quickly. It was very powerful and also unpredictable. It had much physical strength — male crocodiles are huge. They can reach the length of 6 meters, so they were really huge. Even some of these mummies are really big mummies. They are carnivorous animals. In the wild, their diet consists of mostly fish, but they are really ready to attack anything that passes by.”

Lucarelli says the mummies were likely used as votive offerings to the crocodile gods, given as a way to gain good favor with the giant, deadly reptiles.

The main crocodile god was called Sobek, but there were many crocodile deities in antiquity. In Tebtunis, there was a temple to Sobek marking the center of town.

“And so, because they were so dangerous and feared, there was, almost, I think, a need to see them as gods and to appease them,” she says. “So, by having a temple to the crocodile god, bringing offerings was a way to respect the aggressive character of these animals and, theoretically, to use this power with benevolence towards humankind. Also, crocodiles were very prolific, so they became also a symbol of fertility.”

Ancient Egyptians living along the Nile counted on the river to flood every August, spreading fertile soil to nourish their crops. The Egyptians feared that if they didn’t make offerings to Sobek, he wouldn’t produce a sufficient flood.

There were crocodile priests who spent their days mummifying crocodiles and offering them to the gods. They meticulously wrapped the crocodiles with the same material and care that was used for human mummies, which shows how important these offerings were.

To hold the mummies’ shape, priests would stuff the mummies with waste papyri that had writing on it that people didn’t have a use for anymore.

This waste papyri, plus other texts that were found in Tebtunis, reveal what daily life was like for the ancient Egyptians. It’s knowledge that’s invaluable to social historians today.

That’s according to Andrew Hogan. He’s a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri at the Bancroft Library at Berkeley.

“Often histories are sort of referred to as ‘great man’ political histories,” says Hogan. “It’s very easy in early America to go from Washington to Adams to Jefferson and so on. Those have been really done to death, I think. One of the things that I find so invigorating and fascinating about working with the papyri is that you are really peeling away below the 1%. So, you’re getting to the vast majority of the lived experience for most people in the ancient world.”

The center holds a collection of more than 26,000 pieces of papyri collected over several years across Egypt. It’s the largest collection of Egyptian papyri in North America and among the largest in the world. (Although, Hogan notes, the University of Michigan actually has more complete texts of Egyptian papyri.)

Hogan says there are two main groups of papyrus texts in the collection: literary documents, including texts that have been lost to us, such as fragments of Sophocles’ play Inachus or The Dictys Cretensis, a pseudo-chronicle of the Trojan War.

And then, there’s the documentary evidence, the texts that, when put together, allow us to write a kind of history that you can’t write anywhere else in the ancient world.

“With the documentary papyri, you have all sorts of different texts, just thousands and thousands of them,” says Hogan. “You get contracts and wills and official petitions. You get sort of day-to-day ways that people would interact with religion, when they would make a prayer and tie it up and wear it as an amulet around their necks. You get deeds and land registers. You get tax documents. And then, on the other end of things, you get royal decrees that have come down and have been stored in local offices. And then, you get the really fun things, like letters.”

In the letters, he says, people express many of the same emotions that we have today — the same fears about change, hopes for the future, even worries about money. He says it speaks to the universality of what it means to be human.

“I think that if you consider everything on a case-by-case basis, we can really point to a sort of shared human experience rather than an unshared one.”

Today, there aren’t nearly as many crocodiles in Egypt, says Lucarelli.

They’re mostly in the southern part of the Nile Valley. And although they’re still dangerous — about 200 Egyptians die every year from crocodile attacks — people have more effective tools to defend themselves against the predators.

A combination of factors led to the crocodiles decreasing in number: the Aswan Dam was built, plus climate change, pollution, over-hunting and habitat degradation. And also, Christianity and Islam spread throughout Egypt. These religions didn’t value animals like the religion of its ancient inhabitants.

“With the advent of Christianity in Egypt, the Copts were also destroying a bit of this polytheistic iconography of gods looking like animals — they were seen as demons,” says Lucarelli. “So, with the advent of Christianity, then Islam, the indigenous polytheistic Egyptian religion died. And this is when, also, of course, Sobek, the crocodile god was not worshipped anymore.”

Lucarelli says that she hopes the museum can find a way to share the Egyptian collection with a wider audience — maybe in an exhibition on the Nile gods or the crocodiles of ancient Egypt.

The Hearst Museum today has an online exhibit called Exploring Objects, Fears and the Future. It came from a fall 2018 seminar for first-year students taught by Adam Nilsen, head of education and interpretation at the museum.

Students started off the semester talking about things that concerned them in the world and how a museum exhibit could shed new light on issues like climate change, poverty, inequality and the unknown.

After the students began to look through the museum’s two collection areas that hold, in total, 3.8 million objects, Nilsen says the students noticed that many of the objects had to do with protection and were used to allay different fears — fears that looked a lot like ours today.

“As we paired our lists of objects of interest with students’ lists of broad global concerns,” says Nilsen, “they realized, ‘Wow, a lot of the things that are on this list are things that cause fear. There are a lot of reasons that people are fearful in this day and age. And isn’t it fascinating and enlightening how in different times and places people have had fears that may look different superficially, but that, at their root, may have similarities to our own fears?’”

Noah Hernandez is a third-year English student who stayed on the project as the student curator. He selected items for the exhibit.

It includes a plaster cast of Ludovisi Medusa, a copy of a Roman sculpture that personified evil, and that might have been used to protect against evil forces. There’s also a Chinese magnetic divination compass that helped a practitioner arrange their surroundings according to feng shui and to predict aspects of the future. And yes, a crocodile statue, which Egyptians used to please Sobek, hoping that the deity would bring the yearly flood.

“These objects have distinct and deep histories behind them,” says Hernandez. “It’s almost as if by treating these objects well, they will treat you well, and, in a sense, pass the kindness forward. These objects have history and people’s histories behind them and people who relate to and associate with these objects today. And to not respect these objects would be not respecting human history.”

Although Sobek is no longer worshipped as the god of the Nile, he lives on, giving us insight into what life was like for everyday Egyptians more than 3,000 years ago.

Sudan floods, due to heavy rains especially in neighbouring Ethiopia, caused the Nile level to rise to an unprecedented level since 1912, according to Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands others were displaced.

Authorities have declared a three-month emergency state and have designated the country a natural disaster zone.

Blue Nile water flow at Deim water station, which borders Ethiopia, will be around 590 million cubic metres on Saturday, the committee said, down from 595 million on Thursday, 600 million on Wednesday and 985million on September 2.

For the Nile state of Atbara, water flow will be around 155 million cubic metres, up from 125 million on Thursday, 150 million on Wednesday. The peak in Atbara River reached a peak of 450 million cubic metres, state’s news agency SUNA reported, citing Executive Director or Dams Rehabilitation, Mutasim Al-Awad as saying.

On Friday, water levels recorded 17.37 metres and is expected to remain the same on Saturday. Water levels are expected to drop in northern water stations on Saturday, to record 15.55 metres in Atbara down from 15.74 metres on Friday and 14.91 in Dongola down from 14.98.

The floods committee called on citizens and relevant authorities to remain cautious.

Sudan’s usual rain season takes place annually between June and October. Water levels in the White Nile rise from spring to May and in the Blue Nile from July to September. This year, the equatorial sources of the River Nile, prime among which is Lake Victoria, shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, witnessed torrential rains that contributed to the increased water level in the White Nile.

Less than two months later, Ethiopia’s Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile, saw heavy rains, especially in August, increasing the water levels of the Blue Nile to a record 17.67 metres on 7 September.

Egypt has been on high alert due to floods in Sudan, expecting a higher-than-average annual Nile flood. The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources have continued to remove building violations on Nile waterways to allow water networks to contain excess water, but has reassured citizens that the Aswan Dam in Upper Egypt, as well as barrages on the northern branches of the Nile River, will help contain water.

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

The Livingston Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness released the following list of roads with high water as of Tuesday, Sept. 22.

Not since 2014 has Egypt seen this amount of fake news items than it did in 2020, thanks to the coronavirus. Rumours about the pandemic made up 51.8 percent of the false news circulated in Egypt throughout the year, read a report released on Monday by the cabinet’s media centre.

And not that warnings of legal action succeeded in putting the brakes on the generation of rumours. Egypt’s general prosecution warned in late March against spreading fake news and rumours about the coronavirus, saying the act is punishable by jail sentences and fines of up to EGP 20,000.

The finance sector was the most hit by rumors in January 2020, and the health sector won the lion’s share throughout the following six months as the pandemic broke out in Egypt in mid-February.

According to the cabinet's report, the health sector was the most hit by rumours in 2020 with 24.1 percent, followed by the education and finance sectors.

Rumors hit many other fields, including supply, agriculture, housing, tourism and antiquities, social solidarity, fuel and electricity, and administrative reform, the report read.

The report detailed the most serious rumours generated in 2020, dividing them into “most serious,” “strangest,” “repetitive” and “rumours aiming to distort achievements.”

- Fees will be imposed on students to enter universities.

- A deduction was applied on salaries of teachers who are absent for contracting the coronavirus.

- Vaccines administered orally to children, including the polio vaccine, cause sterility.

- Alexandria dwellers are obliged to sign a ratification to stay in their houses that might fall down.

- School libraries turned into classrooms so that social distancing is maintained.

- Citizens will be excluded from the government subsidy programme if they lose the password of their subsidy card.

- Citizens will bear the cost of disinfecting mosques.

Repetitive rumours

- An EGP 150 fine will be imposed for the issuance of burial permits.

- A number of Egyptian antiquities were sold to foreign parties.

- The Suez Canal saw major losses as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

- Shipments of bad flour were used to produce subsidised bread.

That raised the death toll from 24, reported earlier by the Moroccan news agency MAP.

Local authorities said firefighters and emergency workers rescued 10 people from the factory, in the basement of a residential villa. Rescuers searched for others who might have been trapped in the sudden flooding.

The total number of laborers at the site wasn’t immediately known. An investigation was opened.

A shaken unidentified woman who emerged from the flooded basement told TanjaNews, a local site, that no one was prepared for the deadly deluge.

“There was nothing to worry about. We were working as usual,” the woman said. “And then because it was raining, as you can see … the water started entering, a little water, even my shoes didn’t get wet. But suddenly …” She couldn’t finish her sentence.

To meet growing international demand, numerous factories in Morocco, notably in Casablanca and Tangier, rely on unregulated shadow factories to speed up production and meet deadlines. Factories subcontract to such illegal units to better compete with cheaper Chinese and Turkish products.

Such hidden factories are mainly located in residential areas and up to 40 people often work in them, sometimes minors.

Long hours and low wages are a mark of such illegal work, usually in unsafe conditions, without fire extinguishers, emergency exits and indoor plumbing.","Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2021/02/800-35.jpeg,"['morocco', 'killed', 'garment', 'flooded', 'workers', 'illegal', 'water', 'work', 'woman', 'site', '28', 'tangier', 'residential', 'factories', 'factory']",

Nine ministries cooperate with the Water Resources Ministry to implement the national plan for water at a cost of L.E. 900 billion, a figure that may double in time, Minister Mohamed Abdel Aaty told the parliament.

Complaints about the lack of water in 2020 were the fewest in 20 years, Abdel Aaty said, adding that the production of a feddan increased from 25% to 30% with a 70%-reduction in water consumption as part of the national drip irrigation project.

Modern irrigation systems have been applied over 4 million feddans, and in areas where such systems will not be used a smart irrigation system has been applied instead, according to the minister.

Some 5,000 sensors manufactured by Military Production factories will be installed in farmlands and will notify farmers on their phones about the time to water crops according to the need of the soil, Abdel Aaty said.

The lack of irrigation water can be alleviated by importing certain crops such as wheat, he said, highlighting that Egypt is one of the most efficient countries in terms of water consumption and recycling.

He continued to say that an integrated plan was set in 2021 to counter the effects of global warming, and protection projects were implemented at a cost of 10 million since 2016. Buildings worth more than L.E. 100 billion have been saved from floods in northern Delta, thanks to early response mechanism, the minister said, adding that 280,000 meters in infringements have been cleared from the bays of the Nile.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and global warming are amongst the most urgent issues before the ministry and concerted efforts by the entire government have to be exerted to face them, Abdel Aaty said, noting that his ministry tackles the technical part of the GERD issue and the Foreign Ministry tackles the political and legal parts.

He asked the parliament to approve a draft law from the ministry on new irrigation systems and water resources, while MPs asked him to lift farmer debts and for a time frame for smart irrigation and depolluting waterways.","Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202101250143164316.jpg,"['parliament', 'increased', 'frame', 'farmland', 'water', 'transformation', 'tackles', 'abdel', 'production', 'reduced', 'irrigation', 'ministry', 'resources', 'aaty', 'systems', 'minister', 'warming']",

Damage has been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, adding to pressure on an economy deeply impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, including virus-related shutdowns and the loss of overseas markets.

Hubei province, through which the Yangtze flows and famed for its numerous lakes and rivers, is under particular threat. The province’s capital Wuhan was the epicenter of China’s virus outbreak, which appears to have largely been contained.

The floodwaters have inundated towns across southern and central China and prompted emergency workers to shore-up embankments and dig channels to release overflow. Flood surges on 433 rivers have exceeded the warning level and 33 of them hit record highs, Zheng said. Apart from the Yangtze, other major rivers systems and lakes have been rising, including the Yellow River in the North, the Zhujiang in the south and Taihu, China’s largest freshwater lake just west of Shanghai.

Flooding in some areas last week forced the rescheduling of portions of the crucial four-day national college entrance exams that had already been delayed for a month because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage that is compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.

Alexandria Governor Mohamed al-Sharif said that these heavy rains have strained the capacity of the city’s dilapidated sewage network and its pumping stations.

He called on all sewage network officials, neighborhood heads and all concerned parties to continue sucking out water and stationing vacuum trucks in places exposed to heavy flooding.

Alexandria governorate officials called on citizens to exercise caution, follow safety instructions, and limit movement in cars until Monday to allow vacuum trucks to move easily.

It appealed to citizens to avoid driving at speeds exceeding 60 km and to maintain a greater safety distance than usual.

Warnings were also issued not to stand under dilapidated balconies and avoid all open areas, metal objects, fences and railways during lightning strikes.

Eman Shaker, the Egyptian Meteorological Authority’s (EMA) Director of Remote Sensing, warned on Friday of heavy rains on the northern coasts for Saturday and Sunday.

Shaker told Al-Masry Al-Youm that there are moderate to heavy rains are expected for the northern coasts, which include Salloum, Alexandria, Rashid, Sidi Abdel Rahman, Dabaa, Matrouh, Fayoum and Sidi Barani.

Nasser’s government then designed a large dam to tame the mighty Nile River. The Aswan High Dam took a decade to build. The rockfill dam used around 44 million cubic meters (57 million cubic yards) of Earth and rock for its construction—a mass sixteen times greater than Great Pyramid of Giza. It offered better control of the flood cycles and more water storage than its predecessor, the Aswan Low Dam, to the north.

The new 111-meter (360-foot) tall dam created one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Named for the Egyptian President, Lake Nasser stretches 480 kilometers (300 miles) long and 16 kilometers (10 miles) wide. Storing more than 100 cubic kilometers (24 cubic miles) of water, the lake took approximately six years to fill.

The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired the data for this natural-color image of Lake Nasser (the Sudanese call their portion Lake Nubia). This composite scene was compiled from cloud-free images from 2013 to 2020. Located in a hot, dry climate with sporadic rain events, the lake loses a lot of water through evaporation and consequently shrinks seasonally in surface area. Water levels are typically highest in November during the flood season and lowest in July during the dry season.

Lake Nasser plays an important role in Egypt’s economy. Approximately one quarter of the nation’s population works in agriculture, which depends heavily on irrigation. With a reliable source of water from Lake Nasser, farmers have been able to plant more crops and to do so multiple times per year with the aid of fertilizers. After the reservoir was filled, the country was able to increase its arable land by 30 percent in the first few years, particularly to the west of the lake. Lake Nasser has also created a fishing industry and is a popular tourist attraction due to its crocodiles.

Researchers, however, are worried about the lake’s future. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which will be Africa’s largest dam for hydroelectric power, is expected to greatly reduce water levels in Lake Nasser and the amount of power generated at Aswan High Dam. Research shows the project, which was 70 percent complete in October 2019, could lead to an irrigation deficit for Egypt in dry years and a decline in fisheries. One study found the lake shrunk 14 percent in surface area from 2015 to 2016, which may have been due to the new dam and the partial filling of its reservoir.

More heavy rain is forecast after Saturday’s deadly deluge in the Kumamoto prefecture, Japan’s worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis in October last year left about 90 people dead.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a meeting of Japan’s disaster response task force to step up the search and rescue operations.

“Nothing is more important than human lives. Please make utmost effort through the night to search for missing people,” Abe said after Japanese television broadcast images of overturned cars, people shovelling mud from their homes and the military rescuing stranded residents in boats.

“We had no electricity and no running water,” one rescued woman told the broadcaster. “It was tough.”

TV footage also showed a gymnasium-turned-evacuation center equipped with face masks, disinfectants and thermometers to prevent coronavirus infections.

The Japan Meteorological Agency urged people to stay vigilant, as more rains are predicted.

“From this evening on, extremely heavy rains with thunder are expected in southern as well as northern Kyushu,” an agency official told Reuters.

“The rainfall so far has already loosened the ground. There is a high chance of landslides occurring, even without much additional rain.”

Dozens of people have been killed in Sudan and South Sudan and hundreds of thousands displaced as the Nile reached its highest level in a hundred years.

The NGOs that participated in the aid included the Egyptian Red Crescent, the Egyptian Food Bank, the Orman Association, El-Jamia El-Shareyah, Misr El-Kheir, El-Ber Wel Tawqa, Resala, and Dr. Mostafa Mahmoud Charity Association, the statement read.

The 109-year old NGO Egyptian Red Crescent, which follows the standards of the International Movement of Red Cross and Red Crescent, has sent an international relief team to South Sudan to distribute aid, in coordination with the Sudanese Red Crescent Society and South Sudan Red Cross, executive director Rami El-Nazer said.

Another team transporting aid prepared by the ERC stayed in Sudan for three days to assess the situation and provide emergency relief to those afflicted, El-Nazer added.

In the statement, Social Solidarity Minister Niveen El-Qabbag voiced solidarity with people of the two countries, saying that Egypt has always supported the people of fraternal nations during crises.

The floods in Sudan have affected more than half a million people, destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes, and raised the risk of disease outbreaks, the UN said on Thursday.

Due to the overflowing of the White Nile, around 5,000 people in South Sudan have been displaced and over a hundred have died, according to the South Sudanese state news agency.

Egypt has sent several batches of aid to Sudan as part of an ongoing aid airlift operation launched upon the directive of President Abdel-Fattah El Sisi to help the Sudanese people deal with the disaster.

In addition, Health Minister Hala Zayed travelled to Sudan on Tuesday to offer assistance, accompanied by a 20-strong team of doctors with different specialisms, as well as a number of nurses and experts in epidemic control.

70,70,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Mother Nature chimes in as officials ponder controversial landfill proposal - ncpolicywatch.com,http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/13/mother-nature-chimes-in-as-officials-ponder-controversial-landfill-proposal/,"A day of dangerous flooding underscores concerns of local residents regarding proposed Vance County facility

The rain, curtains of it, had fallen in North Carolina all of Thursday. Relentless and unforgiving, floodwaters filled rivers and creeks, which broke their banks. It swept mud from hillsides, buckled roads, swallowed cars. It killed people in several counties.

For residents of Egypt Mountain Road in Kittrell, in rural Vance County, the flooding was an unspoken expert witness in their fight against a Land Clearing and Inert Debris Landfill proposed for their neighborhood.

Late Thursday afternoon, the Vance County Board of Adjustment heard more testimony about the potential environmental impacts of the LCID, as these landfills are known. LCIDs accept tons upon tons of trees, stumps, brush, unpainted wood and concrete, often from construction sites. If the board grants a conditional use permit, this LCID would be built within a half-mile of 60 homes, on roughly 80 acres of steep, rugged and forested terrain that bottoms out at Long Creek, a tributary to Tabbs Creek and the Tar River.

Two months ago, Kenneth Harrison III of K&K Organics, and his attorney, Tom Terrell, had deployed a battalion of expert witnesses — traffic engineers, real estate appraisers, landfill consultants — to testify in hopes of convincing the board to approve the plan. The residents were caught off-guard by the proceedings, which are quasi-judicial in nature and include sworn testimony, similar to a court. The board gave the residents 60 days to hire their own attorney and gather their own expert witnesses, which coincidentally included the flood.

Jeff Garrett lives with his wife Angie on 170 acres that have been in the family for five generations. His mother’s ashes are scattered on the farm, which abuts the property where the LCID would be built. “The creek floods five to 10 times a year,” Garrett said. “And five of those times it’s a major flood.”

The slopes on the proposed landfill acreage are steep, a 70-foot drop in some places. “You’re talking about a lot of water,” Garrett said, comparing the force to “throwing a bowling ball from the top of a hill.”

“How in the world will you build a containment that will hold that water before it gets to the creek?” he added. “There’s a place for these sites, a place far from water.”

John Alderman, a retired biologist with the state Wildlife Resource Commission, discovered freshwater mussels in Tabbs Creek more than 30 years ago— about 350 million years after they emerged from primordial soup. “They watched the dinosaurs come and go,” Alderman said. “The waters were filled with these creatures. Now 80% of the species have been wiped out.”

Both endangered and threatened species of mussels live in Long and Tabbs creeks. Birds, fish and mammals eat mussels, which are also vital to maintaining water quality by filtering out pollutants.

Alderman now works as a consultant to industry, including developers of megasites. “I tell my clients, ‘Put your site where there will be the least damage, the least impact. Be careful. These creatures are going extinct on our watch.'”

Terrell asked Alderman if he “had any evidence” that the LCID would be improperly designed and maintained.

“These designs aren’t made for major rain events,” Alderman replied. “It is not the engineers’ fault. These are 500-, 1,000-year storm events. Whatever is approved can be washed out.”

Terrell has a reputation for being an aggressive, at times even rude litigator. His line of attack was to question the opponents’ witnesses if they had “evidence” that environmental laws would not be followed or enforced.

While it’s impossible to speculate on this particular project, Jill Howell, the Tar-Pamlico Riverkeeper said, the fact that Harrison had already broken environmental laws by illegally dumping on the property without a permit shows “bad faith.”

In addition, the NC Department of Environmental Quality is so short-staffed and underfunded that its enforcement and inspections have suffered. The agency has lost a third of its funding and more than 370 employees in the past 10 years, and, stretched thin, inspectors can visit landfills only once a year, sometimes less frequently. For example, after notifying the agency of illegal clearing along a stream in eastern North Carolina, Howell said, it took two weeks for inspectors to visit the area. Two months later, dirt was still flowing into the waterway. A year later, the site still hasn’t been restored, she said.

Sedimentation and erosion are the least glamorous aspects of environmental protection, but controlling the flow of dirt is essential. When sediment accumulates in rivers and creeks, it clogs fish gills, blocks light, and carries pollutants from the land. It consumes space where water would otherwise go, and worsens flooding. If the land is cleared for the LCID, the trees and vegetation that currently hold the dirt in place and control flood waters will be gone, leaving exposed hillsides that would turn to mud.

“LCIDs can have minimum impacts if sited correctly,” said Howell, who has a master’s degree from Yale University in environmental management. “Flat topography, distance to water and homes. This is site is far from ideal. It poses unreasonable risks to Long and Tabb creeks and the Tar River.”

Former legislator and U.S. attorney, ex-state Treasurer and now a bank president, Richard Moore lives on Egypt Mountain Road about four miles from the proposed LCID site. “This thing is going to be humming wide open,” Moore said, adding that he’s concerned not only about traffic, but about invasive beetles riding in on the trucks filled with brush and trees. From there, the insects can spread and decimate forests. “I’m scared for my timber.”

Kittrell, Moore noted, was the first resort in North Carolina, known for its natural springs. The water table is high, gurgling just below the surface.

“The aquifers in this area are really special,” Moore said. “Water is everywhere.”

As the meeting ended Thursday evening, downstream the Tar River kept rising. In Tarboro, it’s projected to crest tomorrow at nearly 32 feet, major flood stage.

71,71,FL-2020-000038-EGY,A River that Belongs to None: The Nile River Dispute - The Colgate Maroon-News,https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/25209/commentary/a-river-that-belongs-to-none-the-nile-river-dispute/,"The Nile River, for all of its recent history, has been a crucial geographic feature in Africa’s landscape. The fertile lands around the Nile have provided livable and farmable land to its inhabitants. In modern times, the Nile has been a hotly contested resource. Since Egypt completed the Aswan Dam in 1970, the first modern dam of the Nile, Egyptians have depended on it for water, flood control and electricity. Several dams have been built since then, but the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), begun in 2011 and now near completion, has generated turmoil among several powerful African nations and their allies. While the GERD is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa, its situation along the Blue Nile is currently one of the most contentious political and economic situations in Africa. The question of sustainability is at the core of this current crisis.

Ethiopia and Egypt have butted heads ever since construction began; from the Egyptian point of view, the dam is a detriment to the country’s potential. Egypt claims the dam will cut off water supplies to the south; any amount of water loss is problematic, as the Nile provides Egypt 90% of its water. Since the only farmable land in Egypt lies within a couple of miles of the river, Egypt doesn’t produce enough food to feed its whole population; as a result, Egypt is an import-reliant economy. The Egyptian government doesn’t want to make their food insufficiency worse by conceding water rights to Ethiopia. However, with construction almost complete, Egypt’s focus has turned to the filling of the dam. The two countries mainly disagree over how long the new reservoir would take to fill up.

For Ethiopia, the country’s economic ambitions hinge on the completion and success of the dam. The dam will be the country’s largest-ever public works project in its history and will help solve Ethiopia’s energy shortage (60% of Ethiopians have no electricity). While Egypt has conceded that the completion of the dam is inevitable, there is still incredible tension. Negotiations have come to a halt, as Ethiopia and Egypt disagree upon the filling time. While Egypt wants Ethiopia to gradually fill up the dam over twelve years, Ethiopia hopes to fill it in six. Because of the lack of negotiating progress, the United States recently withdrew $130 million of aid to Ethiopia. A lot is at stake for both Ethiopia and Egypt. On one hand, Ethiopia is shouldering most of the cost of the dam and would like to get a return on their investment as soon as possible. On the other, the dam could exacerbate Egypt’s already significant water insecurity.

Tensions have risen so high that the Ethiopian government has banned flights over the dam for security reasons. With Ethiopia taking such strong safety precautions, it’s probable the government foresees future non-diplomatic measures being taken by Egypt if negotiations don’t progress. Ethiopia has also just announced they have achieved one year of filling, and that the dam will start generating electricity in the next twelve months.

Climate change and sustainability are at the heart of this debate. Sudan is experiencing its worst floods in recent history, crippling an emerging country that has struggled with violence, disease and political turmoil. The Nile River Delta, where 40-50 million Egyptians live, could be partially underwater soon if sea levels rise. Additionally, the area is becoming less fertile as a result of sediments caught in the Aswan Dam; another huge dam will only worsen the problem. Saltwater intrusion also is lowering farmer’s outputs already, and the problem will only get worse. The flooding every year is devastating; however, the drought that an impending climate crisis will bring will be more devastating.

The issue of Nile water availability is a microcosm of the region’s slowly manifesting confrontation with climate change. Finding agreement on the dam’s filling has been difficult because the lifeblood of several African countries depends on the outcome. Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia can find a suitable agreement for all parties on the filling of the dam, but only if each country makes concessions. With Egypt historically being in control of the Nile, it’s going to be difficult to give up the regional hegemony they’ve enjoyed over the Nile’s water. The Nile is a shared resource, and the countries it runs through must find a fair agreement to make sure it stays that way. Finding an agreement soon is crucial. Ethiopia has already filled the dam with a year’s worth of water and will fill it up as fast as possible if negotiations remain stalled. Once they find a solution, the countries can move on together to face the biggest threat to the region’s health and existence: climate change.","Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot_2020-03-13-thecolgatemaroonnews-com.png,"['belongs', 'egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'agreement', 'soon', 'nile', 'dispute', 'countries', 'dam', 'river', 'filling']",

A 2,300-year-old Egyptian mummy was among the rare objects of historical interest which were saved from drowning at the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur during the torrential rains that lashed the city last week. The mummy was taken out of its glass box in the museum’s basement and shifted to another hall in the building.

The rainwater, which inundated several roads and residential colonies of the State capital on August 14, entered the museum’s basement and submerged artefacts, paintings, maps, files and documents. Just before the water at four-foot level could touch the mummy, the staff broke the glass and carried it to a dry area on the upper floor.

The mummy, named Tutu, a female member of a family of priests, dates back to Egypt’s Ptolemic period from early 300 B.C. to 30 B.C. It was excavated from a pyramid in Akhmim area of the ancient city of Panopolis.

It is one of only six mummies in India and was gifted by the Museum of Cairo for an exhibition in Jaipur organised by the then ruler of the princely state, Sawai Madho Singh II, in 1887. Three experts from Egypt’s Ministry of Culture, who came here in 2011 to conserve the mummy, had concluded that it was in good condition. They had sterilised all the attached objects to wipe out microbes.

Main attraction

The mummy has been one of the main attractions of the museum, which functions in the historic building constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style. The museum is named after King Edward VII (Albert Edward) during whose visit to the city as the Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne its foundation stone was laid in 1876.

After the rains, hundreds of documents and antiques have been strewn on the floors of the museum for drying. The entry of tourists has been closed for seven days, said Prakash Chandra Sharma, Director, Department of Archaeology and Museums.

Diya Kumari, a member of Jaipur’s erstwhile royal family and a BJP MP from Rajsamand, expressed shock at the damage caused to the artefacts in the museum. “Torrential rains and rampant disregard by the government have damaged the treasures of the past... That adequate measures for their protection were not taken is a sad commentary on the departments concerned,” she tweeted.

State Art and Culture Minister B.D. Kalla, who visited the museum on Tuesday, said the staff were vigilant and had rescued the mummy and other important objects. He said preventive steps would be taken to protect the artefacts and another museum would be established in Jaipur to display the objects of historical interest.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3n22xp/article32397948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20MUSEUM,"['glass', 'egyptian', 'city', 'rains', 'flooding', 'survives', 'mummy', 'jaipur', 'objects', 'taken', 'staff', 'basement', 'museum']",

Gatkuoth also thanked Egypt for launching an air bridge during the crisis to transport to South Sudan important humanitarian aid, the Egyptian cabinet’s spokesman said in a statement on Monday.

He affirmed Egypt's efforts to support South Sudan came in light of the brotherly relations between the two peoples.

The meeting was attended by Egypt's Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Aty.

Torrential rain and floods earlier this year hit South Sudan and submerged many villages and livestock and displaced over 600,000 people since July. The floods were described by the UN as the worst in 60 years.

The South Sudanese minister also praised Egypt’s establishment of technical schools in South Sudan that have qualified students for the job market, as well as the decision to increase the number of scholarships for students of ٍSouth Sudan to study in Egypt.

He expressed his aspiration for further Egyptian support of other South Sudanese students in the country and in Egypt, who receive education at their own expense, especially as the coronavirus implications have affected their income.

Gatkuoth said he wants to enhance cooperation with Egypt and to benefit from the Egyptian experience and distinguished cadres in capacity-building and the establishment of Egyptian investment projects in agriculture, irrigation, electricity and other infrastructure fields.

The minister also requested that Egypt opens a branch of one of its banks in South Sudan, particularly the National Bank of Egypt (NBE).

Gatkuoth called for forming a joint high committee with Egypt.

Prime Minister Madbouly affirmed during the meeting that Egypt will spare no effort to support South Sudanese people in the fields mentioned by the minister, mainly supporting South Sudanese students in Egypt, based on President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi’s directives to support foreign students residing in the country.

Madbouly also expressed Egypt’s willingness to establish investment projects needed in South Sudan.

The prime minister urged coordination with the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to accelerate efforts to form the joint high committee and to hold its first meeting in Cairo before the end of this year.

Concerning the request to open a bank branch in South Sudan, Madbouly said the Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt would be contacted to submit the request to open a branch of the NBE there.

This unique phenomenon takes place just twice a year—once on October 22 to mark the king’s birthday and the beginning of the growing season, and again on February 22 to celebrate his coronation and the start of harvest season.

On these two days, the temple opens its doors for tourists at 3 am in order to facilitate viewings of this special occurrence, which lasts for just 20 minutes.

Thousands of tourists line up in what is known as the country’s “longest tourist queue” in order to witness the sunlight penetrate sixty meters into the temple, lighting up the king’s face.

The sun also shines on statues of the sun gods Re-Horakhte and Amon-Re, seated next to Ramses II. The statues sit in the company of the Theban god of darkness, Ptah, who remains in the shadows all year.

Ramses II was the third pharaoh of Egypt’s 19th Dynasty. He is regarded as the most powerful and celebrated pharaoh of Egypt, and was the husband of the famous Queen Nefertari.

The king was responsible for numerous military campaigns that expanded the empire, as well as the construction of temples and statues throughout the region.","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020/10/5435ED76-24CF-4199-8CD7-3AF274B16119.jpeg,"['face', 'ramses', 'statues', 'pharaoh', 'growing', 'temple', 'simbel', 'photos', 'illumination', 'ii', 'abu', 'kings', 'king', 'order', 'tourists', 'lights', 'biannual']",

But the destruction of Hurricane Eta in early November left him in debt and unable to feed his three children.

So he set out with three neighbors to try to cross Guatemala, then Mexico and eventually find work in the United States.

“First the pandemic, and then the hurricane … we have no money for our children,” he said on the journey north.

Back-to-back hurricanes Eta and Iota internally displaced more than half a million people in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, according to International Organization for Migration data. The UN agency said at least a third could be displaced for more than three months, hampering their ability to earn a living and rebuild their lives.

“Every day, about 20 new people arrive because they lost their land, their homes, and their crops in Honduras and Guatemala,” said Gabriel Romero, the director of a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tenosique.

Thousands more Central Americans say they’re planning to join northbound caravans with names like “Caravan for Flood victims” scheduled to begin departing from Honduras in the coming weeks, according to conversations in Facebook and WhatsApp groups dedicated to coordinating the efforts.

Such a mass movement could become a major test for the incoming administration of US president-elect Joe Biden as it tries to undo some of President Donald Trump’s most severe anti-immigration measures without turning pent up pressure into a border crisis.

On the election campaign trail, Biden promised a US$4 billion plan to address underlying factors driving migration from Central America. Advocacy group Refugees International says such relief, while welcome, will take years to have an impact.

Egypt has invited Elon Musk to visit its famed pyramids after the SpaceX and Tesla founder posted a satirical tweet stating that clearly extra-terrestrials had built the giant monuments.

""Aliens built the pyramids obv,"" Musk had tweeted, picking up on a theme popular with conspiracy theorists and kicking off a predictable flood of replies ranging from light-hearted to furious.

Among the avalanche of one-liners, memes and potshots were some angry messages from nationalistic Egyptians who demanded the eccentric engineer and high-tech billionaire better check his facts.

Egyptian International Cooperation Minister Rania al-Mashat, a savvy social media user, however, saw a marketing opportunity to help revive the country's pandemic-battered tourism sector.

""I follow your work with a lot of admiration,"" wrote Mashat, a former tourism minister. ""I invite you & Space X to explore the writings about how the pyramids were built and also to check out the tombs of the pyramid builders.

""Mr. Musk, we are waiting for you,"" she added, inviting the entrepreneur to come and see for himself one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, Egypt's enormous tombs built for pharaohs and their consorts.

Musk followed up by posting a link to a BBC article about the history of the giant structures, calling it ""a sensible summary"" of how they were constructed.

The Giza Pyramids on the southwestern outskirts of the Egyptian capital Cairo

The most famous and largest of Egypt's ancient monuments, the Giza Pyramids outside Cairo, reopened to the public last month after a three-month closure forced by the coronavirus pandemic.

Egypt's tourism sector suffered a decade of turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring protests and overthrow of longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, with militant attacks and political instability keeping many tourists away.

The tourism sector, which accounts for a fifth of the country's GDP and employs some three million people, had recovered to draw record visitors, around 13.6 million last year, when the COVID-19 crisis struck.

78,78,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"North Korea lifts lockdown in city, rejects flood, virus aid - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/north-korea-lifts-lockdown-in-city-rejects-flood-virus-aid/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lifted a lockdown in a major city near the border with South Korea where thousands had been quarantined for weeks over coronavirus worries, state media said Friday.

But Kim, during a key ruling party meeting on Thursday, also insisted the North will keep its borders shut and rejected any outside help as the country carries out an aggressive anti-virus campaign and rebuilds thousands of houses, roads and bridges damaged by heavy rain and floods in recent weeks.

Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency also said Kim replaced Kim Jae Ryong as premier following an evaluation of the Cabinet’s economic performance and appointed Kim Tok Hun as his successor.

Entering the last year of an ambitious five-year national development plan, Kim Jong Un in December declared a “frontal breakthrough” against international sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in a struggle for economic self-reliance.

But experts say the COVID-19 crisis likely thwarted some of Kim’s major economic goals by forcing the country into a lockdown that shut the border with China — the North’s major ally and economic lifeline — and potentially hampered his ability to mobilize people for labor.

During Thursday’s meeting, Kim said it was clear after three weeks of isolation measures and “scientific verification” that the virus situation in Kaesong was stable and expressed gratitude to residents for cooperating with the lockdown, KCNA reported.

Kim said his country now faces a dual challenge of fending off COVID-19 amid a worsening global pandemic and repairing damage from torrential rain that lashed the country in past weeks.

KCNA said 39,296 hectares (97,100 acres) of crops were ruined nationwide and 16,680 homes and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded. It said many roads, bridges and railway sections were damaged and a dam of an unspecified power station gave way. There was no mention of any information related to injuries or deaths.

Kim expressed sympathy with people who were at temporary facilities after losing their houses to floods and called for swift recovery efforts so that none is “homeless” by the time the country celebrates the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s founding on Oct. 10.

“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying.

Kim’s public rejection of international aid for flood recovery and his decision to release Kaesong from quarantine are negative indicators for inter-Korean cooperation as South Korea had hoped to restart diplomatic engagement by providing support in these areas, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

Cho Hey-sil, spokesperson of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the South remains willing to provide humanitarian assistance to the North.

North Korea in past months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, which faltered over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.

The North in June blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, following months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy US-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and restart joint economic projects that would help the North’s broken economy.

“The North Korean economy, while touting self-reliance, is increasingly dependent on China and will struggle to balance sanctions-busting efforts and COVID-19 prevention,” Easley said. “The job of North Korea’s new premier will be to show the country has recovered from recent flooding and has upgraded public health facilities” by the October party anniversary, he said.

In late July, Kim ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong and had the nation shift into a “maximum emergency system” after the North reported it found a person with COVID-19 symptoms.

The North’s state media said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to the South before slipping back into Kaesong. But South Korean health authorities say the 24-year-old hadn’t tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any known virus carrier.

North Korea later said the person’s test results were inconclusive and still maintains it is virus-free, a status widely doubted by outsiders. Some experts said the North was likely trying to shift the blame over a possible spread of the virus to South Korea.

In an email to The Associated Press last week, Dr. Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization’s representative to North Korea, said the North has told the UN agency it quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Kaesong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days.

Since the end of December, North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners, Salvador said.

79,79,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Dozens of towns isolated by flooding in Australian state - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/dozens-of-towns-isolated-by-flooding-in-australian-state/,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Hundreds of people have been rescued from floodwaters that have isolated dozens of towns in Australia’s most populous state New South Wales and forced thousands to evacuate their homes as record rain continues to inundate the country’s east coast.

Around 18,000 people had been evacuated from flooding in New South Wales by Monday and emergency services feared up to 54,000 people could be displaced with rain forecast to continue until Wednesday.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament that 35 communities in northern New South Wales had been isolated and emergency services had conducted more than 700 flood rescues.

“We are grateful at this point that no lives have been lost so far,” Morrison said. “But weakened foundations for buildings, for roads and trees, they all create risk, as do downed power lines and rising water levels.”

A year ago, vast swathes of New South Wales had been charred by unprecedented wildfires following years of drought that gripped most of the state.

Some of the same areas were now being by inundated by one-in-50-year and one-in-100-year rain events.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said up to 38 parts of the state had been declared natural disaster areas.

“I don’t know any time in our state’s history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,” Berejiklian told reporters. “So, they are challenging times for New South Wales.”

Thousands of people have been affected with 40 flood warnings and 20 evacuation orders along the state’s Mid North Coast, and in western Sydney. Houses had been submerged and destroyed while several communities had lost power.

Heavy rain will remain a serious risk on Tuesday for the Mid North Coast, where communities are facing the worst flooding conditions since 1929.

Communities along the Hawkesbury River were also bracing for the worst flooding in the area since 1961.

Bureau of Meteorology national flood services manager Justin Robinson described the rainfall as a “very significant flood event for New South Wales.”

“I’ve been a flood forecaster with the bureau for 20 years and this is probably the worst flooding that I’ve experienced,” Robinson said.

Nepean River levels at Penrith on Sydney western outskirts had peaked late Sunday at a higher level than the 1961 record and the Hawkesbury River flood waters at Windsor, northwest of Sydney, were expected to peak late Monday around a 1988 record level, Robinson said.

The spokesperson for the Ministry, Mohamed al-Sebaie, explained that negotiations will continue on Monday, with Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan having gathered all their proposals into one report.

During a phone-in with the TV show “Ala Massoulity” (By My Responsibility), Sebaie stated that a technical and legal member representing each country has been chosen to discuss the proposals during the remainder of the talks.

“We cannot say there has been progress or retreat in the negotiations,” Sebaie said. “All that happened is the formulation of the proposals of the three countries.”

Regarding the current year’s flood levels, Sebaie said that there is a permanent committee in place to monitor the state of the river and its flooding.

He noted that flood rates during this August have been higher than last year.

“The flood rates will be higher than the average, and we have a plan to invest every drop of water,” he assured.

The meetings of the second round of GERD negotiations began on July 27 under the auspices of the AU and in the presence of observers from the United States and the European Union, and experts of the African Union Commission. Its aim is to reach a binding agreement regarding the filling and operation of the dam. The meetings are based on the outcomes of an African Union presidential summit held on July 21.

Egypt and Ethiopia have been in multiple rounds of negotiations over the dam during the past nine years, all of which have failed to reach a final agreement. Egypt blames Ethiopia for the failure of negotiations.

Egypt, which relies considerably on fresh water from the Nile, has voiced fears that the GERD would negatively impact the country’s water supply, especially in light of overpopulation fears, and has insisted that measures be put in place to protect downstream countries in case of drought during the dam’s filling process.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, has stressed the importance of the project to bolstering its economy, where more than half of the population currently lives without access to electricity.","Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020/07/1267266_0.jpg,"['flood', 'final', 'talks', 'union', 'egypt', 'report', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'negotiations', 'proposals', 'reach', 'submitted', 'dam', 'sebaie', 'current', 'gerd']",

On Jan. 28, the Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, instructed the ministry’s agencies to begin collecting fines for wasting water from farmers who fail to adhere to modern irrigation systems.

Abdel-Aty stressed the importance of finding successful ways to switch from flood irrigation to modern irrigation systems. He urged more farmers to switch to smart irrigation systems and use tools like soil moisture meters developed by the ministry, stressing the many advantages offered by modern systems to maximize productivity, reduce operating costs and increase profitability through the efficient use of labor, energy and water.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation's meters measure soil moisture levels to determine the crops’ water needs and send the data to farmers' mobile phones by text message.

In December, the ministry also launched a national project to rehabilitate about 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) of damaged canals at a cost of 18 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.14 billion) by mid-2022.

In July 2020, Ethiopia announced it had completed the first phase of filling the GERD despite the lack of an agreement with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia began constructing the GERD on the Blue Nile in 2011 as a power-generating facility but Egypt fears the dam will affect its Nile water share of 55 billion cubic meters a year, most of it from the Blue Nile.

Egypt's former Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohammed Nasr Allam told Al-Monitor that Egypt is fining farmers who had received state loans to adopt modern irrigation systems but failed to follow through.

He explained that the fines are part of the Egyptian state’s plan to rationalize water consumption because Egypt has a water deficit of about 30 billion cubic meters annually. He said that Cairo seeks to address this deficit amid the country’s increasing population growth, which could result in a drinking water deficit of 10 billion cubic meters.

Allam added that Egypt is working to rationalize agricultural water to avoid shortages of drinking water and is implementing agricultural expansion projects that require modern irrigation systems.

“We reject what Ethiopia is doing in the GERD without a binding agreement for all, neglecting Egypt's share of the Nile water. A solution that satisfies all parties must be reached because water is a red line for Egypt since it threatens its security and stability,” Allam said.

Mahmoud Abdel Mohsen, a researcher at Egypt's Agricultural Research Center, told Al-Monitor that Egypt has started developing irrigation systems in Kafr El Sheikh and Beheira governorates.

Abdel Mohsen added that Egypt's share of the Nile is limited and and crucial for drinking and the rest for agriculture. He considers Ethiopia’s actions unacceptable and the Nile water is a matter of life and death for Cairo.","Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/almpics/2021/02/GettyImages-1186227188.jpg/GettyImages-1186227188.jpg?h=a5ae579a&itok=TrfeRFOV,"['crisis', 'modern', 'meters', 'egypt', 'water', 'systems', 'drags', 'irrigation', 'nile', 'share', 'farmers', 'dam', 'fines', 'billion', 'wasting']", 
82,82,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt wishes to resume Ethiopian dam negotiations holding onto water rights fundamentals: min. - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/100121/Egypt-wishes-to-resume-Ethiopian-dam-negotiations-holding-onto-water,"CAIRO – 25 March 2021: Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aty asserted Wednesday Egypt's desire to resume the negotiations on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) while holding onto the fundamentals it adopts to preserve its water rights.

The minister's statements came in his speech while presiding over a seminar titled ""The Water Future of Egypt: Opportunities and Challenges"" jointly organized by Canada-Egypt Business Council and the Egyptian Business Council for International Cooperation.

The minister presented the updates on the issue stressing that the Ethiopian Dam and its impact on Nile water compose one of the biggest challenges faced by Egypt. That is particularly in light of the unilateral measures taken by Ethiopia in terms of reservoir filling and dam operation. Abdel Aty warned against the massive repercussions that will not be accepted by Egypt.

The minister underlined that Egypt supports development in fellow African states and Nile Basin countries. Examples of such support is embodied in building a number of dams that harvest rainwater; underground water treatment plants and supply networks powered by solar energy serving remote communities; flood management projects; river harbors; fisheries, and, cleaning canals.

That is in addition to contributing to the preparation of studies necessary to establish dams that would secure water and generate electricity as well as offering training and capacity-building opportunities to technical cadres in Nile Basin countries.

Abdel Aty pointed out that water challenges require Egypt to deploy efforts on both the governmental and societal levels. On one hand, the government shall implement a number of large projects in the sector. On the other hand, there is a need to raise people's awareness on water rationalization and preservation from pollution.

On the legislative level, Abdel Aty indicated that the House of Representatives is examining a draft bill on efficient water management, and elimination of water-related violations.

The Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources noted earlier in March in a statement that it had accomplished the lining of 1,188 kilometers of canals across Egypt.

Currently, the ministry is lining further 4,312 kilometers while allocations to line 1,452 kilometers have been endorsed so they would be offered to contractors in tenders soon.

The target for the first phase ending in 2022 and worth LE18 billion is lining 7,000 kilometers of canals.

The canal lining project is part of the National Project for Developing the Egyptian Countryside aimed at raising the quality of life of residents of rural areas. The lining of canals would enhance water management and distribution, ensure the delivery of water to the ends of canals, and inhibit pollution.

On another level, the ministry is encouraging farmers to substitute modern irrigation systems for flood irrigation in order to rationalize water use. Modern irrigation systems have been introduced in 230,000 feddans and will be introduced in further 55,000 feddans as requested by agricultural land owners.

The ministry attributes demand by farmers on modern irrigation systems to the desire of lowering costs, and improving the productivity and quality of crops.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202007260255115511.jpg,"['min', 'modern', 'wishes', 'water', 'egypt', 'lining', 'fundamentals', 'aty', 'rights', 'irrigation', 'ethiopian', 'nile', 'kilometers', 'holding', 'resume', 'systems', 'minister', 'negotiations']",

The following will introduce the fundamental principles of the Kabbalah of Information regarding the structure and functioning of Creation, based on an analysis of events described in the Torah and the Nevi’im (Prophets). There will be a particular focus on the concept of Evil in Creation.



When studying the Torah, it is important to approach the text as a single whole: each letter, each word, and each story is interconnected.



In addition to the 613 commandments that are explicitly listed, the Torah also contains a wealth of other teachings and lessons. In order to uncover these lessons, one must reveal the hidden links, parallels, and patterns that exist between the events described in the Torah.



This task requires knowledge of the Kabbalah.



Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a 2nd-century Tannaitic sage and disciple of Rabbi Akiva, described the stories in the Torah as the garments, the commandments as the body, and the Kabbalah as the soul of the Torah.



This article will attempt to analyze the following interconnected stories through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information:



> The Flood

> Abraham’s descent into and ascent from Egypt

> The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the salvation of Lot

> Jacob’s flight from Laban with his family

> The Exodus



The links between these stories will be traced according to the following considerations:

1 - All of the individuals mentioned in the stories above suffered from a higher evil that they could not overcome on their own.

According to the Kabbalah, the higher the root of the animal soul, the lower it may fall. It is believed that the souls of the most malevolent villains are initially formed at a higher level of revelation of the information conveyed by HaShem (the Almighty). In other words, they are very powerful. This is true of the antediluvians, the Pharaoh of the time of Abraham, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Laban, the Pharaoh of the Exodus period, and Esau. This seemingly paradoxical fact requires further clarification, which will be provided in the following sections.

2 - All of the stories mentioned above involve the direct intervention of HaShem with miraculous deliverance.

3 - None of the individuals in any of the stories listed above broke from evil entirely:





— Noah took a grapevine with him on the Ark.

— Hagar accompanied Abraham and Sarah out of Egypt.

— Lot’s wife looked back while leaving Sodom.

— Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim as Jacob fled with his family.

— When Moses delivered the children of Israel from Egypt, they were joined by ‘a great mixed multitude’ of Egyptians.



4 - All of the aforementioned events had incredibly negative and irreversible consequences.





Each story will be reviewed below in further detail, followed by a general overview from the standpoint of the Kabbalah of Information.

1 - Chapter 1:

And There Was a Severe Famine in the Land, and Abraham Descended to Egypt; or the Pharaoh’s Revenge.



A brief description of the events in this story:



The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.” The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.”

As they approach Egypt, Abram (Abraham) asks his wife Sarai (Sarah) to pretend to be his sister. Pharaoh takes Sarah to the palace and bestows on Abraham herds of animals, menservants, and maidservants.

cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); }); if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";} HaShem then sends plagues onto Pharaoh and his household on account of Sarah. The Midrash B’reishit Rabbah gives the following description of the event: “Rabbi Levi said: All that night the angel stood with a staff in his hand and hit. If she said ‘Hit,’ he hit; if she said ‘Leave,’ he left.”

Pharaoh realizes that he has been deceived, returns Sarah to Abraham, and gives him money. Abraham and Sarah return to the Holy Land.

After some time, we learn that they are accompanied by Hagar, an Egyptian woman who had become Sarah’s handmaid.

This story has elicited much commentary, but the sages remain divided in opinion.

For example, Rashi wrote in his commentary that the famine was meant to challenge Abraham’s faith: “To test him, whether he would think ill of the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who ordered him to go to the Land of Canaan, and now He was forcing him to leave it.”

Therefore, Abraham is commended for not questioning the will of HaShem and descending into Egypt.

This interpretation is shared by Abraham ibn Ezra.

Ramban, however, held the polar opposite opinion.

In his commentary on the Torah, he writes, “And know that [our patriarch] Abraham sinned a great sin inadvertently, by bringing his wife the saint in a compromising situation, due to his fear that he be killed.” He further suggests that Abraham should have trusted HaShem to save both him, his wife, and all that they owned, as HaShem had the power to aid and to protect him. Ramban insists that Abraham’s descent from the land where he had been guided was a sin as he should have known that HaShem would have kept him from perishing during the famine. “Because of this action,” he concludes, “It was decreed that his descendants be exiled to Egypt at the hand of Pharaoh.”

The belief that Abraham’s descent into Egypt would lead to the exile is also expressed in the Zohar.

It is later revealed that Hagar also left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham. It is important to note that the Torah provides information about Hagar immediately after describing the prophecy of the exile to Egypt.

Who was Hagar, and how did she become part of Sarah and Abraham’s household? The Torah does not say. However, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Midrash B’reishit Rabbah explains that: “Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter. When he saw the deeds on behalf of Sarah in his house, he took his daughter and gave her to her, saying, ‘Better that my daughter be a maidservant in this house than a mistress in another house.’”

This author believes that by analyzing the consequences of Hagar joining Abraham and Sarah’s household, another explanation for the event may be provided.

Pharaoh ruled the most powerful empire on earth. A small tribe enters his land, headed by a ‘shepherd.’ The shepherd has a very beautiful sister. Pharaoh takes the sister to his palace and bestows immense riches on her brother. From Pharaoh’s point of view, there is nothing unlawful about his actions.

However, it becomes apparent that the ‘shepherd’ has tricked him by disguising his wife as his sister. This event is followed by the punishment described above and the departure of Abraham’s family from Egypt, taking great riches.

What might Pharaoh have felt in this situation?





Firstly, he might have felt extreme humiliation (undeserved, from his point of view). It is worth noting that this punishment would have felt particularly shameful, as it was caused by a woman. This is reaffirmed, for instance, in Judges: “And Abimelech came up to the tower, and fought against it. And he went close to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. And a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. And he called hastily to the young man, his weapon bearer, and said to him, ‘Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ And his young man pierced him, and he died.”

At the same time, Pharaoh must have also been overcome with fear and hatred. Fear because he could feel that the Higher Power was on Abraham’s side. Hatred because of how deeply he had been humiliated. It would be reasonable to assume that Pharaoh wanted to seek revenge, but he could not afford to do so openly out of fear of the Higher Power. Thus, he decided to give away his daughter Hagar to serve as a handmaid. In this author’s opinion, Pharaoh understood that Hagar, a princess who owned countless slaves herself, would never be content as a simple handmaid in the household of Abraham and that sooner or later, this discontent would become manifest. Therefore, Pharaoh set the scene for potential conflict within Abraham’s household, and the events that followed would confirm the success of his plan.



The success of Pharaoh’s plan can be evidenced by the following arguments:

1 - The Torah provides information that Hagar left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham directly after disclosing information about the exile to Egypt.

2 - It is safe to assume that Sarah had several maidservants, including some from Ur Kaśdim (Ur of the Chaldeans), where her family lived. However, the servant that she gave away to become Abraham’s wife was Hagar the Egyptian. This fact also raises questions, as we know from the Torah that the men from Abraham’s family traditionally married their relatives (see Isaac or Jacob).

3 - Hagar becomes pregnant, which instantly elevates her over Sarah. Sarah loses importance in Hagar’s eyes. In the Midrash Bereishit Rabbah, we read: “Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeyahu in the name of Rabbi Hiya bar Abba said:...Hagar would tell them: ‘My mistress Sarai is not inside what she is outside: she appears to be righteous, but she is not righteous, had she been a righteous woman, see how many years have passed without her conceiving, whereas I conceived in one night!’”

4 - The fact that Sarah offered Hagar as Abraham’s second wife indicates that she (Sarah) had absolute confidence in Hagar’s loyalty to her, which, in turn, must mean that Hagar reaffirmed her devotion and love towards Sarah. However, as soon as Hagar conceives Abraham’s child, her behavior changes dramatically, and she starts to despise Sarah, essentially betraying her (this is Pharaoh’s plan in action).



5 - Sarah accuses Abraham of being too passive and invokes the Judgment of HaShem (Havaya) between them.



The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.” The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.”

6 - Considering that calling upon HaShem’s Judgement is a very extreme measure, one may assume that Abraham and Sarah had a major argument and completely failed to understand each other, which pushed Sarah to seek HaShem’s aid.

Preliminary Conclusions



Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant, creates a rupture in Abraham and Sarah’s family, which results in Sarah’s lifespan being shortened by forty-eight years. It should be noted that HaShem considers interpersonal relationships more important than our relationship with Him. There are two facts in the Torah that prompt this conclusion:



1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality. 1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality.

2 - The builders of the Tower of Babel were not destroyed, even though they intended to wage war on HaShem Himself. Instead, they were merely scattered across the earth because they had been a close-knit group and had treated each other with respect.

When people are arguing and divided, they are spiritually incapable of properly serving HaShem. Therefore, the conflict over Hagar diminished the spiritual level of Abraham and Sarah’s service. This will be discussed in further detail later in the article.

However, this is not the full extent of the negative consequences suffered by Abraham’s household due to the descent to Egypt and Hagar’s presence.

Abraham gives Hagar back to Sarah, who starts mistreating her. Hagar flees from Abraham’s home. This escape was an extraordinary feat on Hagar’s part, as runaway slaves were punished by death at the time.

This bold escape indicates Hagar’s strength of character; she was a princess through and through. Upon reaching a well in the desert, Hagar encounters an angel sent by HaShem (Havaya). The angel orders her to return to Sarah and informs her that she will have a son, whom she should name Ishmael.

Hagar addresses HaShem (Havaya) by saying, “You are the God of seeing (El Roi)!”, then names the well Lachai Ro’i. E-l is the name of HaShem that corresponds to the merciful aspect of Creation. Hagar returns to Abraham’s household and gives birth to her son, Ishmael.

In so doing, HaShem answers Abraham’s plea for an heir. However, because of Abraham’s descent to Egypt, it is Hagar, the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh, not Abraham’s first wife Sarah, who becomes the mother of his firstborn child. Abraham and Pharaoh are now kin, and the Pharaoh’s bloodline will continue through Ishmael. The sages note that Ishmael’s descendants have been among the worst enemies of the Jewish people.

‘HAGAR GIVING Ishmael Water From the Miraculous Well in the Desert,’ Charles Paul Landon. After some time, Sarah urges Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael, saying, “The son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

A later passage in the Torah states, “But the matter greatly displeased Abraham, concerning his son.” It is not hard to imagine the extent of Abraham’s distress. After all, he was to banish his firstborn son. However, HaShem appears to him under the name El-im, which stands for judgment. This is especially important. HaShem commands Abraham to do as Sarah tells him and promises that He will protect Ishmael.

The appearance of HaShem to Abraham under the name El-im signifies that every action performed by those in this story will be subject to judgment and bear the consequences.

Abraham banishes Hagar and Ishmael, leaving them all but empty-handed. They receive no more than a piece of bread and a waterskin, in effect sentencing them to near-certain death in the desert. This decision on the part of Abraham requires an in-depth analysis. In the Kabbalah, Abraham embodies the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, charity) at the absolute level. He was known to welcome total strangers into his home, offer them food and drink, and encourage them to embrace HaShem. In light of the above, it is quite clear that sending Hagar and Ishmael into the desert is a direct contradiction of Chesed.

Commenting on this event, Rashi explains that Abraham did not give Ishmael any gold or silver because he hated him for his wicked deeds. However, this statement directly contradicts another one of Rashi’s comments, where he elaborates on the command HaShem gave to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

The Torah says, “And He said, ‘Please take your son, your only one, whom you love, yea, Isaac, and go away to the land of Moriah...’”

Rashi interprets this passage as follows: He [Abraham] said to Him, “I have two sons.” He [God] said to him, “Your only one.” He said to Him, “This one is the only son of his mother, and that one is the only son of his mother.” He said to him, “Whom you love.” He said to Him, “I love them both.” He said to him, “Isaac.”’

It seems that these two comments by Rashi seem to contract each other. The first speaks of hate, the second of love.

There is another explanation behind Abraham’s uncharacteristic behavior. To understand, one must look at the words said by Sarah to Abraham: “Drive out this handmaid and her son, for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

From these words, it can be concluded that Sarah is not just telling Abraham to exile Hagar and Ishmael; she is also forbidding him from giving them any property. This is why HaShem will later appear to Abraham as El-im (judgment). Sarah may have been motivated by the fact that Abraham owed all of his wealth to the suffering that she endured in the house of Pharaoh and the house of Abimelech.

From the above events, we can conclude that Sarah never forgave Hagar for her betrayal. She had to put up with her presence, because she had been unable to bear a child. With the birth of Isaac, the situation had changed.

Sarah knew that Isaac and Ishmael could not live together because there would be continued strife and rivalry between them. From that point of view, the decision to banish Hagar and Ishmael was correct. However, to send them empty-handed into the desert, especially that given that Ishmael was ill, was unnecessary cruelty.

Thus, we witness yet another negative consequence of Abraham’s descent to Egypt: he is forced to banish his firstborn child into the desert empty-handed. This causes Abraham immense pain.

After some time, HaShem commands Abraham to take Isaac up the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. This raises the question: was this command linked to any of the previous events? Rashi cites the sages who believed that this could have been due to Satan’s complaint to HaShem that Abraham was not making the customary offerings. Another theory stipulates that this event was instigated by Isaac boasting to Ishmael that he was ready to sacrifice himself to HaShem. The very fact that the sages were trying to determine the reason behind the binding of Isaac affirms that they could not (or would not) conceive that this extremely painful challenge could not be the result of some past misdoing.

This urges the consideration of another version of the above-mentioned events based on the ‘measure for measure’ principle. Sarah tells Abraham to cast Ishmael, the son of Hagar, into the desert, while he, according to the sages, was sick and bereft of any source of sustenance, effectively dooming him to perish. HaShem, under the name El-im (judgment), assuages Abraham’s anguish, telling him that He will take care of Ishmael. HaShem then performs a miracle to save Ishmael.

According to the ‘measure for measure’ principle, HaShem instructs Abraham to take Isaac, the son of Sarah, to the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. However, Abraham had earlier been given the prophecy that Isaac would become his heir. Abraham passes the test, proving himself worthy. HaShem miraculously saves Isaac, yet we can imagine how Sarah felt when she learned of HaShem’s command. The story of the binding of Isaac (Aqeidah) contains multiple explicit and implicit lessons that will be examined further on.

The following is one of several arguments (which will be provided below) in favor of the opinion that the Aqeidah was linked to Ishmael’s exile:

1. Hagar flees Abraham’s household and meets an angel of Havaya. The angel tells her that she will give birth to a son and that she must name this son Ishmael, then commands her to return. Hagar names the well Lachai Ro’i.

2. The passage that describes the meeting between Isaac and Rebecca specifies that Isaac “was on his way, coming from Be’er Lachai Ro’i.” In his commentary, Rashi suggests that Isaac must have traveled to the well “to bring Hagar [who had been given the new name, Keturah] to Abraham, his father, that he should marry her” following Sarah’s death.

The story of Abraham’s funeral mentions that Isaac returns to Lachai Ro’i after burying his father. Rashi does not provide any commentary on this event.

Based on the aforementioned points, it can be concluded that Isaac did not merely travel to Lachai Ro’i in order to fetch Hagar. Rather, he lived there. In this case, the question is: what is the connection between Isaac’s residence near Lachai Ro’i and the Aqeidah? This author believes that there is, in fact, a direct connection.

In the Torah, Isaac asks Abraham, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” To which Abraham replies, “G-d [referred to as El-im, judgment] will provide for Himself [yir’eh-lo] the lamb for the burnt offering.” When Abraham raises his knife over Isaac, he is stopped by an angel of Havaya (in this instance, the name Havaya appears as the emanation of mercy).

A further passage reads, “And Abraham named that place, The Lord [Havaya] will see, as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” This signifies that the Temple will be built in that spot, and Havaya will see the offerings made here by the Jewish people. The location will, therefore, become a place where the information conveyed by Havaya will be made particularly clear.

The Lech-Lecha reading that describes Hagar’s flight states: “And an angel of the Lord [Havaya] found her by a water fountain in the desert [...] and she [Hagar] called the name of the Lord [Havaya], Who had spoken to her, ‘You are the G-d [E-l] of seeing’ [...] Therefore the well was called Be’er Lachai Ro’i [The Well of Seeing].”

The name HAVAYA symbolizes the entire Sefirot system and may represent both mercy and judgment, whereas E-l represents a specific Sefirah: the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, sharing). Therefore, we see that an angel of Havaya appears to both Abraham on the Mountain and to Hagar, near the well. References to both of these locations given by Abraham and Hagar are almost identical, but in the second story, the name E-l is added.

This prompts the conclusion that the Lachai Ro’i well must have been a powerful place of revelation, where a significant amount of information from HAVAYA was disclosed (albeit not as powerful as the location of the future Temple).

In his commentary on the seventh reading of the Vayeira, the Lubavitcher Rebbe notes that Isaac gained the sacred status of a burned offering: the kind of sanctity that no other man had ever achieved before.

This leads to the conclusion that Isaac must have been highly receptive to the information conveyed by HAVAYA. Furthermore, this is likely why he settled near the Lachai Ro’i well.

In light of the above, it may be concluded that the binding of Isaac is linked directly to the events involving Hagar and Ishmael.

From the above, we can see that taking Hagar from Egypt caused a chain of painful events which affected Abraham, Sarah, and all the Jewish people.

Noah

Noah was part of the sinful pre-flood generation and could not have changed his circumstances on his own. Thanks to the miraculous intervention of HaShem, Noah and his family were spared from the Flood.

HaShem gave Noah clear instructions regarding what and whom he was allowed to take aboard the Ark. However, the Torah later mentions that Noah also took a grapevine. HaShem had not commanded him to do this, but neither had He explicitly prohibited it.

Either way, the presence of this very grapevine would be one of the factors that would provoke the devastating events revealed later in the Torah.

There are several interpretations of the nature of the forbidden fruit eaten by Adam and Eve. According to one interpretation, the forbidden fruit was a grape. There is significant reason to believe that this was the case.

Therefore, grapes indirectly caused the original sin and helped evil infiltrate the world. The grapevine prompted the downfall of Noah, who might have otherwise become the new Adam. Another argument in support of this theory could be the fact that the Nazirites were prohibited from consuming any food or drink involving grapes.

As such, a ‘pattern of Abraham’ is clearly evident. Like Abraham, Noah is miraculously freed from evil but does not sever his ties to evil entirely. The consequences for this are well-known.

The question naturally arises as to why Noah took a grapevine, even though HaShem had not instructed him to do so. Moreover, why was it a grapevine specifically, rather than another kind of fruit or seed?

The answer is obvious. Noah took something that he was fond of and feared losing in the Flood.

This conclusion is confirmed by subsequent events.





Lot’s Wife

In this story, Lot and his family cannot free themselves from the power of the people of Sodom, who are great sinners. Once again, HaShem intervenes miraculously. He saves Lot and his family but forbids them from looking back. Lot’s wife disobeys HaShem’s command. She looks back and is transformed into a pillar of salt.

This is yet another example of the ‘pattern of Abraham’ — the ties to evil have not been severed entirely.

It must be noted that the act of transforming a living human being into an inanimate object does not occur anywhere else in the Torah. This requires an explanation, which will be provided in a later chapter.

Jacob and Laban

In the story of Jacob and Laban, Jacob is forced to serve Laban, a sinful practitioner of magic, for twenty-one years. He decides to flee, but Laban pursues him. HaShem intervenes on behalf of Jacob and his family. He comes to Laban in a dream and tells him, “Beware lest you speak with Jacob, either good or evil.” This miraculous salvation is confirmed by Laban himself, who tells Jacob that he could have inflicted great harm upon him, but refrained from doing so, as commanded by HaShem. One would think that this means Jacob severed his ties with evil. However, this would be incorrect. Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim, which he used for black magic (meaning that they still bore a spiritual connection to him). There are numerous explanations as to why Rachel stole the idols, but we shall not dwell on them here. What matters is the sheer fact that another person’s property was stolen. The Torah tells us that HaShem, through Moses, instructed the children of Israel to destroy their idols, just as He Himself had destroyed the idols of the Egyptian gods. However, He never gave any command to steal idols, much less hold on to them.

Rachel did not tell Jacob that she had stolen the idols, knowing that he would never approve.

The story later takes a tragic turn: Laban accuses Jacob of theft. Outraged, Jacob wishes death upon the thief, not knowing that the true thief was, in fact, Rachel. She dies shortly afterward.

The “pattern of Abraham” emerges again, as the ties to evil were never truly severed.





The Exodus

As the children of Israel were fleeing Egypt, “a great mixed multitude” of Egyptians accompanied them. HaShem had commanded Moses to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt but had neither instructed nor prohibited that he take in anyone else who might join. That was Moses’ own decision. The consequences of his decision proved catastrophic for both the children of Israel and the entire world.

Marc Chagall’s ‘Moses Beholds All the Work,’ from The Story of Exodus (1966) When the Torah was first received, Moses, the Jewish people, and the rest of the world were elevated to the highest spiritual level. However, the Egyptians that left the land with the children of Israel later initiate the sinful cult of the golden calf. Along with the Jewish people, they create an idol out of gold and pray to it.

HaShem prepares to destroy the Jewish people until Moses prays for forgiveness, and HaShem chooses to reverse His decision. He does not reverse it entirely, however. Instead, He informs Moses that, rather than being personally present, He would be represented by an angel, signifying a significant spiritual downfall for the Jewish people. Moses continues to plead with HaShem not to send an angel but to remain with the Jewish people Himself. Moses knows that angels cannot think for themselves. They are, in a way, information-sharing programs. Furthermore, Moses also knows that the Jewish people would surely continue to commit sins in the future, and an angel, being an informational program, would dispense divine judgment, but have no capacity to forgive them. Only HaShem can grant forgiveness. This is reaffirmed in the works of the great Kabbalist scholars: Gates of Light by Joseph Gikatilla and The Palm Tree of Deborah by Moses Cordovero.

HaShem concedes to Moses’ pleas but reminds him that the Jewish people have not been fully absolved of their sin and that punishment is yet to follow.

The ties to evil have not been severed, and we see the “pattern of Abraham” once again.

Conclusion

The parallels identified above between events that affected different people at different times reaffirm that these stories contain an important lesson, which, in turn, requires a detailed examination through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information. This examination will be attempted in the following chapters. To achieve this, themes must be addressed in relation to the creation of information, the information space, the role of different informational worlds in Creation, the concept of the soul and its roots, the concept of evil.



I will also attempt to explain the idea of the concealment of God in the informational space. I will attempt to answer the question why the roots of the souls of the great evildoers come from a very high level. I will analyze the dynamics of the character of the Patriarchs with an emphasis on their interaction with evil and evildoers. The commandment of the Red Heifer also will be discussed. I will also attempt to explain the idea of the concealment of God in the informational space.

I will analyze the dynamics of the character of the Patriarchs with an emphasis on their interaction with evil and evildoers. The commandment of the Red Heifer also will be discussed.

Furthermore, subsequent chapters will provide an explanation for one highly important fact: the similarity between the command not to look back on Sodom, given by the Lord to Lot and his family, and the command not to leave the house until the morning after the Passover sacrifice, given by Moses to the Jewish people.

Berenike, also known as Berenice Troglodytica was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, upon a narrow rim of shore at the head of the Sinus Immunduson on the west coast of the Red Sea.

The city was named after his mother Berenice I, and served as a trading centre with the East Coast of Africa, India, and Arabia for the transportation of war Elephants and exotic goods.

The first stage of the Hellenistic period was interrupted by a period of abandonment for almost half a century around 200 BC, until the city was reoccupied in the latter part of the second century BC.

Archaeologists conducting studies of an ancient well used by the city garrison in a fortified gate complex, suggest that the city was abandoned due to climatic changes brought on by a volcanic eruption.

Previous research found that a volcanic eruption in 209 BC from an unidentified volcano ejected a significant amount of gas and ash into the atmosphere, shifting North-Eastern Africa’s climate and causing a weakening of the annual Nile flood.

The failure of the Nile flood drove the Egyptian people to rise up against the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt in a period known as the ‘Great Theban Revolt’ of 207–186 BC.

This climatic event most likely disrupted the fragile climate of the Red Sea region driving the drought at Berenike, causing the well to dry up and be buried with windblown sand.

Archaeologists methodically removed the thick layers of sand filling the well, where they found coins, amphora, and other datable material that suggest the event happened at the very end of the third century BC.

The drought closed the desert route to Berenike and disrupted the long-distance sea routes that the city was dependent upon, resulting in the eventual abandonment. Find out more

Here’s a look at the Arab League, an organization of 22 Middle Eastern and African countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

Facts

Ahmed Aboul Gheit of Egypt is the current secretary-general of the Arab League.

There are also four observer states: Eritrea, India, Brazil and Venezuela.

The Arab League’s purpose, from the Pact of the League of Arab States, is to promote closer political, economic, cultural and social relations among the members.

A council composed of representatives from the member states works together to settle disputes peacefully. The league has five major committees: political, economic, social and cultural, legal and Palestinian affairs.

Each member has one vote on the council. Decisions are only binding to the states that have voted for them.

Special to Ventura County Star

In the ancient world, one of the many ways kings taxed their subjects was based on the harvest of their subjects’ trees. According to a website sponsored by Ithaka, which describes itself as “a not-for-profit organization helping the academic community…”, sometimes these taxes were comically complicated.

For example, since likely crop yields in ancient Egypt depended on annual flooding of the Nile River, taxes required three tax collectors and two assessment periods. Before the floods, officials calculated taxes based on predicted flood heights.

After each flood, three assessors refined the tax by holding cords, stretching the cords, and recording by the number of cord lengths the extent of cropland watered. These experts then calculated as a tax 10% of the expected harvest.

Eco-tip:Toilet maintenance important for flow to avoid replacement

Ancient commentary on biblical injunctions shows similar procedures elsewhere. The Jewish holiday of Tu BiShvat, linked to the lunar calendar but celebrated this year on Thursday, commemorates the “birthday” of the trees, a demarcation enacted partly for an ancient tax.

Each tree, regardless of when it was planted, was counted as a year older on this date. The “tree year” was initially for Levitical prohibitions on fruit from the first three years, but later used because each year, or partial year, of the tree’s harvest, 10% of crop yield from each tree was owed to the Temple in Jerusalem for distribution to the priestly class and the poor.

Today, many Jews celebrate the birthday of the trees by planting trees. Although figs, dates and pomegranates are the traditional tree crops of the holiday, I will plant a persimmon tree this Thursday.

Bare root tree planting is generally best at this time of year, and in the bare root stage, planting is easier. As noted by University of California Farm Adviser Ben Faber, “In the bare root stage, trees are still dormant, and you don’t need to be as delicate with them” as you would with evergreens, which typically suffer transplant shock.

Although taxes no longer extract 10% of our harvest for a pharaoh, king or priestly class, and tithing to the hungry through organizations such as Food Forward or Food Share is voluntary, endemic to Ventura County are several other entities likely to extract a share of our crops.

Gophers are prevalent, so one measure to protect your new tree is to protect roots with a mesh gopher barrier. I have dug holes deeper than needed for the root ball, lined the bottom of the hole with chicken wire shaped into a basket, and filled the basket partially with dirt before planting the tree at the desired depth.

However, Faber warns, “You really need to line up the bottom of the tree ball with the bottom of the hole” because “if you dig it much deeper, the tree settles over time” and if the trunk stem is covered, the tree becomes vulnerable to disease.

Instead, Faber recommends products such as the Root Guard Speed Basket, which fits into the planting hole, preventing gopher attack.

Moles are also eager to extract a portion of your crop. They are not really eating roots, but digging for worms, disturbing the root system. Both moles and gophers can be killed with spear or harpoon style traps, which are better than anticoagulant poison bait traps because the poison may harm non-targeted species, including predators eating poisoned animals.

Ground squirrels eat roots, strip bark, and also take fruits and nuts from trees. You can stop squirrels with metal guards around tree trunks. Some gardeners place poison gas devices inside burrows.

Birds also try to take a share of crops. Screening or netting material tied around the tree is most effective. Sometimes, owl statues, fake snakes or cat statues can scare away birds, but only if these are repositioned frequently.

Tax authorities of the ancient world no longer take a portion of your garden, so non-toxic methods of pest control can help you enjoy the full wealth of your harvest.

HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. — When it rained Sunday afternoon, it poured, causing some street flooding for parts of Hillsborough County.

A flood advisory was in effect until 4 p.m. for north-central Hillsborough County. With the City of Tampa seeing quite a bit of reported flooding.

The city's street flooding map shows a stretch of W. Swann Ave., W. Azeele St. and Kennedy Blvd. dealing with water. As other streets are seeing smaller impacted areas.

NWS reports doppler radar indicated heavy rain in the area due to thunderstorms and that up to two to three inches of rainfall has been recorded.

Weather service personnel are also seeing stalled cars in the downtown area of Tampa. A resident shared a photo with 10 Tampa Bay of a car on W. Swann with water halfway up its tires.

For sale were distinctive pieces of jewellery, weapons, finely crafted ceramics, drinking vessels, and game boards—featuring unusual artistry and magnificent inlays of carnelian and lapis lazuli. These extraordinary pieces featured a complex symbology of animals, both wild and domesticated, depicted fighting among themselves or with human figures, the humans always triumphant. There were beautifully realised bucolic scenes of animals grazing in vast palm groves and architectural reproductions of temples or palaces.

Data provided by the internet sites and auction houses selling these mysterious pieces was sparse and, at best, vague. Their origins were often listed as “from Central Asia.” At first, it was assumed that the pieces were the work of expert forgers, but as more came on the market in the following months, scholars began to speculate that they could be genuine, deriving from an undocumented site whose location was unknown to them. In 2002 more appeared on the market.

Iranian police solved the mystery later that year. A coordinated investigation led to the arrest of several traffickers and the confiscation of a hoard of artefacts. These objects were being prepared to be shipped from Tehran, Bandar ‘Abbas, and Kerman to buyers around the world. Investigators revealed that most of these distinctive pieces could be traced back to a location in the Halil River Valley, about 25 miles south of Jiroft, a remote and peaceful city in southeastern Iran, not far from the Persian Gulf.

But where did these mystery artefacts come from? At the time, scholars knew of no dig sites in the area, but when they looked closer, they found a simple yet surprising explanation. In early 2001 flooding caused the Halil River to overflow its banks and erode the surrounding lands. Layers of sediment were washed away, and the remains of an ancient cemetery were exposed. Locals and looters quickly recognised the importance of the find and moved to collect and sell the artefacts they were finding.","Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.nationalgeographic.co.uk/files/styles/image_3200/public/human-cheetas-2.jpg?w=1600&h=1035,"['market', 'sites', 'culture', 'buried', 'location', 'artefacts', 'cradle', '4000', 'mystery', 'pieces', 'halil', 'objects', 'scholars', 'civilisation', 'ancient', 'river', 'expand']",

Others, like North Korea, have been on the receiving end of diplomatic overtures once considered unthinkable.

By Rehab Abd Almohsen

[CAIRO] Egypt’s Nile river water supply will only be threatened by the filling of the upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in the case of prolonged drought, new analysis suggests.

The dam, and ongoing negotiations over its filling and future operation, has sparked conflict between Ethiopia and downstream states Sudan and Egypt, which say they fear the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam could alternately cause water scarcity and flooding in their countries.

Data analysis shows that Egypt will not be severely affected by the first stage of the filling of the dam, says Peter Hany, a professor of irrigation and hydraulics at Egypt’s Ain Shams University.

“In the case of an abundance of water, or a sudden flood that necessitates the release of large quantities of water, it is possible that the Sudanese dams will not bear this pressure and collapse.” Mohamed Dawoud, National Center for Water Research in Egypt

However, a decline of five billion cubic metres in Egypt's share of Nile river waters — about 12.5 per cent of what Egypt says is its minimum need — could lead to the loss of 42,000 hectares of agricultural land, Hany warns.

Recent heavy rains mean the first stage of filling is already complete, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister said after an extraordinary meeting between the three states last week (21 July).

Sudan reported last week that it had recorded a significant drop in water levels along its sections of the Nile.

The African Union called the summit in an effort to progress stalled political, legal and technical negotiations and arrive at a comprehensive operational agreement for the dam.

Hany says beginning the filling process this year, rather than next year, was the better option as water levels are currently high in Egypt’s Lake Nasser, which fills from the Nile and provides water for agriculture and energy production.

A seven-year filling schedule had been tentatively agreed as a result of a series of negotiations that began in December, but Ethiopia has been pushing for a four-year schedule to expedite its energy production.

Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s water, irrigation and energy minister, has said the release of water will remain above the historical 29 billion cubic metre flow. Egypt wants Ethiopia to commit to a minimum 40 billion cubic metres of water.

“By following this schedule, the possible range of water release is between 31 and 43 billion cubic meters during the seven years, at 80 per cent probability,” Bekele told a virtual seminar held by the Ethiopian Embassy in South Africa on June 27.

“The schedule clearly shows for the first time the filling pattern, which includes six stages, the last of which is estimated at 14 billion cubic meters,” Hany tells SciDev.Net.

Hany used this data to create a mathematical model to determine the impact that filling Ethiopia’s reservoir would have on Egypt’s Aswan High Dam and the water level in its reservoir, Lake Nasser.

Hany found that if the schedule is maintained, the impact during filling would be limited, except in the event of periods of prolonged drought.

The Nile river states agreed at the extraordinary meeting to separate scientific and technical negotiations from the political and legal issues. Dates are yet to be set for future meetings, which will be hosted by the African Union.

Also downriver from the hydropower structure, Sudan has said it fears Ethiopia’s dam will impact its own hydroelectric installations. The Nile river countries have constructed a series of dams along its length — known as cascading dams or reservoirs — and river flow fluctuations caused by upstream dams can have major implications for downstream dams.

Sudan’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Yasir Abbas, has said he feared a lack of coordination and data exchange from Ethiopia.

Mohamed Dawoud, a professor of water resources at the National Center for Water Research in Egypt, says that in the absence of a binding agreement, Sudan’s dams are at risk of being severely harmed.

The Sudanese dams are relatively small,"" Dawoud tells SciDev.Net. ""In the case of an abundance of water, or a sudden flood that necessitates the release of large quantities of water, it is possible that the Sudanese dams will not bear this pressure and collapse.""

Environmental conflict expert Ashok Swain, from Uppsala University’s Research School of International Water Cooperation, says the African Union is best placed to play the role of mediator in Nile negotiations.

“Any agreement is better than no agreement, as no one is expecting a comprehensive basin-based water resource development agreement taking place among the three riparian countries soon,” Swain says.","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.preventionweb.net/files/72932_largeImage.jpg,"['egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'dams', 'nile', 'limited', 'drought', 'cubic', 'egypts', 'dam', 'schedule', 'impact', 'river', 'filling']",

The Egyptian media, many internet users and a handful of celebrities dismissed COVID-19 as a hoax and even joked about it.

Asked about the threat from COVID-19, Egyptian film stars attending the opening ceremony of the Luxor African Film Festival mocked the pandemic.

""We eat salted fish and onions, are you joking? What coronavirus are you talking about? The coronavirus will fall ill if it comes to Egypt,"" joked actress Zena.

""We are Egyptians, nothing scares us,"" comedian Badria Tolba told reporters. ""We are being asked to avoid large gatherings, but we continue to gather; they advise us not to kiss, but we kiss each other all the time.""

""I actually like Corona with milk and Turkish delight,"" she added, referencing the Egyptian chocolate brand that shares the virus' name. A video clip of her remarks spread quickly, sparking controversy on social media.

In the early weeks, after news of the pandemic broke, the media promoted the narrative that Egypt is ""untouchable"" and that Egyptians ""are immune"" to coronavirus.

Talk show hosts across Egyptian TV promoted the message that ""Egypt is protected by God. No harm can befall us."" Clerics propagated a similar message on social media. In one video, a preacher tells worshippers in his Friday sermon: ""Muslims shouldn't fear coronavirus. They perform ablution five times a day, which makes it impossible for them to get infected."" In another online video, a Coptic Orthodox priest in Assiut asks his congregation to repeat after him, ""If we pray from the bottom of our hearts, coronavirus won't come anywhere near us.""

Veteran TV presenter Sanaa Mansour said on her show on the DMC satellite channel, ""We drink our water and don't get sick so it seems we [Egyptians] have developed a natural immunity to viruses that kill people elsewhere."" Her comment was a reference to the poor quality of Egypt's drinking water, generally considered unsafe.

Said Sadek, a political sociologist at Nile University, attributed such misconceptions to Egyptians' perception of themselves as resistant to external factors. ""We have a saying, 'Egyptians eat pebbles,' which basically means we can overcome practically anything,"" Sadek told Al-Monitor. “This is the result of a media narrative that persistently inflates our self-image. It also stems from the fact that many poor Egyptians struggle on a daily basis and yet miraculously manage to survive. They are inclined to underestimate the threat of the virus because the way they see it is: How does a virus that causes flu-like symptoms compare to the hardships we face every day?""

After the suspension of international flights to and from Egypt in mid-March, initial skepticism gave way to anxiety and fear, which, in turn, prompted even more misinformation about COVID-19. Fake news flooded Egyptian TV, including a host of alleged COVID-19 cures and prevention methods. TV anchor Amany El Khayat suggested on her show on Extra News that ""drinking tea is a sure way of killing the virus in the throat before it reaches one's chest.""

In a live TV interview on al-Nahar satellite channel, former TV presenter Moufid Fawzy claimed that India was the only other country besides Egypt that was coronavirus-free ""because spices that are high in chromium are widely consumed in the Indian diet."" While chromium has indeed been found to help metabolize fats and control blood sugar, spices are by no means the only source of this essential mineral, also found in whole grains, cereals, mushrooms and a variety of other foods. More importantly, no medical evidence supports Fawzy's claim that chromium helps prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Egyptian social media is also rife with fake coronavirus cures. In an audio file making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter, a woman shares what she claims to be ""a magical cure for the new virus: gargling with warm salty water three times a day.""

“I tried it myself after coming down with what I'm pretty sure was coronavirus disease. It cured my cough instantly and relieved the pain in my throat,"" she says.

Scores of Egyptians defied the government's calls to stay home and flocked to the beaches in Alexandria the weekend of March 27. The move prompted Alexandria Gov. Mohamed El Sherif to order the closure of all Alexandria beaches, effective March 29.

Some traders, meanwhile, are exploiting fear of the pandemic by promoting their products online as cures to prevent or treat the coronavirus. One herbalist reportedly put up a sign in his store reading ""anti-coronavirus anise seeds sold here,"" according to the news portal El Balad. He also published a picture of the product on social media, evoking interest among some internet users who asked where they could buy the anise seeds, El Balad reported.

The spice, used to enhance flavor in food or consumed as an herbal tea, is known for its therapeutic benefits, including the improvement of digestion.

Another online rumor advocates consuming onions and garlic to protect against coronavirus. In a sarcastic tweet, comedian Mohamed Henedy argued that this would be a good way to help people self-isolate.

Conspiracy theories also abound. A popular theory among Egyptian internet users claims that Chinese bat soup is the origin of the virus. The belief gained ground after false claims circulated online that the Egyptian Ministry of Health was checking Chinese restaurants for the new coronavirus. It led to an apparent spike in xenophobia against the Chinese in Egypt. A shocking online video shows a Chinese man running back and forth on a busy Cairo street, trying to get a lift. Drivers ignore his signal for them to stop and a car nearly runs him over. This is after the driver he had been riding with abandons him — and the car — for fear of becoming infected. The driver is earlier advised by another driver to dump his Chinese passenger on the road. The Chinese man who seems bewildered by the disappearance of the driver is also mocked by Egyptians shouting ""corona, corona!""

Egypt's pro-government media, meanwhile, are pushing the idea that coronavirus is a lab-manufactured biological weapon to destroy the Chinese economy. Advocates of this conspiracy theory made no mention of where the virus may have originated. TV presenter Basma Wahba devoted an episode of her daily show on the ONE channel to biological warfare in early February. ""Machine guns and cannons are no longer the weapons used in today's wars. Some countries resort to bio-weapons to target the economies of other states,"" she said.

Other talk show hosts like Ahmed Moussa attempted to politically exploit the pandemic. He accused the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood of spreading coronavirus. ""Malaysia is among the countries hardest hit by the new virus because it has given refuge to exiled members of the group,"" Moussa said on his show on Sada al-Balad TV channel. ""Wherever the Muslim Brotherhood goes, crises emerge!""

But perhaps the weirdest — and most chilling — phenomenon to arise from the pandemic is the spread of apocalyptic prophecies. An online video published March 23, shows a man standing in front of a mosque and claiming to be ""the awaited Mahdi,"" or savior. According to the sayings of Prophet Muhammad, or hadiths, the Mahdi is a descendant of the prophet who will appear before Judgement Day to rid the world of injustice, oppression and other evils. ""I am the Mahdi sent by Prophet Muhammad to spread his message across the world, there is no prophet after me, for I am here to redeem you,"" the man shouts.

Sadek is not surprised. ""In uncertain times, it is not uncommon to find some power-hungry people who make tantalizing promises to change the world,"" he said. ""Very often, those are cult leaders or attention seekers from poor backgrounds. They appear in marginalized areas where the residents are also poor and uneducated and so are more likely to be influenced.""","Mon, 30 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/almpics/2020/03/RTS378OJ.jpg/RTS378OJ.jpg?h=a5ae579a&itok=0zAl84Kf,"['flood', 'amid', 'egypt', 'conspiracy', 'tv', 'media', 'virus', 'theories', 'misinformation', 'egyptian', 'egyptians', 'battles', 'chinese', 'coronavirus', 'online', 'video', 'covid19']",

Please note: Due to a flood warning, Route 10 will be closed from Monday, except for the section between Ezuz and Mount Harif junction.

Closed to civilian traffic for most of the year, the road was opened Friday for Hanukkah, and will remain open through Saturday, December 19. In recent years, the highway has only been opened during holidays, to enable travelers to enjoy the view and have easier access to the fascinating Mount Karkom site.

Driving along Route 10, you can reach stunning sites such as the Kadesh Barnea observation point, 670 meters above sea level, where you can gaze at northern Sinai, and the Har Hursha lookout that offers a wonderful view north toward Kadesh Barnea, and northeast toward Ramat Barnea and Mount Hamran. The view to the west is even more enticing, as you look over the border into Sinai.

With binoculars you can clearly make out the area of Ein al-Qudeirat, which some believe is the site of the biblical Kadesh Barnea – a large oasis where the Israelites dwelled for a long time during their wanderings in the desert following the exodus from Egypt. Another marvelous lookout – which faces west toward Sinai and the winding border fence – is 11 kilometers south of the Har Hursha lookout, slightly south of Border Marker 47, several hundred meters south of the memorial to Capt. Orion Salomon and Tal Tzuri, who died in a flight training accident in 1980.

Another interesting stop along the route is the Sabha cistern, about 1 kilometer down a dirt road east of the highway. The ancient water cistern, apparently from the Nabatean period 2,000 years ago, leads to an underground pool. It is filled with water year-round and on hot days, you can take a dip. Typically for the Nabateans, the cistern is well-hidden. It’s not easy to find if you don’t know of its existence. It’s currently covered with a sheet of tin that can be easily removed.

Mount Harif junction is 55 kilometers south of Nitzana Junction. The mountain rises to an elevation of 1,000 meters, though the highway is 200 meters below. From here you can continue south toward Mount Karkom and Eilat or turn east onto Route 171 and drive 40 kilometers north to Mitzpeh Ramon.

Off-road adventure

The opening of Route 10 gives those with 4X4 off-road vehicles a relatively comfortable way to reach Mount Karkom, one of the most intriguing sites in Israel. The rest of the year, the only way to reach Mount Karkom is from the northeast, via a very long off-road drive from the direction of Mitzpeh Ramon. During Hanukkah, one can drive down Route 10 then turn east and drive off-road for just 10 kilometers to reach Mount Karkom.

Travel on Route 10 will be permitted from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and strict safety rules will be enforced: driving on marked routes only, in accordance with road conditions and not along the border fence. There are military posts spread out along the route for security and guidance. ID must be presented in order to enter the route. Photographing the border fence is prohibited. There are no gas stations along the route, so fill the tank ahead of time. Overnight camping is permitted only in approved campgrounds. Vehicles may not be left unsupervised. Littering is prohibited, to protect the wildlife. The area near the route is a military zone with training grounds. Touching unexploded ordnance or ammunition is strictly forbidden: If you come across any, you must report it to the Israel Defense Forces. In many areas along the route, there is no cellular reception.

CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday exchanged views on the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

During a phone conversation, Shoukry voiced his concern over the stalled African Union-led negotiations on filling and operating the GERD, according to a statement.

Shoukry reviewed elements of Sudan's recent proposal, which was backed by Egypt, to develop the negotiation mechanism through forming an international quartet led by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the current chair of the African Union.

Under the Sudanese proposal, the international quartet will also comprise the United Nations, the European Union and the United States.

The Egyptian diplomat stressed the need to launch a serious and effective negotiation process that will result in a fair, balanced and legally binding agreement on filling and operating the dam.

He emphasized that the deal should be reached before the next flood season when Ethiopia will start the second phase of filling the mega dam's reservoir.

During the phone call, Guterres confirmed that the United Nations is available to support and participate in the African Union-led negotiation process on the dam, according to Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres.

The UN chief expressed the hope that the process will count on the full engagement of the parties in a serious negotiation, said the spokesman.

Ethiopia started building the GERD in 2011, while Egypt is concerned that the dam might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the Nile water. Sudan has recently been raising similar concerns over the 4-billion-U.S.-dollar dam.

Over the past few years, tripartite talks on the rules of filling and operating the GERD, with a total capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, have been fruitless.

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

The hieroglyphs on Nile’s Sehel Island near Aswan in southern Egypt are more than 4,000 years old, but worries about the natural rhythm of the Nile, which provides 90% of Egypt's fresh water, are of no less importance today.

""The Nile does not reach its previous levels in the winter and summer flows,"" said 52-year-old Abdel Hares Mohamed, a resident of Aswan who gives Nile boat rides to tourists.

Officials say Egypt currently has around 570 cubic meters (150,000 gallons) of water per person per year. Experts consider a country as water poor if its supply is less than 1,000 cubic meters per person annually.

Experts blame population growth, climate change and a giant hydropower dam built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, which Egyptian authorities say poses a threat to its water security.

Ethiopia says it has taken the needs of Egypt and Sudan into account in the construction and scheduled fillings of its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

While modern day Egyptians can still empathize with King Djoser's plight, the measures he took to counter the drought would not get much support today. The ancient pharao was instructed by Imhoteb, the designer of his famous Step Pyramid, to offer a sacrifice to Khnum, God of the Nile.

""When Egypt had a famine for seven years, he (King Djoser) made a council ... And Imhoteb told him: we have to give an offering to Khnum,"" said egyptologist Zahi Hawass. ""Because Khnum controlled the water from the Nile.""

Two cars crashed due to the balcony’s collapse, resulting in two injuries.

A combination of snowfall for 15 minutes and rainwater reaching 20cm high caused Mansoura’s streets to flood, halting traffic in many areas.

Numerous shop owners called emergency services and the governorate operations room for help after their establishments were flooded.

One shop worker, Mustafa Ali, said: “The water entered the stores and goods and electrical appliances were destroyed. We were unable to control it due to the clogging of sanitation.”

A child was also electrocuted in Port Said Street after several electrical poles fell, and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

99,99,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Floods on record-high Lake Victoria expose need for water cooperation - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-floods-environment-trfn-idUSKCN25F1YU,"BUDALANGI, Kenya (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya’s western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called “backflow”.

“We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,” said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

“There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,” said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake’s water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

“Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda’s Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the “speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers” feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria’s shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

“While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,” Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya’s government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

“The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,” Opere said.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['floods', 'school', 'rainfall', 'recordhigh', 'water', 'rivers', 'uganda', 'dams', 'flooding', 'lake', 'expose', 'climate', 'need', 'victoria', 'cooperation']",
