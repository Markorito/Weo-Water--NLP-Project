0,0,FF-2018-000030-KEN,Industry loss from Australian floods estimated at A$1.055bn (US $825m) - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/industry-loss-from-australian-floods-estimated-at-a1-055bn-us-825m/,"The industry loss to insurance and reinsurance markets from March’s severe flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia has been initially estimated at A$1.055 billion (around US $825m) by PERILS.



The flooding hit the eastern region of Australia from 18th to 24th March 2021 and quickly a number of insurers said the event could cause them to tap their reinsurance protection.

PERILS estimate for just over A$1 billion of industry losses is based on claims for the property and motor hull lines of business.

Major river and surface water flooding occurred during the event, as a blocking high pressure system in the Tasman Sea interacted with a low-pressure system off north-west Australia that fed moist tropical air into eastern Australia.

The Mid North Coast, and the Hunter and Greater Sydney regions were the worst affected, while parts of south-east Queensland and eastern Victoria were also impacted by storm and flood damage.

Across a 7-day period, the New South Wales coastal region experienced the highest recorded rainfall since national records began in 1900, PERILS explained.

Some locations along the mid-north coast of New South Wales recording as much as 600-800mm of rain.

Damage to private property and businesses was largely covered by insurance, while losses to public infrastructure, crops and livestock remained largely uninsured, PERILS said.

Darryl Pidcock, Head of PERILS Asia-Pacific, stated, “During the week ending 24 March 2021, the East Coast of Australia experienced extreme rainfall over both a wide geographic area and an extended period. The resulting damage from storm drain water and river flooding was considerable, especially for New South Wales, where the event represents the largest industry flood loss on record. While damage to private property was largely insured, there were cases where policyholders decided to opt out of flood cover reminding us of the challenges the industry still faces in offering sustainable and affordable flood risk protection in Australia.”

“We appreciate how difficult it’s been for parts of Canterbury and our customers in the flood-affected areas,” said the airline’s CEO, Greg Foran.

“That’s why we are offering them fare flexibility to get to their destinations, including over the holiday weekend. We have also offered to carry essential supplies or emergency personnel helping with the flood response.”

Earlier, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern surveyed the damage to the region by air.

“It is quite devastating, there is a lot of work to do. A big clean up job lies ahead of us,” she said.

“You could see winter feed had been affected, you could see how for some farmers they’ll be completely cut off from accessing winter feed, you could see damage to fencing and of course the impact on transport links.

“We could see just from the air a lot of broken trees, shingles all through properties that will need to be cleared alongside fencing damage.”

Customers booked to travel to and from Christchurch or Timaru up to and including Tuesday, 8 June 2021 may fly in or out of another port in the South Island on or before Sunday, 13 June 2021.

Customers wishing to make changes to their booking should call Air New Zealand’s Contact Centre on 0800 737 000 or contact the airline via its social media channels to have the fare difference and fees waived.

Last year, Australian Aviation reported how Air New Zealand customers donated nearly 250,000 frequent flyer points to three charities, which were able to redeem them on essential services such as food, heating and petrol.

Air New Zealand general manager loyalty Kate O’Brien said she was blown away by the generosity of customers helping people struggling through COVID.","Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:28:26 GMT",https://australianaviation.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/An-Air-New-Zealand-A321-271NX-ZK-NNG-shot-by-Victor-Pody.jpg,"['including', 'customers', 'fencing', 'flights', 'winter', 'ups', 'aid', 'timaru', 'lot', 'flood', 'helping', 'zealand', 'response', 'offered', 'air']",

In line with its events definition, the latest loss figure covered the property and motor hull business lines.

According to PERILS, the areas most affected were the Mid North Coast and the Hunter and Greater Sydney regions. Adjacent parts of southeast Queensland and eastern Victoria were also affected by storm and flood damage.

From March 18 to 24, the NSW coast experienced the highest recorded rainfall since national records began in 1900, with some locations along the mid-north coast of New South Wales recording 600 to 800 millimetres of rain.

The resulting damage to private property and businesses was covered to a large part by insurance. Meanwhile, losses to public infrastructure, crops, and livestock remained largely uninsured.

3,3,FF-2018-000030-KEN,Parents of Pakistani man who died in NSW floods forced to watch burial through car window - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/05/parents-of-pakistani-man-who-died-in-nsw-floods-forced-to-watch-burial-through-car-window,"The parents of a man who died when his car was trapped in New South Wales flood waters have farewelled their son at a prayer service in Sydney after flying in from Pakistan.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son’s body or coffin and were kept apart from Younus’s friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younus’s father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

“When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,” the grieving father said.

“I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didn’t happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.”

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

“Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me,” he said.

“One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.”

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

“I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.”

Younus had three siblings – two older brothers and a younger sister – who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younus’s parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his son’s coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia’s mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the family’s travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younus’s coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends – Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. “We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities,” he said. “We would spend time there with friends.”

The housemate said Younus “loved going to the gym and playing volleyball – he was a very energetic person”.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younus’s parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

“They’re in quarantine at the moment and an exemption was given only after an intense negotiation, with the immigration department, for them to be released for only a very short period of time,” he said. “It was a minute-to-minute procedure.”

The funeral for Younus was delayed due to a coronial inquiry and because of the complications in obtaining permission for his parents to attend.

4,4,FF-2018-000030-KEN,New Zealand hosts Australia PM in 1st meeting since outbreak - Federal News Network,https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-news/2021/05/australia-leader-morrison-visits-new-zealand-leader-ardern/,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — Growing friction with China and how to reopen borders after the pandemic will likely be among the topics discussed by the leaders of Australia and New Zealand in their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together.

Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus. The neighbors opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in Melbourne has prompted New Zealand to suspend the arrangement with Victoria state.

Morrison’s visit came as New Zealand was dealing with extensive flooding in the Canterbury region following heavy rains. Video footage showed one farmer being rescued by helicopter from a raging river, while other swelling rivers threatened to flood thousands of homes.

The choice of Queenstown for the meeting was deliberate as New Zealand tries to revive its battered tourism industry. Queenstown has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, although tourism operators say they expect a boost from Australian tourists during the upcoming ski season now that the travel bubble has begun.

The changing dynamics with China have been a big topic in both countries.

Australia’s relationship with China has deteriorated significantly. China has blocked some Australian exports after Australia excluded China-based telecommunications company Huawei from its 5G phone network and called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.

New Zealand has also been more outspoken against China on some issues in recent months, although it has so far maintained better relations with the superpower than Australia.

Ardern said she would talk with Morrison about the pandemic recovery as well as key regional challenges and security issues.

“Our relationship with Australia is our closest and most important and this has never been more evident than in these trying times for the world,” Ardern told reporters.
