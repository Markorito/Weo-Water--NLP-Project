In some places, at least, people are finding innovative ways to adapt, according to new research. A new study shows that using nature to adapt to intense storms and drought can be affective for thriving in a changing climate.

In some Indonesian villages on Borneo Island and Java, people cut down trees along the banks of rivers to sell or use for fuel. Without the trees there as a buffer, the soil erodes into the streams, swallowing up the water or turning it murky brown. At the same time, these islands are experiencing more instances of intense rain and drought, making it more difficult to grow food.

Giacomo Fedele, climate change adaptation fellow at Conservation International’s Moore Center for Science, traveled to two villages in Borneo and two villages in Java to learn how different communities responded to flood and drought caused by climate change. In a recent interview, Human Nature spoke with him about his research.

Question: What were you looking for in your research?

Answer: I surveyed four different villages on Borneo and Java, and spent two months in each village, observing how the villages adapted to climate change.

They’re experiencing more frequent and intense floods, drought, pests and diseases that directly affect their livelihoods. For example, the crops they produce are rice and other vegetables. So, when there’s a flood or a drought, the yields could be reduced up to 50 percent.

The villagers notice changes and they’re taking action to adapt to the changes. That’s what the study is about: How people use natural resources and ecosystems to adapt to a changing climate and its impact on droughts and floods.

Q: What do these changes look like?

A: Carbon is increasing [in the atmosphere] and local biodiversity is decreasing, which drives climate change.

Some people are converting the forests to rubber plantations because they offer more flexible livelihoods. They can store this rubber and they can sell it anytime they want. They can tap the trees, get the latex and then they sell it in the market whenever they need to. This is better than forests for them, but of course the long-term effects might be worse because cutting down trees can drive climate change. They might not be aware of those effects now. They need this money to repair their houses and to buy new seeds for the crops.

I was looking at how this kind of management of natural resources is impacting the water, the carbon sequestration and the biodiversity. These actions impact the local community and often the whole region. Often the community doesn’t realize the people downstream also need the watershed well-preserved with trees and forests that help filter the water. They also don’t think about carbon and how it’s destabilizing the climate. It could easily go into this vicious cycle, but the good part of the story is that there are several strategies that provide multiple benefits that are good for the communities.

Q: What are the strategies that the villages are using to mitigate these problems?

A: One strategy is agroforestry — planting more trees into their garden. This increases biodiversity and water availability seemed to increase slowly, which is particularly important in case of drought. When precipitation is scarce community members noticed more water. Usually they plant the rice three times during the year. If there’s not enough water — two times. And if there’s very little water — only one. Recently they’ve noticed that they can plant up to two times again.

Another adaptation strategy is reforestation of the least productive rice fields. They used to cultivate the steep slopes that are far from the river. They decided to change this because they need more time to access this land, it takes a lot of labor to prepare the land and people are getting too old to farm the land because some young people are migrating to the cities for better opportunities. Climate change and drought are making the soil less fertile, so they prefer to convert this agricultural land back to forest by planting teak. Teak requires less attention. They don’t have to water the plants in case of drought. They can cut and harvest [the teak] anytime they want. Teak is good for land productivity, for the water, for the biodiversity and for reducing carbon.

Q: Was there any difficulty persuading people to use these long-term solutions rather than short-term?

A: I think you can have both. You can talk to people about the long-term changes and how it’s important to reforest and protect some areas now for the future benefits.

People experienced a lot of changes in the land use in the last 20 years. Forests were completely converted to agricultural land, so they noticed the changes in the water quality. Communities will tell you we have this natural forest and now it has been cut down and converted to a plantation and we noticed a decline in the water availability. In the tropics, the trees grow very fast. In 10-20 years it can be a forest again. They noticed improvements in the water after 5-10 years of regrowing forests. So, this is really encouraging. You don’t have to choose between having a protected forest, or you having your field of crops. It’s about finding this compromise between uses for land.

Q: Did anything surprise you?

A: I was very surprised that all of the strategies were “bottom-up.” For example, there was only one farmer that started planting teak on his land, but the other farmers started copying this strategy because they saw the benefits. The farming association started distributing seedlings, helped to create rules on how to cut and when to prune these trees, the distance they should have between each other, as well as a formal rule that says every time they cut one tree, they should try to plant at least 10 others. They also have all these informal social rules — they even take pride in taking care of their gardens.

In another case, the village chief noticed that the forest was getting very degraded. There was more soil going to the river and this was increasing floods. The very progressive village chief made a rule that people couldn’t cut the trees at the top of the river anymore. They could use the branches and the leaves, but not the trees, so they would help to stabilize the soil. In this case, some products decreased, like the wood because they couldn’t use it, but the long-term benefits compensated for it. This was the initiative of one village chief, but the people followed it. There was some social pressure not to be “that person” who cuts the trees along the river.

Q: Are there any plans for the next steps of the research?

A: I think it’s important to figure out which type of land use management makes sense in this particular area and be aware of the tradeoffs. With this research, we can show that local people are already taking action and sometimes they just need an external facilitating role to help them scale up what is already happening, so they can build on the practices that make sense for them and the environment. The research shows the big trends and effective strategies are already in place even without much external help. The external help can be redirected to support what makes sense.

Linkedin News Desk (The Jakarta Post) Jakarta ● Wed, June 27, 2018 17:05 1071 a7124a1e87885b91d244660f9eb08653 1 City flood,mitigation,anies-baswedan Free

The Public Works and Housing Ministry's flood control office has questioned Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan about the continuation of a river dredging program to mitigate floods in the capital.

At least five neighborhood units (RT) in South and East Jakarta were inundated on Monday after rain hit the city and caused Ciliwung River to overflow.

The head of the ministry's Ciliwung-Cisadane Flood Control Office (BBWSCC), Jarot Widyoko, said he had delivered a letter to the governor to ask him about the program, given that in August and September the body would start planning its budget for 2019.

The body would not allocate finances to Jakarta if the city administration could not clear the land for river dredging, as happened this year, Jarot said.

However, Anies had yet to respond to the letter, he said.

Jarot went on to suggest that Anies immediately explain Jakarta's river dredging program to him or the public works and housing minister.

“Please tell the minister soon about the plan, so the budget [for the river dredging program] can be allocated,” Jarot said on Tuesday as quoted by kompas.com.

Previously, the plan to dredge Ciliwung and Pesanggrahan rivers was cancelled because the city administration could not acquire the land for the program.

In 2017, the BBWSCC returned the budget of Rp 40 billion (US$2.8 million) because the river dredging program in the capital could not be carried out.

Previously, former Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama dredged rivers by relocating residents living on river banks to low-cost apartments.

Anies promised during his campaign that he would not arbitrarily relocate residents.

2,2,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Australian Property King Iwan Sunito Returns to Indonesia - Jakarta Globe,https://jakartaglobe.id/context/hold-iwan-sunito-property-king-homecoming/,"Jakarta. Iwan Sunito left Indonesia nearly three decades ago to become one of Australia's top property developers.

In 1994, he founded the Crown Group, which is known for numerous landmark apartment projects in Sydney and Melbourne. By 2020, it is going to invest Rp 23.5 trillion ($1.66 billion) in Australia, Indonesia and the United States.

The group has been present in Indonesia since 2013. In early May, it joined forces with Jakarta-based resorts operator Pembangunan Jaya Ancol to develop a Rp 7 trillion apartment complex in North Jakarta, which will be one of Crown's largest projects.

For the developer, the waterfront apartment is not just a homecoming project.

Iwan went to Australia to study. Soon he decided to start a property business and embarked on an exceptionally successful career. When he visited Indonesia in May, he shared his story with the Jakarta Globe.

What was your childhood like?

I think I've been quite blessed that I had an opportunity to grow up in places like Kalimantan, in a remote town, in Pangkalan Bun. It's a jungle over there and in the back of our house was a tropical rainforest. Once in a while, like when I was 10 years, flood waters would cover the house. As we were kids at that time, we just enjoyed swimming, even though the house was flooded.

My mom came from Surabaya (East Java) and dad studied in Surabaya. We tried to build a business in Surabaya, but it did not go well, so we went back to Kalimantan and my dad started working with somebody else, selling timber for roofs.

That's how he started his business. Mom and dad at that time wanted their kids to go to Surabaya. As they were still running the business in Pangkalan Bun, I grew up with my maternal grandfather.

There I finished my junior high school and almost finished high school, but I failed one year. It was very embarrassing.

But then I finished it and went to Sydney to study. After I received a bachelor's in architecture, I continued to study construction management. It was really good. I love architecture, because it teaches design excellence. The master's course in construction management from the University of New South Wales taught me about building sites, economics, feasibility studies.

When I graduated, I had these two skills, which helped me to be where I am today. I have always wanted to be an architect as much as a property developer, because this way I can control the design, the quality, the way I want it to be.

Have you ever tried other businesses?

Of course, I started as an architect. The first year was really, really tough. But I didn't venture into anything other than building management.

When I later did, it was more of a joint venture with other people, and I learnt I didn't want to do any business that I didn't understand.

It was a computer business and we lost the investment. And then another friend of mine invited us to a restaurant business. Again, it didn't work.

From there on, rather than trying to do too many things, I thought that focusing on one business is far more powerful than trying to do everything. It's like what Warren Buffet said: ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand.""

What was the key to your success?

I've never dreamed to be where I am today ... never really had that sort of ambition. The only thing that I'm passionate about is actually producing good buildings, better buildings, better designs, better architecture.

But I think entrepreneurship has always been in my blood. I like to be creative, but I'm a person who is not ambitious in setting up goals, for if you don't achieve them, you get disappointed. I don't, I simply just work for it. Do what you can, with what you have.

When people stand in front of a mountain, they see the summit, but they forget there is the mountain to climb. For me it is more like a journey, climbing and stopping sometimes to rest, to get my strength back, to acclimatize myself and then to climb up again, make the next step.

How did you survive the 2008 global economic crisis? How did Blue Ocean Strategy help you?

It was actually in 2004, the housing recession. At that time, when I was in despair, a friend and mentor of mine, Robbi Djohan, former chairman of Garuda Indonesia, gave me a book titled ""Blue Ocean Strategy.""

And I laughed because the book talks about how you create your own product and position yourself so as to have no competitors.

That time I thought about the best building. If you own the best building, you don't have to compete with anyone else.

We did that in 2004, we introduced an urban resort (a five-star apartment building). We sold the apartments, before it was complete. Our company reached a balance not long after that.

The business was growing and in 2008, during the global financial crisis, it continued to grow. We started to gain public recognition. After that, we got another one, a 2 billion dollar project. We had to move our office, because it became too small. It now has $5 billion in the pipeline. During 10 years the business has grown five-fold.

Do you have any dream projects?

If you look at the earlier days, when I was establishing the business, it was building the first house, the second... Of course, my dream then was to build 50 development projects. And later I saw people who were doing 400 to 500 units and asked myself how can they do that? Then I got to know and befriend other people, like Ciputra (the founder of property developer Ciputra Group), who designed and built a city. That became an inspiration for me.

My dream is to design a city in Indonesia. I hope the dream is not too far away.

There have been rumors you will be listing your company this year. Is this still on the table?

No, more likely in three years. There's a thought about listing the company in several countries. The first one is, of course, Australia, then Singapore. But to me this thing is not required for the company, because I want to make sure we fully understand what we are doing before we list it.

The company does not need to have an initial public offering for the sake of growing its business. To list it would be for our legacy, to allow the next generation to continue the business.

How much are you planning to raise?

I don't know the number yet, but I have something in my head. I'll let you know.

Are you looking for projects in other countries?

We want to focus on Australia, the United States and, of course, Indonesia.

How do you see the Indonesian market?

Indonesia is a big market for me, it is still an undiscovered country, and it has a huge young population, quite tech-savvy, with a capacity to grow digital.

There is also a great political progress, democracy. In fact, it is the third largest democratic country in the world. Friends that I meet, people who invest in China, Japan and some parts of Europe, are actually looking at Indonesia. I'm seeing a big shift, that's why we are here.

Are you planing any other projects in Indonesia, beside the Jakarta one?

Not at the moment. I want to start with Jakarta first. Thereis an offer in Surabaya, and I'm looking into it, but I'm not confident enough. I think Jakarta is a good place to start.

It's not only about developing a property project, I want to be part of Indonesia's development, participate in developing education, accelerating and revolutionizing the country.","Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2016/02/Iwan_Sunito_2015.jpg,"['surabaya', 'started', 'property', 'course', 'sunito', 'returns', 'business', 'iwan', 'building', 'jakarta', 'company', 'im', 'australian', 'king', 'indonesia']",

Up to 300 millimeters of rain fell on Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and western portions of Gangwon Province on Sunday. A 74-year-old was reported to be missing since Thursday, while a 73-year-old women got injured due to landslide on Sunday at 8 a.m. The heavy rainfall is expected to continue through Tuesday.



The Ministry of the Interior and Safety sent 36 officials to six cities and 11 provinces on Sunday as a pre-emptive measure against possible landslides caused by heavy rain. The government is considering setting up a disaster center as well.

Multiple cars were submerged in Boseong, South Jeolla Province, slowing traffic. Houses and rice paddies were flooded and railway services stopped on Saturday as heavy rain battered the area. A total of 383 trails in 13 parks were closed to pedestrians along with the Cheonggye Stream in Seoul on Saturday. Eighteen flights between Gimpo and Ulsan were also canceled.



Up to 400 mm of rain is forecast to pour down on Jeju Island and the Jeolla provinces starting Monday, due to the season’s seventh typhoon, Prapiroon, which formed from the southeast side of Okinawa, Japan, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration.

Prapiroon is expected to peak when it approaches Korea’s southeast coast on Monday morning. The typhoon is forecast to land at Yeosu, South Jeolla Province, Tuesday morning and exit through the east coast.



Prapiroon is a small typhoon with maximum wind speeds of 97 kilometers per hour, according to the weather agency.



Officials in Namhae, South Gyeongsang Province, held an emergency meeting Sunday after canceling a scheduled inaugural ceremony in order to provide measures for possible damages the typhoon could cause.

4,4,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Indonesia election season kicks off with crucial local polls - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/6/26/indonesia-election-season-kicks-off-with-crucial-local-polls,"More than 150 million Indonesians will head to the polls on June 27 to elect 17 governors, 39 mayors and 115 regents.

Bekasi, Indonesia – Soldiers are guarding a half-built Catholic Church in Bekasi, near Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.

The church has become a symbol of the election campaign of Rahmat Effendi, the mayor of Bekasi, a city of 2.7 million people, two million of whom are Muslim.

Despite strong local opposition against the building of the church, the Muslim mayor went ahead and issued a permit for it.

His decision came after church leaders lobbied his predecessors for 17 years without a result, forcing them to hold services in private homes.

“We have 340,000 non-Muslims in Bekasi, they need houses of worship. This does not mean they want to spread their religion. They simply want to pray,” the mayor said.

Effendi is one of the candidates in Indonesia’s regional elections on Wednesday.

Overall, more than 150 million Indonesians will head to the polls to elect 17 governors, 39 mayors and 115 regents, in what is seen as a major exercise in democracy in advance of next year’s presidential polls and a test for President Joko Widodo‘s chances to be re-elected.

After the election loss and jailing of Jakarta’s Christian Governor-elect Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaya Purnama in 2017, who was found guilty of blasphemy against Islam, there were concerns that religious and ethnic sentiments would dominate the polls.

But in Bekasi, a city tainted by religious violence for nearly a decade, the situation has remained quiet.

“There were rumours and fake stories spreading from mosque to mosque that I would build 500 churches and that a crusade was about to happen,” said Effendi. “But we have acted quickly together with police to arrest those responsible for spreading lies.”

Latifah, who sells household goods at a market near the guarded church, said she has Christian friends but added that the mayor should have “listened to the majority, who is Muslim”.

“Why did they need to build it so close to the homes of Muslim clerics,” she said, adding that even though the mayor did some good for the city she will not vote for him.

‘If people are happy, religious sentiments don’t play a role’

Still, Effendi is leading in the polls because of his free healthcare and education policies.

These policies have also boosted Widodo’s popularity, who enjoys approval ratings of around 70 percent.

The president’s candidates seem to be heading for victory even in provinces where his main rival, former General Prabowo Subianto, won in the 2014 elections – like in West Java, the province which Bekasi is a part of.

“If all is well and people are happy, religious sentiments don’t play a role,” said pollster Djayadi Hanan. “But if people start to feel the impact of a slowing economy, these are the first issues to pop up.”

This means that despite his popularity, Widodo is not unbeatable. Hanan predicts that if prices continue to be high and people keep finding hard to get jobs, Widodo might face a tough and nasty campaign.

“The economy has not improved as he promised and if a political scandal comes up, all the issues are thrown at him: that he is a communist, a non-Muslim, secretly a Singaporean and Chinese, will be used during the campaign.

“These identity politics have become more important now, not only in Indonesia but worldwide.”

Widodo and Subianto will be watching Wednesday’s “festival of democracy” very carefully before deciding on their next moves.","Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/f27baae5ec434da8914927432f18a47e_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['17', 'sentiments', 'religious', 'polls', 'effendi', 'crucial', 'bekasi', 'church', 'season', 'million', 'kicks', 'local', 'city', 'mayor', 'election', 'indonesia']", 
5,5,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Coral Reefs Prevent $4.3 Billion in Flood Damage Annually - The Pew Charitable Trusts,https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/06/20/coral-reefs-prevent-4-3-billion-in-flood-damage-annually,"Researchers conducted aerial surveys over the Caribbean Islands to map coral reefs, which help protect people, property, and ecosystems. Courtesy of Marjo Aho

Protecting the top 1 meter of nearshore, shallow-water coral reefs can save countries across the world $4.3 billion in annual flood protection benefits, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The research was led by Mike Beck, lead marine scientist at The Nature Conservancy, and supported by his 2012 Pew fellowship in marine conservation.

Healthy coral ecosystems regulate flooding and mitigate storm damages, providing natural protection for shorelines and adjacent areas. When corals are lost, the result is increased coastal flooding, which in turn incurs economic impacts on residents, communities, and government at all levels. Population growth, coastal development, and climate change are exacerbating the impacts of these losses.

The researchers compiled estimates of sea level and wave energy for all coastlines with coral reefs—approximately 71,000 kilometers (44,117 miles) globally. They then estimated likely flooding from storms—and the impacts of that on the land and built environment—under two scenarios: with and without the top 1 meter of reef. The authors chose 1 meter because it represents a loss of some to most of the living corals, but not the underlying limestone structure.

Reef loss would allow costlier and more widespread flooding

The study’s authors found that a decline of just 1 meter in reef height from present levels would more than double annual expected damages from storms, from $3.7 billion to $8 billion annually. The study also predicts an 81 percent increase in the land area affected by flooding annually, and a 69 percent rise in the number of people affected by flood damage each year.

“We’re in an era when we’re losing coastal habitats. And the risks to both those habitats and to people are increasing greatly,” says Beck (see video below). “The core goal of my Pew fellowship was to figure out if we could turn some of those threats into opportunities to invest in those habitats to protect people, property, and the ecosystems.”

Coral Reefs Prevent $4.3 Billion in Flood Damage Annually

The protections offered by healthy reefs were found to be greatest for lower intensity storms, which happen more frequently. However, the study estimates that coral reefs also provide substantial protection from more severe storms.

“It’s only in the past 10 to 15 years that we’ve recognized that these habitats provide really important services and benefits,” says Beck. “The coastal protection that they provide is by breaking waves and reducing storm surges and flooding.”

Coral protections offer most benefits in storm hotspots

The protections provided by coral reef habitats are distributed unevenly across the globe. Certain hotspots—areas subject to frequent storms, protected by shallow reefs, and with valuable assets near the coast—receive the greatest benefits from healthy reefs in terms of avoided losses of life and property.

The projected savings were greatest for Indonesia ($639 million); the Philippines ($590 million); Malaysia ($452 million); Mexico ($452 million); Cuba ($401 million); and the United States ($94 million)—a combined savings of more than $2.6 billion for those six countries.

For many smaller islands and developing states, although the dollar benefits are often less than $1 million each, they are much more important to the national economy. In particular, the Cayman Islands, Belize, Grenada, and the Bahamas receive the greatest benefits relative to their gross domestic products.

The results confirm the importance of nearshore shallow coral reefs in reducing flood damage, and reinforce the case for reducing local pressures on reefs, such as pollution, sedimentation, and destructive fishing.

Beck points out that, globally, enormous amounts of money are spent on recovery after coastal storms. “Reducing those risks, reducing those costs, makes good economic sense for everybody,” he says.

The economic benefits of protecting reefs could provide decision-makers with incentives to invest in habitat conservation and restoration. Climate change in particular will make reef restoration and management more necessary and valuable, as storm surges become stronger and more frequent.

6,6,FF-2018-000079-IDN,"""Don't bother, just let him die"": Killing with impunity in Papua [EN/ID] - Indonesia - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/dont-bother-just-let-him-die-killing-impunity-papua-enid,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On the morning of 8 December 2014, hundreds of Papuan protesters gathered near the local military and police headquarters, in the town of Enarotali in Paniai District, Papua Province. The demonstration was a response to military personnel allegedly beating 11 Papuan children the day before. When protesters started throwing stones and pieces of wood at the buildings, security forces opened fire into the crowd, killing four people. At least 11 others were injured by bullets or bayonets. Witnesses told the National Human Rights Commission they saw police officers shoot a protestor at close range after he had fallen to the ground.

Several weeks later, at a national Christmas ceremony in Papua, newly elected President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo committed to bringing those responsible for the killings to justice as soon as possible. The Paniai shootings became a test for the new administration’s commitment to end pervasive impunity for serious human rights violations by security forces in Papua and throughout Indonesia. It is a test that President Jokowi’s government, like those before it, has failed.

Cases like the Paniai shootings are not uncommon in Papua. Over the two decades since Indonesia’s 1998 reforms (Reformasi) began, Amnesty International has continued to receive allegations of unlawful killings by security forces in the eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua, even as they decline across Indonesia. These killings occur mainly in the context of unnecessary or excessive use of force during mass protests, during law enforcement operations or due to misconduct by individual officials. Amnesty International has recorded 69 cases of sus pected unlawful killings by security forces in Papua between January 2010 and February 2018, with 95 victims. In 34 of the cases the alleged perpetrators came from the police forces, in 23 cases they came from the military, and in 11 cases both security forces were allegedly involved. One more case also involved the municipal police (Satuan Polisi Pamong Praja, or Satpol PP), a body under local government and tasked to enforce local regulations. Most of the victims, 85 of them, have Papuan ethnicity.

Indonesian and international groups have long raised serious concerns about unlawful killings and other serious human rights violations by security forces in Papua. The subject is a frequent topic of discussion during Indonesia’s human rights reviews by UN treaty and UN Charter based bodies.There is no explicit definition of unlawful killings, or ""extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions"" under international law. Amnesty International defines such acts as unlawful and deliberate killings carried out by order of a government or with its complicity or acquiescence, which is along the lines of descriptions provided by international experts. Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions would under this understanding include unlawful killings both by state forces and by non-state groups and individuals that state authorities fail to properly investigate and prosecute. All unlawful killings violate the right to life, a key human right protected by international law and Indonesia’s Constitution.

Indonesia has ratified several international human rights treat ies that protect the right to life, chief among them the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

Papua is now the only region in Indonesia that has both peaceful and armed pro-independence movements. Since the end of the Soeharto government in 1998, political activists in Papua increased their demand for independence through peaceful means. The national government has been reluctant to respect their freedom of expression, arguing that their success would encourage other “secessionist” movements. A variety of armed pro-independence groups have carried out sporadic attacks, mainly on military and police targets. They have also engaged in clear human rights abuses, including unlawful killings, abductions and hostage-taking.

Amnesty International takes no position on the political status of any province of Indonesia, including calls for independence.

Successive national governments have pledged to bring economic growth to Papua and to end human rights violations. However, they have maintained an uncompromising stance towards independence movements, whether peaceful or armed. They have limited access to Papua for international human rights observers and shown little tolerance for freedom of expression.

Based on a review of 69 cases of suspected unlawful killings by security forces in Papua between January 2010 and February 2018, Amnesty International has documented several patterns. First, the majority of cases, 41 of them, occurred in the context of events that were unrelated to calls for independence or a referendum for Papua. This type of unlawful killing often happens when security forces uses excessive force to handle peaceful social protests, incidents of public disorder, and attempts to arrest criminal suspects, or as a form of misconduct by individual members of the security forces.

In a second category are killings by security forces related to the issue of independence or a referendum for Papua. This type of unlawful killing, consist of 28 cases, happens when security forces deal with peaceful political protests, particularly flag-rais ing ceremonies or religious gatherings on commemoration dates.

Investigations into reports of unlawful killings by security forces in Papua are rare. There is no independent, effective, and impartial mechanism to deal with public complaints about misconduct by security forces, including criminal offences involving human rights violations, leaving many victims without access to justice and reparation.

In the 69 incidents documented in this report, not one has been subject to a criminal investigation by an institution independent of the one whose members were suspected of committing the killing. In 25 cases there was no investigation at all, not even an internal one. Meanwhile, in 26 cases the police or military claimed to have conducted internal investigation but did not make the results public. In only six cases were perpetrators held accountable for the deaths.

Most families of the victims of unlawful killings by security forces in Papua told Amnesty International that they still wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice through trials in civilian court.

Amnesty International believes that there is a direct and causal link between impunity and the commission of human rights violations. Each failure to investigate or bring those responsible to trial reinforces the confidence of perpetrators that they are indeed above the law.

Amnesty International acknowledges the complex environment law enforcement officials often find themselves in when carrying out their duty in Papua, and when being attacked they certainly have the right to self-defence. However, even in such situations they must ensure full respect for the right to life, liberty and security of persons, including those suspected of a crime. Firing without warning and firing indiscriminately at a crowd without distinction as to who presents an imminent threat to themselves or another person and who does not, is clearly a violation of international human rights law as well as domestic legislation. And it contributes to an ever-escalating cycle of hostility and violence with an increasing risk of more lives being lost or in danger - including their own.

This report focuses only on unlawful killings committed by the security forces in Papua as Amnesty International's main mandate is to expose human rights violations. However, the organization acknowledge that there have been human rights abuses and incidents of violence, including lethal violence, committed by non-state actors in Papua and recognize that the Indonesian government's right and duty to protect its population, including police and other officials. Such protection must, however, be exercised strictly within the framework of human rights law and standards, as explained below.

Amnesty International calls on all governments to apply these law and standards and refrain from human rights violations whatever the political context in which they are committed, whether in Papua, in other regions in Indonesia or globally.","Mon, 02 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1123104-ASA2181982018ENGLISH.PDF.png?itok=2pOgzcoO,"['killing', 'unlawful', 'let', 'enid', 'bother', 'papua', 'security', 'human', 'killings', 'violations', 'cases', 'die', 'rights', 'forces', 'impunity', 'dont', 'international', 'indonesia']",

At least 128 passengers were missing after a ferry sank in Indonesia's Lake Toba on Monday evening, a search and rescue official said on Tuesday.

""Many people have reported their relatives missing,"" Budiawan, head of the search and rescue agency based in the nearby city of Medan, told Reuters after a co-ordination meeting.

Authorities had previously said at least 80 people were thought to be on board the ferry that sank in rough weather.

Local police chief Marudut Liberty Panjaitan said 18 people have been rescued and one death confirmed.

Initial estimates were that 80 people were on board but there was no passenger manifest and the number may range from 70 to 130, disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said on Twitter.

Nugroho said the boat sank at about 5:30pm as it sailed from the mainland to an island.

A survivor identified by Indonesian television as Juwita Sumbayak said the vessel was rocked by high waves and was hit a by a wooden boat before suddenly sinking.

""I was desperate, I was scared to death. I'm afraid my family is dead,"" she said, weeping.

The wooden ferry had a capacity of 60 passengers but was overloaded and also carrying dozens of motorcycles, said Sri Hardianto, an official at Indonesia's transport ministry.

Ferry tragedies are common in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, with weak enforcement of safety regulations often to blame.

With the rise of skyscrapers and better infrastructure, including the almost finished MRT, Jakarta has been turned into a modern city, very different from what he saw when he was a young boy.

But in his neighborhood in Cilincing, North Jakarta, he also sees that little has changed in terms of congestion, flooding and rampant poverty, which continue as the city celebrates its 491st anniversary on Friday.

Water levels are rising in Panchagarh after two days of heavy rainfall and with water coming down the rivers in the region from upstream

Northern areas of Bangladesh could be deluged by heavy flooding by the end of this week following monsoon rainfall upstream in India, officials have warned.

Md Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), said most of the Indian northeast – especially Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal states – have been experiencing heavy and widespread rainfall for the past few days.

“The water is gradually coming downstream to Bangladesh and swelling the rivers in the northern part,” he said.

The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast that the rainfall in its north-eastern zone will continue for at least another two days.

“If the rainfall continues as per the projection, most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin in Bangladesh will be flooded,” Arifuzzaman added.

The June to August period is monsoon season in South Asia. During this period, heavy to very heavy rainfall is the normal trend across the whole catchment of rivers, from their origins in northern India to Bangladesh, where they empty into the Bay of Bengal.

According to the FFWC on Tuesday, all of the major rivers in the Brahmaputra basin were rising are were likely to continue to do so for the next three days.

The water level of the Ganges river system was also expected to continue increasing on Wednesday, while a similar trend was seen in the Surma-Kushiyara river systems due to the presence of heavy rainfall in the upstream Meghalaya state of India.

The river rages through the Teesta Barrage Dhaka Tribune

Danger levels reached

According to the flood bulletin of FFWC, three different rivers in the country were all flowing above their danger levels at certain points on Tuesday.

The Surma river was flowing above its danger level at Kanaighat and Sunamganj points, by 56cm and 48cm respectively.

The Kushiyara river was flowing 2cm above its danger level at Sherpur-Sylhet point, while the Old Surma at Derai point was over by 43cm.

The situation is unlikely to ease soon with the Bangladesh Meteorological Department also predicting heavy rainfall in the northern region of the country for the next 48 hours.

In 24 hours of Tuesday it recorded 179mm of rainfall at Jaflong, 174.2mm at Ramgarh, 141mm in Rangamati and 135.5mm at Panchagarh.

There were also levels of 119mm recorded in Chittagong, 101.4mm at Bandarban, 100.0mm at Lorergarh and 79mm in Kushtia.

Many areas in the Panchagarh district headquarters remained waterlogged Dhaka Tribune

Water levels on the rise in Panchagarh

Water levels are rising in Panchagarh after two days of heavy rainfall and with water coming down the rivers in the region from upstream.

Water levels have risen in the rivers flowing over the district. In Karatoa the flow was 2cm below the danger level, the Water Development Board said on Tuesday.

Many areas in the district headquarters remained waterlogged, with even the Panchagarh deputy commissioner's office becoming inundated with floodwater.

Whole streets were under water in the municipal area's Islambagh, Dokropara, Kayetpara, Uttar Jalashi and Stadium Road, among other areas, impeding traffic and commuters.

The rising waters of the Teesta river has already flooded places in Rangpur’s Gangachara upazila Focus Bangla

Teesta waters close to danger level

In Dalia Division, a local public representative from Dimla upazila of Nilphamari said around 700 families were marooned after the water level began rising from Monday night.

The FFWC office at Dalia Division of the Water Development Board said that at 3pm on Tuesday, the water level at Teesta Barrage point of the Teesta river was at 55cm, right below the danger level of 60cm.

The water level was the same at Dalia point. This is despite all 44 sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage having been opened, Dalia Division Executive Engineer Rafiqul Alam Chowdhury said.

Surma above danger level in Sunamganj

Water levels were increasing rapidly for a number of rivers in Sunamganj - including the Surma, Kushiara, and Dhonu - due to incessant rainfall and the onrush of water from higher ground.

The Sunamganj Water Development Board recorded 38mm rainfall in 24 hours on Tuesday.

The Surma River is now flowing at 48cm above the danger level at the Shologhar point, while water levels were also increasing in the haor areas.

“We might be hit by floods if the situation does not improve,” Ranjan Kumar Das, the sub divisional engineer of the Water Development Board, said.

Flood recedes in Moulvibazar

Locals living near the Monu, Dholai, and Kushiara rivers have already been badly hit, after almost 500 villages in Kamalganj and Moulvibazar were swept away on June 12 when water broke through 38 points of Kamalganj, Kulaura, Rajnagar, and Moulvibazar on the Monu, Dholai, and Kushiara rivers.

Many people lost their homes, crops and fisheries due to the sudden flooding, and at least ten people were killed.

Last year, Hakaluki, Kauwadighi and Hail Haor locals were similarly devastated by unseasonal floods and waterlogging in these areas.

By Tuesday the waters had receded from most of the flood-affected areas in the Moulvibazar district in the north-east, enabling residents to return to their homes and begin the arduous task of making repairs, despite their impoverished state.

Moulvibazar Water Development Board has identified the 38 places where the embankments of the Monu, Dholai, and Kushiara rivers were breached.

However, the board has only taken initiatives to repair them in 18 places and although contractors have been employed for the remaining 20 places, repair work has not yet started.

The delays mean thousands of people near the river banks are living in fear of another flood if the damaged embankments are not repaired soon.","Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/07/flood-focus-bangla-1530639315106.jpg,"['rainfall', 'river', 'level', 'water', 'week', 'floods', 'likely', 'rivers', 'heavy', 'danger', 'areas', 'board', 'north', 'levels']", 
15,15,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Indonesian Election Season is a Gauge of Rise of Political Islam - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/indonesian-election-season-gauge-rise-political-islam,"JAKARTA - About 100 residents of a gritty commercial district of Indonesia's capital listen intently as a man roars into a microphone: ""Are you ready to change our president? Are you ready for new leadership?""

But this is not a political rally. Dressed in white robes and a turban, Novel Bamukmin of the Jakarta chapter of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), a hardline Islamist group, addresses evening prayers in a mosque.

As a year of local and then national elections begins this week in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, some Islamic leaders have emerged as the most vocal opponents of President Joko Widodo, who is expected to seek a second term next year.

They belong to a loose grouping of Islamists behind protests that culminated in the election defeat and jailing for blasphemy in 2017 of Jakarta's ethnic-Chinese and Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Widodo ally.

The case of Purnama, who had said political rivals were deceiving people by using a verse in the Koran to say Muslims should not be led by a non-Muslim, showed how Islam had crept into politics in the officially secular country.

Widodo has pledged to protect Indonesia's tradition of pluralism and moderate Islam, and he has banned Hizb ut-Tahrir, a hardline group with ambitions for an Islamic caliphate.

But a senior government official conceded there are limits to how much the government can control political messaging in mosques.

""Any action against this phenomenon is blasted as anti-Muslim so our actions are restricted,"" said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.

'Change the president'

A former furniture maker and Indonesia's first president from outside the political and military elite, Widodo - known as Jokowi - has remained popular since he took office in 2014.

He is widely seen as an honest man of the people, rare for a leader in a country where the political class is scorned as corrupt and aloof, and his push for infrastructure and cutting red tape has burnished his image as a hands-on leader.

A recent opinion poll gave him a double-digit lead over the opposition Gerindra party's Prabowo Subianto, a retired general who is expected to run a second time against Widodo in 2019.

Opponents and hardline Muslim groups, including the FPI, accuse Widodo of failing to stem income inequality or deliver higher growth, but the most incendiary attacks have often been around religion and ethnicity.

False accusations have spread on social media that the president is not actually Muslim and is a descendant of ethnic Chinese communists. Widodo has sought to strengthen his ties with moderate Islamic leaders and he recently appointed a controversial hardline cleric as a communications adviser.

""The only way for the opposition to win is to debunk the argument that Jokowi is one of the masses, and to attack his weakest spot, which is his shyness in showing his religion,” said Achmad Sukarsono, a political analyst at Control Risks.

Ahead of local elections across much of the country on Wednesday, the anti-Widodo sentiment has crystallized into a movement called ""#GantiPresiden2019"" or ""Change the president in 2019.”

The movement's founder, Mardani Ali Sera, a member of parliament from a conservative Islamic party, says he has no connection with political messaging in mosques.

But he says the majority of those affiliated with his movement are from Islamic parties and the groups that opposed Jakarta's Christian governor.

""We don't use mosques but if the hashtag and the movement works for you, then go ahead and use it,"" Sera, who is active on social media, told Reuters.

The FPI's Bamukmin supports the #GantiPresiden2019 movement and said he and other preachers push that message in sermons.

""It is the duty of Muslims to try and replace the current president who has betrayed the country and his religion,"" he said, accusing Widodo of ""selling the country to foreigners"" and ""empowering communists and deviant religious sects.""

No campaigning allowed

Indonesia’s election laws prohibit political campaigning in places of worship ahead of polls. Vice President Jusuf Kalla told media political discussion is allowed in mosques because they are places of education as well as worship, but campaigning is not.

Tens of millions of Indonesians will vote in 171 elections for mayors, regents, and governors on Wednesday, an important barometer ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.

Opinion polls suggest candidates backed by parties supporting Widodo will win in many parts of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, but observers will be watching for signs of Islamist influence.

One man who attended FPI preacher Bamukmin's sermon in Jakarta this month, said even if clerics were becoming more political, their congregations were smart enough to decide for themselves.

Hundreds gathered on Monday morning to protest at a martabak food stall belonging to the President's eldest son in Solo, Central Java, where they held an anti-government rally in support of the #2019GantiPresident (#2019ChangePresident) hashtag.

The Markobar food stall, which sells martabak (a sweet or savory pancake), is the first business that Gibran Rakabuming Raka, President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo’s eldest son, has owned.

In a video @Muslim_Bersatu uploaded to Twitter, the rally participants are seen standing in the middle of the street, right in front of Markobar. Wearing T-shirts emblazoned with #2019GantiPresident (#2019ChangePresident), the protesters are heard yelling that they will elect a new president in 2019.

“We will protect the nation’s sovereignty by changing the President in 2019. We want sharia to be enforced in Indonesia,"" one protester said, ending with ""Allahuakbar"" (God is great).

Netizen Mas Piyu using the Twitter handle @maspiyuuu posted a picture of the rally with the caption: “AMAZING. Solo residents declared #2019ChangePresident in front of Jokowi’s son Markobar store.”

Gibran, however, appeared to have remained calm as seen from Markobar’s response to the rally on its official Twitter account (@markobar1996).

“Thank you for queueing since the morning. The delightfulness of Markobar, the pioneer of sweet martabak with premium topping, has been proven #eatsharehappiness,” the tweet read.

Many netizens viewed the tweet as funny and clever, as Gibran had used the rally to promote Markobar and its product, instead of responding with anger.

Markobar's ""marketing message"" has been retweeted more than 2,700 times to date.

Markobar also posted a composite picture that showed the rally participants standing in front of the stall in their #2019ChangePresident T-shirts, along with an image of Gibran’s face with a speech bubble in informal Indonesian saying: “Oh no, you came too early guys... Markobar isn't open yet...”

Eko Kuntadhi (@eko_kunthadi) commented on his Twitter account that the protesters were afraid that they would come up against martabak in the 2019 presidential election.

“Why did they demonstrate in front of Markobar? Because they are afraid that if their presidential candidate ran against martabak, the people will choose martabak,” he tweeted.

Gibran seems to have stuck to his role in running a small business and has used Monday's event as a marketing strategy, flooding the Markobar account with tweets about the stall and its products.

18,18,FF-2018-000079-IDN,'Green gold': Pakistan plants hundreds of millions of trees - Jakarta Post,http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/06/26/green-gold-pakistan-plants-hundreds-of-millions-of-trees.html,"The change is drastic: around the region of Heroshah, previously arid hills are now covered with forest as far as the horizon. In northwestern Pakistan, hundreds of millions of trees have been planted to fight deforestation.

In 2015 and 2016 some 16,000 labourers planted more than 900,000 fast-growing eucalyptus trees at regular, geometric intervals in Heroshah -- and the titanic task is just a fraction of the effort across the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

""Before it was completely burnt land. Now they have green gold in their hands,"" commented forest manager Pervaiz Manan as he displayed pictures of the site previously, when only sparse blades of tall grass interrupted the monotonous landscape.

The new trees will reinvigorate the area's scenic beauty, act as a control against erosion, help mitigate climate change, decrease the chances of floods and increase the chances of precipitation, says Manan, who oversaw the revegetation of Heroshah.

Residents also see them as an economic boost -- which, officials hope, will deter them from cutting the new growth down to use as firewood in a region where electricity can be sparse.

""Now our hills are useful, our fields became useful,"" says driver Ajbir Shah. ""It is a huge benefit for us.""

Further north, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swat, many of the high valleys were denuded by the Pakistani Taliban during their reign from 2006 to 2009.

Now they are covered in pine saplings. ""You can't walk without stepping on a seedling,"" smiles Yusufa Khan, another forest department worker.

The Heroshah and Swat plantations are part of the ""Billion Tree Tsunami"", a provincial government programme that has seen a total of 300 million trees of 42 different species planted across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A further 150 million plants were given to landowners, while strict forest regeneration measures have allowed the regrowth of 730 million trees -- roughly 1.2 billion new trees in total, the program's management says.

- 'Transparency' -

Kamran Hussain, a manager of the Pakistani branch of the World Wildlife Fund, who conducted an independent audit of the project, says their figures showed slightly less -- but still above target at 1.06 billion trees.

""We are 100 percent confident that the figure about the billion trees is correct,"" he told AFP, highlighting the transparency of the process. ""Everything is online. Everyone has access to this information.""

The program has been praised by the head of the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a green NGO, which called it a ""true conservation success story"".

Initially mocked for what critics said were unrealistic objectives, it is a welcome change to the situation elsewhere in the country.

Pakistani authorities say just 5.2 percent of the country is covered by forest, against the 12 percent recommended by the United Nations.

Just one big tree remains in the poverty-stricken village of Garhi Bit in the southern province of Sindh, shading its small mosque.

It has stood there for a century, locals say.

""Before, there were big trees, many kinds of them,"" says Dad Mohammad, a 43-year-old farmer.

""But they started to dry because of the lack of water, so we cut them,"" he says, pointing to hundreds of meters of cultivated land where previously there stood a forest.

- 'Disaster' -

More than 60 percent of the forests lining Sindh's riverbanks have disappeared in the last 60 years, mainly due to river depletion and massive logging during the 1980s, says Riaz Ahmed Wagan, of the provincial forest department.

""It is a disaster,"" he says, adding that forestry remains the lowest priority on the agenda of the provincial governments.

The Billion Tree Tsunami, which cost the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government $169 million, started in November 2014. Officials say they are still implementing maintenance safeguards such as fire protection, with the project due to be completed in June 2020.

In early 2017, the federal government announced its own Green Pakistan Project, which aims to plant 100 million trees in five years across the country.

It ranges from ""legislative reforms"" to ""wildlife protection"", according to its leader Ibrahim Khan, who works under the authority of the ministry for climate change. More than a quarter of the work was done by the end of April this year, he says.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is ruled by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the political party headed by former cricketer Imran Khan, which is the main challenger to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) as the country heads into a general election next month.

Khan has vowed to make the environment an election issue, and to plant a total of 10 billion trees across the country. ""Every child in Pakistan should be aware of the environmental issue which, until now, has been a non-issue,"" he told AFP.

But it is yet to be seen whether his ambitions will translate into votes.

Pakistani environmental lawyer and activist Ahmad Rafay Allam says that in a country where the electorate is often swayed by infrastructure projects rather than the environment, he has doubts.

""It would be a first,"" he told AFP.","Wed, 27 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/06/26/2018_06_26_48273_1530010947._large.jpg,"['trees', 'plants', 'green', 'forest', 'total', 'change', 'country', 'billion', 'tree', 'millions', 'gold', 'million', 'hundreds', 'khyber', 'pakistan']",

20,20,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Erdogan's uncanny popularity in Indonesia reflects growing preference for conservatism - Coconuts,https://coconuts.co/jakarta/features/erdogans-uncanny-popularity-indonesia-reflects-growing-preference-conservatism/,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been elected Turkey’s first executive president — an appointment critics say continues the country’s dangerous slide towards authoritarianism. But thousands of miles away in Indonesia, Erdogan’s victory is being celebrated by hundreds of thousands (at least on social media).

Erdogan has earned an increasing number of supporters in Indonesia over the past few years, coinciding with his gradual rise towards ultimate power. Erdogan’s staunch Islamism certainly plays a factor, but the support he enjoys in Indonesia could be seen as a sign of the country’s overall shift towards conservatism.

Erdogan’s rise

Erdogan, who comes from an Islamist political background, served as Turkey’s prime minister from 2003 to 2014, vacating the position to become president that same year. Following a failed military coup in 2016, Turkey narrowly voted in favor of a new constitution last year, giving increased authority to a new executive president, whose new sweeping powers include the ability to dissolve parliament, issue executive decrees, impose a state emergency, extend his presidential term, as well as abolishing the office of the prime minister, among others.

Though the 64-year-old has repeatedly denied the “dictator” label, it’s hard to see Erdogan as anything but, even if he democratically won re-election yesterday. Under Erdogan’s leadership, Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists while the president strengthens his grip on the media, government, and military.

Indonesia’s infatuation

In Indonesia, Erdogan’s rising popularity can be measured in increasingly popular fan pages on social media. A Facebook page named ‘Sultan Erdogan’ has close to 170,000 followers at the time of writing. The page serves as a propaganda machine of sorts for Erdogan in Bahasa Indonesia, with posts — sources unclear — highlighting the Turkish president’s perceived positive achievements, which mostly include nationalistic and protectionist policies.

This post, highlighting the difference between the renowned secularism of Turkey’s first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who famously banned the hijab from being worn in public and government institutions, compared to Erdogan’s pro-Islam policies, shows why many Muslims in Indonesia see the latter as a hero for the religion as a whole.

The Facebook group ‘Sahabat Erdogan’ (Friends of Erdogan) is even more popular, with over 550,000 followers at the time of writing, on top of an Instagram page which has over 60,000 followers. In the lead up of the election, the page compiled dozens of photos showing followers — all of them appearing to be Indonesian Muslims, separated by gender — placed next to a campaign photo of Erdogan with the tagline “Erdogan for President!” Thousands of commenters flooded the posts with their messages of support for the Turkish president.

[Pemilu Turki]Koalisi Kaum perempuan Indonesia mendukung kepemimpinan Erdogan di Turki Semenjak kepemimpinan… Posted by Sahabat Erdogan on Saturday, June 23, 2018

On the Instagram page, Sahabat Erdogan has reposted videos of support from Indonesians for Erdogan, ranging from celebrities to this fellow, who, despite his apparent love for the politician, isn’t even aware that Erdogan’s name isn’t pronounced with a hard “g”.

Support for Erdogan does represent a monetization opportunity for some opportunistic Indonesians. The Sahabat Erdogan Facebook page, for example, features a shop that sells Erdogan-themed t-shirts for around IDR125,000 (US$8.84) each, turning the Turkish president into both a revered figure and a commercialized political hero a la Che Guevara.

Indonesia’s own Erdogan?

On the politics front, the Islam-based party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) has publicly congratulated Erdogan on his victory, calling his campaign an “effective strategy”. It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that they too would like an Erdogan-esque figure leading Indonesia.

PKS is likely going to back Prabowo Subianto in the 2019 election. Prabowo, who lost the the 2014 election to President Joko Widodo, did not campaign on an Islamic platform four years ago, but will likely have to do so next year if he hopes to have a chance against the ever-popular incumbent. His recent visit with radical cleric and Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab in Saudi Arabia, who was instrumental in former Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama’s blasphemy conviction and defeat in the gubernatorial election last year, speaks volumes as to what Prabowo and pals might consider to be an “effective strategy” for next year’s election.

Religion aside, Prabowo’s Gerindra Party has worked hard to sell the narrative that Indonesia needs a visibly strong, stern leader to steer the ship, qualities that Jokowi, a soft-spoken former furniture salesman, arguably lack. Recently, Gerindra’s Vice Chairman Fadli Zon said that Indonesia needs a leader like Russia’s Vladimir Putin, somebody like — you guessed it — Prabowo. Of course, there are parallels between Putin and Erdogan, especially in the sense that both strongmen have employed forceful tactics to silence their opposition and critics to become the de facto dictators of their respective countries.

Are Indonesians longing for a return to the dictatorial rule of Soeharto’s New Order era? Local supporters of Erdogan seem to believe that a dictatorship is a fair trade off for socio-political religious stability, even if it only benefits them — the majority. Next year’s presidential election will be an important test for Indonesia’s pluralism — a hypothetical weakening of which could open up the possibility of an Erdogan-esque figure leading Indonesia in the future.

But is Indonesia going the way of Turkey anytime soon? Pro-pluralists may still be comforted by the fact that Jokowi still leads in practically every poll for 2019. But image is everything in the popularity contest that is Indonesian politics, and if an Erdogan is what the majority demands, then an Erdogan we will get — for better or worse.

indonesian based firm RAW architecture‘s hotel has been planned to inject a new design by splitting building masses from the north-south side. the splitting achieved by few lightwell corridors — placed in linear manner — allows light to penetrate from a transparent roof to the first floor. each 1 m x 4.5 m lightwell is installed on the highest point of the building’s 4th floor, creating a luminous bridge before entering the rooms on the west side.



the building stands within a 1500 sqm plot, with 16 m width facing south and 97 m length facing west

RAW has designed the west and east side of the hotel to be more introvert. this is achieved by a plane that weaves from an imaginary line of view, forming a rationalized balcony with a 2.5 m concrete cantilever width and 6 m diagonally. this cantilever functions as the room’s eaves and gives shade to the west side from 3 pm at noon until night time. this concrete cantilever also focuses the vista and landscape from the south side area, which is the kramat raya street to tugu tani street and the capital city’s landmark monas. this cantilever’s projection also forms a passive design inside the planned interior of the hotel.



RAW’s hotel injects a new design by splitting building masses from the north-south side

this hotel is designed with a 21 m2 module per room. each one is composed by a bathroom (20%) and two bedrooms (80%). the design totaled of 109 rooms on a 4-7-4 m grid section long and 7.7 m width, includes a briefing area placed on the first floor of the building. the basement area is designed to receive natural light and air by a cross ventilation system. the hotel corridors are also designed to gain the same effect from the north and south side areas.



combinations of cantilevered wickering concrete

the material design has been chosen focusing on an easy maintenance and accessibility towards minimal cost due to the financial situation available within the construction period. this followed by a 15-month-period time challenge, which RAW architecture’s solution is to design the building’s structure with a prefabricated floor plate technology to accelerate construction time.

PROBOLINGGO, Indonesia: Thousands of locals and tourists climbed Mount Bromo early Sunday for a lavish religious ceremony that involves throwing ritual offerings into the smouldering crater of an active volcano in Indonesia's tribal hinterlands.

Each year people from the Tengger tribe gather from the surrounding highlands to cast fruit, vegetables, flowers, and even livestock such as goats and chickens into Mount Bromo's smoking crater as part of the Yadnya Kasada festival

Each year people from the Tengger tribe gather from the surrounding highlands to cast fruit, vegetables, flowers, and even livestock such as goats and chickens into Mount Bromo's smoking crater as part of the Yadnya Kasada festival.

Other villagers -- not members of the Tengger tribe -- try to catch the offerings before they disappear into the billowing smoke using nets and sarong. This is not technically part of the ritual but reflects local frugal urges not to waste the offerings.

The month-long Yadnya Kasada festival harkens back to the 15th century legends of Majapahit kingdom princess Roro Anteng and husband Joko Seger.

Unable to bear children after years of marriage, the couple begged the gods for help.

Their prayers were answered and they were promised 25 children, as long as they agreed to sacrifice their youngest child by throwing him into Mount Bromo.

Legend has it this son willingly jumped into the volcano to guarantee the prosperity of the Tengger people.

The sacrifice tradition continues to this day -- though the Tengger sacrifice their harvest and farm animals instead of humans.

Dancers in elaborate traditional costumes and tourists were up before dawn to take part in this year's ceremony.

Crowds have swelled at Mount Bromo in recent years as the local government promotes the festival as a tourist event.

Where is the morality and spiritual integrity in Atherley – having convinced the constituents of St Michael West to vote for him as a member of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) team – simply switching to become an Opposition to the said BLP without first reverting to the said constituents for their consent or approval?

Don’t the principles of morality and spiritual integrity require that Atherley go back to the people for a new vote – a by-election?

Similarly, in light of the fact that Atherley received some 3 000 votes to the Democratic Labour Party’s (DLP) combined total of some 33 000 votes, where is the morality and spiritual integrity in him thwarting Prime Minister Mia Mottley’s proposal to amend the Constitution in order to permit the DLP to appoint the two Opposition senators?

26,26,FF-2018-000079-IDN,1 million Florida homes at risk of chronic floods by 2100: UCS study - WMNF - WMNF,https://www.wmnf.org/million-florida-homes-risk-chronic-floods-2100-ucs/,"Share this:

A new report by the Union of Concerned Scientists says “within the next 30 years, roughly 64,000 homes in Florida … will be at risk” of chronic floods from sea-level rise. On WMNF’s MidPoint we spoke about this report with UCS senior climate scientist, Kristy Dahl, and with Susan Glickman, who is working to create a regional West Coast Climate Compact. She’s the Florida director, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. The report is called, Underwater: Rising Seas, Chronic Floods, and the Implications for US Coastal Real Estate (2018).

Here are some quotes from the report:

“As sea levels rise, persistent high-tide flooding of homes, yards, roads, and business districts will begin to render properties effectively unlivable, and neighborhoods — even whole communities — financially unattractive and potentially unviable.”

“Yet property values in most coastal real estate markets do not currently reflect that risk. And most homeowners, communities, and investors are not aware of the financial losses they may soon face.”

“In the coming decades, the consequences of rising seas will strain many coastal real estate markets — abruptly or gradually, but some eventually to the point of collapse — with potential reverberations throughout the national economy. … these are not devaluations from which damaged real estate markets will recover.”

This study “estimates the number of homes and commercial properties … that will be put at risk from chronic, disruptive flooding [26x/yr or more]”

Listen to the full show here:

Watch the show:

“300,000 of today’s homes and commercial properties in the contiguous United States [are] at risk of chronic disruptive flooding within the next 30 years.” by 2045 = $136 billion.

“by the end of the 21st century nearly 2.5 million residential and commercial properties, collectively valued at $1.07 trillion today, will be at risk of chronic flooding.” That’s 4.7 million people.

“for the most part, financial markets do not currently account for these risks.” even though “experts in risk assessment, credit ratings, real estate markets, insurance markets, and flood policy”

“In many cases, the risks are masked by short-sighted government policies, market incentives, and public and private investments that prop up business-as-usual choices and fail to account for sea level rise.”

“results are based on the high sea level rise scenario [developed for the 2014 National Climate Assessment], a scenario that results in 6.6 feet of global sea level rise by 2100.”

“within the next 15 years roughly 147,000 existing homes and 7,000 commercial properties — currently worth $63 billion — are at risk of being inundated an average of 26 times per year … About 280,000 people” live in those homes.

“Within the next 30 years, roughly 64,000 homes in Florida … will be at risk of chronic flooding.”

“In Florida, the number of today’s homes that are at risk from sea level rise balloons to more than 1 million by 2100, reflecting the scale of existing development in Florida’s low-lying inland regions.”

“the Miami area, the Florida Keys, and Tampa-St. Petersburg stand out as being the most highly exposed within the next 30 years.”

We also asked Kristy Dahl about something not directly related to this report. It’s based on a statement released by Andrew Rosenberg of the UCS Sunday, which criticized a NOAA official. At a Department of Commerce summit last week, the acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, proposed a new mission statement for the agency—one that would undermine the agency’s vital work on behalf of the American people. It removes “climate” from NOAA’s mission. It also added to the mission, to “empower the economy, and support homeland and national security.”

At the beginning of the show we heard comments left by listeners after a previous show. There was a spirited conversation about gun violence. We had guests from Moms Demand Action after the latest mass school shooting, this one in Santa Fe, Texas.

29,29,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Coral Reef Loss Could Cost Countries Billions - Pacific Standard,https://psmag.com/environment/the-financial-cost-of-losing-a-reef,"According to a recent study, losing just the top three feet of coral reef could result in $4 billion a year in flood-related damages.

As rising ocean temperatures and other threats devastate coral ecosystems around the world, a new study has found that losing just part of those reefs could lead to $4 billion a year in flood-related damages.

The top three feet, to be precise.

That layer of the reef, though small in size, packs some power, breaking up waves that might otherwise wreak havoc on coastal cities and send destructive storm surges inland, according to a study published recently in the journal Nature Communications.

The findings follow a particularly devastating year of storms, with Puerto Rico, Houston, and the Philippines hit particularly hard. But the annual damage could double with the loss of reefs' topmost three feet, researchers led by scientists from the Nature Conservancy found.

They calculated that corals reduce the cost of storms by an average of $4 billion annually—savings that would disappear along with the top three feet of reefs as the reefs subside due to sea-level rise, destruction from storms and coral bleaching. Damages from smaller, once-every-25-year storms would rise fastest. Reefs as a whole currently prevent $36 billion in damages from those periodic storms and $130 billion in damages from 100-year storms, the researchers found.

As climate change accelerates, the financial hit from disappearing reefs would also grow as storm surges reach farther inland. The area of land flooded by a 100-year storm would more than double if reefs lose three feet of height and sea levels rise as predicted under a business-as-usual scenario without dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

""We asked what's the benefit provided by reefs right now, with their current height and roughness, what would the flood damage be by floods around the world where there are reefs right now, what would those be if they lost one meter of reefs,"" said study co-author Michael Beck, lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy and a research professor at the University of California–Santa Cruz.

Beck and his colleagues found that, on average, globally, the dollar damage would double without that top three feet of reefs.

That cost could be higher in certain places, though. Cuba, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and the Philippines would each be able to avert more than $400 million in average annual damages by retaining that top three feet of reef, according to the study. The United States would save $100 million.

""Despite all the calls for protection of coral reefs, not a lot of work has been done that really helps you [quantify reef benefits] beyond on a place-to-place basis,"" Beck said. ""We expected to find higher values in places that were in the hurricane belt and where there were shallow reefs and a lot of assets. So some of the hot spots we found we expected to see. But we had really no idea what values we would get.""

The main surprise, Beck said, was that global annual average damages from coastal flooding would double with diminished reefs.

And reefs are already declining dramatically. Coral bleaching events—in which ocean temperatures rise beyond corals' tolerance—are happening so frequently that reefs may no longer be able to recover before the next wave of bleaching hits. Climate change remains the overwhelming threat to coral reefs, but new ports and other terrestrial developments can damage or destroy reefs, too, as can direct impacts from other forms of human activity, such as the use of sunscreen, which can contain coral-damaging chemicals, and plastic pollution.

Australia's Great Barrier Reef lost half its coral in back-to-back bleaching events in 2016–17. A UNESCO study last year predicted that all the world's iconic reefs would die off by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions weren't significantly reduced. Some estimates have found that the world has already lost half its reefs over the past three decades and that more than 90 percent of them will be gone by 2050.

But projecting the consequences from losing all the world's reefs seemed too extreme to Beck and his colleagues. So they chose the three-foot loss figure, which is the portion of reefs often damaged by destructive storms and subject to drowning by sea-level rise. ""We wanted to do a comparison that we think is the sort of the thing that could happen,"" he explained. ""We're not trying to make a prediction ... but what's a reasonable expected amount of reef loss.""

The study's estimated benefits in terms of savings don't take into account how much it might cost to maintain or protect reefs—but they also don't take into account the many other ecosystem services coral reefs provide beyond protection from flooding, such as spawning grounds for fisheries and attractions for tourism. A 2009 estimate placed the total average annual economic benefit of the world's reefs at $172 billion.

Beck said the savings quantified in the new study should be used as guidelines for investment in managing reefs.

For the most affected countries, that would mean investing an average of $400 million a year in reefs to avoid having to spend a comparable amount on rebuilding following flooding.

""We would say you should be investing at least that level in protecting reefs,"" Beck said. ""The benefits are more than $400 million a year just in averted flood damages, leaving out other benefits.""

The insurance industry is increasingly paying attention to that cost-benefit equation.

Reinsurance giant Swiss Re worked with the Nature Conservancy to help the Mexican state of Quintana Roo create a trust fund to purchase the first insurance for a coral reef. The policy would immediately pay out if a Category 4 or 5 hurricane hits a specific stretch of Yucatan peninsula so that the funds could be used to restore the part of the Mesoamerican Reef that protects the $9 billion tourism industry around Cancun.

Beck said the Nature Conservancy is working with Munich Re on another funding tool to encourage coral preservation and restoration in exchange for reductions in insurance premiums.

The economic benefits of flood protection from reefs may be gaining acceptance in Washington, D.C., as well. Beck said the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has been working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess damage to reefs around Puerto Rico following the hurricanes that hit the island last year.

He said the findings from his new study were provided to the NOAA to help the agency make the case to FEMA that there is hard data to quantify the benefits of those reefs.

""It's really a kind of first recognition by FEMA of the value of these habitats,"" Beck said.

34,34,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Go-Jek prepares to launch ride-hailing services in Vietnam and Thailand - TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/go-jek-prepares-to-launch-ride-hailing-services-in-vietnam-and-thailand/,"It looks like Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek will finally initiate its long-awaited expansion in Southeast Asia over the next month.

The company announced today that it’ll launch businesses in Vietnam and Thailand under the names of Go-Viet and Get, respectively, using a model that sees local founders run each business independently with backing from local partners and the Go-Jek mothership.

TechCrunch understands that the Thai and Vietnamese entities will go live for customers from August. The plan is to initially launch motorbike and car-based services. Later, it may introduce services-on-demand as it done with significant success in Indonesia.

Go-Jek didn’t provide a timeline for launches in its announcement today, but a source with knowledge of the plans told TechCrunch that Go-Viet is likely to be up and running by August with Get in Thailand set to follow a month later. The Philippines launch will come next, but the timeframe is currently unspecific and simply “before the end of 2018.”

That just leaves Singapore, which is a more complicated market since it doesn’t support Go-Jek core motorbike on-demand service and it has been flooded by new entrants following Uber’s exit.

As TechCrunch previously reported, Go-Jek has held partnership talks with Comfort Del Gro, Singapore’s largest taxi operator which formerly had an agreement with Uber. However, it looks like any potential deal will take time and Go-Jek is prioritizing other markets initially.

Interesting, our source confirmed that the apps — Go-Jek, Get and Go-Viet — will not be interoperable. On one side that gives the local teams the flexibility and autonomy to introduce services and customize their offerings to suit the local market, but it will mean that consumers traveling between countries will need to download different apps.

Back in May the company formally announced plans to enter four new markets via a $500 million budget. Consumers may have been expecting a quick launch, particularly since Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia, but the process takes significant time. Now that Go-Jek has installed local teams — led by Nguyen Vu Duc in Vietnam and former head of Line Man Thailand Pinya Nittayakasetwa for Get — it is readying the operations side of the service to launch for consumers.

Grab, Go-Jek’s key rival, raised $2.5 billion over the last year and it is currently raising a new round that values its business at over $10 billion. The first investor confirmed for the new raise is Toyota, which has pledged $1 billion in what is the largest investment from an automotive company into a ride-hailing provider.

Go-Jek hasn’t raised as much as Grab, but it is still well capitalized. The company raised $1.4 billion from a bevy of backers that include Tencent, JD.com and Meituan from China as well as global names like Google and Allianz.","Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/go-jek.jpg?w=540,"['vietnam', 'ridehailing', 'techcrunch', 'launch', 'services', 'prepares', 'billion', 'raised', 'gojek', 'ubers', 'company', 'thailand', 'local', 'goviet']",

The bishop of Tanjung Karang ordained five new priests in his diocese. Mgr Robertus Rubiyatmoko, archbishop of Semarang, officiated the consecration ceremonies of 11 diocesan priests, a Xaverian father and two Trappists. The bishop of Ketapang ordained a priest in remote Air Upas to ""promote religious vocations among local youth"".

Ketapang (AsiaNews) – In just one week, the Catholic Church of Indonesia celebrated 20 priestly ordinations: five in Tanjung Karang (Lampung), 12 in Yogyakarta (province of Central Java), two at the Trappist monastery of St Mary in Rawaseneng (Central Java), and one in Air Upas, diocese of Ketapang (West Kalimantan).

Last week, the bishop of Tanjung Karang, Mgr Yohanes Harun Yuwono, ordained five new priests in his diocese (picture 2).

Yesterday, Mgr Robertus Rubiyatmoko, archbishop of Semarang, officiated the consecration ceremony of 11 diocesan priests and a Xaverian father, at the St Paul Major Seminary in Yogyakarta.

On Thursday, the prelate consecrated two deacons to the contemplative life at the Trappist monastery of St Mary in Rawaseneng (picture 1).

The parish of St Mary Queen of Peace in Air Upas yesterday celebrated the ordination of Deacon Bonefaseus Mite as a diocesan priest (gallery).

Air Upas is located in one of the most remote areas of the Diocese of Ketapang. Reaching it required seven hours of travel by car, on gravel roads through vast oil palm plantations.

The day before the ceremony, the AsiaNews correspondent faced the long journey together with Fr Bangun Nugroho Pr, a local priest.

The following morning, two traditional tribal ceremonies took place to celebrate the ordination. Bonefaseus Mite is from Bajawa, Flores Island (East Nusa Tenggara), where most people are Catholic.

While he was a child, he moved with his family to a migrant centre in Air Upas. The local Catholic community therefore wanted to pay homage to the new priest, first with dances typical of Flores Island, then with Dayak dances. Ethnic Dayak hail from the place.

The Bishop of Ketapang, Mgr Pius Riana Prapdi, led the Mass, attended by 37 priests of the diocese.

The simple church in Air Upas was still flooded following rains that hit West Kalimantan 24 hours earlier.

Speaking to AsiaNews, the prelate noted that the decision to celebrate an ordination at such a remote location was ""due to a desire to promote religious vocations among local youth"".

The growth of massive commercial palm oil operations in Indonesia and Malaysia has seen the deforestation of vast tracts of rainforest and caused the decimation of populations of some of the world’s most endangered animals, including tigers and orangutans.

But replacing palm oil with other oil crops such as soy, rapeseed or corn would require up to nine times as much land to produce than palm, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

This would drive damaging biodiversity losses elsewhere, rather than end the ecological destruction associated with palm oil, the organisation said.

The report also suggests that palm oil certified as “sustainable”, is only slightly less damaging to rainforests than that from uncertified production.

The oil is the most widely consumed vegetable oil on the planet, used by billions of people each day and accounting for about half of all packaged products in the supermarket, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

It is found in food products such as chocolate, bread, ice cream and margarine, as well as cosmetics including lipstick, detergent and shampoo, while use of the oil is as a biodiesel is becoming increasingly popular.

“When you consider the disastrous impacts of palm oil on biodiversity from a global perspective, there are no simple solutions,” said IUCN Director General Inger Andersen. “Half of the world’s population uses palm oil in food, and if we ban or boycott it, other, more land-hungry oils will likely take its place.

“Palm oil is here to stay, and we urgently need concerted action to make palm oil production more sustainable, ensuring that all parties – governments, producers and the supply chain – honour their sustainability commitments.”

The report’s authors used satellite data to estimate the total planted area at 18.7 million hectares for industrial palm oil, and a total of 25 million hectares – roughly the area of the UK – when smallholder plantations are included.

Since 2002, more than 150,000 orangutans are thought to have been wiped out as a direct consequence of the palm oil industry.

“Palm oil is decimating South East Asia’s rich diversity of species as it eats into swathes of tropical forest,” said the report’s lead author and Chair of IUCN’s oil palm task force, Erik Meijaard. “But if it is replaced by much larger areas of rapeseed, soy or sunflower fields, different natural ecosystems and species may suffer. To put a stop to the destruction we must work towards deforestation-free palm oil, and make sure all attempts to limit palm oil use are informed by solid scientific understanding of the consequences.”

Recommended Government warned palm oil ban risks losing lucrative weapons deals

Oil palms produce 35 per cent of the world’s vegetable oil on under 10 per cent of the land allocated to oil crops, the report notes.

The huge demand for the oil has seen Malaysia and Indonesia come to dominate global production of the commodity which is worth in excess of $40bn (£32bn).

In January the European Parliament voted to end the use of palm oil in biodiesel which has grown in popularity among European drivers. The EU is Malaysia’s third biggest market for palm oil.

The move triggered alarm in Malaysia, and last month British diplomats warned the UK government that backing the EU ban could even put a lucrative arms deal with Malaysia at risk.","Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/05/16/21/2-Palm-Oil-Forest-AFPGet.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['oil', 'climate', 'say', 'world', 'change', 'stay', 'believe', 'alternatives', 'malaysia', 'drought', 'photographs', 'palm', 'better', 'doesnt', 'experts', 'disastrous', 'ecologically']", 
37,37,FF-2018-000079-IDN,China's Plastic Ban Will Flood Us With Trash - Smithsonian,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/chinas-plastic-ban-will-flood-us-trash-180969423/,"One of the only redeeming virtues of single-use plastic—besides its convenience—is the idea that all those used yogurt cups, water bottles and coffee lids can be tossed into the recycling bin to live another day as a park bench or even a T-shirt. But that whole feel-good system has hinged on one factor: China's willingness to import and deal with the developed world’s massive mountains of plastic. But China banned the import of most plastic waste on December 31, 2017. Now, reports Brian Kahn at Earther, a new study shows that because of the ban, plastic is piling up, and by 2030 111 million metric tons of plastic will be “displaced,” a euphemism for going into landfills, ditches, the ocean and anywhere but a recycled park bench. The United States alone will have 37 million extra metric tons of plastic waste to contend with.

According to a press release announcing the new research, several factors caused China to give up on its plastic importing. “Plastic waste was once a fairly profitable business for China, because they could use or resell the recycled plastic waste,” says Amy Brooks of the University of Georgia and lead author of the study in Science Advances. “But a lot of the plastic China received in recent years was poor quality, and it became difficult to turn a profit. China is also producing more plastic waste domestically, so it doesn't have to rely on other nations for waste.”

The result is that nations around the world that relied on China to take their plastic trash are now stuck with the stuff and do not have the infrastructure to recycle it. Darryl Fears and Kate Furby at The Washington Post report that the change has already had impacts on the United States, with states including Massachusetts and Oregon lifting restrictions on plastic waste in landfills to deal with the problem. In the coming years, many more Americans may see recycling programs screech to a halt. “It will impact recycling programs across the country,” Ben Harvey, owner and president of E.L. Harvey & Sons Recycling Services in Westborough, Massachussets, tells WaPo. “If there’s no place for this stuff to go, what’s the sense of collecting it? We’re going to look at the programs and say why are we collecting it, it’s not a commodity anymore. It’s a big thing. It’s a scary thing.”

There are some loopholes in the Chinese ban, reports Ellen Airhart at Wired. China’s ban covers potentially contaminated plastic, like mayonnaise jars that weren’t washed out or water bottles with chewed gum in them. However, China still allows bales of plastic with less than 0.5 percent contamination in for recycling. The company that deals with San Francisco’s plastic waste, for instance, has slowed down its sorting line to drop its contamination level from roughly 5 percent to under 1 percent, which allows the city to keep sending its Fiji bottles back overseas. But, Airhart points out, not all domestic waste handlers have the ability or money to reduce their contamination levels.

And there are no reasonable alternative destinations for the trash, either. “There’s not really another huge main hub where this material has to go,” Jenna Jambeck, a study co-author also from the University of Georgia, tells WaPo. Some nations like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia do recycle plastic, but they don’t have the infrastructure to shoulder China’s previous load. “There isn’t another individual country that has the capacity that China had to take the material.”

The ban is causing ripples in the U.S. recycling industry, reports the Associated Press. The National Recycling Coalition realeased a statement saying the industry needs to fundamentally shift how it communicates with the public and how it collects and processes recyclables. “We need to look at new uses for these materials,"" coalition executive director Marjorie Griek says. “And how do you get manufacturers to design a product that is more easily recyclable.”

Brooks tells Airhart that she hopes the international community pays attention to the study. “My dream would be that this is a big enough wake up call to drive international agreements” to regulate disposable plastics, she says.

There are some signs that nations around the world are starting to confront single-use plastics. India recently announced a plan to ban single-use plastics by 2022 and a recent United Nations report shows 50 nations around the world are making efforts to ban plastic bags, Styrofoam and other non-biodegradable items. Britain, too, has recently announced a ban on single-use plastic, and will likely eliminate things like plastic straws and cotton swabs next year.

In the U.S., the federal government is not taking the lead on the plastics issue, but several cities have implemented plastic bag bans or taxes and several are considering straw bans. Companies are taking up the issue too, with McDonald’s set to test alternatives to plastic straws later this year, though the company's shareholders aren't too keen on the idea.","Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/t4YZlftOHewbBWVXj6lT-PaJlIE=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/49/e5/49e565e9-a3bb-4d73-9ec0-e19d13e26223/bottlecaps.jpg,"['chinas', 'plastic', 'china', 'plastics', 'world', 'trash', 'nations', 'flood', 'study', 'singleuse', 'waste', 'recycling', 'ban']", 
38,38,FF-2018-000079-IDN,South-East Queensland is droughtier and floodier than we thought - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/south-east-queensland-is-droughtier-and-floodier-than-we-thought-97860,"New data recording the past 1,500 years of flows in the Brisbane River have revealed that South-East Queensland’s climate – once assumed to be largely stable – is in fact highly variable.

Until now, we have only had access to 200 years of weather records in South-East Queensland. But our new research used marine sediment cores (dirt from the bottom of the ocean) to reconstruct stream flows and rainfall over past millennia.

This shows that long droughts and regular floods are both prominent features in South-East Queensland’s climate.

This is concerning. Decisions about where we build infrastructure and how we use water have been based on the assumption that our climate – especially rainfall – is relatively stable.

Read more: Old floods show Brisbane's next big wet might be closer than we think

Archives of past climates

Natural archives of climate are preserved within things such as tree rings, coral skeletons, ice cores, lake or marine sediments. Examining them lets us extend our climate records back beyond documented history.

We can then undertake water planning in the context of a longer record of climate, instead of our short-term instrumental records.

In this study, we used sediment cores from Moreton Bay (next to the mouth of the Brisbane River) to reconstruct the river’s flow over the past 1,500 years. In these cores we measured various indicators of fresh water to reconstruct a record of streamflow and regional rainfall.

At the turn of the last millennium the region was in the middle of a prolonged dry spell that lasted some six centuries, from roughly the year 600 to 1200. After about 1350 the region became gradually wetter, with peaks revealing a series of extreme floods in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Large floods in the 1700s have also been documented in the upper reaches of the catchment, in the Lockyer Valley.

These broad shifts in regional rainfall and streamflow are linked to drivers of global climates, including hemispheric cooling and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

Read more: Explainer: El Niño and La Niña

A cool La Niña-dominant climate that persisted from roughly 1350 until 1750 caused increased rainfall and reduced evaporation.

In addition, the southward displacement of monsoon troughs at this time may have increased the likelihood of cyclone-related weather systems reaching southern Queensland.

This information helps us contextualise the climate of the last 200 years and gives us some insights into how regional rainfall responds to shifts in global climate.

Wet and dry extremes

Over the past 20 years, South-East Queensland has experienced its fair share of extreme weather events. Severe floods have caused deaths and damaged infrastructure. Flooding cost the Australian economy some A$30 billion in 2011.

The millennium drought, which in this region was most severe from 2003-08, resulted in widespread water shortages. This prompted major investment in the South-East Queensland Water Grid, a connected network of dams, water treatment plants, reservoirs, pump stations and pipelines.

So far Queensland has coped with everything Mother Nature has thrown at it. But what if extreme floods and droughts became the norm rather than the exception?

Read more: Floods don't occur randomly, so why do we still plan as if they do?

Water quality is getting worse

The 2011 and 2013 floods highlighted the vulnerability to these extreme events of Brisbane’s major water treatment facility at Mt Crosby. The drinking water supply to the city in 2013 became too muddy for purification. The 2011 flood was also alarmingly muddy.

Such events also threaten the ecosystem health of downstream waterways, including the iconic Moreton Bay

Our reconstruction found that big floods over the past 1,500 years rivalled the size of floods in recorded history (1893, 1974 and 2011), but the level of sediment in the water of more recent floods seems to be unprecedented.

This indicates that historical and ongoing land-use changes in the Brisbane River catchment are contributing to more abrupt and erosive floods.

This will continue unless better land management techniques are adopted to improve the resilience of catchments to extreme weather events.

What does this mean for the future?

We are learning that over the last millennium natural climate and rainfall have been more variable than previously thought. This means that modern anthropogenic climate change may be exacerbated by a background of already high natural climate variability.

In addition, our water infrastructure has been built based on a narrow understanding of natural climate variability, limited to the last 200 years. This may mean the quantity of reliable long-term freshwater resources in eastern Australia has been overestimated.

At least 12 people are dead after a ferry ran aground and took on water off Indonesia's coast, forcing terrified passengers to leap into the sea and wait for rescue.

The dead include a two-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl, officials say.

Passengers snapped dramatic photos as they clung to railings onboard the sinking vessel which was carrying up to 139 people and didn't have enough life jackets for everyone.

Pictures show huge waves swamping the listing ferry, people wearing orange life jackets as they float in the sea, and cars and trucks sinking in the turbulent water.

One of the vehicles that sank was a secure car carrying 30bn Indonesian rupiah (£1.5m) in cash from a bank.

Footage captured earlier shows scenes of panic onboard as people put on flotation vests while children scream and the boat is whipped by strong winds.

His video, viewed almost 200,000 times within two hours, shows passengers in life jackets waiting to be rescued as the boat took on water and waves crashed against it.

The KM Lestari ferry was sailing from Bira, on Sulawesi island, to Pamatata, on Selayar island, when disaster struck in strong winds and waves as high as 13ft.

Officials said the ferry ran aground after suffering engine damage on Tuesday afternoon. The hull was damaged, causing the vessel to take on water and list.

Rescuers raced to the scene to pull passengers out of the water in heavy rain. The effort was hampered by poor weather and rough sea conditions.

The ferry's manifest listed 139 passengers and 48 vehicles, including two buses and 14 trucks.

40,40,FF-2018-000079-IDN,How private equity is shaking up Southeast Asia - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/How-private-equity-is-shaking-up-Southeast-Asia,"BANGKOK -- Vietnam is still a communist country, but it is fast becoming one of the world's hottest markets for companies that are synonymous with aggressive capitalism: private equity firms.

The appeal for Western private equity firms -- known for their appetite for risk and debt-fueled buyouts -- is clear. Vietnam's economy is growing fast, its stock market has been performing well and the government has rolled out plans to privatize many state-owned enterprises. These are ideal conditions for private equity giants such as Warburg Pincus, KKR and TPG, which have been pumping money into Vietnam as opportunities shrink at home.

Warburg Pincus has led the pack, committing $1 billion to invest in Vietnamese companies. In March, the firm made Vietnam's largest-ever private equity investment by taking a $370 million stake in Technological and Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Techcombank) ahead of its listing on the stock exchange in Ho Chi Minh City in June.

Warburg's first Vietnamese investment was $200 million -- later raised to $300 million -- in Vincom Retail, a shopping mall owner now valued at around $3.5 billion.

KKR is also turning its attention to Vietnam. The leading U.S. private equity firm invested in Masan Group, a Vietnamese food and beverage company, last year. Ashish Shastry, head of KKR Southeast Asia, said, ""Vietnam holds great opportunity with its growing economy and favorable demographic trends.""

Vietnam's boom is part of a larger trend across Asia, where total private equity investment rose 38% to $158 billion in 2017 -- eclipsing Europe for the first time, according to research company Preqin. More money is coming. Carlyle Group has established its largest-ever Asia fund, at $6.65 billion, and Blackstone Group announced in mid-June that it has closed its first Asian-focused private equity fund, at around $2.3 billion. Together with commitments from its global buyout fund, Blackstone said it has a minimum of $3.8 billion to invest in Asia. Joe Baratta, Blackstone's global head of private equity, said, ""The region continues to experience strong growth compared to other major markets, presenting compelling investment opportunities across sectors.""

Growth has been particularly strong in Southeast Asia, where total private equity investment nearly tripled to $23.5 billion in 2017. Investors are betting on higher economic growth, rising investment in technology and growing middle classes across Southeast Asia.

The World Economic Outlook report by the International Monetary Fund forecasts stable growth for the five major ASEAN nations of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, with growth of 5.3% in 2018 and 5.4% in 2019.

While the projected growth rates for China and India are even higher, a Hong Kong-based investment fund specialist points out that with shares already trading at relatively high levels in those countries, big returns on investments are less likely.

In Southeast Asia, on the other hand, investors have more opportunities to invest in promising companies without breaking the bank. As a result, the specialist said, ""high yields can be expected in three to five years.""

Another factor steering funds' attention toward Southeast Asia is widespread capital market reforms.

The 1997 currency crisis hit several ASEAN members hard, prompting them to introduce new regulations and other measures to prevent a recurrence. These included improving corporate governance practices to protect the interests of investors.

These reforms, which were largely modeled on those in the U.K. and the U.S., generally started around 2000 and have served as a catalyst for private equity funds to invest in the region.

Reforms in Vietnam have focused on the public sector, including recently privatizing state-owned enterprise.

The privatization push officially began in 2011, but it only started making significant progress in 2016 under the government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. The number of SOEs that year fell to 583, down from 1,500 in 2010, and the number is projected to fall further to around 120 by 2020, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Finance. The number of listed companies, meanwhile, grew from 2 in 2000 -- the year Vietnam's first stock exchange opened -- to 686 as of the end of 2015, an overview by the State Securities Commission shows. Total market cap over the period went from 0.28% of GDP to 34.5%.

The government had intended to privatize state companies more gradually, but is now looking to speed up the process, in part to meet a projected $9 billion shortfall in its 2018 budget. A decree that took effect in January has made it easier for investors to take part in IPOs.

State companies that have gone public so far this year include Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical, PV Oil, PV Power and Vietnam Rubber Group. Major upcoming offerings include mobile network operator MobiFone, Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group and Vietnam National Tobacco Corp.

The prime minister has pitched these IPOs at numerous local and overseas business conferences, describing them as ""opportunities for private and foreign investors to hold shares in Vietnamese enterprises.""

These efforts are being recognized internationally. At a high-level conference in Hanoi in March, Ousmane Dione, the World Bank country director for Vietnam, said, ""Recent progress in enhancing Vietnam's business climate has been very encouraging and clearly reflects the government's strong commitment to narrow the gap with top performing economies.""

Management prowess

The private equity industry has its roots in the 1970s, when financiers such as Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts used debt to make ""leveraged buyouts"" of family-owned businesses. An LBO boom followed in the 1980s, and the impression of these firms as ruthless profit-hunters -- sometimes known as ""vulture capitalists"" -- was cemented by the best-seller ""Barbarians at the Gate.""

While it has taken time to shake the ""barbarian"" moniker in the West, private equity funds enjoy a considerably higher reputation in Asia, where many see them as sources of not just funds but also management expertise.

""Private equity firms provide Asian companies with a wide range of human resources, governance and growth capital,"" said Luke Pais, a partner at consultancy EY.

TPG, the private equity fund run by David Bonderman, set off a series of deals in Southeast Asia's beer and spirits industries after it bought a 50% stake in Myanmar Distillery for $150 million in December 2015.

The private equity group advised Myanmar Distillery in a range of areas, including ways to improve management efficiency. Last October, TPG sold its entire stake to Thai Beverage (also known as ThaiBev) for an estimated $490 million in a sooner-than-expected exit, more than tripling its investment in just two years. (ThaiBev acquired a total 75% of Myanmar Distillery by buying shares from another party.)

ThaiBev is in a relatively mature market with an aging population, so making forays into frontier markets like Myanmar is a matter of survival. In December, it bought a stake in Vietnam's largest state-owned brewer, Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage, or Sabeco.

The ThaiBev-TPG deal offers an example of how a private equity firm's exit strategy can influence industry realignment.

Private equity has also helped shape the epic ride-hailing battles in Southeast Asia, with KKR leading a $550 million investment in Go-Jek, the Indonesian ride-hailing company, in 2016. That investment boosted the startup's credibility, paving the way for later investments from Google and other big-name companies -- and fortifying it as it takes on Singapore-based Grab, which recently forced Uber Technologies out of the market after about four years.

A recent move by the ASEAN Economic Community may spur more private equity activity. In January, the group abolished nearly all tariffs in the bloc, giving companies a stronger incentive to formulate cross-border strategies in Southeast Asia. For many companies, this will mean pursuing growth through mergers and acquisitions. And if history is any indication, private equity firms will likely play a significant role in these M&A deals.

Atsushi Saito, former chairman of KKR Japan, said that in Europe, KKR was involved in a number of takeovers after the introduction of the euro as a common currency. This helped improve European companies' competitiveness, Saito said, suggesting that private equity funds could play a similar role in Asia.

Shifting sources of cash

The rise of private equity in Asia dovetails with another recent development in the region: rising personal wealth.

On May 17, fund managers, investment bankers and financial consultants from across Asia gathered at Singapore's Shangri-La Hotel to attend a conference of the Singapore Venture Capital & Private Equity Association.

Some of the newer faces at the conference belonged to family offices -- private wealth management advisory firms that serve the ultra-rich.

In the past, most family offices were based in Europe, but they are now becoming more common in Asia. Conferences like the one in Singapore are an opportunity for them to gather information on private equity funds in which they can park their clients' cash.

Data from Preqin shows that family offices are becoming an increasingly important source of investment money. Pension funds were the biggest supplier of cash for private equity funds established between 2012 and 2014, accounting for about 28% of all the money injected. They remained the top supplier in 2015-2017, but their share dropped to 20%. The figure for family offices, by contrast, tripled to 15%.

Western private equity firms do not have Southeast Asia all to themselves. Malaysia-based Navis Capital Group is one of several local players competing not on size but on expertise. Founded in 1998, just after the Asian currency crisis, Navis Capital started investing in undervalued companies and helping them turn their businesses around.

Thailand's Lakeshore Capital, which was launched in 2009, got its start acting as a substitute for banks, which had become increasingly risk-averse following the global financial crisis.

Kuala Lumpur-based Creador will soon launch its No. 4 fund worth $500 million. ""Our strength is the localization [in ASEAN markets],"" said founder and CEO Brahmal Vasudevan.

Mekong Capital, meanwhile, has been working to introduce Western-style business principles and attitudes into socialist Vietnam by bringing in executives from overseas to serve on company boards.

While their bigger U.S. rivals focus on growth rates and market reforms, Asian private equity firms like these are relying on their intimate knowledge of local business practices and their ability to sniff out and nurture promising companies.

Japanese private equity firms are going on the offensive, too. In mid-May, independent private equity firm Advantage Partners set up a $380 million Asia fund and announced that it would buy Malaysian plastic packaging maker Plastic Center.

Polaris Capital is preparing to launch an Asian investment fund worth about 14 billion yen ($130 million). ""We want to boost the value of our investment by connecting Japanese and Asian companies,"" President and CEO Yuji Kimura said.

With U.S., Japanese and local private equity companies pouring money into Southeast Asia, there is vast potential for growth -- but also trouble.

The amount of ""dry powder"" -- money raised but not yet invested -- has reached a record $1 trillion worldwide.

HANOI (Reuters) – The death toll from floods and landslides in Vietnam rose to 15 on Tuesday with authorities warning the toll could go higher with more torrential rains forecast for the worst hit province in the mountainous north.

Lai Chau province, 470 kms (290 miles) northwest of Hanoi, has been the worst hit with at least 12 people, including two children, killed, said Le Trong Quang, Deputy Chairman of the province’s People’s Committee.

Most of the victims drowned or were buried in landslides, triggered by heavy rains since Saturday, Quang told Reuters.

“We are bracing for more rains in the coming days and I fear that the death toll in the province will continue to climb as 11 people remain missing,” Quang said.

Vietnam is prone to natural disasters, with floods and typhoons killing hundreds of people each year. Natural calamities killed 389 people and injured 668 others in the country last year, according to the government.

In the neighboring province of Ha Giang flash floods have killed three people, the government’s Disaster Management Authority said.

Floods and landslides have also caused damage worth over 141 billion dong ($6.15 million) to houses, roads and crops in the area, according to the agency.

It said traffic to many areas of the provinces remain cut off on Tuesday.

42,42,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Goodbye Daddy: The life and times of Nyoman Suradnya - Jakarta Post,http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/06/21/goodbye-daddy-the-life-and-times-of-nyoman-suradnya.html,"Just sixteen years old with almost waist long hair, loose pyjama pants, a shoulder bag and sandals, I stepped off the only daily bus from Denpasar one afternoon in Ubud in late 1971.

Broke but optimistic, I wandered south through the market that in those days spilled out on to monkey forest road. It had already shut down for the day, the stalls with their flat bamboo woven shades empty. Rice fields began right where the football field is now, nothing downhill from there but rice fields and the narrow dirt track that led to the Padang Tegal Cemetery in the forest that is now known by its English name, Monkey Forest.

Across the potholed main road, Ubud’s wantilan, the closest thing to a town hall, had a big banyan tree towering over it to the north. It was under this tree that two of Ubud’s most iconic warung (food stalls) of the time were to be found. Ibu Rai’s nasi campur (mixed rice) plate on the eastern corner, and just next to it, separated by a woven bamboo bedeg (wall) to the west of it was Okawati’s, who had already begun to cater bit by bit to western tastes.

At Okawati’s you could have prut saladde (fruit salad) even if she only was catering to the three or four non Balinese living in the what was still the village of Ubud. Fresh fruit, condensed milk and fried peanuts. If fruit salad wasn’t your thing, you could order instant oatmeal!

But most important that morning was the presence of a big, burly, young Balinese man with a large head and big beaming smile. I would add that he wore a Balinese sarong, but in those days everyone did.

“Selamat pagi [Good morning],” came a deep, booming voice out of that smile.

Nyoman Suradnya alias Badung was the first person in Ubud who befriended me. I think he found me an interesting oddity, and he was always curious about the world around him. Young and somewhat innocent (not that we thought that), that morning we chatted like old mates. He had a spontaneous openness and seemingly endless sense of humor.

He also knew everyone in town — he would fill me in with short, pithy descriptions of who they were. And everyone in town knew him and liked him. Already then, he was a bit of an icon.

One by one, I got to know many of the people who would walk up from the main road and up the dirt track that was to become Jl. Suweta.

There were no road names, no house numbers, no electricity, no asphalt beyond the main road and no phones. Addresses were by banjars (traditional community unit), subaks (traditional farming and irrigation system), temples or the vicinity of large trees.

But it really didn’t matter because it was a community; everyone knew each other and where they were at any given time of day, it was an endless web of interrelationships sealed by marriages and loyalties. “Outsiders” like myself were a tiny minority. An outsider could be forgiven for not registering that this community too had experienced the horror of dreadful bloodletting only six years before, during the 1965 massacres.

I also got to know many of Ubud’s movers and shakers sitting there. This was Nyoman’s world. Nyoman too was to become a mover and shaker in Ubud.

He was a vigorous mix of romantic, emphatic Balinese who later on would wear his sarong to Australia; down-to-earth practicality that had him driving trucks delivering chilies and such to Java; and an artistic calling that eventually became his “profession”.

Dancing hands: Nyoman Suradnya taught Western visitors the art of painting batik. Those who attended his workshop found that they learned a lot more than just painting batik. (Nyoman Suradnya’s family/File)

But above all Nyoman had a vision for his beloved Ubud: the tourists that came — we called them tamu (guests) in those days — would be sensitized to Balinese culture and way of life, giving them an opportunity to immerse themselves in Ubud while avoiding the harm that was already beginning to be wreaked at Kuta and Legian in the early 80s.

Perhaps his closest friend was Cok Raka Kerthyasa. These two, the commoner and the prince, were to have many adventures together and even the odd hilarious misadventure.

Nyoman soon became established as an artist, and spent time as an artist in residence in Sydney, Melbourne and Singapore.

Asri, Cok Raka’s Australian wife, recalls the two of them setting off on a train to visit a town just west of Sydney.

“Being Balinese, they both simply relaxed and fell asleep. When they woke up they were at the end of the line somewhere way in interior and had no idea where they were! And no mobile phones in those days, so you can imagine [...].”

Driven by a vision of sustainable and sensitive tourism, in the early 80s the two formed Bina Wisata (guiding tourism). Bina Wisata set out to not only provide information to tourists but lead them into discovering the real Ubud: cultural and destination experiences that would cause minimum damage and instead benefit the community.

It wasn’t a business, it was a community service. It really was in character for Nyoman: he took delight in connecting with people and helping them discover new things, and he loved his community, flaws and all.

Larger than life, he would spontaneously reach out to people on first encounter, and often change their lives. His homestay, filled with his laughter and love of life, was an inspiring starting point for many who would become deeply involved in Ubud and Bali.

Recalling author Diana Darling: “I stayed at his homestay when I was first chasing John Darling in 1980. What a lovely happy host Nyoman was.”

Many too were visitors who got their first experience in creativity by joining one of his workshops.

However, time proved to be unkind to Nyoman’s Ubud. Bina Wisata was turned over to the village council’s Community Welfare Organization, which at first continued to serve the community. Yet as more and more tourists started to flow into the place, Ubud’s character started to change along with the type of people it had started to attract.

I can’t guarantee that this was something that triggered the following rather astounding event. One night there was a barong performance in the Ubud wantilan. Not necessarily sacred, at least in the hazy fog of my memory, but with all the elements present.

All of a sudden there was a scream and Nyoman leapt up in trance. The whole audience stared agog as Nyoman, kris in hand went flying over the gamelan, the terrified musicians ducked as low as they could as his large corpulent figure didn’t quite soar above them, sarong aflap.

Honestly, to this day I can’t figure out if he really was in deep trance or whether he was just making a pointed statement – or perhaps both.

By the mid 90s mass tourism flooded this once sleepy village, drowning out Nyoman’s dream. The community took second place to commerce, culture became something of a commodity. Industrial tourism brought foreign investors, fancy hotels and traffic jams. Kuta had come to the hills.

Nyoman slowly began to retreat. He remained true to his vision, but its realization had became more and more remote. The likelihood of ever achieving the dream went from improbable to near impossible.

Slowly but surely he withdrew more and more to the sanctuary of his home and guest house on Jl. Gotama. Here his wife Rai, as diminutive as he was large, looked after him, and eventually his son Putu Adi and daughter-in-law Kadek Purnami would all spend time looking after “Daddy”.

Though he still loved to see his old friends, the vigor and fight began to leave him. His melanchonic side began to dominate. In the last few years, as he became more infirm, it was rare to get a sighting of him outside of his home.

This month in hospital in Mas, various complications of heart, lungs and kidneys started to overwhelm him. At 10 p.m. on June 14, suddenly a large flock of herons appeared above the hospital and flew around in a swooping circle three times. It was such an unusual sight that people came out and stared.

That night Cok Raka said he was praying at the Gunung Lebah temple in Campuhan when suddenly he saw Nyoman sitting next to him: Cok nearly jumped out of his skin.

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. exactly, with a puzzled feeling that something had woken me up. I reached for my phone to check for earthquake notices, but nothing significant was to be found there. Unable to go back to sleep I got up. Then came the news that Nyoman had finally left his body on June 15 at 2:30 a.m. It was as if he was reaching out one last time that night in his ever unconventional manner.

Now his friends are left with a mixture of relief that his suffering is finally over and a sadness that he has taken with him an Ubud that is no more. We lost a gem that morning.","Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/06/21/2018_06_21_47900_1529545584._large.jpg,"['ubud', 'town', 'ubuds', 'nyoman', 'started', 'tourism', 'life', 'goodbye', 'balinese', 'times', 'community', 'suradnya', 'road', 'large', 'daddy']", 
43,43,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Bajaj Auto looking to set up KTM plant in Indonesia - Autocar India,https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/bajaj-auto-looking-to-set-up-ktm-plant-in-indonesia-408831,"KTM recently started selling its smaller displacement motorcycles in Indonesia via the CBU route. Now, with the positive reception shown towards these models, Bajaj Auto has expressed a desire to set up a plant in the country and begin production using CKD kits.

Bajaj itself had entered the Indonesian market way back in 2005 with its Pulsar under the venture PT. Bajaj Auto Indonesia, but was greeted with a lukewarm reception and was unable to convert it into a profitable venture. Bajaj attributed this to the domination of Japanese brands in the Indonesian market and it was therefore pleasantly surprised by the interest shown in the KTM models recently launched there.

Bajaj has been so impressed by the sales figures that, in its recent annual report, it stated it is moving towards setting up a plant in the country. It went on to say that the necessary licenses are being renewed, and clearances are awaiting approval.

""The plan for PT. Bajaj Auto Indonesia is to spearhead the development of KTM and Bajaj partnership and bring the jointly developed products into Indonesia. To take this further, all the required manufacturing, import, and business licenses have been renewed. Further, studies on the product acceptability have been conducted, which look favourable,"" Bajaj Auto stated in its 2017-18 annual report.

""CKD configurations have been created and the process of seeking clearances for these configurations has started. The company plans to kick off the business operations for PT. Bajaj Auto Indonesia in the current year with the CKD production in Indonesia,” added the report.

KTM currently sells the 200, 250 and 390 Duke and RC models in Indonesia as CBU units, and these are the models expected to be manufactured from CKD units once the plant is up and running. As Bajaj has mentioned, this should occur within this financial year.

46,46,FF-2018-000079-IDN,One big dump - Inquirer.net,https://opinion.inquirer.net/114078/one-big-dump,"Last week, soon after the monsoon rains stopped and floods receded, Metro Manila’s streets were once again left littered with plastic cups, PET bottles, retail packaging, styrofoam, take-out boxes, etc.

Other solid waste — including a refrigerator, a king-size bed and a sofa, according to one TV report — choked waterways and mouths of pumping stations across the metropolis, blocking water flow.

Officials often cite the indiscriminate garbage disposal practices of Filipinos as among the reasons flood prevention measures have not improved.

It is not uncommon to see people throwing their trash carelessly on the street, probably thinking that a wee piece of candy wrapper, a tiny bus ticket or cigarette butt won’t hurt the environment.

But that seemingly inconsequential piece gets washed away to join other trash until a virtual carpet of stinking, dangerous detritus is created on the waterways.

“Every day, our workers go down the drainage and waterways just to haul these garbage,” said Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chair Danilo Lim.

The MMDA recently conducted declogging operations in flood-prone areas. Scooping the enormous trash required heavy equipment, and the equivalent of more than 400 trucks of garbage were eventually collected.

It only took a few days, however, for the waterways to brim over with fresh trash, endangering once again the communities around it.

The civic group Eco Waste Coalition noted, in particular, that trash dumped into the Pasig River and its tributaries, and into Manila Bay, “[aggravate] the pollution of our water bodies and the oceans with waste and chemical contaminants.”

But this problem is not unique to Metro Manila; cities and towns across the country experience the same problem with recklessly thrown garbage.

Last year, the environmental group Greenpeace ranked the Philippines the “third-worst polluter” of the world’s oceans after China and Indonesia.

The country is among five Asian nations that contribute to more than half of the 8 million tons of plastic waste dumped into the oceans every year.

Greenpeace pointed to western consumer giants as exacerbating the situation by selling products packaged in cheap, disposable plastic, known as tingi or sachets, to Filipinos.

These single-use plastics were among those gathered by the group in a clean-up campaign in September 2017.

The Philippines does not, in fact, lack a solid waste management law. Republic Act 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, prohibits the dumping of waste in streets, canals, esteros and other public places.

It imposes a fine from P300 to P1,000, or a penalty of one to 15 days, or both, for violators. It also bans the manufacture, distribution or use of non-environmentally acceptable packaging materials, and a fine of P500,000 for violators.

In addition to this law, many local governments have also spearheaded campaigns to replace plastic with paper bags and encourage the use of reusable bags.

But old habits die hard; people still patronize single-use plastics and dispose their trash carelessly, often treating their surroundings as their extended dumping ground.

The public may blame it on the lack of garbage bins on the streets, or the absence of proper garbage segregation and recycling facilities.

But this also reflects badly on how Filipinos are taught the value of general cleanliness outside of their homes and bodies.

Amendments to RA 9003, including making manufacturers more accountable for waste products, are pending in the Senate.

Lawmakers should consider stiffer penalties for casual offenders, while the government should ensure not only that the law is firmly implemented, but also that more public-awareness programs are done to encourage citizens to keep their part of the bargain in ensuring clean, garbage-free communities.

The Metro Manila of today simply reflects the reality of that familiar but all-too-often ignored warning a netizen posted on Twitter: “Lahat ng basura na itinapon mo, babalik din sa iyo (All the garbage you throw will return to you).”

47,47,FF-2018-000079-IDN,"Cities Face Dramatic Rise in Heat, Flood Risks by 2050, Researchers Say - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/science-health/cities-face-dramatic-rise-heat-flood-risks-2050-researchers-say,"CAPE TOWN - In just 30 years, cities around the world will face dramatically higher risks from extreme heat, coastal flooding, power blackouts and food and water shortages unless climate-changing emissions are curbed, urban researchers warned Tuesday.

Today, for instance, over 200 million people in 350 cities face stifling heat where average daily peak temperatures hit 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for three months of the year, according to a study released by C40 Cities, a network of major world cities pushing climate action.

But by 2050, more than 1.6 billion people in 970 cities will face those conditions, researchers predicted.

The number of people who are both in poverty and battling brutal heat — usually without air conditioning — will rise tenfold, they said.

""This is a wake-up call,"" said Kevin Austin, deputy executive director of C40 Cities, at an international meeting in the South African city of Cape Town on adapting to climate change.

""The magnitude of people affected by heat will be (much) greater than today if we continue to increase greenhouse gases at this rate.""

But cities can take action to directly curb the risks, besides working to cut emissions, he said.

In Seoul, for example, a major elevated thoroughfare through the center of the city has been removed, opening up access to the river and lowering urban heat in the area by at least half a degree Celsius, he said.

South Korea's capital also has planted more than 16 million trees and created shaded cooling centers for those without air conditioning.

""We want to encourage cities to adopt more of these solutions and implement them as quickly as possible. In the worst case scenario, they will need to do them quickly,"" Austin said.

More drought, less water

The research, carried out by the New York-based Urban Climate Change Research Network, looked at data from more than 2,500 cities and predicted likely conditions if emissions continue to rise at their current rate.

It found that Cape Town's ongoing battle with drought-driven water shortages could become far more common, with over 650 million people in 500 cities — among them Sao Paulo and Tehran — likely to see their access to water reduced by 2050.

Many thirsty cities are already aiming to set caps on water use per person, with Los Angeles pushing for 200 liters a day, Melbourne for 155 litres and Cape Town a dramatically reduced 50, Austin said.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that an average American today uses at least 300 liters of water per day.

Sharing advice on how to make cuts happen — including insights gained in Cape Town, which has slashed its water use by half in the face of extreme drought — can save cities time and help them make changes faster, Austin said.

But more cities ""need to transition in a planned way, not in response to disaster,"" he added.

Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said dealing with a crisis when it arrives leaves little room to maneuver.

""In a crisis like this there is no time to go by trial and error. You unfortunately have to get it right the first time,"" she said at the Adaptation Futures conference in Cape Town.

Power risk from floods

The C40 Cities study also found that by mid-century over 800 million people will live in 570 coastal cities at risk of flooding from weather extremes and sea level rise.

Flooding presents a particular risk to urban power supplies, with many power stations located in flood-prone areas - and everything from transportation to heating and hospitals at risk if power plants flood in cities from London to Rio de Janeiro, the study noted.

Decentralizing power systems - including by getting clean energy from a larger number of smaller power plants - could help cut the risks, researchers said.

But flooding risks may be coming faster than expected.

Patrick Child, the European Commission's deputy director-general for research and innovation, said a predicted one-meter (3-foot) rise in global sea level, once anticipated by 2100, is now expected by 2070.

Last year already saw the highest-ever documented economic losses from severe weather and climate change globally, he said.

Experts at the adaptation meeting also predicted that extreme weather could bring cascading problems for cities, with flooding, for instance, triggering everything from disease outbreaks to road failures, food shortages and closed schools.

Looking at just one type of problem — such as a health threats from extreme heat, or sea level rise — isn't enough to capture the risks, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the authors of the report.

""In cities, all of these impacts interact with each other, and are all happening at the same time,"" she said.

Solutions also need combined approaches, with engineering efforts to cut flooding, for instance, working hand in hand with things like better protection of flood-absorbing wetlands, Rosenzweig said.

She said she hoped the research would help city officials prioritize what changes need to happen first to better protect their citizens from climate threats.

In cities ""it's often overwhelming, with so many things to do,"" she said.","Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/E0BA7806-38C8-4F23-AF5C-222847877B59.jpg,"['climate', 'dramatic', 'say', 'face', 'rise', 'risks', 'flood', 'water', 'cape', 'power', 'researchers', '2050', 'flooding', 'cities', 'urban', 'town', 'heat']",

At least three deaths were reported from Jammu owing to rain-related incidents on Saturday and over a dozen houses were also damaged due to the rains in the district.

Meanwhile, intermittent rains continued in Kashmir on Saturday, with authorities sounding a flood alert in central Kashmir, even as water levels started receding in the southern parts of the valley.

The authorities had on Friday issued a flood alert in south Kashmir. On Saturday, they issued a flood alert for low-lying areas of central Kashmir, including Srinagar, and asked the people to be alert and prepared for evacuation. Schools across the Valley were closed on Saturday in view of the inclement weather.

""The gauge at Ram Munshi Bagh crossed the flood declaration of 18 feet and was flowing at 20.87 feet at 10 am,"" an official of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department said.

He said the people living in areas along the embankments of Jhelum river and other streams and in low-lying areas of central Kashmir were advised to remain vigilant.

Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Syed Abid Rasheed Shah said the people living in low-lying areas and embankments of river Jhelum in Srinagar were requested to be alert and prepared for evacuation.

In south Kashmir, the flood alert was sounded after the water level crossed the flood declaration level of 21 feet at Sangam in Anantnag district.

While the water level at Sangam at 10 am Saturday morning was 23.06 feet – still above the critical mark – the water had begun receding. At 9 am the water level there was 23.16 feet.

Kashmir Valley experienced heavy rainfall over the past three days and the downpour intensified in many parts, including the summer capital of the state, on Friday.

The annual Amarnath Yatra resumed from both the on-foot routes of Baltal and Pahalgam on Saturday after being suspended for a couple of days due to inclement weather conditions. Incessant rainfall in the region for the past few days forced the authorities to suspend the yatra, but with improvement in weather, pilgrims were allowed to proceed towards the cave shrine. Air sorties by the administration have also resumed from Baltal.

Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Governor N N Vohra on Saturday undertook an extended tour of the summer capital for a first-hand view of the ground situation consequent to the rising water levels in the Jhelum river and streams in the Valley due to rains.

Vohra inspected the administration's preparedness to evacuate people if Srinagar gets flooded, a Raj Bhavan spokesperson said.

He visited the Boulevard Road, Hydraulic Gauge Centre of the Jhelum river at Ram Munshi Bagh, Lasjan, and relief camps in the Rawal Pora and Ram Bagh areas for a first-hand view of the ground situation consequent to Jhelum rising above high flood levels, the spokesperson said.

The governor inspected the designated relief camps at the Tourism Department's Community Centre Goripora, Government Boys Higher Secondary School Rawal Pora and the ERA Complex in the Shopping Complex building at Ram Bagh. The divisional commissioner Kashmir explained the basic facilities being provided at these sites.

The governor instructed the commissioner, PHE, Flood, and Irrigation Department, to immediately ensure adequate availability of sandbags and other required materials for ensuring immediate repair of any breach in the Jhelum bundh, he said.

Search officials believe the team has taken shelter inside a large chamber deep inside the complex.

In addition to the Navy divers, underwater probes are being used in the search.

51,51,FF-2018-000079-IDN,Kenya's Lake Turkana put on World Heritage danger list - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/06/29/kenyas-lake-turkana-put-on-world-heritage-danger-list.html,"A UNESCO panel on Thursday added Lake Turkana, a conservation hotspot in Kenya and a candidate site for the birthplace of mankind, to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.

The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's World Heritage Committee expressed concern about the disruptive effect of Ethiopia's Gibe III dam ""on the flow and ecosystem"" of Lake Turkana downstream.

The impact ""poses further threat to the site,"" UNESCO said in a statement on Thursday issued from Bahrain.

Located in northwestern Kenya and known as the Jade Sea, Lake Turkana is the most saline lake in East Africa and the largest desert lake in the world.

Its islands are breeding grounds for the Nile crocodile, hippopotamus and several snake species while the lake itself is important to migratory birds.

The area is also a possible site of mankind's birth, hosting the fossil deposits at Koobi Fora.

The remains of many early hominins have been found there, including Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.

""The Koobi Fora deposits, rich in mammalian, molluscan and other fossil remains, have contributed more to the understanding of paleo-environments than any other site on the continent,"" says UNESCO.

""The geology and fossil record represents major stages of earth history,"" it adds.

The lake itself is 249 kilometers long and 44km wide while the protected area, known as Lake Turkana National Parks, comprises three adjacent reserves -- Central Island, South Island and Sibiloi parks -- covering a total area of 161,485 hectares.

The lake, however, is endangered primarily by Ethiopia's construction of a hydroelectric and irrigation dam on the Omo River, which replenishes the lake seasonally.

The dam threatens to disrupt seasonal flooding that is essential to the reproductive cycle of the lake fish, with an estimated 300,000 people depending on fishing Turkana for their livelihoods.

The irrigation project is also expected to significantly reduce the total amount of water entering the lake.

Many fear that the two Omo River projects will cause the lake level to reduce dramatically -- by several tens of meters (dozens of feet) -- echoing the environmental disaster previously seen in the Aral Sea, in Central Asia, which dried up after its feeder rivers were diverted for irrigation schemes.

UNESCO opposed the Gibe III dam, Africa's highest at 243 meters, which was inaugurated at the end of 2016 and also serves to water vast new sugar cane plantations.

""The dam's impacts on the lake water levels are already becoming evident,"" UNESCO warned.

""The data provided shows an overall rapid decline in water levels since January 2015 when the impounding of the Gibe III reservoir commenced, and that seasonal fluctuation patterns have been heavily disrupted.""

UNESCO lamented the absence of proper environmental assessments and warned of ""potential downstream impacts on [Lake Turkana], such as reduced water flow and contamination from fertilizers and pesticides"".

""Although the scale of the project has been reduced, it is likely to increase water consumption from the Omo River,"" it added, meaning less water reaching the lake.

The southern part of Ethiopia's Omo Valley is also designated a World Heritage Site.

In Kenya, Richard Leakey, a renowned palaeoanthropologist and conservationist, welcomed the endangered listing but doubted it would save the lake.

""I think the more attention we can get for the plight of Lake Turkana the better, but I don't think necessarily that UNESCO can do anything for Lake Turkana,"" Leakey told AFP.

""UNESCO declared it a world heritage site many years ago, (but) the situation in Turkana continued to get worse not better,"" he said.","Sat, 30 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/06/29/2018_06_29_48497_1530266427._large.jpg,"['dam', 'turkana', 'heritage', 'world', 'river', 'lake', 'list', 'water', 'danger', 'site', 'unesco', 'kenyas', 'omo']",

Countries are increasingly using climate information systems, which consist of data collection points that are mapped and analysed, to provide communities with scientific estimations of future climate impacts.

Their expanded use is likely as studies indicate extreme weather events are expected to occur more frequently - even assuming the Paris Agreement’s central goal of limiting global temperature rises to well under 2°C is met.

Climate effects manifest in a variety of forms — ranging from the abnormally powerful hurricanes that smashed into the Caribbean in September last year to the insidious, and equally disruptive onset of drought in Africa, most recently in South Africa.

While the impacts may differ, the destructive effects of climate change often resonate long after their onset.

The Philippines, for instance, is still dealing with the after-shocks of Cyclone Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, which killed more than 6,000 people and reportedly dealt the biggest blow to the agricultural sector in the country’s history.

That is why the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has been stepping up its support to countries to use climate early warning systems to reduce the impacts of extreme weather.

These systems are designed to improve weather forecasting and, just as importantly, disseminate climate information to ensure communities are informed and prepared.

Wider benefits

A GCF-funded project being implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) in Vanuatu is expanding the use of climate information services in five targeted sectors: tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, water management and fisheries.

SPREP’s Simon Wilson emphasises the broad benefits climate information services can provide, right down to the grassroots level.

“Tailored meteorological and climate services can have significant multiplier benefits for decision making on a daily basis,” he said. “This can also address long-term sea level rise, and mitigate flooding impacts through infrastructure and land-use planning. Ultimately, this will help save lives and reduce economic costs.”

For the past four years, Vanuatu has been ranked the world’s most disaster-prone country, with more than 90 per cent of its infrastructure located no more than 500m from the coastline.

The experience of Vanuatu also provides an example of the positive aspects of climate disaster warning. The death toll of 11 from Cyclone Pam, which smashed into the island in March 2015, was relatively low thanks in part to the use of warning texts sent to the islanders.

The use of early warning helped to reduce the devastation, when considering that aid agencies viewed Pam to be one of the worst disasters to hit the Pacific region.

Using scientific analysis to calculate climate risks is often a core component of efforts to make societies more resilient to climate change.

“ Some see climate considerations as an increasingly essential element in making major business investments.

A GCF initiative now being implemented in Vietnam with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is strengthening storm and flood protection by using information from climate assessments across all of the country’s 28 coastal provinces.

Vietnam’s vulnerability was brought into stark relief in November last year when floods following Typhoon Damrey killed at least 60, destroyed 2,000 homes, and threatened to disrupt a yearly Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering of world leaders.

Another GCF-UNDP project shows that early flood warning is not just a priority for coastal communities. Rising temperatures in northern Pakistan are turning glaciers into growing lakes which now threaten over 7 million people with flooding.

Heading off conflict

It should also be noted, however, that early warning can be more than just preparing for the sudden onset of devastation by floods and cyclones.

Joseph Intsiful, a GCF climate information specialist, believes that while prompt responses to climate disasters are essential, early warning systems are far more than just storm alerts, as they can also act as useful planning guides to boost long-term resilience.

“While freak weather events grab the news headlines, we also need to think how early warning systems can help address slow-moving climate effects such as drought,” he said.

“This is particularly important in Africa. Climate systems in the region show precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly erratic, while 95 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa’s agriculture relies on rainfall.”

More accurate predictions of rainfall can also help reduce climate change-induced conflict, added Intsiful.

“One of the biggest security challenges in West Africa is climate-related, as cattle herders move into farming lands because pasture lands they have been using become untenable with changing rain patterns,’” he said.

“With climate information and conflict early warning systems, it is possible to head off conflict before it occurs, for instance by advising that water reservoirs are installed in areas where rainfall is predicted to decline.”

Business sense

The importance of early warning systems is expected to grow. The World Economic Forum has identified the increasing prevalence and cumulative effect of extreme weather as a major risk to global stability and economic growth.

And businesses are taking note. Reinsurance group Swiss Re has found that insured losses from natural and man-made disasters worldwide in 2017 were the highest ever recorded in a single year at USD 144 billion. The main cause was the series of hurricanes that smashed the Caribbean and US coasts.

Some see climate considerations as an increasingly essential element in making major business investments. This could lead to enhanced funding by companies to support climate early warning systems as part of a country’s suite of adaptation measures.

This aspect alone is likely to increase private-sector investment in climate resilience and adaptation – which currently lags far behind private-sector investment in clean energy.

This might be a silver lining in the gathering clouds of future extreme weather.

Authorities acted after Mount Agung in northeastern Bali erupted on Thursday, spewing a 2,500-meter (8,200-foot) column of ash into the surrounding air. Ash can damage aircraft engines and cooling systems and reduce visibility.

Officials, who have not raised their warning alert to the maximum level, established a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) danger zone around the volcano's crater and helped evacuate some 300 nearby residents.

Astronauts were able to snap a picture through a hole in the clouds. From dense ash to clouds of condensed water, virtually all natural phenomena can be examined from outer space.

Natural disasters as seen from outer space Don't play with fire Every year, wildfires devastate the landscape - and ecology - in numerous countries around the world. Too often, these are caused by humans. This was also the case in Indonesia, where farmers burned peat rainforest areas for agriculture. On the island of Borneo and Sumatra, satellites detected fire hot spots in September 2015, and the plume of grey smoke that triggered air quality alerts.

Natural disasters as seen from outer space German kids misbehaved In Germany, parents warn their children that if they don't finish their meals, it's going to rain. And indeed, in 2013 it rained, so much that some of central Europe's major rivers overflowed their banks. As shown in this image from 2013, the Elbe burst its banks following unprecedented rainfall. In the photo, muddy water covers the area around Wittenberg, in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.

Natural disasters as seen from outer space Hold your breath! Dust often covers remote deserts - however, in September 2015, satellites offered this impressive view of Middle East areas enveloped by a dust storm, or haboob, affecting large populated regions.

Contemporary works are also part of the show.

But why has man always taken pleasure from pictures that show misfortune, tragedy and suffering? Why is it that natural disasters so entirely captivate an onlooker?

""Representations of catastrophes emotionally involve the viewer, making him or her become emotional and stirring feelings of compassion,"" explains Markus Bertsch, curator of the exhibition in Hamburg.

A disaster's magnetic pull

""Each person maintains a certain basic interest in catastrophes. They have a sort of magnetic effect. But after a specific point, the moral principles come into play,"" Bertsch says. The curator adds that that's the reason why most people first look at news, photos or videos of catastrophes, even if they actually don't want to, before they decide to turn away from the topic.

A common motif over centuries

Though the exhibition at Hamburg's Kunsthalle includes 15 to 20 works of contemporary art, most of the over 200 items on display come from earlier centuries.

Bertsch and his colleague Jörg Trempler, a professor from the University of Passau who helped develop and prepare the exhibition, wanted to make the viewer sensitive to the fact that catastrophes are not just omnipresent today due to the media, but have actually fascinated people for centuries.

In works dating back to the year 1600, different artists show how natural disasters have long played a central role in art; it's simply that the representation and transmission have changed and developed as time has gone on.

""This topic has been present and totally relevant for hundreds of years and comes to the forefront again and again,"" Bertsch points out.

Yesterday's catastrophes today

While earlier artists depicted mythical catastrophes, since the 18th century, artists have increasingly drawn inspiration from current events, for example, the great fire of Hamburg in 1842, or the sinking of the Titanic on April 14, 1912. The second half of the 18th century can therefore be seen as the era when catastrophe depictions as a genre was truly born, according to Bertsch.

Nevertheless, general representations of different types of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, sinking wreaks, fires, and volcanic explosions, have been present throughout all eras.

The same is true for art of the present, Bertsch says, in that there is no focus on a particular type of catastrophe; the whole spectrum of disasters can be artistic subject matter today, just as it has been in the past.

Theatrical origins

The term catastrophe originally comes from the theater, where it was primarily characterized through its role as a turning point, causing a surprising change in plot. ""This theatrical definition can be partially applied to art as well,"" Bertsch explains.

Consequentially, catastrophes were accompanied by a certain positive connotations such as productivity, especially at the beginning of the 17th century.

But in the centuries that followed, the suffering, misfortune and tragedy caused by catastrophes took center stage and have held the position to this day.

58,58,FF-2018-000079-IDN,George Town marks UNESCO anniversary amid debate - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Arts/George-Town-marks-UNESCO-anniversary-amid-debate,"GEORGE TOWN, Malaysia -- On any given weekend, a 15-meter-long queue of international tourists materializes at the upper corner of Armenian Street, an atmospheric road packed with tourist shops and cafes at the heart of George Town, capital of Malaysia's Penang State.

Selfie-stick-toting visitors wait patiently to snare shots next to George Town's most iconic piece of street art, ""Two Kids on a Bicycle,"" a life-size mural showing two children riding a bicycle into the wall. Meanwhile, local motorists curse the artwork -- and the tourists -- for contributing to the traffic gridlock that mars the area.

The mural, voted one of the world's best graffiti in a 2013 poll by the Guardian, a U.K. newspaper, was created in 2012 by Ernest Zacharevic, a Lithuanian artist, as part of that year's George Town Festival -- a month-long carnival of international art that celebrates the city's listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site on July 7, 2008.

A decade on from the listing, murals such as Zacharevic's have led to a boom in street art that has helped to make George Town one of Southeast Asia's coolest creative locations. But the city's emergence as an open-air street art museum has also shifted its focus from the multiethnic cultural heritage and colonial architecture that led to the listing toward a short-term fixation with easy tourist dollars.

""It's interesting how Penang has become one of the biggest open-air art galleries in the world, but how do you control this? How to decide what stuff should really go on the wall?"" said Joe Sidek, director of the George Town Festival, who is responsible for helping to kick-start the street art mania. ""The sad thing is that people don't come to see the beautiful architecture, peoples and food of Penang any longer,"" Sidek said. ""The relevant authorities should really look at a master plan for tourism, and not just at increasing the numbers.""

In 2017, Penang Airport, the closest to George Town, registered 7.2 million tourist arrivals, up from 6.7 million in 2016. ""But you want better quality tourists,"" said Sidek. ""Penang is very sensitive, [George Town is] a small city with small lanes that can't sustain the current number of tourist buses.""

Penang Global Tourism, the state tourism bureau, did not respond to questions from the Nikkei Asian Review. However, former Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, now Malaysia's finance minister, claims that the development of the state has been a great success. ""From being the dirtiest state in the country, we are now one of the cleanest cities not only in Malaysia but also in ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations],"" Lim says on his personal website.

""Penang is now acknowledged by the [Malaysian] Auditor-General's Report as the best financially managed state, with annual budget surpluses every year since 2008. Over the last 10 years, Penang's asset reserves have been doubled to 1.83 billion ringgit ($457 million) Investments have gone up by 90% and tourism more than doubled.""

Zairil Khir Johari, another politician from the state's ruling Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition, said the problems of development should be seen in the context of major economic advances. ""Some of the positives include a revival of the inner-city economy, the booming of heritage tourism and the emergence of new forms of tourism based on arts and culture. On the downside, there has been significant gentrification: Many old traders have been priced out, and George Town has become a tad more expensive compared to before. But that is the price of development.""

To some long-term George Town residents, and to those who work in tourism and the arts, the picture looks very different. George Town's UNESCO-protected area has been transformed into a patchwork of tattered shophouses awaiting restoration and shiny, gentrified and refurbished commercial lots. Real estate prices have risen tenfold in a decade thanks to investment by foreign investors, mainly from China, Singapore and the West. Shophouses within the UNESCO heritage area now sell for between 3 million and 6 million ringgit, and monthly rentals hover between 4,000 and 8,000 ringgit.

""George Town is in danger of being turned into a spectacle of consumer culture, driven by market forces,"" said Gareth Richards, co-founder of the city's new Hikayat arts space, who co-curates the successful George Town Literary Festival. ""In George Town, the process of gentrification involves a specific kind of intervention -- one that alters the cityscape by accentuating architectural features or transforming them to generate a heightened visual impact, adjusting the new landscape to the demands of the property market and mass tourism.""

Development within the UNESCO-protected area is subject to regulations. But the rules are less well-defined outside its boundaries, and tension is growing between those who want to preserve what they see as authentic and those who favor vigorous development. In one well-known case, development forced the relocation of a traditional coffee shop called Kong Thai Lai, which had dished up Penang roti bakar -- toasted bread with coconut jam and half-boiled egg -- from a traditional shophouse in Hutton Lane for the best part of a century. The shop moved in 2016 after Singaporean developers bought a row of shop houses in the street.

""I was very sad at the beginning, but in the end I bit the bullet,"" said Kong Thai Lai's manager Gary Tan Jeng Seow. ""The new location is closer to the tourist enclave of Chulia Street, and we get more business,"" he said.

In February 2016, six heritage buildings -- including a bungalow that was once home to Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of the British settlement in Singapore -- were bulldozed to make space for new condominiums. ""George Town's Special Area Plan was only gazetted in 2016: that's like closing the barn door after the horse has bolted,"" said Khoo Salma Nasution, vice-president of Penang Heritage Trust.

Murals like this work in Air Hitam, have been used to ""revive"" and attract more tourism to most areas outside the heritage buffer zone. (Photo by Kit Yeng Chan)

""Penang's heritage is that of a port city set between the hills and the sea, a historic urban landscape composed by many scenic attractions and cultural landscapes. But the number of residents living within the world heritage site has declined to less than 10,000, and many traditional crafts are already lost. In order to get back on track, we need to carefully balance the historic urban landscape with a new urban agenda.""

There have also been development issues elsewhere in Penang State, which consists of Penang island, off the west coast of peninsular Malaysia, and a strip of land on the country's mainland. Penang Hill, a historic island retreat for the area's British colonizers, suffered severe floods in November 2017 that led to mudslides across the island.

""Yes, we are facing serious challenges of sustainability. The future is in our hands: it will depend on good governance, social inclusion and environmental sensitivity,"" said Anwar Fazal, a Malaysian social activist and director of the Right Livelihood College, a ""capacity building"" initiative of the Swedish Right Livelihood Award Foundation, which has campuses at several global universities. ""Fortunately, Penang has a vibrant, assertive civil society, and the degree of awareness about sustainability is very high.""

Anwar added: ""There have already been very deep concerns about hill development, floods, reclamation and people, and eco-friendly public transport. The heritage concept must also move beyond George Town to a state-wide, and even regional, concept. There are great archaeological discoveries in Penang, and also a campaign for the historic island of Pulau Jerejak, formerly a leper colony and a quarantine station, to be protected."" Pulau Jerejak lies off the east coast of Penang island.

For sceptics about the benefits of development, it is time for George Town -- and the rest of Penang -- to stop chasing tourist dollars.

62,62,FF-2018-000079-IDN,National security in the Philippines under Duterte: pragmatic partnerships beyond the noise | The Strategist - The Strategist,https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/national-security-in-the-philippines-under-duterte-pragmatic-partnerships-beyond-the-noise/,"In May 2016, Rodrigo Duterte, the long-term mayor of Davao City, won a resounding victory in the Philippines national presidential election. He has since set in train a highly populist agenda that has seen internal security and stability as the main priority of his tenure.

My new report for ASPI—National security in the Philippines under Duterte: Shooting from the hip or pragmatic partnerships beyond the noise?—released today, looks at how Duterte has gone about securing his internal objectives and diversifying and rebalancing the country’s external alignments.

On assuming the presidency, Duterte ordered the army to prioritise the neutralisation of the Islamic State–affiliated Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) within a year, reiterating that mandate in the wake of the protracted 2017 Marawi crisis. He flooded the south with thousands of troops, requested the deployment of an additional 20,000 soldiers to safeguard areas where there were continuing threats, and declared an extended state of martial law across Mindanao.

These measures have been relatively successful. More than 350 militants were eliminated in 2017, and their ability to operate out of traditional strongholds in the south has been effectively degraded.

Duterte also sought to capitalise on ties he’d made with the left when he was mayor to bring an end to the protracted insurgency of the New People’s Army (NPA). His approach was conciliatory, and he quickly entered into four rounds of peace talks with the rebel movement.

Despite that promising start, little progress has been made in concluding a final deal. In November 2017, Duterte formally terminated all talks with the NPA. That was seen as an ominous development, possibly presaging the wholesale abandonment of the peace process. However, in April 2018, the president directed his cabinet to resume negotiations with the communist movement. How this will play out in terms of sealing a lasting settlement remains to be seen.

In March 2016, a surge of high-profile hijackings hit the tri-border area (TBA) between the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia in the Sulu and Celebes seas. Although no party has explicitly taken responsibility for the attacks, most commentators believe criminal elements within the ASG were the main culprits. Duterte mobilised specialist units from the army to destroy the group’s strongholds in Sulu and deployed the coast guard to intercept suspected pirate vessels. He also moved to collaborate with Indonesia and Malaysia in instituting a trilateral regime of maritime domain awareness in the TBA.

This combined unilateral and collective approach has resulted in a significant drop in attacks in the TBA. That said, there’s little room for complacency. The resilience of the ASG, combined with the size and archipelagic nature of the area to be monitored, means that the TBA will remain a potential maritime crime hotspot for the foreseeable future.

On the domestic front, one of Duterte’s main election pledges was to initiate an aggressive response to the Philippines’ growing drug problem. Not only did he promise that 100,000 dealers, addicts and traffickers would be eliminated, he also offered bonuses to the police for every criminal body they delivered. By the end of 2017, 4,000 had died at the hands of law enforcement and another 8,000 had been murdered by unknown assailants.

The global community has reacted with alarm at these figures and the apparent impunity with which the drug war is being conducted in the Philippines. In February 2018, the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary judicial inquiry into whether Manila’s policies warranted a full investigation of known human rights abuses.

Certainly, there are grounds to question the morality and utility of Duterte’s drug war. However, it’s important to note that his administration’s counter-narcotics strategy includes more nuanced strands of demand reduction and rehabilitation support. These underreported initiatives reflect a somewhat more coherent approach to dealing with the illicit drug trade and are more in line with the policies of governments in the West.

Duterte’s foreign policy has focused on configuring the Philippines’ external relations to maximise the time and space he has to pursue his domestic security priorities. To that end, he has embarked on two parallel courses of action. The first is resolving outstanding disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea in an effort to remove what was a key source of international distraction during the Aquino presidency. The second is adopting an ‘independent’ foreign policy that lessens the Philippines’ dependence on the United States while improving relations with China and other non-traditional partners such as Russia.

Despite this seemingly revolutionary stance on foreign affairs, it’s clear that his administration continues to view Washington—rather than Beijing or Moscow—as the ultimate security guarantor in Southeast Asia. Nearly two years into the Duterte presidency, there’s considerable continuity in American–Filipino relations. All the treaty foundations of the bilateral alliance remain intact. The two countries continue to conduct regular joint training exercises. And while some military engagements have been cancelled, new ones have been initiated in their place.

Rather than adopting an independent foreign policy, Manila appears to be moving more towards an ‘interdependent’ stance in its external relations, maintaining relationships with traditional partners (the US) while seeking to diversify ties with new powers (China and Russia). Although that may not have been Duterte’s original intent, it’s largely consistent with the postures of past presidents and is certainly the approach that would seem best for the Philippines’ national security today.","Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/640px-President_Duterte_handshake_with_President_Xi.jpg,"['south', 'duterte', 'national', 'noise', 'foreign', 'pragmatic', 'security', 'drug', '2017', 'relations', 'approach', 'philippines', 'tba', 'partnerships']",

(Reuters Photo/Instagram)

Wellington. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave birth to her first child, a girl, on Thursday (21/06), Ardern said in a posting on Instagram.

Ardern, 37, became New Zealand's youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election, and now becomes the first woman in the country's history to give birth while in office.

""Welcome to our village wee one,"" Ardern wrote on Instagram.

""Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45 p.m. weighing 3.31 kg ... We're all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital.""

She posted a picture of herself, smiling and holding the baby in a woolen blanket, with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford.

Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has stepped in as acting prime minister and will run the country for the next six weeks while Ardern takes maternity leave, according to an agreement they published earlier.

Ardern is one of the few elected leaders to hold office while pregnant. Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto gave birth while she was prime minister in 1990.

The public has generally been supportive of the popular Ardern.

New Zealand has long had a progressive reputation and was the first country to give women the right to vote in 1893 and Ardern is the country's third female prime minister.

Congratulations quickly flooded in from around the world and across the political spectrum.

'Proud Day'

New Zealand's first women prime minister, Helen Clark, wrote on Twitter: ""What a proud day ... gender quality in action. This is 21st C[entury] NZ.""

Ardern found out she was pregnant on Oct. 13, just six days before she was propelled into the job when Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First Party, announced he was siding with her Labour Party in post-election negotiations.

Peters is a colorful political veteran who first entered Parliament in 1978 and has held senior positions in both center-left Labour and center-right National governments.

Ardern had played down the chances of any disruption arising from her absence, saying she and Peters would be in regular contact.

""There actually hasn't really been a need to put down a plan ... We already talk about significant issues, that will just continue, we'll just be in different roles,"" she said in a interview with Fairfax media just before going on maternity leave.

Ardern has said she plans to return to work at the beginning of August.

Then, Gayford will take care of the baby and will travel with Ardern between their Auckland home and the capital, Wellington, as well on international engagements.

Ardern worked until late into her pregnancy, regularly encountering members of the public who touched her stomach and passed on gifts such as ""onesies"" and miniature rain boots, known as ""gumboots.""

""It's been great,"" she told reporters at her last major public event before giving birth.

""New Zealanders are incredibly generous people and have been generous in their support of me regardless of the politics just as another human being going into a new stage of life.""

64,64,FF-2018-000079-IDN,"On India's Kerala coast, a man-made solution exacerbates a natural problem - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2018/06/on-indias-kerala-coast-a-man-made-solution-exacerbates-a-natural-problem/,"Coastal erosion in the southern Indian state of Kerala has destroyed hundreds of homes, forcing families into temporary shelters, many of whom have been stuck there for several years now.

Experts say a major factor for the erosion is, ironically, the series of seawalls built by authorities along the coastline to prevent the problem.

The cyclical nature of the erosion has traditionally meant that sediment swept out to sea is later deposited back on land. But the seawalls prevent the latter from happening.

Other factors have also been cited, including a cyclone that struck the region last year, as well as intensive sand mining along the coast.

KERALA, India — Sixty-five-year-old Maria sits at the doorstep of her demolished house. The only thing that remains is a wall attached to the door. Every morning, she comes “home” and sits there until evening, reminiscing about the times going back to when she and her family started to build their new house.

“My family and I lived in this house just for two years. One night there was an announcement for us to go to a relief camp as the sea was rough. When we returned the next morning the house was ruined by the waves. We were heartbroken,” she said.

Maria lives in the coastal area of Valiyathura in Thiruvananthapuram district, in southern India’s Kerala state. Officially, 110 families have lost their houses in Valiyathura alone because of coastal erosion and rough seas. Another 100 homes have been damaged in the nearby fishing villages of Poonthura, Panathura and Bimapalli, all in the past five years.

About 200 fisher families now live in government schools that function as temporary relief camps. Three or four families live in a single classroom, sleeping on the floor and cooking inside the same room. Many of them go to the shoreline regularly in the mornings to see the remains of their houses. “We are living in this school for the last five years,” Mini, one of the refugees, said tearfully. “My child does not know how to live in a house, he was born here. We had a three-bedroom house there in the first row of houses on the shore.”

Alphine, also from Valiyathura, has had sleepless nights as she fears losing her home to the eroding shoreline. Ten years ago, when her house was built, it was more than 550 meters (1,800 feet) from the shoreline. Now, it is hardly 3 meters (10 feet) away. “Cracks have already appeared in the doors and windows. We have packed our things and are prepared to run away anytime from here,” Alphine said.

In Valiyathura, the most affected coastline of the district, three rows of houses near the sea have been devastated. Another three rows, about 100 houses, are under severe threat. As in the case of Alphine’s house, most of these already have cracks.

Shankhumugam is one of the most popular beaches in the district. The seawall here is completely broken, and the beach has been eroded by the southwest monsoon, which began in June.

According to the shoreline change assessment for Kerala prepared by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), “a major stretch of Kerala’s coastline (63 percent) is eroding.” The report also says the erosion is highest in Thiruvananthapuram district.

“There are two types of erosion: cyclic and progressive,” D. Ilangovan, senior principal scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa, told Mongabay-India. “One need not worry about cyclic erosion as erosion during the rough season gets balanced by accretion during the calm season in a year. Progressive erosion is the one that has to be addressed as it is continuous. The reason for progressive erosion needs to be assured through scientific studies and appropriate corrective measures can then be taken.”

The erosion in Valiyathura, Poonthura and Panathura seems to be progressive as the beach was not restored. But in Shankhumugam, the erosion is cyclic and the beach gets restored after the rough season.

Sea walls and breakwaters not ideal

Constructing seawalls has been Kerala’s main defense against the drastic erosion. However, it’s proved to be a failure, and experts say these walls can in fact have an adverse effect.

Seawalls are structures built between the water and the land, usually along the coastline, to stop waves hitting the shore and prevent soil erosion. Of the 590-kilometer (367-mile) stretch of Kerala’s coastline, 310 kilometers (193 miles) have seawalls.

K.V. Thomas, a scientist formerly with the Kerala-based Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS), told Mongabay-India that seawall construction was, conversely, one of the factors for the erosion. He said erosion during the monsoon was common; but after the rains, the beach doesn’t get restored, all because of the seawall. The sediments that are washed away don’t come back, he said.

He said the erosion in Thiruvananthapuram district began about 30 years earlier in the Panathura and Poonthura coastal areas. These coasts had pozhi, sandbanks between the sea and backwaters, that were opened seasonally to prevent flooding in the nearby Karamana River. “Thereafter, the government started a stable mechanism to open and close the pozhi,” Thomas said. “A wall was constructed from the river extending to the sea. Since then, beach erosion began in the areas where the wall ended.”

He added that sand mining was also prevalent along the coastal areas of Thiruvananthapuram district: “That was also a reason for the erosion.”

According to Thomas, Valiyathura and Shankhumugam are the most affected beaches because both “lie in between a gap of seawalls.”

“The Valiyathura shoreline exists in between two seawalls that end on its south side and another seawall had started from other side where the people lived in between,” he said. “So it caused an elevation of water level in the gap. That is how we lost hundreds of houses in Valiyathura.”

Cyclone Ockhi in 2017, which claimed more than 200 lives in southern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states, is also believed to have exacerbated the problem. “This year the erosion was severe compared to previous years because the damage that happened during Ockhi could not be repaired due to continued depressions in the sea after the cyclone,” Thomas said.

“We have around 590 kilometers of coastline; I don’t think seawall construction produces the desired effect,” said Oommen V. Oommen, former chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board. “Seawalls and breakwaters are not scientific solutions. Putting a barrier in the coast will destroy the ecosystem. It will deepen the sea.”

He also hinted at a larger environmental concern over sourcing quarry stones for the construction of these walls. “Where do we get these quarry stones to build the seawall? It is by destroying the hills of Kerala. So in a way through this unscientific method we are destroying coastal areas as well as the hills,” he said.

‘Leave the sea to itself’

Oommen said there was a need to give space for the sea to expand and contract.

“Leave the sea to itself,” he said. “Forty-four rivers of Kerala drain into the sea. A considerable amount of soil from the Western Ghats accumulates in the sea. Due to this, beach erosion as well as beach formation happens. We should leave the sea to itself, for its expansion or its contraction.”

The focus should instead be on rehabilitating the fishing community away from the sea, he said. “Just one-tenth of the amount spent on seawalls is required to rehabilitate the people in coastal areas. It is we who have to adapt to the conditions of the sea.”

National Fishworkers Forum general secretary T. Peter said the local communities that understood the sea were being pushed away from the shore, and unscientific human interference was causing a disaster.

“Wherever breakwaters are being built on the west coast, issues like soil erosion are happening,” he said. “In my childhood, during monsoon, I remember waves sweeping away the soil from the shore and naturally creating a wall using this soil in the sea. And then in September, the waves calmed down and brought back the soil. But now due to human interference, this doesn’t happen. Because of breakwaters, the soil that is washed away is not coming back.”

Peter agreed that the seawalls were an issue: “When a seawall is built on one shore, the shore nearby will erode.”

Harbors are yet another reason for erosion, he said, warning that the under-construction Vizhinjam port project in Thiruvananthapuram will cause huge damage to the coastal area.

Thomas, who agreed that harbors caused sea erosion, said the Vizhanjam port might not have an immediate effect, although in the long term it would be harmful and negatively impact the coastal ecosystem. He also said there was an immediate need to strengthen beach nourishment to protect the coastal area.

“The way to protect Valiyathura for the time being is to close the gap between the seawalls, even though it is not a permanent solution,” he said. “That is why we need detailed studies to bring a sustainable solution to these issues. We need to study how to restore the sediments in the beach. Beaches should be divided into sub-cells of 5 kilometers [3.1 miles] where beach nourishment takes place. This will not be an overnight process, but a long-term sustainable plan to address erosion.”

Oommen said natural protection was the only way out. “We need to plant trees and plants in the coastal areas that protect our beaches,” he said. “Only natural remedies can solve the issue, not manmade constructions. Coastal vegetation as well as mangrove plantations can hold the sand in the shore.”

65,65,FF-2018-000079-IDN,"US/China trade war could boost Brazil soy export, Amazon deforestation - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2018/06/us-china-trade-war-could-boost-brazil-soy-export-amazon-deforestation/,"President Donald Trump is pressing hard for a trade war with China. So far, he has imposed $50 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, and threatened another $200 billion; the Chinese are retaliating. An all-out U.S./China trade war could have serious unforeseen repercussions on the Brazilian Amazon, including increased deforestation, intensified pressures on indigenous groups, and escalated climate change.

The concern is that China will shift its commodities purchases, including beef and soy, away from the U.S. to Brazil. The Amazon and Cerrado biomes are already major exporters of both commodities, and are creating a boom in infrastructure construction to bring those products to market. Even without a trade war, experts expect Brazil to edge out the U.S. this year as the world´s largest soy producer.

The U.S. tariffs may already be prompting a shift in trade. Trump first threatened China with tariffs in January. By April, U.S. soy sales to China were down 70,000 metric tons compared to the same period last year. Data also shows a surge in Brazilian Amazon deforestation between February and April of 2018, compared to 2017, a possible response by Brazil soy growers eager to profit from a trade war.

If the U.S./China trade war results in a significant surge in Brazilian commodities production, deforestation rates there could soar. Scientists worry that Amazon deforestation, now at 17 percent, could be pushed past a 20-25 percent climate tipping point, converting rainforest to savanna, greatly swelling carbon emissions, and potentially destabilizing the regional and even global climate.

“We are the ones who care for nature,” says Alessandra Munduruku, a young Munduruku indigenous leader in the Brazilian Amazon. “It isn’t someone coming from on high who’s going to teach us about caring for the forest.” Alessandra first joined her community’s fight for survival when it was threatened with flooding by the São Luiz de Tapajós mega-dam project. Although plans for the dam are shelved for now, Alessandra says the Munduruku still face threats to the survival of their culture and community.

One unexpected menace: President Donald Trump’s bluster over tariffs and trade, which pushed up the price of Brazilian soybeans earlier this year. Since the Amazon region is a hub for soybean production, the price increase could lead to greater deforestation there. Now, with the U.S. already imposing $50 billion in tariffs on China; the Chinese retaliating equally; and Trump threatening another $200 billion in tariffs, an all-out trade war looms. The repercussions of such a war would threaten the Munduruku and the Amazon.

“What affect us directly are the railway, the canal, the ports,” Alessandra says. “There are three [ports] already, and they want to build 20 more.” She is referring to the new transportation infrastructure and grain silos that dot the shore of the Tapajós River, an important Amazon River tributary, and the home territory of the Munduruku. Those silos are filled with soy being transported from Mato Grosso state, in Brazil’s interior.

The expansion of industrial agribusiness, especially beef and soy production, in Mato Grosso and other Amazon states is steadily cutting away at the Amazon rainforest. This, along with the construction of infrastructure to support moving these products to market, is putting increased pressure on indigenous and traditional communities that inhabit the region. Researchers also point to the neighboring, lesser-known Cerrado biome as another deforestation hotspot; it too is home to numerous indigenous groups and site of a Brazilian soy and cattle boom.

Even though Trump´s escalating U.S./China trade war has yet to fully make its international effects felt, it may already be impacting Brazil´s forests negatively. Data from the rainforest monitoring organization Imazon, shows a surge in deforestation between February and April of 2018 compared to last year. That timeline aligns with the President’s first threat of tariffs against China made in January.

In March, Trump officially announced $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods coming to the United States. Beijing struck back by declaring $300 billion in taxes on U.S. products headed to China, including soybeans. As of May 10th, U.S. soybean sales to China were down by roughly 70,000 metric tons compared to the same period last year. This drop suggests that Chinese buyers have been seeking other suppliers just to be safe, no matter whether the trade war is on or off.

Analysts say that Brazil is positioned to replace at least part of the soybeans China ordinarily buys from the U.S. as President Trump provokes the Asian trading giant’s ire. Brazil already expects to ship 56 million metric tons of soybeans to China this year, with the Amazon region and the Cerrado providing much of that amount. This year, experts expect Brazil to edge out the United States as the world´s largest producer of soybeans, growing 117 million tons.

Likely in preparation for a big boost in China/Brazil commodities trade, the Chinese in 2017 offered the Brazilians a $20 billion infrastructure investment fund package, which could pay for new roads, railways and industrial waterways for soy transport – likely leading to more Amazon deforestation and more disruptions of indigenous life.

Experts can clearly point to industrial agribusiness and the global trade in soy as a contributor to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. For example, forest watchdog Imazon correlates a drop in Amazon forest clearing last year to a decrease in commodity prices, including both beef and soybeans. This is the opposite of what is happening currently.

Importantly, Amazon deforestation could trigger significant climate impacts not just in South America, but around the world. Scientists reported in Nature Climate Change that cutting down large numbers of trees in the tropics can adversely affect rainfall patterns in other parts of the world. More sobering still, renowned researchers Tom Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre warned this March that Amazon deforestation, currently around 17 percent, if pushed to 20-25 percent could result in the passing of a climate tipping point that would reduce Amazon rainfall and lead to the conversion of large swathes of rainforest to savanna. That loss of the Amazon’s ability to store vast sums of carbon could dramatically increase greenhouse gas emissions, escalating climate change to dangerous levels.

Still, Jair Schmitt, Director of Brazil’s Department of Forests and Deforestation Prevention, has faith in current protection measures aimed at curbing future deforestation. These include the country’s forest code and the Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement arrived at by agribusiness, environmental NGOs led by Greenpeace, and the government. “Even if the demand for products can influence deforestation, it’s the market itself that is putting restrictions on illegal deforestation,” Schmitt says.

The Soy Moratorium was launched in 2006 with the aim of preventing the spread of new soy plantations into the rainforest, and to directly prevent forest clearing to make way for soy. That agreement has kept new deforestation for soy production to below 1 percent in the Brazilian Amazon, but it hasn’t ended forest clearing.

Critics of the Soy Moratorium say that the agreement contains large loopholes. One example: land thieves clear native forests, move cattle onto the land, then sell those pastures to soy growers, a multi-step process not counted under Soy Moratorium rules. Likewise, with the 2012 Brazilian forest code, which was recently weakened substantially by a Brazilian Supreme Court decision, according to experts.

While the world has shone a spotlight on deforestation in the Amazon, it isn’t the only region where trees are felled for soy. The Cerrado, the vast savanna in north-central Brazil is presently seeing the nation’s most rapid shift from native vegetation to soy, cotton, corn. Dr. Holly Gibbs, a supply-chain researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, calls the Cerrado the new deforestation “hotspot.”

“Soy is a relatively minor cause of deforestation in the Amazon” today, Gibbs says, with “cattle ranching account[ing] for 60-80 percent of the new deforestation.” Yet, because areas initially cleared for livestock can later be transformed to soy fields, that deforestation story isn’t so cut and dry. Adding to that complexity, soybeans also provide important fodder for livestock, enmeshing the two commodities further. Another complication: if Trump’s tariffs result in the Chinese imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. beef, the Chinese might then up purchases of Brazilian beef. China and other Asian nations have seen their beef consumption and imports soar in recent years – more potential bad news for the Amazon.

Gibbs’ research found that even with the Soy Moratorium, more than 600 soybean farms violated the country´s forestry laws and cleared forestland illegally. The study reviewed satellite images of the Amazon gathered between 2001 and 2014 and of the Cerrado between 2001 and 2013. In addition, only 115 of those farms were banned from selling soy because of loopholes in the agreement. The Soy Moratorium only covers the portion of a plantation where soy is grown, and not the entire farm. Loopholes such as this leave wiggle room that allow for more tree removal, say environmentalists.

Conservationists also warn against the rapid expansion of infrastructure needed to ship commodities. New roads, railways and industrial waterways directly cause Amazon deforestation, while also dramatically increasing rainforest access for land thieves, illegal loggers, cattle ranchers, soy growers, mining operations, and new settlers.

One organization that is challenging unregulated agribusiness growth is Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA), the Socio-Environmental Institute, an NGO dedicated to social and environmental justice. ISA’s Rodrigo Junqueira says the prospect of a U.S./China trade war is exciting soybean growers: “[They] are betting that an increase in demand is going to put pressure on the market, and so whatever [legal] restrictions exist will be dropped.

“If the demand increases, and Brazil becomes a more important supplier as a result, soybean cultivation will increase in the Cerrado and the parts of the Amazon that are suitable,” Junqueira maintains. He adds that a surge in global soy demand will almost certainly produce “a territorial dynamic that will lead to new deforestation.”

For Alessandra Munduruku, agribusiness expansion poses an existential threat to the Munduruku people. “The fight is for our land. The fight is for a little bit of land,” she says. “Even if people come to talk [to us] about forest management, capitalism comes to teach you to be ‘sustainable.’ But that mini-capitalism is where individualism begins.” Individualism, she says, with its built-in competiveness, will ultimately lead to the end of the forest, the demise of community-focused indigenous cultures, and to the end of the Munduruku.

One of its key elements is crop insurance, which helps protect farmer income in times of volatile production – for example, when crops are damaged by droughts or floods.

Crop insurance pays farmers who raise major commodities, such as wheat and corn, when crop yields or revenues drop below certain levels. On average, the federal government pays 62 percent of farmers’ crop insurance premiums.

We work together on a climate policy initiative at the University of Illinois from different perspectives that include economics, finance, resource use and disaster relief. In our research, we have found that crop insurance impacts the environment in ways that are important but often overlooked.

While it plays an important role, studies have shown that crop insurance encourages overuse of resources – particularly water – and makes the agricultural system less resilient in the face of climate change. Instead, future research should find ways to encourage farmers to adapt to a changing climate.

Insurance and moral hazard

Crop insurance is the second-largest title in the 2018 Farm Bill, after nutrition aid. The Congressional Budget Office has projected spending on proposed crop insurance programs at US$78 billion over the next 10 years, which represents 9 percent of total farm bill funding.

Insurance changes farmers’ incentives, which in turn might change their behavior. When farmers know they will receive an insurance payout if their crop fails, they may take fewer steps to mitigate that risk, or choose to grow riskier crops. Here are some theoretical examples.

First, being insured should discourage farmers from irrigating their crops as much as they otherwise would. Watering is costly, and the potential for insurance payouts in the event of crop failure reduces the expected benefits of watering.

Insurance companies know this, so policies typically require farmers to demonstrate that they have irrigated a “normal” quantity of water in order to receive payouts. Paradoxically, this approach can encourage farmers to use water just to qualify for crop insurance.

Holding insurance could also impact water use by influencing farmers’ choices of what to plant. Since insurance reduces the cost of failure, it may lead farmers to plant crops with highly variable payouts. If yields are high, farmers reap the benefit; if they are low, farmers don’t bear all of the costs. And if the “risky” crops are more water-intensive, then water use increases.

Mixed impacts

Indeed, as two of us have shown, crop insurance does lead to more irrigation and therefore more water use. One reason is that it leads farmers to grow more water-intensive crops, such as cotton. This response is particularly pronounced across the U.S. South, where farmers have tapped groundwater supplies to irrigate cotton.

Using more water is not a problem if it is consistent with choices farmers would make in well-functioning markets where risk was absent. For example, if some farmers were not growing cotton simply because it was too risky and the price of water reflected its local scarcity, then reducing farming risk by offering crop insurance would benefit society.

Unfortunately, there is a general consensus that agricultural water in many locations is underpriced, which makes increases in water use problematic, especially in water-scarce locations. Farmers already use too much water due to its underpricing, so any additional policies that lead to more water use would compound this market failure.

Crop insurance could also impel farmers to shift to new crops that are nutrient-intensive, which would increase fertilizer use. More nutrient applications lead to more nutrients washing into rivers and streams. Every year, nutrient runoff from Midwest farms flows down the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, creating a massive “dead zone” where fish can no longer thrive due to degraded water quality.

However, a 2016 study that analyzed this question using farm-level information showed that, in fact, crop insurance did not impact nutrient use. This is good news, since it indicates that crop insurance does not contribute to nutrient runoff in our national waterways. It is not clear why crop insurance increases water use but not fertilizer use, although we suspect the answer is price differences between these inputs.

Crop insurance and climate resilience

Still another concern is that farmers with crop insurance might not take enough precautions against extreme weather, since crop losses will be covered. Without insurance, farmers who find that they are no longer able to raise a particular crop at their location might grow something else or move production elsewhere.

To avoid this moral hazard problem, crop insurance is “experience rated,” which means it is more expensive for farms that have experienced large losses in the past. In principle, farmers whose premiums rise after they experience large losses due to extreme weather should take steps such as switching to more resilient crops or shifting to new locations.

However, a 2015 study that examined the impact of crop insurance on corn and soybean farming found that yields in areas with more crop insurance were more sensitive to weather fluctuations. In other words, subsidies for crop insurance appear to create a disincentive for farmers to protect their crops from the consequences of extreme weather events.

This suggests that crop insurance is making our agricultural system less resilient to future changes in the climate than it would otherwise be. Crop insurance also is likely to increase future payouts to farmers – which ultimately are subsidized by taxpayers – in the wake of floods and droughts. For example, the Midwestern corn belt drought of 2012 cost taxpayers $13.4 billion.

Questions for the next farm bill

Neither house of Congress opted to make significant changes to crop insurance in the 2018 farm bill, although some Senators had considered offering amendments to make the largest and wealthiest U.S. growers pay a bigger share of crop insurance premiums. We believe that insurance protects farmers’ livelihoods in times of crop failures, but its less-understood impacts on their decisions about resource use deserve more study. Modifying crop insurance to reduce incentives for unsustainable farming practices could be an effective way to ensure the resilience of our future agricultural system.","Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/224972/original/file-20180626-112634-1vmf35j.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C455%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['crops', 'weather', 'payouts', 'water', 'lead', 'nutrient', 'environment', 'farmers', 'good', 'crop', 'insurance', 'farm']",

By KYAW YE LYNN | FRONTIER

THE GOVERNMENT is stepping up moves to extract more revenue from gold mining companies accused of falling behind in tax payments made in the precious metal.

The No. (2) Mining Enterprise of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation plans to sue companies that have failed to pay the gold tax for several years, its managing director, U Than Daing, told Frontier on June 11.

An audit of more than 300 small-scale gold mining companies by the Union Solidarity and Development Party government in 2013 found that most had failed to pay the gold tax.

The companies were established in 2007 and 2008 when the Ministry of Mines granted permission for gold mines to operate as small businesses in return for agreeing to pay 35 percent of extracted gold as tax, Than Daing said.

“Those small companies had a contract with the government to pay the gold tax each year since 2007-08, but because of flooding or other reasons, they have not paid and year after year the debt in gold has accumulated,” he said.

Than Daing said that because of issues including flooding and the fact some firms were operating in conflict-affected areas, the previous Union Solidarity and Development Party government had written off the debt of about 50 companies.

He said that up to 100 small mining companies still owe the government at least 13,000 ticals, or about 217 kilogrammes, of pure gold, as of June 1. At current prices 217kg of gold is worth about US$9.1 million.

“I think that some of these companies no longer exist, but the debt is still on paper,” he said. “But there are some companies that will not pay even though they are still producing gold; we have been trying to recover the debt from these companies through legal avenues,” he said.

Than Daing said the ministry had launched legal proceedings against some companies over outstanding debts in 2015 and civil cases were underway against at least seven companies.

“We are suing another 10 companies this month,” he said.

Than Daing confirmed that the ministry intended to sue National Prosperity Co Ltd, one of three big mining companies whose operating permits were revoked in February over outstanding gold debt payments.

The ministry says it is owed about 63,000 ounces by National Prosperity, worth about $82 million.

In 2011, National Prosperity won a tender to mine on a 6,105 acre (2,470 hectare) block in the gold-rich Moehti Moemi area of Mandalay Region’s Yamethin Township.

The other two big companies to win tenders in 2011 were Shwe Moe Yan Co Ltd, for an 8,485 acre (3,433ha) block at War Phyu Taung in Mandalay Region’s Yamethin Township, and Geo Asia Industry & Mining Co Ltd, for a 6,726 acre (2,722ha) block at Shwe Minn Phone in Shan State’s Kalaw Township.

The government says that in return for mining rights for five years, NPC agreed to pay 5.577 tonnes of gold, Shwe Moe Yan 5.117 tonnes and Geo Asia, 2.2058 tonnes.

Than Daing said the contract with NPC was revised in 2013 and 2014 after the company said it was unable to meet its debts to the government, but no change was made to its gold tax payment amount.

Despite concessions by the government NPC failed to meet the gold payments agreed in the contracts, Than Daing said, adding that the two other companies also failed to meet their contractual obligations.

“We sent the first letters demanding that NPC and the two other companies suspend all activities late last year,” he said.

“The other two companies followed the instruction, but NPC continued mining and it also ordered protests against the order to suspend operations.”

“We revoked the mining permits of all three companies on February 17; then we terminated NPC’s contract on May 17.”

Than Daing said the main reason for taking action against NPC was because it has produced about five tonnes of gold at Moehti Moemi but had only paid the government about 300 viss, equal to 489.87kg or 1,080 pounds.

The ministry had been consulting with Mandalay Region’s Attorney General’s Office about filing a civil lawsuit against NPC for a month and had also taken some “necessary measures” against the company, he said.

“We asked the Ministry of Home Affairs not to allow the company’s directors to leave the country and we also froze their bank accounts,” Than Daing said.

He said it was possible that Shwe Moe Yan and Geo Asia would be permitted to resume their gold mining operations.

Shwe Moe Yan was trying hard to meet its contractual obligations and the amount of gold in the area being mined by Geo Asia was very small.

“These facts have been reported to the president, who will decide if the companies will be permitted to continue mining,” Than Daing said. “The chance is still there for them to be granted permission to continue their operations,” he said.

NPC chairman U Soe Tun Shein confirmed to Frontier that the company was told of the plan to sue over the non-payment of the gold tax at a meeting with government officials.

He acknowledged that the government had the right to sue under the terms of the contract.

In written correspondence between NPC and the government’s No. (2) Mining Enterprise, seen by Frontier, the company said that when it tendered for the Moehti Moemi block it was estimated by the government to have gold reserves of 38.06 parts per million, but when the mine went into full operation in early 2016, reserves were found to be only 9.01ppm.

The letter, which was written by Soe Tun Shein, said that because the gold content in the ore was four times lower than expected it was impossible for the company to meet the originally contracted payment of 5.557 tonnes of gold over five years.

“The proposal to change the original contract to extend the deadline to give gold was submitted on 29 July, 2016,” the letter, dated June 4, said.

In an interview, Soe Tun Shein told Frontier that the company had “material evidence and human evidence” for its claims.

“We won the contract giving the highest bid believing the gold content mentioned in the contract. We lost because the area does not bear gold as mentioned in the tender,” he said.

Soe Tun Shein said that, according to the contract, the company was required to provide 93 viss of gold per month (about 152kg), but could only realistically provide 60 viss (about 98kg).

“So it is simply impossible for the company to give that amount to the government,” he said.

However, Than Daing said no such data was provided by the government when tenders were called.

“The gold content is not mentioned in tender documents provided by the government. They took the assay result of the Ivanhoe company for granted,” Than Daing said, referring to results from a survey conducted by the Canadian mining giant, which had a 50 percent stake in copper mines in Mandalay’s Monywa Township until 2011.

NPC also accuses the government of having breached the contract when it ordered the suspension of mining operations.

NPC says paragraph 19 of the original contract outlines a dispute resolution process that begins with negotiations and if they fail, to be followed by an investigation involving a board with one representative from each side. If the investigation fails to resolve the dispute, a decision must be made by a tribunal agreed by both sides.

In its letter, NPC says the suspension of mining operations and withdrawal of permission to mine contravene paragraph 19 of the original contract and amount to a miscarriage of rules and regulations.

NPC says its only demand was for the ministry to grant the company more time to pay the gold tax.

In its letter, NPC said it only became aware of the low levels of gold reserves after it had invested significant money for machinery to be installed.

“That is why the company proposed extending the contract to be able to pay the 5.557 tonnes of gold. The company is not refusing to pay gold as agreed in the contract,” it said.

Soe Tun Shein said NPC worked with about 40 other small companies as subcontractors at Moehti Moemi and its total investment in the mining operation exceeded K100 billion.

“After production was suspended we lost K60 million a day,” he said, adding that the mine employed about 5,000 people.

Soe Tun Shein confirmed that all eight members of the company’s board of directors were not allowed to travel abroad.

He said they included U Thiha Zaw Lin, who was “unpleased” with the ministry after being stopped from travelling overseas at the airport and had lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission. “It is unfair because no judge or court has found the company guilty,” Soe Tun Shein said.

“The Ministry of [Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation] sent letters to other ministries and departments telling them to have nothing to do with NPC and its related companies; I think that’s against the law,” he said.

71,71,FF-2018-000079-IDN,How climate change is increasing the risk of wildfires - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/how-climate-change-is-increasing-the-risk-of-wildfires-99056,"The army has been called in to help firefighters deal with a huge wildfire on Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester, where residents have been forced to evacuate. Wildfires are also blazing across Northern California while the issue of bushfires in Australia calls for constant vigilance from the emergency services there. These fires are becoming more common and one of the reasons for this is climate change.

Warmer temperatures in the summer and associated drier conditions desiccate plant materials and create more vegetation litter, providing more fuel for these fires. Several studies have linked the increase of wildfires with climate change in various parts of the world, such as North America and Southern Europe.

For example, a study in California from 2004 found that the warmer and windier weather (brought about by an atmosphere with higher levels of CO2) produced fires that burned more intensely and spread faster in most locations. Despite enhanced firefighting efforts, the number of escaped fires (those exceeding initial containment limits) increased by 51% in the south San Francisco Bay area, 125% in the Sierra Nevada.

University of Dundee

It has also been demonstrated that increases in rainfall during winter and spring – which are also known consequences of climate change – provide more favourable conditions for plant growth and therefore more potential fuel for the fires later in the summer.

Even though climate change increases the vulnerability of dry environments to wildfires, a source of ignition is still required. In the UK, it can be natural (such as bolts of lightning) or caused by man either deliberately or accidentally. Various studies have shown that the number of recreational visits to “risky” sites, such as the English Peak District, increase the occurrence of wildfire.

Human activities have shaped heathlands and moorlands in the UK over the centuries, keeping them open and slowing down the natural succession towards more closed forest habitats. Despite the human impact on their origin, moorlands represent important ecosystems for numerous endangered species including reptiles, insects and birds.

Moorland management

But historic poor management has caused a lot of damage in moorland habitats. The introduction of non-native species for the moor, such as Rhododendron or planted conifers, has affected biodiversity. Overgrazing and drainage has increased the risks of erosion and flooding by reducing vegetation cover and limiting the ability for the soil to absorb precipitations. This, in turn, as lead to an increase in aridity of the habitat – which is the perfect environment for wildfires.

Nowadays, most of the UK’s moorlands are associated with red grouse shooting and are managed in relation to that activity. Procedures include rotational burning and control of predators. Some of these processes are controversial with some environmentalists claiming it can turn the moorland into a “monoculture” of low heather which can be highly susceptible to wildfires. But the evidence on this is not clear and a report by the RSPB found little proof of the negative effect of grouse moor management on biodiversity, flooding and wildfires.

The ecological role of fire

Landscapes and their plant and animal communities are not fixed in time. They are under the influence of dynamic processes that can be recurrent (such as marine tides and seasonal flooding) or catastrophic (volcanic eruptions or storms). Fire – whether natural or man-made – is an important factor that will drive the structure and wildlife composition of ecosystems.

Some areas, such as the Mediterranean region or the African savannah, have been shaped by fire for thousands of years. Plants and animals have evolved to cope with the periodic perturbations due to it. For example, some seeds can only germinate after they have been burnt.

There are even some plants and animals that are contributing in the propagation of wildfires. In Australia, some raptor birds have been observed picking up burning sticks and dropping them in unburned areas to force potential prey out of their burrows.

Despite its destructive power, fire is an important ecological process that can benefit several endangered species by maintaining their habitat. It is an important tool in the management and preservation of heathlands and moorlands in the UK when used appropriately and in a controlled way.

But climate change and human activities increase the vulnerability of those habitats to uncontrolled wildfires and higher population densities near these areas will potentially put more people and houses at risk. In addition to the global battle against climate change, appropriate management procedures are necessary to maintain those habitats and ensure the risks of uncontrolled fires are minimised and the potential spread of them reduced.","Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/225354/original/file-20180628-117436-1cme2fw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C425%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['climate', 'important', 'management', 'increasing', 'uk', 'change', 'wildfires', 'increase', 'fires', 'risk', 'habitats', 'moorlands']",

The prospect of Tottenham Hotspur star Heung-Min Son having to do two years of military service has always concerned the club's fans and mention of it during the World Cup has resurrected that fear.

Son was involved as South Korea lost 1-0 to Sweden in their opening group stage game last Monday and the ITV commentators mentioned the attacker's required two-year military service.

Then the 2-1 defeat to Mexico left the Spurs star in floods of tears with Son's World Cup dream is all but over and that affects what options he now has regarding his military service.

There have been plenty of mixed messages put out about Son and the prospect of him doing that military service back in his native South Korea.

The player himself is reluctant to ever discuss due to any problems that would cause back home due to a massive star looking as if he was trying to skip his national duty. Even requesting delays or finding loopholes is frowned upon as former Arsenal player Park Chu-Young found.

There have been various ages given for when the 25-year-old would have to complete that service. South Korean law says it must be done by 28. Delays have been allowed in the past in certain special cases although as previously stated are not well received by the South Korean public.

South Korean laws indicate that sportsmen who win medals in the Olympic Games or gold medals at the Asian Games are to be handed exemptions from military service, but they still have to do four weeks of basic training.

However, the South Korean team that reached the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup was given a special pardon from the government from military service for their efforts.

So if Son and his team-mates had pulled off a similar, albeit unlikely, achievement on foreign soil then that might have feasibly happened again.

Now that chance appears to be gone, Son's big chance will come at the Asian Games in Indonesia in August where they will need to take home the gold medal.

It's been reported by Goal that Son has reached an agreement with Spurs to play for South Korea in the Asian Games in August.

Tottenham are looking to hand Son a new contract this summer but the prospect of those two years of military service, will of course play its part.

It is new territory for the club as their previous South Korean player, left-back Lee Young-Pyo, was a member of that 2002 World Cup team that earned its special exemption.

Son turns 26 next month so he would have to begin those two years before he turns 28. South Korean players often play for military teams during their service so any new contract would surely need to include some kind of break clause.

There is always the possibility that Tottenham could delay contract talks until after those Asian Games in August so they have a clear picture of the years ahead.

In the mean time Spurs fans will be hoping for a gold medal for the popular South Korean star.

The 15-minute trip usually costs less than one euro, but today I was charged a whopping €5 ($6) — for the fourth time. Not exactly the ""best deal of the city"" — a claim by Ofo, one of several stationless bike-sharing companies who have been flooding Berlin and other major European cities with their brightly-colored bicycles since mid-2017.

From annoying — and costly — technical errors to vandalism, theft and regulation: Dockless bike-sharing in Europe has been plagued with problems so far.

One thing Berlin's four million residents and the 13 million yearly guests can't complain about is a lack of availability — at least in the inner districts

Some 16,000 bikes from no fewer than seven different providers populate Berlin's sidewalks: the four dockless contenders Mobike and Ofo (China), Obike (Singapore), LimeBike (US) and Donkey Republic (Denmark), as well as incumbents Nextbike (dock-based) and Lidl-Bike (dockless).

Tapping into the 'sharing economy' ethic behind Airbnb and ride-hailing apps such as Uber, bicycle-sharing has grown rapidly in recent years, thanks in large part to hundreds of millions of dollars from investors that allowed companies like Mobike and Ofo to wage a costly war of subsidies for market share, both in China and overseas.

The dockless providers' bikes are unlocked with a smartphone app and can be left anywhere for the next user. In Germany's capital, a 20-minute trip on a silver-and-orange Mobike costs €1 ($1.17), while Ofo charges 80 cents for a ride on one of its canary-yellow two-wheelers.

Mobike, founded in January 2015 in Beijing, began its foray into the German market in November of last year by putting 700 of its orange-wheeled, silver frame bikes on Berlin's streets. It claims to have more than nine million bikes in more than 200 cities in 15 countries around the world.

Tough road to profitability

When asked about their ambitions and prospects in the increasingly crowded European market, local representatives of Asian bike-sharing companies are typically confident that demand is high and that their service is well-received.

But critics like market analyst Horace Dediu suspect that Mobike and its competitors won't be able to become profitable just through revenues from rides.

""It's preposterous to expect a significant uptake in dense northern European cities like Berlin and Copenhagen, where bike penetration is already very high,"" Dediu told DW.

Approached by DW, Mobike's general manager in Germany, Jimmy Cliff, said that Mobike ""can be profitable"" with its rental bike business alone. He wouldn't, however, share whether Mobike was profitable in Germany for ""competitive reasons.""

China's bike sharing graveyards Bicycle fields Chinese police have an extra job to add to their workload: collecting unwanted bicycles from parks and pavements, and leaving them in fields outside city centers. The growth of bike sharing has left unintended consequences for local governments.

China's bike sharing graveyards Industry drive Since it rolled in two years ago, bike sharing has become part of daily life in megacities such as Beijing. Officials claim millions of these bikes trundle along the streets of China.

China's bike sharing graveyards Park where you like Bike sharing is designed to be simple and convenient. Users download an app, pay a small fee to unlock a bike — some charge by the hour — and then lock it back up upon reaching their destination. Some cities have designated parking places but many shared bikes can be left anywhere, meaning many are simply abandoned.

China's bike sharing graveyards Lost in the city The strategy of flooding cities with cheap bikes has attracted the wrath of authorities that have to deal with the discarded ones. Chinese industry giants such as Ofo and Mobike compete by offering extremely low prices.

China's bike sharing graveyards Wobbly future While the scheme has proven to be popular with city-dwellers, industry growth far outstrips demand. That has led to widespread abandonment of bicycles. Cities such as Shanghai have introduced regulations to prevent discarded bikes accumulating on sidewalks — but not quickly enough to prevent bicycle graveyards such as the one pictured here.

China's bike sharing graveyards A bike bubble? Critics fear speculation has taken hold, with venture capital funds blowing a bubble of cheap bikes that are not needed and which may never even feel a foot on their pedals. Some companies such as Bluegogo have already had to fold while Chinese authorities are grappling with the daily reality of the problem. Author: Ajit Niranjan



As none of the providers disclose ridership statistics (Mobike's Cliff: ""Our bikes are used multiple times a day""), there's no reliable data about the number of daily users or occupancy rate of the some 16,000 dock-based and free-floating bicycles in Berlin.

China boasts 70 million daily riders and 400 million registered users, thanks in part to subsidies and fares as low as one yuan (€0.29 or $0.15) an hour.

Mixed responses by Berlin cyclists

Milena Strathmann, a German business lawyer who splits her time between Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai and Berlin, says thanks to dockless, on-demand bike-sharing services, she doesn't need to own a bike in each city.

""I appreciate the flexibility I need to keep up my active lifestyle while travelling and working in different cities around the world,"" the 31-year-old told DW. Still, the overall low quality of the bikes, frequent technical hiccups and inconveniences like low saddles ruin part of the experience for the tall German.

Milena Strathmann says she would be willing to pay more for a sustainable service that doesn't compromise quality

Jasper Zimmermann, who commutes to Berlin from the city of Potsdam by bike and subway, prefers to take his own bike on the subway over relying on a rental bike to bridge the last mile between the subway station and his office.

""For me, a bike pass is both cheaper and more convenient than using a service like Mobike,"" he told DW. ""I always know where my own bike is, and don't have to hunt for one.""

In Europe, where the companies have rolled out in cities including London, Paris, Brussels, Manchester and Madrid, city dwellers have been much less welcoming to Asian bike-sharing companies than in China. Singapore-based oBike, for instance, recently pulled out of Zurich after a year of grappling with vandalism and low uptake.

For some time in late 2017, posting destroyed oBikes even became a trend on Instagram.

To be fair, dockless bike-sharing isn't rejected by everyone in Europe. The German Cyclist's Association (ADFC), for instance, says bike-sharing has the potential to reduce congestion and play an ""important role"" in complementing existing public transport infrastructure, among other things. Yet, the ADFC also said companies needed to comply with European laws and guarantee regular maintenance, and that cities are to provide additional, designated parking areas.

As of March, a new regulation stipulates that providers in Berlin must collect or redistribute bikes within 24 hours if more than four of them cluster on Berlin's sidewalks.

The same goes for broken bikes and those blocking foot traffic or access to public transportation. Dorothee Winden, a spokesperson for Berlin's senate, told DW violations could be fined with €3 per bike.

Concerns about data sharing

Aside from doubts about the viability of their business model, critics also suspect that sharing and selling of user data is the Asian providers' primary goal.

""Right now, they try to increase their market share and look at the patterns of behavior on the ground,"" says market analyst Dediu. ""At some point, though, they will commercialize their user data, either through coupons, GPS-based mobile ads or gamified incentives,"" he told DW.

On request by DW, Cliff said Mobike is neither selling any user data to third parties nor does it plan on commercializing it. ""Personal data will always be encrypted and only used for verifying processes, e.g. banking information,"" he told DW in an email. Mobike does, however, collect and analyze GPS data for internal use. Both Mobike and Ofo, which have raised more than $2 billion in venture capital, claim they have roughly 200 million users each globally.

Data will likely play an increasingly important role in the crowded bike-sharing business down the road. Asian bike-sharing companies are backed by major Chinese tech firms including heavyweights Tencent and Alibaba which rely heavily on data to place ads in their competing all-in-one online-services ecosystems

Will the winner take it all?

At this point, nobody can predict if and when bike-sharing will become economically viable. The winner(s) could be those with the most venture capital — in other words: those who can afford to stay unprofitable the longest.

""The typical demands on that capital are for 'all or nothing,'"" market analyst Dediu said. ""Therefore, bets will be increasingly wild in the hope of finding a natural monopoly.""

Still, he predicts a withdrawal of some providers within a year, both due to market forces like low consumer demand (in the EU) and regulatory decisions (in the US).

""Ultimately, only high-end products will stand a chance. If providers compromise user experience, consumers and regulators will reject them,"" Dediu say. ""Around 2020, we'll likely have two to three large players and a few more local ones per country.""

For my part, I didn't reject Ofo in spite of being overcharged four times in two days. After I explained what had happened, they promptly promised a full refund.","Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/44293165_6.jpg,"['market', 'europe', 'dockless', 'faces', 'battle', 'mobike', 'bike', 'sharing', 'companies', 'cities', 'data', 'bikes', 'berlin', 'bikesharing', 'uphill', 'ofo']",

78,78,FF-2018-000079-IDN,China's water wars - East Asia Forum,https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/06/28/chinas-water-wars/,"Author: Scott Moore, University of Pennsylvania

China is often thought of as a country that suppresses internal conflicts, usually to great effect. But there are a number of notable exceptions and, of these, conflicts over water are perhaps the most intriguing. While China is by some definitions water-scarce, its domestic and international water conflicts are driven not by scarcity per se but by the impact of China’s rampant economic growth.

Total water availability in China stands at about 2000 cubic meters per person per year — around one-third of the global average. According to one estimate, China faces a shortfall of some 200 billion cubic meters of water annually, due mostly to increasing industrial and urban water demand. But these figures mask considerable regional differences. Most of the provinces where water demand exceeds its supply sit astride the rapidly growing eastern seaboard.

Even more serious is the issue of water pollution, which affects some 85 per cent of major urban waterways and about 80 per cent of tested groundwater in China. Large-scale urbanisation is also seriously damaging China’s aquatic ecosystems like lakes and wetlands, and is dramatically increasing flood risk.

These changes are setting the stage for a growing number of water conflicts between China’s sub-national jurisdictions, and may portend more difficult relations with its neighbours as well.

China’s domestic water conflicts typically take the form of disputes between sub-national units like provinces and prefectures. These conflicts arise over a number of issues like dam and hydropower development, but they most commonly pertain to some form of inter-jurisdictional water pollution.

Domestic water conflicts can provoke civil unrest. In a landmark incident in 2001, residents of the city of Jiaxing in Zhejiang province who were fed up with pollution flowing downstream from neighbouring Jiangsu province sunk a number of old boats in the two provinces’ shared waterway to form a makeshift dam, which backed up the polluted water across the border.

China’s internal water wars have the potential to pose significant problems for China’s political system, which is set up to ensure local officials pursue centrally formulated priorities rather than their own. There are relatively few mechanisms to encourage cooperation between neighbouring jurisdictions on issues of shared concern.

Beijing has recently undertaken a number of wide-ranging reforms intended to address the problem of inter-jurisdictional water disputes. A number of regulations have been issued over the past decade to clarify how such disputes are handled, and several provinces have set up ‘dialogue mechanisms’ to try to prevent and resolve such disputes.

But the overwhelming preference of China’s leaders is for a more hierarchical solution, such as the recently established ‘river and lake chief’ system (hezhang). Under this system, China’s local officials are vested with specific responsibilities for ensuring adherence to water quality and other water-related policy measures within their jurisdictions.

The problem with this approach is that issues like pollution and flooding require broad cooperation between officials and residents of neighbouring regions that cannot easily be encouraged by fiat. Decades of research and examples from across the globe show that durable, effective cooperation over shared resources like water requires inclusive institutions that bring interested parties together — the exact opposite of the vertical hierarchy that currently shapes the governance of water and almost everything else in China.

The importance of building good institutions is even greater at the international level, where outside actors can play an important role in fostering cooperation between countries that otherwise might not see eye-to-eye over contentious issues like water. Mistrust over shared rivers remains high between China and its neighbours, especially India and Vietnam, which for different reasons fear the downstream impacts of dam-building and water diversions being planned or undertaken by China.

Outside observers have noted these projects with alarm for some time, especially with respect to China’s transboundary rivers. Indian strategist Brahma Chellaney attracted widespread attention for his contention in 2014 that these rivers are destined to become ‘Asia’s new battleground’.

It is true that China has often been dismissive of its neighbours’ concerns that construction of large dams may negatively impact downstream fisheries, flood risk and other matters. But in some cases China has been a constructive neighbour, for instance in helping to establish the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism as an alternative to the ineffectual Mekong River Commission.

If China’s reputation as a ‘hydro-hegemon’ that seeks to control Asia’s water resources by exploiting its dominion over the headwaters of many of the continent’s major rivers is indeed a misrepresentation of its intentions, China’s internal divisions over water are at least partly to blame for this perception.

China’s peculiar blend of political centralisation and fiscal decentralisation gives sub-national officials an incentive to pursue grand infrastructure projects, regardless of their implications for China’s neighbours. The dam-building projects in particular — which are the source of many international transboundary water conflicts between China and its neighbours — appear to largely reflect the economic self-interest of individual jurisdictions rather than grand geopolitical objectives.

According to one analysis, jurisdictions that build dams experience a 16 per cent increase in revenue. Fieldwork evidence has also concluded that local officials are often motivated to support dam construction projects because of their contribution to local economic growth.

While there’s no question that China isn’t always the ideal riparian neighbour, parochial rather than hegemonic interests appear to better explain China’s behaviour on Asia’s transboundary waterways.

The last approach focuses on improving the welfare of those who reside within or near the peat ecosystem through sustainable peat management. The livelihood revitalisation is important to ensure the success of restoration in the long run, given that local communities will only protect the ecosystem when they consider it valuable for their lives.

In many peatland villages, the livelihood options might include the utilisation of commercially worthy native peat commodities. One of the popular commodities in Sumatera is purun (Lepironia articulata), a peat sedge plant easily found in peat swamp areas in Indonesia and neighboring countries (e.g. Thailand and Malaysia).

In many villages within the province of South Sumatra, a priority province for peatland restoration, purun has traditionally been utilised as raw materials for homemade crafts, mostly mats, by several communities living near peatlands.

Purun weaving is culturally significant to many South Sumatran peat communities, for example to those living in Pedamaran, a sub-district with substantial extent of peatland. Here, woven purun mats are regularly used at celebrations of key life events, such as the use of plaited purun mats as container for newborns’ placentas, bedding for newlyweds’ first night, and cover for corpses during burial ceremony.

The skill of purun weaving, carried out daily by the women of Pedamaran, is traditionally passed down from one generation to the next.

Our preliminary research at Pedamaran finds that besides its cultural significance, purun also provides additional economic benefits to the local communities, especially women.

The mats from Pedamaran are commonly sold in other villages and major cities, even outside of the province, mostly through the middlemen or middlewomen. A weaver may make 30 to 90 mats in a month and usually receives between IDR 5,000 and 8,000 for one mat, depending on the sise.

The income from weaving and selling mats is used to help their husbands and sustain the household’s daily needs, such as grocery shopping, children’s allowance, and for women’s personal needs.

By acquiring additional income to their family, female purun weavers report they feel better positioned in their household’s decision-making process.

For them, purun weaving also works as a safety net, especially when other livelihood options (e.g. rice farming and working at the oil palm concessions are not available or restricted to them.

Despite the potential of purun weaving to increase the welfare of women in the village, several challenges need to be addressed by the Government of South Sumatra, potentially in collaboration with non-governmental organisations and the private sector.

Firstly, according to the purun harvesters, the supply of raw materials (i.e. harvested purun plants) has been decreasing recently as a result of peat degradation and land conversion.

Due to peat’s complex hydrological system, the peat conversion into oil palm plantations via land-clearing and massive draining will lead into some parts of the peat swamps being dry while others submerged in perennial flooding (see Sumarga et al. 2016).

The weavers are worried about the lack of supply not only because they might lose their income, but also because some local wisdom and norms associated with purunweaving could be lost. For them, purun mats are also an identity which cannot be replaced by other types of mats.

Secondly, another key issue faced by weavers is the limited capital access. Current economic circumstances drive them to borrow money from the middlemen via the panjar, which requires the weavers to pay off their loans with the mats they produced at a substantially low price.

The system has contributed to the low bargaining power of the weavers. Improving their access into more equitable and sustainable financing mechanisms (e.g. microloans) can go a long way.

Lastly, we observe a knowledge gap between market demands and the existing supply. Most weavers only plait the cheapest, simplest mats, because they are easier to make and can sell fast.

“ With the right training and innovative marketing tools, purun weaving can become an even better livelihood option for Pedamaran women.

Some of these are considered inferior goods, such as the drying mats for agricultural products and the funeral mats. Meanwhile, the highest quality purun mats are still rarely produced, because many of the weavers thought that such products have limited market potential given the higher price.

Our preliminary market assessment for purun products in Jakarta and Palembang (the capital of South Sumatra) suggests that the demand for high quality and value-added purun products is quite large, as more than 80 per cent of the respondents desired products with good design and best quality.

Thus, purun-based creative products, such as stylish handbags, can be sold at higher prices at approximately IDR 50,000 to IDR 100,000 each. Additionally, there is also a niche market for ‘green’ handicrafts, befitting the profile of products made of locally-sourced purun. A global study published by Nielsen (2015) indicates that there is a growing interest towards green products, especially among the millennials.

The respondents aged 15-20 in Nielsen survey willing to pay more for green products increased from 55 per cent in 2014 to 72 per cent in 2015. To tap into these environmentally conscious buyers, the weavers can widen their horizon in looking for design inspiration and creative weaving techniques.

With the right training and innovative marketing tools, purun weaving can become an even better livelihood option for Pedamaran women.

Further, by strengthening the enabling factors, e.g. the protection of peatland ecosystems, the preservation of traditional purun weaving knowledge, and the equitable financing of capitals, purun weaving can thrive, therefore supporting BRG’s efforts to restore degraded peatlands in South Sumatra.

Fonterra is facing fresh questions about whether it is contributing to deforestation in Indonesia.

Greenpeace has alleged Fonterra's supplier of palm kernel expeller (PKE), Singaporean food giant Wilmar International, was closely associated with a plantation firm called Gama that it has accused of engaging in large-scale deforestation in Western New Guinea in Indonesia.

The environmental group said Gama was run by senior Wilmar executives and family members and it had photographic evidence that the company had destroyed at least 21,500 hectares of forest in Indonesia – an area more than twice the size of Lake Wanaka, New Zealand's fourth largest lake.

Greenpeace said Gama was set up by Wilmar co-founder Martua Sitorus and his brother Ganda in 2011 and alleged that Wilmar and Gama had for years ""worked together, with Gama doing the dirty work so Wilmar's hands appeared to stay clean"".

* Fonterra PKE supplier banned after forest fires

Wilmar sold three plantations to Gama between 2004 and 2014 following accusations against those plantation of deforestation, social conflicts with villagers, and of receiving palm products from illegal plantations within a national park, it said.

New Zealand imported a near-record 2.1 million metric tons of PKE, with a retail value of about $500 million, to use as an animal feed last year.

Wilmar – which also owns well-known Kiwi brands such as Chelsea sugar and Vogels – has a joint venture with Fonterra called International Nutritionals which is responsible for importing about 30 per cent of that total.

Wilmar appeared to acknowledge overnight on Monday that it may have sourced palm products from Gama, while also seeking to distance itself from the company.

​Wilmar released a written statement saying that it had ceased sourcing palm products from ""all suppliers that are allegedly associated with Gama Corp"" last Wednesday.

DAVID UNWIN/STUFF Agriculture and Food Safety Minister Damien O'Connor has suggested farmers may turn away from PKE without an actual ban.

""Wilmar will not buy from any company that cannot prove to our satisfaction that they do not belong to Gama Corp because of the alleged identified non-compliance with Wilmar's No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation Policy.""

The family ties with Gama were acknowledged by Wilmar in its statement, but it denied the thrust of Greenpeace's accusation that it had conspired with the company.

""Wilmar and Gama Corp are two separate corporate groups, operating independently of each other. Wilmar has no control, management or otherwise, over Gama Corp,"" it said.

""Wilmar executives with familial ties with Gama Corp do not hold any decision-making power or influence on Wilmar's sustainability policy,"" it said.

Fonterra spokesman Chris Mirams was unable to immediately confirm whether Fonterra's joint venture with Wilmar had been supplied with PKE from Gama's plantations.

Fonterra required all its vendors of palm products avoid deforestation, peatland destruction and exploitation, he said.

""As a matter of process, we will check with Wilmar that the information they have provided us previously is up to date and accurate.""

In April, Fonterra acknowledged it was concerned by allegations from human rights groups that paramilitary police routinely hosted by Wilmar on its palm plantations had been engaged in acts of brutality, including the shooting of two people with rubber bullets in December.

GREENPEACE NZ imported a near-record 2.1 million metric tons of PKE to use as an animal feed last year.

Wilmar said the pair were shot by members of Indonesia's Brimob police brigade to defend one of its security guards during a violent confrontation over palm fruit thefts from one of its plantations.

In 2016, Malaysian plantation owner IOI admitted earlier illegally clearing 141ha of land in West Kalimantan in Indonesia that Greenpeace identified as a habitat for endangered orangutans and Bornean gibbons.

IOI was a supplier to Wilmar – and hence, potentially to Fonterra – at the time.

Greenpeace's sustainable agriculture spokeswoman Gen Toop said its latest investigation meant Fonterra would take another hit to its international reputation.

She called on the company and Kiwi farmers to stop using PKE and to ""re-focus onto pasture based dairying and farm fewer cows"".

""These are the first steps towards transforming New Zealand's dairy industry to regenerative farming which is the direction we need to be going.""

Lewis Road Creamery chief executive Peter Cullinane has called for a ban on PKE imports.

WIKIPEDIA Wilmar has confirmed it routinely hosts members of Indonesia's Brimod police brigade on its plantations to prevent the theft of palm fruit, which human rights campaigners say is often actually linked to land disputes with villagers.

But Agriculture and Food Safety Minister Damien O'Connor suggested in April that the farming industry might turn away from using PKE without government intervention.

O'Connor also indicated he had not yet made up his mind whether the mandatory labelling of palm oil in food for human consumption was warranted.

The Primary Industries Ministry is considering whether there should be mandatory labelling of palm oil, which is an ingredient in a large variety of foods, to help consumers avoid the ingredient if they chose.

However, there are no clear signs of progress since a technical evaluation report was published in May last year.","Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/q/i/r/i/9/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1qiazi.png/1530140165894.jpg,"['oil', 'plantations', 'deforestation', 'questions', 'gama', 'palm', 'fonterra', 'allegations', 'wilmar', 'pke', 'greepeace', 'corp', 'products']",

A common issue with flats is the limited space, but you can work around this by decorating with mirrors. Look for a central location to place your mirror, put it near a light source, or position it across a window to make it seem like another one.

Before anything else, decide first on the design style. This is the perfect time to explore how your flat will embody your personality or even personal style. Whether you’re going for modern, minimalist, industrial, Scandinavian, Bohemian, or eco-friendly, settle on a theme to maintain design harmony and also make it easier for you to pick the pieces that will populate your rooms.

Designing an apartment isn’t just about deciding which colours go well together or shopping for matching pieces. You have to consider various factors that will make or break the look and the feel of your apartment. To get you started on this long and often complicated process, here are some tips on how to design your living area, bedroom, and bathroom.

Neutral colours make the space look neat and wide

Living Area (continued) Neutral and soft colours can also help with this issue. When light hits the walls, it creates an illuminated look that gives off the illusion of space.

Tall bookshelves also highlight the room's vertical dimension

Living Area (continued) If horizontal space is a bit tight, try inspecting the vertical dimension. You can put up small artworks vertically along the walls or hang floor to ceiling drapes to make the most of the height.

This bedroom prioritises comfort by keeping it simple and neat

Bedroom Once you enter the bedroom, you leave all your worries behind. Therefore, the focus of your design should be bringing in as much comfort as possible. One sure-fire way to achieve this is by keeping the layout simple. Avoid cluttering your bedroom with things that do not have anything to do with sleeping or relaxing.

Those storage spaces underneath the wall-mounted bench eliminate the need for bulky wardrobes

Bedroom (continued) If space is also an issue, consider using modular furniture. You can go for a bed that has drawers underneath or a simple worktable that doubles as a dressing table instead of the usual items.

The bathroom should be a place you can completely unwind in | Furnishings by Kaldewei

Bathroom Most people neglect the bathroom because it’s not exactly a livable space like other parts of the house. But if the bedroom is a place to relax, the bathroom should be your private sanctuary. You will want to populate it with elements that will energise you as you start your day and help you calm down as you turn in for the night.

These small potted plants give life to a small and practical space

Bathroom (continued) Bring nature into your bathroom by decorating with plants. If you have space on the countertops, you can place small potted plants. The corners of the room can also be accentuated with plants that grow vertically, like bamboo. If you have a tub and want to make it as cosy as you can, a vase of orchid should do the trick. If you want to be bold, you can hang some plants from curtain hooks or rods.

Climate is changing, whether US President Donald Trump believes it or not. What used to be inconvenient truths are now incontrovertible facts.

Some facts according to the US Global Change Research Programme Climate Science Special Report (2017): The global average surface air temperature has increased by about one degree Celsius over the last 115 years (1901—2016). This period is now the warmest in modern history.



World average sea level has risen by about 17-20 centimetres since 1900, with almost half of the increase (about 7 centimetres) happening since 1993. Thousands of studies by researchers around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric and oceanic temperatures as well as melting glaciers, diminishing snow cover, shrinking sea ice, rising sea levels, ocean acidification and increasing atmospheric water vapour.



“Local media coverage is largely confined to traditional disaster reporting of casualties, physical destruction and damage to property, as it should be. But there is little contextual reporting and explanation of why these natural disasters are happening more often and more violently” Crispin Maslog

Human activities, especially greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions, are the main cause of global warming since the middle of the 20th century. Climate change, if left unchecked, threatens the survival of humans, especially the mini island nations of the Asia-Pacific region, some of which are only three meters above sea level.

Abundant disaster reporting, insufficient context

What is the role of media, science media in particular, and journalism schools in general, in addressing this problem? What are Asia-Pacific’s mass media and journalism educators doing about this threat?

It is heartwarming to note that mass media are aware of the climate change phenomenon and its implications for the region and the planet. Media organisations do report extensively on the problem. There is abundant and competent coverage of climate change events like typhoons, floods, droughts and forest fires by international media organisations like SciDev.Net, Pacific Media Centre in Auckland, CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera.

Specifically, local media coverage is largely confined to traditional disaster reporting of casualties, physical destruction and damage to property, as it should be. But there is little contextual reporting and explanation of why these natural disasters are happening more often and more violently. This is a sentiment shared by CNN Philippines senior editor and journalism professor Jose Carlos.



“I tend to agree,” Carlos tells SciDev.Net. “There are more disaster narratives, fewer stories on how people in various strata of society are being affected, and how they are adapting or finding solutions. There is also less focus on the Philippines’ role and responsibilities under UN climate change negotiations. Most often, climate change as a news subject in the Philippines, is treated as part of ‘disaster reportage’ or ‘doomsday scenarios’.”



Carlos adds: “Journalists, academe and NGOs have varying verdicts on media reporting. The Philippine Network of Environmental Journalists says coverage is generally poor, but it’s improving. Academe is unhappy. (They say) media coverage on disaster risk stories is mostly event or incident-oriented, lacks backgrounding, has insufficient contextualisation.”

A media educator from Indonesia, Hermin Indah Wahyuni of the Centre for South East Asian Social Studies, also tells SciDev.Net: “Climate change issues have been shaking up countries worldwide, but Indonesia is among the least concerned. The coverage by the country’s mass media of environmental problems occupies only a small proportion of total media reports, regardless of the fact that Indonesia is facing some serious environmental problems, such as deforestation, haze disaster, droughts, floods. . .”

Journalism education and climate change

Disaster reporting, which focuses on deaths and casualties for the benefit of local readers, is understandable. However, the mass media also need to explain in depth the causes of climate change. Contextual climate change reporting can be taught to journalists by journalism schools if they have enough trained faculty and resources.



But Asia-Pacific journalism schools are not able to do this, to cite a paper we published in the Pacific Journalism Review (2017), which was based on a small survey of 20 schools in the region. (1)

The impression we got from the survey and based also on our experience is that formal science and environmental education and training in the region are thin and limited. In our experience, journalists who have taken formal courses in science and environmental journal­ism are rare, and schools offering courses or programmes in science and environmental reporting are even rarer.



Some of them are Beijing Normal University, East China Normal University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China; and University of the Philippines Los Baños and Silliman University in the Philippines

.Furthermore, the schools offering science journalism courses lack qualified faculty. There was awareness of climate change as an important issue but the capacity to offer science journalism courses was missing.The schools we surveyed agree that enough attention is being paid to the status of climate change refugees and the human rights issues involved. They also agree that Asia-Pacific mass media are keeping up with science, “but this is not a particularly dramatic story to cover except when there are disasters”.

There is a vacuum in formal science and environmental education in the Asia-Pacific region. In the absence of formal science education for journalists, we have noted the phenomenon of non-formal or non-degree trainings on science journalism and climate change reporting conducted by international communication organisations/NGOs and development agencies such as the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) and the Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (AMIC). National governments’ departments or ministries of science and technology, and of environment and natural resources, also engage in such training.



In addition to this, we have seen a trend for the mass media industry itself to conduct training programs which are more tailored to its needs. In the short-term, this is probably a more practical way to go in terms of climate change journalists’ training. Formal degree programmes require too much time and resources.



But for the long-term, there is a need for a wide-scale, systematic upgrading of the science communication/science journalism training programmes in the universities with the help of UN agencies like UNESCO.
