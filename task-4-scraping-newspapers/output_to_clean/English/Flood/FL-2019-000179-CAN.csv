People captured images of Tuesday's downpours and flooding on their mobile phones, posting images on social media, including scenes of cars submerged by flood waters.

In one dramatic video, a man on a bulldozer pulls the lifeless body of a little girl out of the water in a flooded area in northern Sharqia Province as shouts and screams are heard in the background. Another video shows a policeman, steps away from the presidential palace in Cairo's district of Heliopolis, wading into a flooded street to unclog a sewage drain.

Authorities closed schools and universities in the greater Cairo area Wednesday and companies saw only skeletal staff show up at work. Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly said school closures were limited to the greater Cairo area, including Giza and Qalioubia, as more rainfall was expected in the next couple of days, according to the country's weather service.

The mayhem raised questions about Cairo's ability to deal with such heavy rains as the city's infrastructure and sewage and drainage systems have suffered from years of poor maintenance.

People took to social media to criticize the government's lack of preparedness. Cairo, a city of some 20 million people, has been left for decades in neglect and decay, particularly its overcrowded neighborhoods.

Hashtags like “(hash)Egypt is sinking” were trending on social media, attracting many videos and pictures of the most affected areas in Cairo and elsewhere.

Five deaths occurred in the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia, Gharbia and Kafr el-Sheikh, according to the Interior Ministry. Three of the victims, including two children, were electrocuted. The other two victims died falling from the rooftops of their flooded homes.

Local authorities in northern Sinai also reported two deaths. Moataz Taher, head of the el-Hassana municipality, said in a statement that a 47-year-old farmer and his 13-year-old daughter died early Wednesday in the flooding.

In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, the heavy rain caused a three-story building to collapse Wednesday, killing a 7-year-old child and injuring her 19-year-old brother, according to the city's civil protection authority.

In Cairo, the eastern suburb of Nasr City was hit the hardest, but so was Heliopolis, located near Cairo's international airport. The government said the two suburbs had received at least 650,000 cubic meters cubic feet of precipitation in just 90 minutes on Tuesday, overwhelming the city's sewage and drain systems.

Trucks fanned out across Cairo to drain water from flooded areas. A key highway connecting Cairo to other provinces was closed, the state-run al-Ahram daily reported.

EgyptAir said it had delayed some fights on Tuesday because passengers were stuck on the roads and unable to get to the airport. A part of the old Cairo airport terminal which has been under renovation was also flooded, with footage on social media showing rainwater pouring into the hallway.

The Civil Aviation Ministry said that terminal was only being used by a private carrier for one or two flights a day and shared photos of it after it was cleaned up.","Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-10/AP_19296482191882.jpg,"['sewage', 'rains', 'day', 'social', 'dead', 'cairos', 'media', 'including', 'city', 'heavy', 'flooded', 'citys', 'chaotic', 'flooding', 'cairo', 'egypt']", ,flood

Several people have died since heavy rains and flooding began to paralyse Egypt‘s capital, Cairo, and other cities two days ago.

Al-Watan newspaper reported on Thursday that nine people had been killed in at least four cities, with most of the victims, including children, dying from electrocution by power cables that were submerged by floodwaters.

The Associated Press news agency, meanwhile, put the death toll at 11, citing updated statements released on Thursday by police departments and hospitals in governorates that were most affected by the downpours.

In the capital, the rains and the flooding, which started on Tuesday, also caused enormous traffic jams and prompted authorities to close schools and universities in the Greater Cairo area on Wednesday.

In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, the heavy rain caused a three-story building to collapse, killing a seven-year-old child and injuring her 19-year-old brother, according to the city’s civil protection authority.

Tuesday’s rainfall in Alexandria was reminiscent of the deadly flooding in 2015, which killed five people and led to the resignation of then-Governor Hani el-Mesery.

Thunderstorms are not unusual at this time of the year, but a persistent circulating storm low is rare.

The forecast for the weekend shows the responsible low-pressure centre deepening a little and generating significant thundery rain. Areas most at risk from flooding and lightning strike include Alexandria, Port Said and the north of the Sinai Peninsula.

There are two large-scale influences on the weather that are currently in phase over eastern Africa: firstly, the waters of the Indian Ocean are warmer than usual off the African coast; and secondly, a wave in the upper atmosphere, known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is encouraging any thunderstorms or areas of low pressure to deepen.

These two have contributed to the recent flooding in Kenya, with the MJO likely to have strengthened the downpours in Egypt.","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4595380bd47a46afb03bb1a3822006ce_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['rises', 'low', 'rains', 'alexandria', 'thundery', 'killed', 'toll', 'rain', 'heavy', 'mjo', 'death', 'flooding', 'cairo', 'egypt']", ,flood

Sirius played a significant role in every aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, a role that carried on well into the 20th century, because its heliacal rising in mid-August each year was the signal from the natural world that the mighty river Nile was about to flood. At the heliacal rising of Sirius, people would move off the flood plain to make way for the river, which would rise up to 46 feet in some places!

The ‘heliacal rising’ is the first appearance of a bright star in the morning sky, before sunrise. It’s a word that derives from Helios, the Greek God of the Sun who bore the Sun through the sky in his golden chariot.

The Ancient Egyptian Sun God was Ra, who was credited with the creation of all forms of life.

In Ancient Egyptian culture there were two calendars for measuring the cycle of the year: the solar calendar of Ra; and the calendar used for measuring the return of Sirius. The year itself was divided into three seasons, based on the rhythmic return of Sirius.

There is no appreciable rain fall in Egypt, and this, coupled with population growth and technological advances, eventually led to the building of the Aswan Dam, which opened in 1970, causing the annual flood cycle of the Nile to come to an end.

The Aswan High Dam was opened in 1970, and centuries of Nile River flooding ceased.

Still, Sirius continues to rise, and ceremonies celebrating the annual flood still occur, which is understandable, given that the dam is not quite 50 years old, but the cultural life inspired by the Nile’s annual flooding has existed through all ages of recorded history, and was rooted in the stars.","Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4c8b9f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x337+0+240/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwiaa%2Ffiles%2F201908%2Ffullsizeoutput_4720.jpeg,"['heliacal', 'sirius', 'river', 'annual', 'week', 'storytellers', 'flood', 'rising', 'star', 'night', 'flooding', 'dam', 'sky', 'nile']", ,none

CAIRO – 4 May 2018: As Egypt’s climate changes, heavy rainfall is becoming more and more common, bringing dangerous flash floods. Flash flooding can make the dry ground become saturated in an instant, allowing torrents of water to rush down mountains like a waterslide, wiping away cities.



According to a report issued by the Ministry of Irrigation, 11 governorates in Egypt are potentially vulnerable to flood risks, including Aswan, Luxor, Qena, Asyut, Sohag, Beni Suef, New Valley, and South and North Sinai.



The report also showed that the Red Sea and Suez governorates are included among the risk zones that may be exposed to floods. Even New Cairo, Helwan and Maadi are identified among the risk zones.



The Delta region is also at risk of torrential rain, but not to the level of being flooded. Sewer networks are needed to discharge rainwater, the report explained, adding that some towns are built on areas that are vulnerable to flood because of the limited available space in the Nile Delta governorates.



The report warned citizens not to encroach outfall facilities by building urban buildings without obtaining the appropriate licenses from the state agencies.



Egyptian Meteorological Authority Chairman Ahmed Abdelaal stated that the heavy rains that recently hit Egypt resulted from climate change, which is affecting the whole world.



Rainfall throughout the capital caused some buildings, houses and bridges to collapse; other governorates such as Suez, Ain Sokhna and Ismailia were also affected.



Climate change and its far-reaching impact is currently the subject of numerous discussions worldwide.



Egypt is an ideal example of a developing country that is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and faces numerous threats to its economic, social and environmental sustainability, including energy, water and food security.

5,5,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How Volcanoes Caused Violent Uprisings in Cleopatra's Egypt - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/volcanoes-Nile-flood-climate-Egypt,"Twenty-three hundred years ago, when Euclid and Archimedes wandered Alexandria, and Cleopatra's family controlled the Egyptian throne, revolts and territorial disputes were common. These uprisings have often been attributed to ethnic tensions over Greek rule—the Ptolemaic dynasty, of which Cleopatra was the last ruler, was of Macedonian origin.

A new study published in the journal Nature Communications by an unusual team of historians, statisticians, and climate scientists suggests another surprising factor may also have played a role in the region's unrest: “hydroclimatic shocks” triggered by faraway volcanic eruptions.

""There's a school of thought that what really drives history are the decision of great leaders—the kings, the emperors, the popes,"" says co-author Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. ""I think part of what this paper shows is that you can't just brush off influences from the environment.""

Until the late 19th century, when the first dams were built on the Nile River, Egyptian farmers were utterly dependent on the annual monsoon. The heavy summer rains it brought to the Ethiopian highlands would push the Nile over its banks downstream, prepping the land for planting wheat and other crops. The Nile floods are so important they’ve been recorded accurately since 622 AD.

Ludlow and his colleagues have found that massive volcanic eruptions, whose fallout is recorded in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, are associated with failures of the Nile floods. The team’s climate modeling indicates that the clouds of sulfurous gases from the eruptions not only cool the Earth, by reflecting sunlight back toward space, but also cause a drop in tropical monsoon rainfall, sometimes for years.

Systematic flood records hadn’t yet begun to be kept in the Ptolemaic period, which extended from 305 B.C. to Cleopatra's death in 30 B.C. But written records make it one of ancient Egypt's most richly documented periods, with the Rosetta Stone detailing priestly proclamations, and lengthy notes on papyrus confirming wars, uprisings, land transfers, and family squabbles.

The unrest reflected in those written records can be linked to the eruptions recorded in the ice cores, the researchers find.

In this region, ""once you go in a few kilometers from the coast, there is no rainfall— you're effectively in Saharan territory,"" Ludlow says. ""When there's not a sufficient flood, you get food insecurity. People start to abandon land. They migrate to urban areas seeking food. That increases tensions, food riots. And all of this you can trace.""

An Eruptive Period

The research was the brainchild of Joe Manning, a Yale University history professor, and Ludlow. Manning, a mountaineer and rock climber, was interested in paleoclimatology and started hosting informal gatherings of historians and climate experts. One evening, after a few glasses of wine, Manning and Ludlow, who was then also at Yale, started talking about volcanoes.

Ludlow opened his computer and showed Manning data from recent ice cores. Those data allow scientists to peg the dates of major eruptions almost to the year, going back 2,300 years.

""I thought, 'some of those spikes look awfully familiar,'"" recalls Manning, the study's lead author and an expert in the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The planet during the last century has largely escaped significant eruptions. But explosions on the scale of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo disaster—the biggest in modern times—sometimes occurred two or three times a decade during the Ptolemaic period. Manning recognized some of the dates as periods of important uprisings.

After further research, the team showed that internal uprisings repeatedly came in the wake of these eruptions, sometimes peaking the second year. The authors suspect some of the lag time could reflect short-term coping efforts, such as Cleopatra’s release of stored grain after two eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C.

Interestingly, the researchers didn't find any link between eruptions and the start of wars—but they did see a correlation between eruptions and wars ending.

For example, 200 years before Cleopatra's reign, during one of the many Syrian wars between Egypt and the Seleukid Empire, Ptolemy III's army had advanced all the way to Babylon on the Euphrates. Writings from one Roman historian state that Ptolemy was then abruptly called home. Another papyrus claims he returned to quell domestic sedition, which also happened to coincide with two major eruptions.

""This seems to be the only credible explanation for why he would abandon such an incredibly successful military campaign,"" Ludlow says.

The scientists are quick to say they aren't suggesting the actions of an entire Egyptian dynasty were driven even largely by distant volcanoes. But, they argue, it's hard to ignore the likelihood that volcanic eruptions were at least a significant contributing factor.

""When you see a shock to the river—no flooding for two to three years in a row—you suddenly see a lot of responses,"" says Manning. ""Sometimes we think we're seeing fear and panic.""

Says Ludlow, ""We're very conscious that there are indeed other things that drive a complex event like a revolt. But we were able to systematically show that in almost every case—way more than just chance—revolts seemed to follow on the tail of eruptions.""

A Faraway Trigger

Scientists don't know precisely where all the eruptions occurred, whether in Alaska, Russia, the tropics, Iceland or someplace else entirely. The climate models suggest that volcanoes in the far northern hemisphere may have the largest impact on Egypt, because they tend to push the tropical rain belt to the south, reducing rains in the headwaters of the Nile.

Residents of Alexandria would not have known, of course, what was happening, but one ancient text refers to the sun being obscured, the Earth being scorched and a lack of flooding and seeds. ""My reading of that is that it's describing a volcano,"" Manning says, even though ""they don't understand that a volcano is erupting in Alaska and perturbing rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands.""

Repeated failures of the Nile floods may have forced families to sell land, because poor yields left them unable to pay taxes. One revolt, following an eruption in 209 B.C., came amid writings proclaiming that ""most of the farmers were killed and the land has gone dry.""

In fact, by the time of Cleopatra's defeat at the hands of the Roman navy, historical records show that Egypt had been hit by repeated lack of floods and faced ""famine, plague, inflation, administrative corruption, rural depopulation, migration and land abandonment."" While many factors contributed to the Ptolemaic dynasty’s decline, the authors note that Cleopatra’s death came on the heels of the third largest volcanic eruption of the last 2,500 years.

The two centuries that followed—during which the Roman empire rose to its great heights—were a quiet period for the planet’s volcanoes. The most recent century has also been relatively calm. That raises questions about how well a world in which 70 percent of the population still depends on monsoon rains may be prepared for the next major volcanic eruption.

The new research also sheds light on another current debate—about proposals for “geoengineering” solutions to counteract global warming. One such solution would be essentially to mimic volcanic eruptions by shooting aerosols into the sky to block the sun.

The news from the Ptolemaic period suggests that the unintended consequences of that strategy might be severe.","Tue, 17 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/0a1b2fee-ee1e-4623-a1de-e86b31ea3c7d/02-volcanoes-NationalGeographic_1317119_16x9.jpg?w=1200,"['ludlow', 'caused', 'manning', 'records', 'eruptions', 'ptolemaic', 'uprisings', 'volcanoes', 'cleopatras', 'land', 'nile', 'violent', 'climate', 'volcanic', 'egypt']", ,none
6,6,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Egypt declares water emergency as precaution - Al-Monitor,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2019/08/egypt-water-resources-plan-nile-flood-drop-5--million-bcm.html,"CAIRO — Though water-scarce Egypt is on the verge of flood season, Cairo has declared a state of emergency due to a decline in water flow from last year. Yet water experts say the country is in good enough shape because of its reserves and water conservation measures.

“The job of an irrigation engineer in Egypt has changed,"" Mohammed al-Sibai, spokesman for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, told Al-Monitor. ""We no longer manage water flooding but manage water scarcity, and make precise plans to deal with it, so as not to harm the main interests and the citizens’ needs.”

The ministry reported July 27 that the total annual Nile River flow dropped 5 billion cubic meters (1.3 trillion gallons, or 6.5 billion cubic yards) from the year before due to decreased floodwaters from the Ethiopian plateau and equatorial lakes.

The government imposed a state of emergency in all governorates to regulate and manage water, especially to meet water needs for drinking and domestic use. ""Egypt's annual water quota … will not be affected by the decline,"" Sibai said. “A state of emergency means keeping all of the Water Ministry’s departments on maximum alert to periodically follow up on the water situation in the main riverbed and all canals and water channels in the governorates.""

Sibai said, “According to the ministry’s Nile Flood Forecasting Center's data on the amount of rainfall on the Ethiopian plateau [and equatorial lakes] during the current rainy season, flood rates are still moderate,” meaning there won't be any extra water to increase the storage level in the Aswan High Dam reservoir.

Floodwaters flow into the Nile and then into the man-made Lake Nasser reservoir, created by the Aswan High Dam in Aswan province. Some of the flow comes from rain in Ethiopia's hills. Another source is water that Sudan discharges from its dams to accommodate the new season's floodwater coming from the Ethiopian plateau.

The annual water flow from the Nile is estimated at an average of 84 billion cubic meters of water. Egypt gets 55.5 billion cubic meters of water a year from this flow, while Sudan receives 18.5 billion cubic meters under the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement. The rest of the river's flow is stored behind the Aswan High Dam and is considered a strategic stock for Egypt in case of water shortage or droughts.

Egypt is diligent about monitoring water availability. “In addition to the declining water flow, Egypt is dealing with a water gap that is widening every year,"" Sibai said. ""Internal needs are now estimated at 114 billion cubic meters annually, while only 59.4 billion cubic meters of running surface water is available.""

Sibai said, “The water deficit will be fixed through water recycling projects, which provide 24 billion cubic meters of water. Egypt is now one of the top countries in terms of water-use efficiency, reaching a rate of 95%, according to international estimates."" Egypt also imports food and industrial products that, if grown or made internally, would require 34 billion cubic meters of water.

Despite the water scarcity in Egypt, ""the water year 2018-2019 has ended well,"" Sibai said. ""The daily challenges and problems that farmers face were dealt with in a number of ways, as endorsed in the 2017-2037 Water Resources Plan between nine ministries."" The plan addresses four areas: developing water resources, improving water quality, making water use more efficient while reducing the amount used, and community awareness.

According to experts in Egyptian water affairs, the decrease in the Nile River's flow from floodwater may not present a major danger at the present time, given Egypt's strategic water reserves in the Aswan Dam, in addition to the absence of serious climatic events such as the drought that hit the Nile basin in the 1980s.

Abbas Sharaqi, a water and geology professor at Cairo University, told Al-Monitor Egypt's current water scarcity is mainly due to its population growth, not the lower water flow from the Ethiopian plateau or equatorial lakes.

“The main rainy season in Ethiopia, which feeds the Nile, is in July, August and September, and the water reaches Egypt three weeks after the rainy season begins. The amount of floodwater can't be judged before the season ends in September,"" Sharaqi said.

""It's not possible to be in real danger, as long as there is a strategic water reservoir in the Aswan Dam, and official figures indicate that the water level there is so far within the safe limits,"" he said. “The most important challenge is to maintain safe [levels] of water in Lake Nasser.”

The decline in the Nile's water flow is a chronic but manageable challenge for the Egyptian government. Ethiopia had delayed filling the estimated 74 billion cubic meters of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam reservoir due to internal tensions. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February 2018; the dam project manager killed himself that July, according to authorities; and dam officials were arrested on corruption charges. Meanwhile, Cairo has yet to reach a clear agreement with Ethiopia to set common rules for filling the dam reservoir and avoiding any harm.

But last month, Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati led an official delegation to Sudan and Ethiopia to discuss resuming negotiations and present Ethiopia with Egypt's vision of the rules for filling the Renaissance Dam.

Speaking about the effectiveness of such steps, Sibai said, “Leaderships in Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan do not trust one another, and we recognize the parties' appreciation of how critical the situation is. The issue is being managed by virtue of agreements and treaties that guarantee no harm is done to any party.”","Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/almpics/2019/08/RTX10BYK.jpg/RTX10BYK.jpg?h=a5ae579a&itok=6Bz5b3n7,"['meters', 'water', 'precaution', 'declares', 'emergency', 'dam', 'cubic', 'flow', 'ethiopia', 'aswan', 'nile', 'billion', 'egypt']", ,flood

On Egypt's Mediterranean coast, August should be prime tourist season. But the seaside restaurants in Alexandria are almost empty. Worries over security are keeping a lot of foreign tourists away. But there's a much bigger worry looming: that hotter weather and a disappearing shoreline could make Egypt's prospects even worse.

Scientists generally agree that human-made climate change – the effect of greenhouse gas emissions from things like cars and factories – is making the sea level higher and its waters warmer.

Rising sea levels are affecting the Nile River delta, the triangle where the Nile spreads out and drains into the sea. It's where Egypt grows most of its crops. According to the World Bank, Egypt — with its already high poverty rates and rapidly growing population — is one of the countries that will be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

Hazem Adel is already seeing some of those changes firsthand. He sells hats and woven handbags at a stall in front of a wall of concrete barriers on the Alexandria waterfront.

""The water used to flood and cover the people and their cars,"" says Adel. ""That's why the government put up the barriers – to stop the high water so it won't flood the street.""

All along the waterfront, the government has erected barriers to counter increasingly fierce winter storms. There's no beach on this part of the shore. The sand washed away years ago.

Many scientists predict a sea level rise here of more than two feet by the end of the century. Some historic buildings are already crumbling, as salt water seeps into the bricks. Entire neighborhoods could be submerged.

For thousands of years, Alexandria's fortunes have risen and fallen with the sea.

Near the concrete boardwalk, guides lead Arab tourists through a fortress built partly on the ruins of one of the wonders of the ancient world – the lighthouse of Alexandria.

For almost 2,000 years, the stone lighthouse was the tallest building in the world. It used mirrors to reflect the sun, and fires at night, to warn sailors away from the rocks. After a series of earthquakes between the tenth and 14th centuries, it tumbled into the water. Over the centuries, the sea swallowed what had been a thriving port and even the outline of the harbor itself.

Fishermen stand on what are believed to be some of the remains of the base of the lighthouse, casting lines into the water from long poles.

Saleh Hilmi, who has been fishing here for 25 years, says the fish now are smaller than before – he throws the ones he catches to stray cats. Because the sea water is warmer, he says, the bigger fish have retreated to cooler, deeper water.

It's a big worry for climate change experts like Mohammad al-Raey from the University of Alexandria, who has been researching the potential effects of warmer temperatures and rising sea levels for decades.

""The sea level rise would affect all coasts and all beaches,"" he says, looking out over the brilliant blue waters of the Mediterranean along Egypt's north coast. ""The models show the Middle East would increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation.""

Most models predict a possible average mean temperature rise of more than three degrees Fahrenheit over parts of Egypt over the next four decades.

Raey says the effects of hotter weather, including reduced rainfall, would cut agricultural productivity by 15 to 20 percent – a huge blow to a country already struggling to feed its people.

More than half of Egypt's crops are grown along the Nile delta.

All along the delta, the river banks are eroding. With rising sea levels, sea water is seeping into Nile water used for irrigation.

""The crops die,"" says Youssef Ghazali, who has been farming for 50 years. ""If you water them with salty water, they die immediately. If I had proper water, I could grow rice, clover cotton. I could grow anything.""

Ghazali's arms are crisscrossed with red gashes from cutting thistles. He shows me a patch of bare earth where, two years ago, he was growing rice. Now he says it's too salty to grow anything at all.

Other farmers say they have had to abandon traditional crops like sugarcane because of the salinity of the water.

Ghazali says people here are already struggling with river water polluted by runoff from factories — and now they've been told that human activity is changing the very weather.

""We've heard for a long time that we shouldn't burn wood and straw,"" he says. ""They say because of the smoke from that and smoke from the cars, it affects the temperature.""

Other Egyptians aren't so sure.

Further up the Nile delta, near a fishing village called al-Ma'adiya where the Nile meets the Mediterranean, fisherman say winter storms have been so fierce the past two years, some people here believe God is punishing them.

""Last winter was the worst,"" says Bedair Mohammad. ""The sea swallowed up some of the land and got closer and closer to the village. We're seeing things we never saw before, in a way that could make us believe this is anger from God on the village and its people.""

Mohammad says every year the winds get stronger, the waves get higher and more land disappears. They have to go further and further out to sea to find the same fish they used to catch close to shore.

He points to where the pale blue water of the Mediterranean starts to turn brown a few hundred feet closer to shore. It was bare ground just a few years ago – now it's covered in water. In his grandfather's time, it took more than half an hour to walk from the village to the shore. Now it takes less than 10 minutes.

Ten years ago, these were such rich fishing grounds people referred to this stretch of the coast as ""Kuwait"" — because its villages were so prosperous. Now the fish near the shore are smaller and scarcer. Fishermen need motorboats to get out to deeper water instead of the rowboats they used to use.

9,9,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Sudanese hope Ethiopian dam ends Blue Nile floods - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2019-11-sudanese-ethiopian-blue-nile.html,"Sudanese farmers like Othman Idris say Ethiopia's construction of a controversial dam on the Blue Nile is a dream come true that would regulate flooding during rainy seasons

The Blue Nile is a renegade river, according to Sudanese farmer Osman Idris, its unpredictable flooding swallows crops and houses as it crashes through Sudan from Ethiopia on its way to Egypt.

""Tonight, the level of water will be low,"" said Idris, a resident of Juref Gharb, a small village on the bank of the Blue Nile outside Khartoum.

""Tomorrow, it will swallow all the houses... It's a renegade river, it rises so fast,"" said the 60-year-old, dressed in a traditional Sudanese robe.

For Idris, Ethiopa's construction of a controversial dam on the Blue Nile is a dream come true, as it promises to regulate the floods that inundate Sudan every rainy season.

This year alone, flash flooding has killed more than 60 and injured dozens in Sudan.

The Blue Nile joins the White Nile in Khartoum and supplies the overwhelming majority of the Nile's water, which runs through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.

Construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam began in 2012, but since then Egypt has sounded the alarm that the project would severely reduce its water supplies.

Egypt depends on the Nile for about 90 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, and says it has ""historic rights"" to the river guaranteed by treaties from 1929 and 1959.

It sees the project as an existential threat, fearing Ethiopia's rapid construction of the dam might lead to water and food scarcity for millions of Egyptians.

Construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam began in 2012 but the controversial project has raised concern in Egypt which says it would severely reduce its much-needed water supplies

More cash crops

After several rounds of talks failed to resolve the issue, a new dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan was mediated by the United States in Washington earlier this month.

The three delegations agreed to resolve the dispute by January 15, with ministerial-level talks being held this week in Addis Ababa.

Ethiopia insists the $4 billion hydro-electric barrage is essential for its economic growth given that most of its population still lives without electricity.

And in Sudan, farmers hope the dam will provide predictable flow.

Over the years, farmers like Idris who own farms along the Nile have been forced to change their crops due to flood devastation and tonnes of deposited silt.

Brickmakers fire blocks of mud in riverside kilns, producing smoke harmful to crops.

""I had to shift from cultivating fruits and vegetables to animal feed,"" Idris told AFP.

Being reliant on flooding for irrigation means only one harvest per year and limits the kind of crops that can be grown.

If the river's flow were regulated, more intensive agriculture could be practised, Idris said.

The dam could block unwanted silt which brickmakers in Sudan depend on for their livelihood

""We can plant crops through the year. It will be better for the environment and for marketing our products, which means more income for us,"" Idris said.

Ekram Dagash, a professor at Khartoum's Al-Zaiem Al-Azhari University, agreed that Sudan stands to gain from the dam, which will maintain water levels and block unwanted silt.

""Ethiopia is building the dam for one reason only, to produce electricity and export it, not only to neighbouring countries but to the whole African continent,"" she told AFP.

Worried brickmakers

But one group of Sudanese are concerned about the dam: brickmakers, who depend on the silt for their livelihood.

Dozens of small kilns line the river, providing an income for hundreds of brickmakers like Yakoub Noreen.

""If the dam is built, this won't arrive,"" the 40-year-old said of the silt he was standing in, as he pressed wet clay into a mould.

Nearby, workers stacked bricks into a kiln belching thick smoke. Later they will be sold for 1,500 Sudanese pounds ($32) per 1,000 bricks, Noreen said.

Professor Dagash said workers can be compensated and provided alternative livelihoods if brickworks close, adding that benefits from the dam outweighed such losses.

Vast areas of land would open up for agriculture as well as industrial projects, she said.

""The dam will provide Sudan with low cost electricity... and low cost electricity means more growth,"" she said.

10,10,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Volcanic Woes May Have Contributed to Ancient Egypt's Fall - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/volcanic-woes-may-have-contributed-to-ancient-egypts-fall,"Ice cores and ancient river records suggest that volcanic eruptions may have reduced the flow of the Nile River. Failures of the Nile floods that usually irrigated Egypt’s farms could have fed social unrest.

Imagine it’s 245 BCE. You’re Ptolemy III, a Macedonian king ruling Egypt, and you’re leading an army against your biggest rival, the Seleucid Empire. But there’s a revolt back home, and you must return to the people that your dynasty would rule from 305 BCE to 30 CE.

Sometime in the 3rd century CE, the Roman historian Justin would write that if you had “not been recalled to Egypt by disturbances at home, [you] would have made [yourself] master of all Seleucus’s dominions.” Other writings declare that you did what you had to do to relieve a famine in Egypt. The summer was unusually dry that year, wrote a priest, and the Nile didn’t flood like it usually did. You imported grain from rainier territories—gaining you a priestly commendation in 238 BCE about the sacrifices you made for the “salvation for the population.”

A team of 21st century CE scientists and historians is offering a new look at something that might have indirectly caused the upheaval that changed Ptolemy III’s fortunes. Fast-forward to the present day: A team of 21st century CE scientists and historians is offering a new look at something that might have indirectly caused the upheaval that changed Ptolemy III’s fortunes as well other unrest that beset the Ptolemaic empire—large volcanic eruptions.

In a new paper in Nature Communications, the researchers present a raft of evidence—from climate modeling and ice core and Nile River hydrological records to ancient Egyptian chronicles—indicating that a series of eruptions may have caused sharp drop-offs in the summer rainfall usually brought by the African monsoon.

The loss of monsoon precipitation would have depleted the headwaters of the Nile River and deprived Egyptian civilization of the annual Nile flooding that it depended on to sustain its agriculture. As food became scarce, insurrections may have followed, including one known as the Theban revolt, which rose against the ruling Macedonian Ptolemies starting in 207 BCE.

“The Ptolemies lost control over huge areas of Egypt for almost 2 decades” during the Theban revolt, said Francis Ludlow, a coauthor of the study and a climate historian at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. It “was a very destructive revolt, with damage to temples and huge losses of tax revenues for the state.”

Volcanoes and the Nile

Researchers know well the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions. Major eruptions spew sulfur dioxide, among other substances, into the atmosphere, which reacts to form aerosol particles. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the atmosphere.

Texts from 1788 describe a low-flowing Nile in the summers of 1783 and 1784, which caused a food shortage that killed many people. Generally, this cooling decreases evaporation, and less evaporation means less water in the atmosphere for rain. The summer floods along the 6,800-kilometer-long Nile got their water mainly from rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands, and that rainfall comes from the African monsoon, which is driven by summer heating of the atmosphere. A cooler atmosphere supplies less water for the monsoon and thus less water for the Nile.

This effect has been documented. Texts from 1788, for example, describe a low-flowing Nile in the summers of 1783 and 1784—during and after Iceland’s Laki eruption—which caused a food shortage that killed many people. Recently, other scientists have used models to show how the Laki eruption and its 80 megatons of sulfur aerosols could have indirectly wiped out those monsoons so integral to the Egyptian population’s well-being.

Some possible factors didn’t make it into this research, however, according to Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He told the New York Times that the study didn’t account for weather influences on the Nile like El Niño.

Islamic Nilometer

To investigate a possible connection between volcanic eruptions and a Nile flood failure, the researchers on the new paper turned to one of the longest hydrological records on Earth: the Islamic Nilometer, an ancient structure built in 622 CE that people used to track water levels on the Nile. The researchers studied eruptions that occurred from 622 CE to 1902 CE and compared the dates of those eruptions—like Laki in 1783 and Tambora in 1815—with dates of Nile failures recorded by operators of the Nilometer. In summers during eruption years, the researchers found, floodwaters averaged 22 centimeters lower than in noneruption years.

Although these eruptions occurred long after the end of the Egyptian empire, the researchers assume that they would have affected the African monsoon similarly. “It would be surprising if the climate system operated completely differently in the Ptolemaic era,” Ludlow said.

The researchers then looked back in time with ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica to find evidence, like the presence of sulfur, that would point to volcanic eruptions. They then counted the layers in the ice cores like tree rings to date those eruptions and compared those dates with dates of major societal challenges like famine, disease, and land abandonment.

It turns out there was a major eruption in 209 BCE, just 2 years before the Theban revolt began. Other major eruptions occurred in 247 and 244 BCE, just as Ptolemy III clashed with Seleucus II in the east. “[We observed] in historical records a dynamic societal response” to the climate changes, said Joseph Manning, a historian at Yale and lead author of the new paper.

The mix of different records “is an important part of putting together the effects of the eruptions,” Heli Huhtamaa, a climate historian at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told Science. She said that she found the team’s analysis very convincing.

Climate and Society

“Environmental pressures don’t act in a vacuum.” The researchers stress that their claim is not that volcanic eruptions caused social unrest or that regional climate change alone brought down an empire.

“Environmental pressures don’t act in a vacuum,” Ludlow said. More likely, “pressures from poor flooding coalesced at certain points of time with political and economic factors” like tensions between warring regions and high state-levied taxes. Food shortages resulting from lack of Nile flooding could have added the heat needed to boil an already simmering pot of unrest.

13,13,FL-2019-000179-CAN,The Purchase of The Egyptian: Why Netflix Needs a Pyramid - FLOOD Magazine,https://floodmagazine.com/71075/the-purchase-of-the-egyptian-why-netflix-needs-a-pyramid/,"Amazon sold its first book in 1995—somewhat fittingly, it was Douglas Hofstadter’s Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought. In 2001, Amazon announced its partnership with Borders, an agreement that redirected the Borders website to Amazon’s online book marketplace. Just ten years later, Borders closed its last remaining stores. In a 1992 Census Bureau report, there were 13,136 independent and chain bookstores in The United States. In 2016, that number was 6,448.

Numbers reinforce an industry guard change we all understand on a more personal level with books, toys, electronics, furniture, groceries, and our everyday needs and knick-knacks. Enter a mall and be prepared to feel a sort of vague depression stimulated by the anachronistic storefronts, save for the lone clerks, scrolling their smartphones, biting their nails, straightening already straightened shelves. But some malls stay relevant with edison bulbs and VR experiences—four years ago, brick-and-mortar Amazon Books bookstores began appearing in this type of contemporary retail center, nineteen in total. Without knowing their figures, one can assume these stores—which primarily display Amazon bestsellers and just a shelf or two of the foremost classics—can hardly generate much added revenue for the web superstore. Rather, these storefronts denote banners: nineteen antagonizing monuments to the industry it efficiently and effectively disrupted, then displaced.

Now, for the first time, a streaming service will own and operate a physical theater to project its original films and series. Netflix is set to acquire The Egyptian Theatre, the second most iconic cinema house on the star-studded stretch of Hollywood Boulevard. The purchasing price is estimated in the tens of millions. Its current owner, American Cinematheque—a high-profile nonprofit dedicated to the preservation, projection, and celebration of classic and contemporary independent cinema—will continue to hold screenings on weekends. Beyond this, the official date of purchase, renovation plans, details regarding signage, and any official signature of contracts solidifying the Cinematheque partnership remain opaque.

What does it imply that the streaming service recognized as the forefather of the industry’s digital revolution purchases the first movie theater constructed in Hollywood?

The Egyptian was built by vaudeville showman Sid Grauman in 1922, four years before he erected the Chinese Theatre on the north side of the same strip. Significantly, The Egyptian hosted the first-ever Hollywood premiere, Robin Hood, the same year as the theater’s opening. What does it imply that the streaming service recognized as the forefather of the industry’s digital revolution purchases the first movie theater constructed in Hollywood, the first to host a premiere, and with a structure and name inspired by the civilization known well for their mausoleum-cum-totems for the pharaohs and queens of an era past?

Many know the story to some extent. In 2010, the effects of Netflix sharply surfaced when the ubiquitous Blockbuster chain filed for bankruptcy and its stores started to offload all its copies of Leprechaun 2, The Cable Guy, Jerry Maguire, and shutter. Just a few years later, Netflix shook things up in a bigger way with the production of its first original content program House of Cards, the success of which signaled the clear lucrative path forward to every major entertainment studio and corporate mogul with an interest in not just the financial potential, but also the influence media creators hold.

This history is well-outlined with refreshing objectivity by Ben Fritz in his 2018 book, The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies. It covers the emergence of Netflix, the Sony leaks, the rise of the superhero and franchise blockbusters, alongside the near-total demise of the mid-budget feature. Ben is also the West Coast editor for the Wall Street Journal, and offered a few insights for this article. Netflix remains outspokenly silent on the subject. American Cinematheque did not respond to requests for comment, but an unnamed employee did reply to an inquiry to say: “gonna be hard to get anyone to talk, frankly.”

“Netflix’s reported plan to buy the Egyptian is a great metaphor for where the entertainment industry is today,” Ben answers regarding the acquisition’s subtext. “Here you have this iconic, beautiful theater on Hollywood Boulevard that shows feature films on a huge screen in a large auditorium. Now a streaming video giant wants to buy it and use it to play the movies it makes, primarily for consumption on televisions, tablets, and phones. The Egyptian would become a marketing and publicity tool for Netflix—a place to show off its movies to press, creative professionals, and the small number of people who will pay extra to see a movie on the big screen they could see at home for free (if they already subscribe, as most people interested in entertainment do). The Egyptian would no longer be a business intended to make profits by selling tickets to films. Because, of course, that business is tiny now compared to the wealth of Netflix and its competitors in subscription streaming video.”

A substantial portion of The Big Picture addresses the shrinking of the theatrical film business. Essentially, once digital streaming was of a high enough quality, DVD sales plummeted (which had nullified poor box office performance throughout the 2000s) and viewers only visited theaters for massive spectacle films that they viewed as guaranteed entertainment and a cultural event. Mid-budget films became too risky to produce. Even though twenty mid-budget films could be made for the price of one superhero epic, that superhero epic had a massive guaranteed return, while each of the dramas, rom-coms, or single-star action vehicles would, on average, lose money—and when one or two did make money, it wasn’t nearly enough to float the others. This was specifically enhanced by the emergence of high-quality television series like Breaking Bad, and with home viewing easier than ever with services like Netflix, risking the price of a month’s subscription for a potentially bad drama in the theater became a non-option for most everyone except the most devoted cinemagoers.

The distinction between television and cinema is degrading. Ben explains that “previously they were very distinct because television was only one thing—twenty-two half-hour or hour-long episode seasons—and feature films were ninety to one hundred and eighty minutes and always shown first in a theater. That was dictated by the respective business models of ad-supported television and theaters that charged per ticket and need to cycle people in and out.”

“Netflix’s plan is a great metaphor for where the entertainment industry is today. You have this iconic theater that shows feature films on a huge screen. Now a streaming video giant wants to buy it and use it to play the movies it makes.”

— Ben Fritz

TV movies and series used to be identifiable by their lower quality due to lower budgets, and feature films were frequently helmed by higher-caliber directors and actors. This has since shifted, and feature films on streaming services are often (subjectively) of a lower quality than series, even when attached to heralded directors and stars. Exceptions abound, but television of varying lengths certainly appears the way forward for creatives and executives alike.

So, to return to the principal question: Why buy a theater when your business is founded on producing television? In large part, one can speculate, it’s because Netflix may be differentiating itself from the competition with a prioritization of the feature format. Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman is certainly a signal in this direction. When, in cinemas, there is little found between the low-budget, often subversive, output from A24, Neon, and Blumhouse, and the franchise tent-poles from the “Big Six,” there could be an underlying demand for the types of films that once represented non-independent theatrical releases, regardless of whether or not they actually appear in a theater. The Egyptian would symbolize this position, which further fuels the debate that surrounds streaming service films as Oscar contenders, since historically most Oscar winners were mid-budget films (if listed from lowest to highest budget, adjusted for inflation, the median budget for a best picture is $30.3 million, approximately that of No Country for Old Men).

“The discussion about what qualifies as cinema now seems hugely important, especially in terms of the Academy Awards,” Fritz continues. “In my opinion, there are basically two choices for the Academy and other institutions or people thinking about this issue. One is to define a movie as a piece of visual media that plays first on a large screen in an auditorium, where its creators intended it to be seen. The other is any piece of visual media intended to be completed in a single sitting (as opposed to an episodic series), no matter the type of screen on which it plays first. If you pick the former, you’re essentially excluding films from Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming services in the future that adopt their model. If you pick the latter, you’re essentially eliminating the difference between what we used to call ‘films’ versus ‘TV movies.’”

In today’s digital media-driven culture, it seems impossible to imagine a future where either the Academy does not loosen its requirements for Oscar contenders, or a new awards ceremony with a more inclusive, forward-looking modus operandi appears on the scene, prepared to recognize that the craft of filmmaking now sees its most venerable players dedicated to a format streamed principally on screens sized between seventy and four inches. Now, the conversation can explore all sorts of avenues, such as the qualitative differences in storytelling between cinematic feature films and television series created by and starring the exact same A-listers, or the significance of the ever-increasing democratization of media, where once viewers can easily place his or her own feature-length film on the world’s largest streaming platform, YouTube, and could “qualify” for the same awards as the likes of Scorsese with his Netflix films, and Spielberg and his future Quibis. However, these topics are perhaps better suited for a living room discussion amongst friends.

Netflix could emerge the hero, build a new awards ceremony, unite the streaming frontier into a cohesive recognition that they are all playing toward the same endgame: somehow keeping viewers interested in mainstream media for a long time to come, regardless of format. (I have to ask now, when will we revolt against the self-defeating and patronizing use of the word “content”?) The Egyptian Theatre might be just the mausoleum for such a ceremony.

Or, Netflix will use The Egyptian as its monument to the Hollywood standard it displaced, projecting its bulk of features and series to pervade the same air of classicism as the films that screened in this theater decades prior, and shall continue, purportedly, through the efforts of American Cinematheque.

Whatever the motive, Netflix is the undisputed forefather of the mass of services and media on our HDMI plates today. The winners of the “streaming wars” won’t be revealed for years to come—but the past is certain, and The Egyptian will be known, at least to those who are obsessed enough to think about it, as a relic of a relic of the past.

CAIRO – 13 October 2019: The volume of floodwater flowing into Egypt in October exceeds those of earlier years, and the overall amount in 2019 is “promising,” the Ministry of Irrigation said Sunday.



By August, the floodwater was around the average, but the rain has increased significantly downstream since then, according to the ministry statement.



The permanent committee at the ministry tasked with regulating the river water reviewed the impact of the water year on Egypt’s water resources at this time and how the water should be distributed for different purposes.



It also discussed the measures needed to raise the efficiency of estuaries and canals, update maps, improve the water quality, clean the riverbed, and achieve the equilibrium of the river. Pollutants deposited in the Nile could be eliminated by increasing the river disposals to “wash” the riverbed, which may heighten the water level on the riverbanks and within the water surface that includes the main stream and the accretion of the river.



The statement said the ministry is strictly applying the regulations to counter encroachments to protect the borders of the Nile and its two distributaries, Damietta and Rosetta, and prevent any activities inside the restricted areas of the Nile.

Eruptions across the globe may have suppressed monsoons, the scientists said, diminishing the annual river floods and leading to food shortages. Because 70 percent of the world’s population today similarly relies on monsoon-dependent agricultural systems, the findings may warn of what might happen in a volcanically active future.

17,17,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Thousands in shelters as Indonesia flood death toll hits 53 - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/thousands-in-shelters-as-indonesia-flood-death-toll-hits-53/,"Tens of thousands of Indonesians were still unable to return to their waterlogged homes Saturday after flooding hit the Jakarta capital region, killing at least 53 people, authorities said.

More than 170,000 people took refuge in shelters across the massive urban conglomeration — home to some 30 million — after whole neighborhoods were submerged.

Torrential rains that started on New Year’s Eve unleashed flash floods and landslides in the region and neighboring Lebak at the south end of Java island.

On Saturday, Indonesia’s disaster agency said the death toll had climbed to 53 with one person still missing.

“We’ve discovered more dead bodies,” said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

Officials would be visiting the homeless Saturday in the hardest-hit areas, he added.

Shelters filled up with refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.

Some had been reduced to using floodwaters to clean themselves and dishes.

“We badly need clean water in this shelter,” Trima Kanti said from one refuge in Jakarta’s western edges.

“We’re cleaning ourselves in a nearby church but the timing has been limited since it uses an electric generator for power,” the 39-year-old added.

– Debris and cars –

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta, swampy streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other — with waterline marks reaching as high as the second floors of buildings.

The government said Friday it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital — inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes — to prevent approaching rainfall from pounding the region.

Waters had receded in many areas and power was being restored after being cut off in hundreds of districts.

The health ministry has said it deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.

Around Jakarta, a family — including a four- and nine-year-old — died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an eight-year-old boy was killed in a landslide.

Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November.

But this week’s disaster marked Jakarta’s worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Urban planning experts said the disaster was partly due to record rainfall.

But Jakarta’s myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, worsened the situation, they said.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has announced a plan to move the country’s capital to Borneo island to take pressure off Jakarta, which suffers from some of the world’s worst traffic jams and is fast sinking due to excessive groundwater extraction.

18,18,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Albania's 'Made in Egypt' Cigarettes Flood North Africa - Balkan Insight,https://balkaninsight.com/2018/12/20/albania-s-made-in-egypt-cigarettes-flood-north-africa-12-19-2018/,"Secrets are hard fought for in the impoverished Albanian town of Librazhd, particularly when jobs are at stake.

But the controversial activities of a cigarette factory on the edge of town with a 50-strong workforce appear to have passed largely unnoticed since it began quietly churning out millions of cigarettes in packs bearing the profile of the last Ptolemaic ruler of Egypt – Cleopatra.

Cleopatra is the most popular brand of cigarette in Egypt and one of the world’s top sellers.

Albanian court documents, leaked British customs reports, contracts and interviews with the factory management reveal that since 2014 around 22 million packs of the cigarettes have been produced annually in the Albania Tabak factory in Librazhd, near the central city of Elbasan, before being shipped to Libya.

According to the owner of the Cleopatra brand – Giza-based Eastern Company – cigarettes arriving in Libya are frequently smuggled across the desert border into Egypt, where one pack of 20 can fetch almost a dollar on the legal market.

British customs authorities have been tracking the Librazhd output and flagging it as counterfeit. Their warnings prompted a criminal investigation in Albania in 2015 which halted production for a year. The case was then put on hold as prosecutors awaited information from foreign jurisdictions.

Relieved of its immediate legal troubles, the factory signed a new deal in 2017 with the British Virgin Islands-based firm Eques Holding Group to produce up to 175 million pack a year, according to a contract obtained by reporters.

Albanian prosecutors have now revealed that they reopened the case in 2017.

Undeterred, the men behind the operation are looking to expand.

They include figures from the Balkans, the Middle East and Cyprus, some of whom have been tied to earlier smuggling cases, and some whose involvement in this operation has been concealed through offshore structures that reporters from Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN, and Arab Journalists for Investigative Journalism, ARIJ, have unpicked.

Those benefiting from the booming Cleopatra business also include the wife of a powerful Albanian political figure from the ruling Socialist Party, although she insists she was unaware of the allegations against the operation.

Organised crime and the rule of law are major issues facing Albania as it tries to make progress on the road towards European Union membership, having joined NATO in 2009.

The manager of the factory, Servet Dauti, said the factory operated wholly in line with Albanian law and what happened to the cigarettes after they left Albania was not his concern.

“The moment that the product leaves Albania we have no responsibility or obligation to know what happens with it,” he said.

Eques Holding Group declined to comment for this story.

Made in Librazhd

Produced more than a thousand miles from the land of the pharaohs, the allegedly counterfeit packs nevertheless carry the unmistakable profile of Queen Cleopatra, lover of Julius Caesar, and claim in Arabic script to be ‘Made in Egypt by Eastern Company S.A.E..’ The packs are emblazoned with Egyptian health warnings.

Eastern Company S.A.E. created the Cleopatra brand for President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1960s as an Egyptian take on the smuggled American Kents he liked to smoke. It has been in production ever since, largely for domestic consumption.

Increased taxes on cigarettes from the 2010s onward created a booming black market for the product; lawlessness in neighbouring Libya since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi has turned the country into a smuggler’s paradise.

These Albanian “counterfeits”, as they are described by British customs in a May 2015 letter to Egyptian customs and obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, are produced for Eques Holding Group, a British Virgin Island company owned by a 38-year-old Iraqi businessman called Faris Al-Rifai.

Eques Holding Group boasts a licence to use the Cleopatra brand in the European Union and Albania, obtained from another British Virgin Island firm, Worldwide Spirits Supply.

Eastern Company has been unsuccessful in overturning these trademarks as the Egyptian firm has been unable to prove that it has recently been using the brand in those countries.

But trademarks work on a strict geographical basis, and Worldwide’s do not cover Libya or Egypt, where Eastern Company has registered their brand.

Despite this, a BIRN/ARIJ investigation has uncovered that the Albanian-produced Cleopatra were exported via the Albanian port of Durres to Libya and a firm called Al Zain International Company. Calls to the firm went unanswered.

And an internal report from Eastern Company, obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, describes how Cleopatra cigarettes arriving in Libya from countries such as Vietnam and Montenegro are smuggled across the Sahara into Egypt, where they can be sold alongside authentic Cleopatras, which cost just under $1 each.

Although there is no direct evidence of Albanian-made Cleopatras finding their way to Egypt, officials have reported regular seizures of the brand in the North African country in recent years. Revenues for Eastern Company and the Egyptian government have also been badly hit by smuggled counterfeits.

The Albanian-made cigarettes also purport to be produced by “Eastern Company S.A.E”.

This right was supplied by a company of the same name but based in the British Virgin Islands at the same address as Eques Holding Group. There is no apparent connection to the original Eastern Company headquartered in Giza, home of the Giza pyramids southwest of Cairo, although the firm did not respond to requests for comment.

The letter confirming the production rights was issued a matter of months before Albanian prosecutors opened an investigation into the factory’s operations, prompted by intelligence from British customs, HMRC.

The criminal investigation into “Violation of Industrial Property Rights”, “Laundering the Proceeds of Criminal Offence or Criminal Activity” and “Illegal production of industrial and food items/commodities” was opened in early 2015.

According to news reports from the time, nine million “counterfeit” cigarettes were seized in a raid on the factory but the articles failed to note the brand – Cleopatra – despite being clearly visible from the press photos issued.

Following the raid, the case was suspended while prosecutors awaited responses from various foreign jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands and Egypt.

This allowed Albania Tabak to restart production, despite contact between Albanian customs and the Egyptian ambassador to Tirana, according to an Eastern Company report, and the concerns of British customs and its continued monitoring, according to official letters obtained by BIRN/ARIJ. Britain is one of the biggest markets in Europe for counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.

In correspondence with Egyptian customs in May 2015, not long after the raid, HMRC described how an employee based in Sofia but with regional responsibility for Albania “has recently been successful in closing a cigarette production factory producing counterfeit Cleopatra brand cigarettes.”

“It is HMRC’s intention to eradicate the counterfeit production of Cleopatra brand cigarettes with the help of The Eastern Company, the legitimate license holder for the brand,” the letter added.

To date, neither Albania Tabak, Eques Holding Group, Worldwide Spirits nor any employee of those firms has been accused of any crime.

Production restarts and expands

Dauti, the factory manager, said the factory was shut for roughly a year while the investigation was ongoing, after which they were allowed to reopen.

Then, in December 2016, HMRC informed their Egyptian counterparts that eight shipments of Cleopatra cigarettes had been sent to Libya for Eques Holding Group.

In March 2017, it again reported to Egypt that 11.5 million Cleopatra cigarettes were due to be exported to Libya, via Malta.

The latest contract, signed in March 2017 and obtained by reporters, states that Albania

Tabak will produce up to 3,500 tonnes of cigarettes a year for two years which, at approximately one gram a cigarette, means 3.5 billion cigarettes every 12 months, or 175 million packs. The document places a value of 15 million euros on the order.

In an interview with BIRN/ARIJ, Dauti denied doing anything wrong.

“We perform and proceed with our work in full compliance with Albanian law,” he said.

“The trademarks are registered in Europe and Albania, hence legally nothing impedes us from producing it. But even if it was not registered in Albania, there is nothing that stops us from producing it according to Albanian legislation as we function as a production company and all the inflow and outflow plans are monitored.”

Eques Holding Group agreed to pay Albania Tabak 0.014 euro cents a pack, or approximately 300,000 euros a year.

“According to the contract, we only have to package them and send them to Durres,” Dauti said.

Dauti said the machinery at the Librazhd factory was outdated and capable of producing just 1.8 million packs a month, or 21.6 million per year.

He and the official owner of Eques Holding Group, Al-Rifai, have set up a new company, Eques Trading Company Shpk, in nearby Elbasan where they have applied to open another factory.

“We have a capacity of three containers a month,” Dauti said of the current factory. “We can’t do more than this even though the contractor asks for a larger quantity. We cannot do more because we don’t have better equipment at our disposal.”

Interviewed a second time, Dauti played down the plan to open a new factory, saying they would revisit the idea in six months.

Cleopatra in Vietnam



Before Cleopatra cigarettes starting rolling off the production line of Librazhd, Albania, in 2014, Eques Holding Group and Worldwide Spirits were busy trying to do business on the back of the popular smoking brand in Vietnam.Worldwide Spirits admitted that their European trademark was being used to produce Cleopatra in the South East Asian state in a letter to the EU’s intellectual property office in September 2013. The trademark had been lodged just three months earlier. Eques’s request to trademark Cleopatra in Vietnam in 2012 appears to have been eventually turned down in 2015. Eques also attempted, and failed, to have Eastern Company’s registration annulled in September 2013. Vietnamese authorities ruled in January 2014 that the Egyptian firm’s trademark had been used in the preceding five years and was therefore still in force. It is unclear whether Eques’s efforts resulted in cigarettes being manufactured or who was producing Cleopatra with Worldwide Spirit’s EU trademark, but Cleopatras were being made in Vietnam from 2012 to at least 2015 according to Eastern Company, which alleged in a report that these were aimed at the Egyptian market. In a letter from Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade to the Egyptian embassy in Hanoi, dated September 2014, it reported that the ministry was “currently checking up on the cigarette production of local companies”. “If any company is discovered to produce cigarettes trademarked ‘Cleopatra’ it will be requested to stop producing in order to ensure the intellectual property rights on the industrial products of the Egyptian enterprise,” the letter reads. The ministry did not respond to requests for comment on whether production was halted.

Links to smuggling

Albania Tabak factory has been under the ownership of the Jashari family since December 2010, having been bought by father Ilir for three million euros before passing between his wife and son, Darjo.

Ilir Jashari was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in June 2010 and handed an initial sentence of more than 15 years, which was later reduced, although he only began serving it upon his arrest in 2014. In 2016 he was transferred to an Albanian prison and was released in 2017, according to a source close to the process.

Contacted by phone, he declined to comment.

Ownership of Worldwide Spirits, meanwhile, is shrouded in secrecy in the British Virgin Islands, and no clues were provided in the information released to BIRN/ARIJ from the tax haven.

But a trawl of trademark applications lodged at the EU’s intellectual property office revealed that the firm is owned by another company called Middle East Tobacco Co, METCO, based in Cyprus and with a turnover of almost $28 million in 2014, according to company accounts.

According to documents from a 2008 London High Court case between UK cigarette producer Gallaher and a Cypriot firm called Tlias, over 18 months from May 2002, 20,000 cases of Gallaher cigarettes were shipped to Belgium, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Singapore, Slovenia and Tenerife by Tlais’s main distributor to METCO without any restrictions on their final destination, in breach of Tlais’s contract..

Cigarettes then sold by METCO ended up being smuggled into the UK and resulted in five people being convicted. The judge said: “I shall assume that Metco had nothing to do with the criminality.”

An employee of METCO, who declined to identify himself, said they were “not interested” in receiving or responding to BIRN/ARIJ’s questions on the Cleopatra trademark.

According to a contract signed between Eques Holding Group and the British Virgin Islands-based “trademark” holder Worldwide Spirit Supply, Eques agreed to pay Worldwide one USD for every 10,000 cigarettes produced. This works out at approximately 44,000 dollars a year.

Another company cashing in on the cigarette boom in Librazhd is the Elbasan customs agency Ujori, which is owned by Xhuljana Sejdini, wife of Elbasan mayor Qazim Sejdini, an ally of Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama.

According to the Albanian prosecutor’s report, obtained by BIRN/ARIJ, factory manager Dauti told prosecutors that “the whole imp-exp procedure [is] through the customs agency Ujori”.

Dauti told BIRN/ARIJ that Ujori was given the task because “it is the only company that does everything in Elbasan so we signed a contract with it”.

It is not known how much Ujori has made from the shipment of allegedly counterfeit cigarettes.

Sejdini told BIRN that she was unaware of the investigation into Albania Tabak, explaining that her firm was involved only in the paperwork.

“We do not open any trucks and we do not know what is inside them and there is no reason why we should know that,” she said.

Librazhd’s mayor, Kastriot Gura, said he knew little about the activities of the factory in his town, beyond breathing much needed life into the ailing local economy.

“I know they produce cigarettes and that they have brought jobs to the town,” he said. “They regularly pay their municipal obligations and for us that is all that matters.”

No, I do not know because I was not interested to know. For us, it is important and what really matters is that they pay tax to the city and have created jobs.

Gura said he was not interested in any allegations of wrongdoing. “That’s the responsibility of other parts of the state.”

On December 12, shortly prior to publication of this story, Prosecutor Armanda Xhaferri revealed in a written statement to BIRN that her office in Elbasan had reopened the case in 2017 after new documents were received from the British Virgin Islands, but that the case was still waiting on information from Egypt.

“Under these circumstances, our investigations have not been completed yet,” Xhaferi said.

Responding to questions about why customs allowed a firm under investigation to export goods claiming to be “Made in Egypt” to Libya, Albania’s custom said in a statement that Eques Holding Group was operating with an Albanian trademark for “Cleopatra”, although it also conceded that Eastern Company had registered “Cleopatra Lux” as its brand.

It added: “The case continues to be under investigation by the Prosecution of the District Court in Elbasan while the General Directorate of the Customs awaits the results of the investigation.”

19,19,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Did the Egyptians create a canal and a port to bring stone to the Great Pyramid? - The Boston Globe,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/10/06/did-egyptians-create-canal-and-port-bring-stone-great-pyramid/xtoi4NzlTz9PYRo2QnmG0M/story.html,"The Egyptians, consummate engineers, cut waterways from the Nile through floodplain that now is covered by sand and the urban sprawl of Cairo, Lehner believes. Illustrations developed by Lehner show water within several hundred yards of the Great Pyramid, a startling vision to anyone who has long thought of them as being surrounded by dusty desert.

Mark Lehner, director of Ancient Egypt Research Associates, says his research indicates that, when the Nile River was in flood, Egyptians could steer boats laden with stone to a major port city at the pyramid complex.

A Boston-based archaeologist has developed a theory that the Egyptians delivered stone to the pyramids at Giza through a system of canals and harbors, shedding more light on the mystery of how ancient people — sorry, not aliens — built the massive structures.

“The Egyptians were basically using the Nile as a huge hydraulic lift,” he said in a telephone interview.

Lehner was one of the experts featured on a BBC documentary on Sept. 24, “Egypt’s Great Pyramid: The New Evidence,” that rounded up recent research finds. The release of the film generated breathless headlines across the world, saying that the mystery of the pyramids had been “solved.”

Lehner, 67, who has an office in Brighton and splits his time between his hometown of Milton and Egypt, has been studying and conducting digs at the pyramids for 45 years. He said his theories have been known among fellow archaeologists, but the documentary has generated “quite a bit of interest.”

He said his discoveries and another major discovery by a French archaeologist detailed in the documentary may not have solved the mysteries of the pyramids, but they have opened a “ new window” onto how they were built.

Peter Der Manuelian, professor of Egyptology and director of the Harvard Semitic Museum, said he knew of Lehner’s work. He said Lehner was known for “fine scholarship and good archaeological technique.”

“He has been exploring this area for many years,” he said.

It was long thought that if the Nile were in flood, the Egyptians could have used water transport to get stones closer to the pyramid, Der Manuelian said.

But Lehner has gone a step further, Der Manuelian said, excavating the area and “giving us a better understanding of the ancient landscape.”

The pyramid complex at Giza includes the Great Pyramid, two smaller pyramids, the Sphinx, and other structures. All are believed to have been built in a 70- to 80-year period about 2500 BC, said Lehner.

“This was an age of experiment ... an innovative time,” said Lehner.

The pyramids’ cores were mostly built from stone that was quarried right at the site, said Lehner. But there is other stone in the pyramids that had to be brought from afar, including granite from Aswan 370 miles to the south and white limestone from Tura, across the Nile.

How that stone got there is the piece of the mystery that Lehner’s theory sheds new light on.

The Nile’s current channel runs five miles from the pyramids, a long distance to drag heavy blocks of stone. Far enough to make you wonder if spaceships and tractor beams, or mystical levitation, may have been involved.

Lehner believes the channel may have run closer to Giza in ancient times and, when the Nile was in flood and spread across its floodplain (the river is now tamed by the Aswan Dam), Egyptian engineers may have seen a way to bring water even closer.

“They dug canals and basins into the floodplain as ambitiously as they quarried the high plateau and built pyramids, tombs, and temples,” he said in a 2014 report on his company’s website.

The blocks hauled by boats would have weighed as much as 15 to 17 tons. Stone could have been offloaded in two places, Lehner said, one close to the Sphinx site and one close to a small temple linked to the Great Pyramid by a causeway.

Lehner has built his theory by looking at archaeological evidence, traces of ancient features on the current landscape, and core drilling samples that revealed deep and solid clay and silt, which he took to be evidence of former river channels and artificial basins.

The waterway theory is bolstered by another discovery Lehner has made. He found and excavated a settlement on the rim of the Giza plateau, uncovering evidence of a major port that he dubbed the “Lost City of the Pyramids.”

Another astonishing piece of the puzzle of the pyramids that has come to light in recent years also dovetails with his theory, said Lehner.

Mark Lehner leaning on the Great Pyramid Susan Hutchison

Archaeologist Pierre Tallet in 2013 found rolls of papyrus in caves on Egypt’s Red Sea coast that were written by men who appear to have participated in the building of the Great Pyramid. The rolls included the journal of an unknown official named Merer who described leading a large team making deliveries. Merer mentions stopping at Tura, the source of the pyramids’ white limestone, filling his boat with stone, and delivering it to Giza.

“Pierre Tallet has done a wonderful job with these texts,” said Lehner. He said his own discovery and Tallet’s find “cross-confirm” each other.

White limestone was used for the flat, smooth outer casing of the pyramids, though most of it is now gone. “Merer and his men were bringing the siding” for the pyramid, Lehner said. “It’s just an everyday account of an employee working on the pyramid.”

Lehner said Tallet once came to give a presentation on his findings to his team and displayed an image of the papyrus that included multiple mentions of the name of Khufu, the pharaoh who is believed to have commissioned the Great Pyramid.

It was clear, Lehner said, that “here’s a guy delivering stone to the Great Pyramid.”

After the presentation, Tallet said to Lehner, “This should put the nail in the coffin of the alternative theorists” who have attributed the building of the pyramids to extraterrestrials or the lost citizens of the legendary civilization of Atlantis.

“We kind of looked at each other and then shook our heads and then said, ‘No, it’s not going to stop all that,’” Lehner said.","Fri, 06 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/3TlcpxtkSF2DZJdgFRQ170olJRc=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UWADEJFIOQI6PERQYREVEAYLS4.jpg,"['built', 'egyptians', 'bring', 'pyramid', 'theory', 'great', 'stone', 'port', 'canal', 'lehner', 'ancient', 'pyramids', 'create', 'nile']", ,flood

CAIRO - 13 September 2019: Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly was updated on the results of a field training on the state’s flood risk management plan, said the Cabinet in a statement on Friday



According to a report issued by the Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC), the field training was conducted on September 4 and 5 in Assiut’s Alexandria Liberation village. The cabinet has formed a national committee for crisis and disaster management and risk reduction, to achieve an effective and immediate response to crisis and disaster risks.



The plan was framed to face expected floods in the governorate and to test the safety of equipment to deal with emergencies, and ensure readiness, the statement added.



The training included stimulation of an emergency case due to heavy rains that led to the flooding in the village, resulting in a power outage, disruption of communications, partial collapse of the main road and some houses and schools.



The trainees worked on urgent actions that should be taken in cooperation among the Traffic Department and the Directorates of Health, Social Solidarity, Supply, Roads and Transportation, and Endowments,the statement continued.



Three days ago, the Red Sea Governorate Authority announced that it has built 16 dams, dug 12 artificial lakes, and made 11 dirt barriers and canals at a cost of LE572 million in order to avert the repercussions of floods caused by rainfall in winter.

21,21,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Rising Sea Levels Threaten Egypt’s Alexandria - VOA Learning English,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/rising-sea-levels-threaten-egypt-s-alexandria/5067579.html,"Rising sea levels are threatening parts of the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria.

Alexander the Great established the city more than 2,000 years ago. In that time, it has survived invasions, fires and earthquakes.

But, Alexandria now faces severe flooding from rising waters blamed on climate change.

Alexandria is Egypt’s second largest city, with more than 5 million people. It is also an important port and home to about 40 percent of Egypt’s industrial activity. The city is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and sits next to a lake.

Officials have built concrete barriers in the sea in an effort to reduce the force of waves. A severe storm in 2015 flooded large parts of the city. At least six people were killed in the flooding, which also caused the collapse of many homes.

In the late 1940s and 50s, Alexandria was a popular place for writers and artists from Egypt and other countries. Today, more than 60 kilometers of waterfront make Alexandria a top summer vacation spot. However, many of the city’s most famous beaches are already showing signs of damage.

The United Nations has warned that worldwide sea levels could rise by 0.98 meters by 2100, with “serious implications for coastal cities, deltas and low-lying states.”

Egypt’s Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said the sea level rose by an average of 1.8 millimeters each year until 1993. Over the next 20 years, it rose by 2.1 millimeters a year. Since 2012, however, the rate became 3.2 millimeters each year.

Measurements show that the land on which Alexandria is built is also sinking at about the same rate. This is expected to increase the risk of dangerous flooding.

A 2018 research study predicted that up to 734 square kilometers of the Nile Delta could be under water by 2050. People living in low-lying areas are already experiencing problems.

A 52-year-old resident of the Shatby neighborhood, Abu Randa, said he has repaired his three-story home twice since the 2015 floods. “We know it is risky. We know that the entire area will be underwater, but we have no alternative,” he told The Associated Press.

Sayed Khalil is a 67-year-old fisherman living in the el-Max neighborhood, where hundreds of people were forced to leave their homes after the flooding in 2015. He said homes have flooded with seawater every winter in recent years. “It is hard to imagine that el-Max will be here in a few decades,” Khalil said. “All these houses might vanish. The area you see now will be an underwater museum.”

The government built sea defenses to protect the neighborhood, but people who live there say it has not made a big difference. “Every year the waves are much stronger than the previous year,” said Abdel-Nabi el-Sayad, a 39-year-old fisherman. “We did not see any improvement. They just forced people to leave.”

Some of the city’s archaeological treasures are also threatened. Among them is the citadel of Qaitbay, a fortress built in the Middle Ages on the ruins of the ancient Pharos lighthouse in the central harbor.

Ashour Abdel-Karim is head of Egypt’s General Authority for Shores Protection. He said the citadel is especially at risk. Powerful waves continue to push against the structure’s foundation. Officials were forced to build a long line of concrete sea barriers that can be seen from the downtown waterfront area known as the Corniche.

The Egyptian government has put aside more than $120 million for the barriers and other protective measures along the shore, Abdel-Karim said. He added that without barriers, parts of the Corniche and other buildings near the shore would be damaged. If that happens, he said, repairs could cost nearly $25 billion.

CAIRO – 25 August 2018: The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation worked on finishing the preparations for winter rains and downpours by carrying out a plan to check the pumping stations, clear canals, water banks and storm drains.



Mohamed Abdel Aati, an official in the ministry, said that the preparation plan included maintenance of all pumping stations nationwide to be ready for sudden rains.

The ministry installed more than 25 emergency units in West Delta near the critical areas, to avoid the recurrence of the 2015 floods.



Khaled Madin, head of the ministry's Irrigation Department said that flood protection projects have been executed, in addition to the projects that have already been accomplished, including 119 dams, about 16 man-made lakes, about 500 underground rainwater tanks, and five channels.



For her part, Nadia Abdel Hamid, a ministry's official, said that a series of flood control projects have been accomplished. The projects included the establishment of numerous man-made lakes, and dams.







In September, Agriculture Minister Ezzedin Abu Stait urged all bodies concerned to take the necessary measures to face possible floods with the beginning of the winter season.

State bodies are always coordinating efforts to better deal with heavy rains and floods and prevent any harm to citizens or damage to their property and crops, Abu Stait said in statements.



Hassan el-Fouly, the director of the General Authority for Agrarian Reform, said directorates in Behaira, Alexandria, Beni Sweif, Fayyoum, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, Luxor and Aswan are urged to coordinate efforts with the Irrigation Ministry to handle the floods, clean canals and make sure warehouses are fit to store production equipment.

Last month, the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, in cooperation with the South Sinai governor, inaugurated a project that built a cement barrier to push floodwater into a man-made lake in al-Ismabiya to save city houses from flood risks.



Over the past two years, the government built a number of lakes and barriers to protect South Sinai, especially Taba, from flood risks. In 2014, several hotels in Taba drowned by floods.

The floods, which hit Egypt’s Saint Catherine over the past two days, resulted in the accumulation of around 10,000 cubic meters of floodwater, said the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation.

23,23,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Venetian anger after historic flood devastates city - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/venetian-anger-after-historic-flood-devastates-city/,"Venetians woke Wednesday to devastating scenes after the highest tide in 50 years washed through the historic Italian city, beaching gondolas, trashing hotels and sending tourists fleeing through rapidly rising waters.

Shopkeepers on the Grand Canal raged against those who have failed to protect the UNESCO city from the high tide, blaming corruption for the much-delayed barrier protection system which could have prevented the disaster.

“The city is on its knees,” Venice’s mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in an interview with national broadcaster RAI.

“There’s widespread devastation,” he said in the famed St. Mark’s Square, which bore the brunt of the flooding.

Tourists lugging heavy suitcases waded in thigh-high galoshes or barefoot through the submerged alleys, as water taxi and gondola drivers baled sewage-tainted water out of their trashed vessels.

The exceptionally intense “acqua alta,” or high waters, peaked at 1.87 meters (six feet). Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 meters in 1966.

“It was unbelievable, the water rose so quickly,” said resident Tiziano Collarin, 59, as he surveyed the damage.

“Windows were blown out, there are those who have lost everything,” he said as the flood alarm rang out to warn those in the canal city that the tide, which had receded somewhat overnight, was coming in once again.

The fire brigade said it had carried out over 250 operations as well as laying on extra boats as water ambulances.

Around 150 fire fighters were deployed to rescue people stranded on jetties and to recover boats broken free from their moorings.

A 78-year old was killed by electric shock as the waters poured into his home, Italian media reported.

President of the Veneto region Luca Zaia said 80 percent of the city had been submerged, causing “unimaginable damage”.

– ‘Horrifying’ –

German tourist Gabi Brueckner, 58, said the nighttime drama had been “horrifying”.

She echoed the mayor in blaming climate change and said she feared like many people that “it will get worse and at some point Venice will drown”.

A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been underway since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.

The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice’s lagoon during high tides — but a recent attempt to test part of the barrier caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered parts had rusted.

“They’ve done nothing, neglected it. It doesn’t work and they have stolen six billion euros. The politicians should all be put in jail,” said local Dino Perzolla, 62.

St. Mark’s Square in one of the lowest parts of the city was particularly affected, its vestibule inundated with water.

“It was apocalyptic, enough to give you goosebumps,” said Marina Vector, as she and her husband used buckets to scoop water out of their shop selling Venetian festival masks.

“The storm was so bad it broke the marble flood barrier out front. Nothing’s survived,” she said.

Tables and chairs set out for aperitifs bobbed outside bedraggled luxury hotels, where people of all ages seeking safety from the storm late Tuesday had been forced to climb in through windows after gangways washed away.

“I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. There was a terrifying wind, it was a hurricane. It was horrible,” said local Cristina, as she fought back tears.

24,24,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ancient Egyptian calendar: 1st calendar known to mankind - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/74680/Ancient-Egyptian-calendar-1st-calendar-known-to-mankind,"Ancient Egyptian Calendar - YouTube

CAIRO - 11 September 2019: Today marks the Egyptian year 6261, the beginning of the first Egyptian and international calendar in human history.



A solar calendar developed by the ancient Egyptians to divide the year into 13 months. It depends on the sun cycle. The Egyptian calendar is one of the first calendars known to mankind.



The ancient Egyptians then discovered the lunar year and divided it for seasons, months, days and hours. They were able to distinguish between a simple year and a leap, an astronomical miracle at the time.



The Coptic calendar, or the ""Martyrs' Calendar,"" relies mainly on the ancient Egyptian calendar. It is called the solar calendar. It is an arithmetic system the ancient Egyptians established for the division of the year. The year they created consists of 13 months.



The calendar was calculated based on the sun cycle, and is one of the first calendars known to mankind and the most accurate in terms of climate conditions and agriculture during the year, where the Egyptian farmer has been relying on it to determine the seasons of agriculture and crop yielding for thousands of years.



The Egyptian calendar contributed to the development of different calendars of ancient civilizations, whether they were solar or lunar. Although thousands of years have passed since the beginning of the ancient Egyptian calendar, which relied on the Nile flood in determining the beginning of the year, it is also the current calendar that regulates agriculture in Egypt in modern times.



The researchers believe that the Egyptian calendar was founded by the ancient Egyptians and the calculations are conducted according to the rotation of the sun, dividing the year into thirteen months.



Despite the series of changes that have affected it later, it is the most accurate calendar so far because of the weather conditions as well as the different seasons of agriculture.



According to the Egyptian researcher Joseph Mamdouh Tawfik, the ancient Egyptian calendar is highly accurate and was a miracle of its time. However, it is not exactly in line with the current Gregorian calendar used around the world.

25,25,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Japan rescuers go house to house as flood toll hits 141 - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/japan-rescuers-go-house-house-flood-toll-hits-141/,"Rescue workers carried out house-to-house searches Tuesday in the increasingly unlikely hope of finding survivors after days of deadly floods and landslides that have claimed 141 lives in one of Japan’s worst weather-related disasters for decades. The record downpours that began last week have stopped and receding flood waters have laid bare the destruction that has cut a swathe through the west of the country.

In the city of Kurashiki, the flooding engulfed entire districts at one point, forcing some people to their rooftops to wait for rescue.

By Tuesday morning, rescue workers were going door-to-door, looking for survivors — or victims — of the disaster.

“It’s what we call a grid operation, where we are checking every single house to see if there are people still trapped inside them,” an official with the local Okayama prefecture government told AFP.

“We know it’s a race against time, we are trying as hard as we can.”

Hideto Yamanaka was leading a team of around 60 firefighters dispatched from outside the prefecture searching homes.

“I’m afraid elderly people who were living alone may have failed to escape,” said Yamanaka, 53.

“Physically weak people may have been late in getting out when it suddenly started raining hard, swamping the area,” he told AFP.

In the Mabi district of Kurashiki, the water left behind a fine yellow silt that has transformed the area into moonscape. Cars driving through kicked up clouds of dust. People walking around wore medical masks or covered their mouths with small towels to protect themselves against the particulates.

Stores were still closed, and inside one barber’s shop the red sofas, customer chairs, and standing hair dryers were all covered with the same silt.

Fumiko Inokuchi, 61, was inside her home, sorting through the damage caused by floods that submerged the entire first floor.

She escaped the house on Saturday, crossing the street to take shelter in a three-storey care home for the elderly, from where she watched in horror as the waters rose.

“I saw my house sink underwater and I couldn’t do anything at all, there was just nothing I could do. I felt helpless,” she said, retrieving a photo of her children playing baseball.

“I got married here, and we built this house two years afterwards. We raised our three small sons to adulthood here, there are so many memories,” she said, her eyes welling with tears.

New dangers from heat

The crisis is the deadliest rain-related disaster in over three decades, and has sparked national grief.

On Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a four-stop foreign trip as the death toll rose, and his office said he would visit Okayama on Wednesday.

Top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday that at least 141 people had been killed. Media said dozens more remained missing and the tally was expected to rise further.

Around 75,000 police, firemen and troops have been deployed in the search and rescue operation across parts of central and western Japan, Suga said, warning that hot weather posed new risks.

Thousands of people remain in shelters, and local authorities in some areas were offering drinking water and bathing services for those without their own supply. “It will be over 35 Celsius in some areas… Please be careful about heatstroke if you’re doing reconstruction outdoors, and continue to be vigilant about landslides,” Suga said.

The government said it would tap around $20 million in reserve funds to provide aid to those affected by the disaster.

And even with the rains over, the risk of flooding remained, with the town of Fuchu in Hiroshima issuing a new evacuation order as a local river burst its banks.

“Driftwood and dirt has piled up… and now the water has started overflowing from the river,” a spokesman for the local fire department told AFP.

“We are on high alert,” he added.

Television stations showed muddy water cresting river banks and patrolling firefighters shouting through loudspeakers: “This area is dangerous. Evacuate to higher ground now.”","Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/09/japan-flood.jpg,"['told', 'water', 'area', 'local', 'rescue', 'house', 'river', 'japan', '141', 'inside', 'rescuers', 'toll', 'flood', 'hits', 'yamanaka', 'suga']", ,flood
26,26,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Climate change threatens the Nile's critical water supply - Quartz,https://qz.com/1709757/climate-change-threatens-the-niles-critical-water-supply/,"The Nile river snakes through 11 countries, providing hundreds of millions of people with the majority of their water supply. For many, it is their only water source. Egypt, for one, gets about 85% of its water from the river—and experts expect the country to face a nationwide freshwater shortage by 2025.

A new study published in the journal Earth’s Future on Aug. 28 takes a broad view of the impending Nile water problem: Researchers from Dartmouth College used climate models, population trends, and crop failures to model the next 50 years along the river. The short of it is that the upper Nile basin—including western Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda—is likely to feel an acute squeeze for Nile water, and soon. And because nearly all the rain that feeds the river falls on the upper Nile region, parts of the lower Nile basin, mainly Sudan and Egypt, depend heavily on the water that flows from there.

The region is about to take a one-two punch. Population in the upper Nile basin is set to double between now and 2040, from its current 200 million to 400 million people. At the same time, an uptick of hotter, drier years are set to parch the system. By the late 21st century, the researchers write, the frequency of hot and dry years may rise by “a factor of 1.5 to 3,” even if warming is limited to a global average of 2 °C.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh Water from the Nile flows from a pump in eastern Cairo, Egypt.

Meanwhile, Ethiopia is nearing the completion of a massive hydroelectric dam on the Nile. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is expected to cost anywhere from $4 billion to $6.4 billion and produce some 15 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, more than three times the output of the Hoover Dam in the US. That could have major impacts in a country where more than half the population lacks access to electricity.

But the vast reservoir will take 5 to 15 years to fill. Previous research has suggested that climate change will make the river’s flow 50% more variable, swinging from drought one year to flooding the next and making the dam more difficult to operate. During that 15-year period, the new study suggests, flows from the Nile into Egypt could drop by as much as 25%.

With the Nile supplying the vast majority of Egypt’s water, the dam has caused major political controversy. In 2013, former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was caught on camera proposing military strikes in response to the potential project.

Climate change is primed to increase tensions over Nile water. By 2030, the Dartmouth researchers write, the flow of the Nile will regularly fail to meet demand, and between 20% and 40% of the population will face water scarcity even during “normal years.”

By the 2080s, things could get much worse. According to the study’s projections, roughly 170 million people will face water scarcity during normal years. During hot and dry years, that already-reduced water supply will be cut by approximately 20%—events the researchers call “negative shocks.” During these periods, which will increase with frequency and duration as the century advances, between 30% and 55% of the population won’t have enough water. That’s roughly 200 million deprived of water, or the equivalent of the region’s entire population today.

Talks between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam are currently deadlocked. “If the water that’s coming to Egypt reduced by 2%, we would lose about 200,000 acres of land. One acre at least makes one family survive. A family in Egypt is average…about five persons. So this means about 1 million will be jobless,” Mohamed Abdel Aty, Egypt’s minister of water resources and irrigation, told the BBC last year. “It is an international security issue.”

While the Dartmouth study doesn’t take the dam into account, its findings have the potential to exacerbate the fears of water scarcity central to the debate. The “overall increase in water scarcity in the region will likely make the construction and placement of new dams harder to agree on than it already is,” Ethan Coffel, a fellow at Dartmouth’s Neukom Institute for Computational Science and lead author of the study, said in an email.

One fact appears, on the surface, to ease the region’s fears: Over the same period that temperatures will rise, rainfall is projected to increase. But the paper shatters that hope. Even if rainfall does increase, an increase in storms won’t be able to soften the blows dealt by the growing population and the increase in hotter, drier seasons. More rainfall is not always a good thing: As has been projected in California, the region could experience “precipitation whiplash,” a destructive cycle of floods and droughts.

And while temperature increases are fairly straightforward to model, precipitation is one of the most difficult climate impacts to predict: Rainfall might not, in fact, increase. “If precipitation remains constant or declines in the future, hot and dry years will become more frequent than we project here,” the researchers write. In those cases, water scarcity for Nile countries will be even more dire.

27,27,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Monsoon rains wreak flood havoc across South Asia - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/monsoon-rains-wreak-flood-havoc-across-south-asia/,"Survivors scrambled for higher ground as torrential monsoon rains swept away homes and triggered landslides across South Asia Tuesday, with millions of people affected and at least 180 dead, officials said.

The monsoon is crucial for irrigation and groundwater supplies in the impoverished region — home to a fifth of the world’s population — and brings relief after the unforgiving summer.

But the downpours — which stretch from June to September — can turn deadly, and have wreaked havoc again this year across India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with people, dwellings and boats in remote low-lying areas washed away.

“Entire communities have been cut off by rising waters, increasing the risk of people going hungry and getting sick,” Xavier Castellanos, of the International Federation of Red Cross, said of the growing crisis.

In Mumbai, a building collapsed in a cramped neighborhood, killing four people and trapping 12 following heavy rains in the city.

Almost a third of Bangladesh — a delta country criss-crossed by hundreds of rivers — was underwater, Arifuzzaman Bhuyan of the state-run Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre told AFP.

At least 14 major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, burst their banks and were flowing above “danger levels”, marooning hundreds of thousands, he added.

The toll in the flood-prone country rose to 34, including five children who drowned, 18 others hit by lightning and seven who drowned after their boat capsized in choppy waters in the Bay of Bengal.

In Nepal, at least 78 people died and 16,000 families were displaced, although flood waters have started receding. Images showed rescuers using inflatable dinghies to evacuate families trapped in flooded houses.

“The ground floor of our house was completely submerged,” Rajaram Yadav, 45, told AFP from a district near the border with India.

“Our family and some neighbors survived by staying at the top floor for two days. Most one-floor mud houses in the areas have been severely damaged.”

Health experts have warned of possible outbreaks of waterborne diseases and called for international help.

Red alert

Nearly 50 people have been killed in India, with two eastern states — Assam and Bihar, which borders Nepal — bearing the brunt of the deluge.

Authorities in Assam declared a red alert Monday as the flood situation turned critical, with villages cut off by surging waters and a major highway submerged.

Photos showed residents crammed in boats carrying their belongings to safer areas in Morigaon, one of the worst-affected districts, and just the roofs of submerged homes above water.

So far 11 people have died in the state and some 83,000 people displaced by flooding.

Authorities have raced to reach animals marooned by the deluge at the state’s World-Heritage listed Kaziranga National Park, which is home to two-thirds of the world’s one-horned rhinos.

In Bihar, 25 deaths were reported, with 2.5 million residents affected.

Among the dead were three children who drowned as they went to check the rising water level in a canal. Two others died while playing near a ditch filled with floodwater, the Press Trust of India reported.

Further northwest, in the Pakistan-administered part of the Kashmir region, flash floods killed 23 people and damaged 120 houses, with the water and power supplies crippled.

The United Nations said Monday it “stands ready to work with the authorities in the affected countries as they respond to the humanitarian needs resulting from this ongoing monsoon season”.

CAIRO – 17 July 2018: The High Dam is prepared for the annual flooding of the Nile River for the 2018-2019 water year, which starts in August, as the necessary maintenance work has been carried out for its gates to regulate the flow of water and control the flood, according to Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel-Ati.This came during his visit to Aswan on Monday to inspect the preparations made at the High Dam as well as the facilities annex to the High Dam and the Aswan Reservoir.Abdel-Ati remarked that mechanisms were set to deal with the flood; water levels rise as flood arrives from the Ethiopian highlands across the Blue Nile then to Khartoum, Sudan, before entering Aswan's Lake Nasser in Egypt.He further remarked that Sudan has also put new storage program and mechanisms to operate its annual reservoirs and maintain the water balance between the discharge, the water volume needed by countries and the required water volume for storage to compensate the losses of the water level.He pointed out the Nile River Committee periodically receives the reports issued by the irrigation missions in Uganda and Sudan, which estimate the countries’ shares of water, rainfall rates and the amount of water collected from rains at Lake Nasser; the reports also ensure the fair redistribution of water among basin countries based on their needs.He added that it is difficult to specify the amount of the current flood as the rainfall rates at Ethiopian highlands is fluctuating, noting that he inspected Toshka lakes to ensure its preparedness for the flood.Egypt’s share of water is 114 billion cubic meters from all different sources. One of the main pillars of the national strategy for water resources 2017-2037 is to rationalize water use by reducing cultivation of water consuming crops, Ministry of Irrigation spokesperson Hossam el-Emam told the “Ra’ayAam” (Public Opinion) TV show on January 27.Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Abdel Aty recently decided to reduce the rice cultivationarea in Egypt from 1,700,000 feddans to 724,200 feddans (1 feddan = 1.038 acres) in order to rationalize water use.The decision identified nine governorates to grow rice according to the relevant studies: Kafr El-Sheikh, Sharqia, Damietta, Dakahlia, Beheira, Alexandria, Ismailia, Port Said and Gharbia. The ministry stressed that those who do not comply with the decisions will be subject to penalties.At the same time, Egypt is negotiating with the African front to guarantee its rights in Nile water amid establishing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Recently a tripartite summit was held between Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and resigned Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn at Sisi's presidential residence in Addis Ababa during the African Union (AU)’s 30th summit.The three countries sealedan agreement on a single vision based on the Declaration of Principles signed in Khartoum and raising the no-harm principle of the three countries’ interests.","Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/32932.jpg,"['water', 'starts', 'preparations', 'high', 'river', 'annual', 'prepared', 'irrigation', 'flood', 'upcoming', 'nile', 'countries', 'dam', 'season']", ,flood

Luigi Brugnaro ordered the iconic square closed ahead of the latest sea surge of around 1.6 metres (over five feet) mid-morning as strong storms and winds batter the region — lower than Tuesday’s peak but still dangerous.

“I’m forced to close the square to avoid health risks for citizens… a disaster,” Brugnaro said.

Churches, shops and homes in the city of canals have been inundated by unusually intense “acqua alta,” or high waters, which on Tuesday hit their highest level in half a century.

“We’ve destroyed Venice, we’re talking about a billion (euros) in damage and that’s just from the other day, not today,” Brugnaro said as far-right leader Matteo Salvini joined the list of politicians to visit the stricken city.

The crisis, driven by bad weather, has prompted the government to release 20 million euros ($22 million) in funds to tackle the devastation.

Before it was closed, tourists had been larking around in the flooded St Mark’s Square in the sunshine during breaks from the rain, snapping selfies in neon plastic boots.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who has called the flooding “a blow to the heart of our country”, on Thursday declared the emergency.

Earlier that day he met Venice’s mayor and emergency services before jumping in a speed boat to visit businesses and locals affected by the tide.

Residents whose houses had been hit would immediately get up to 5,000 euros in government aid, while restaurant and shop owners could receive up to 20,000 euros and apply for more later, he said.

As authorities assessed the extent of the damage to Venice’s cultural treasures, such as St Mark’s Basilica where water invaded the crypt, locals were defiant.

Many stopped for their usual coffees at flooded bars, drinking espresso while standing in several inches of water.

“It’s shocking to see this, having water up to your knees,” said Mexican tourist Oscar Calzada, 19.

“You have to be here to believe it and hopefully it won’t happen again, it’ll only be once in a lifetime type thing.”

Need to adapt

The Locanda Al Leon hotel said bookings had suffered from the international media coverage of the flood, with some guests cancelling their rooms after seeing images of Venice underwater.

Tuesday’s high waters submerged around 80 percent of the city, officials said.

Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 meters in 1966.

“It makes me question what Venice is going to be like in 50 years,” said California student David Melendez, 20.

“Hopefully this beautiful city can survive and our sons and grandsons can see it.”

Many, including Venice’s mayor, have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that Italy — a country prone to natural disasters — must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons.

“We need to be resilient and adapt. We need a policy that looks at the climate through completely different eyes,” Environment Minister Sergio Costa said Thursday.

The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to a mere 50,000 residents but receives 36 million global visitors each year.

A massive infrastructure project has been underway since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.

The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice’s lagoon during high tides — but a recent attempt to test part of it caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered it had rusted.

Tony Robinson visited Gebel el-Silsila to meet with archaeologist John Ward for his new Channel 5 show “Egyptian Tomb Hunting,” who had uncovered what he believed to be an entrance to a hidden chamber. The hole, which scaled down more than 20 feet, was completely filled with water. Unsure on the source of the pool, the pair used pumps in a bid to get a look at what could be hiding inside.

After crawling on their hands and knees through a thick layer of mud, they got to a huge chamber, with another door awaiting them ahead. Mr Robinson asked: “Look at it, what do you reckon would be in there?” Before Mr Ward responded: “I don’t know, it’s totally different to any of our tombs that we’ve found in Silsila. “If that secondary chamber is another burial, we’re not talking about 50-60 people plus.""

The archaeologists uncovered an amazing find

Mr Robinson was stunned by the tomb, adding: “And all their bits and pieces are mixed in beneath our knees, like human soup. “The idea that so many people might be down here is pretty eerie, and some of them at least must have been of real status. “This chamber has been carefully chiselled out, and this doorway beautifully finished.” The pair began excavating the tomb, getting completely covered in dirt in the process. Mr Ward told viewers: “What’s intriguing me is that the ceiling is vaulted, it has got an arch to it. JUST IN: 'The spy in the BBC’ How undercover Nazi sent coded messages over national radio

Egypt’s Ministry of Irrigation noted that increasing flooding rates improve water quality by achieving environmental balance and disposing of the pollutants in the Nile River.

During a meeting with Minister of Irrigation Mohammed Abdel Atty and the National Water Research Center, the committee presented the 2019 Nile flooding situation and explained the flood’s impacts on the total water resources in Egypt.

The committee explained water management and distribution mechanisms and measures of rehabilitating and upgrading the outlets of the canals.

Abdel Atty said in 2018 that 114 billion cubic meters of water are required to meet the country’s agricultural, industrial, drinking, and home usage needs.

During the Supreme Council of Culture’s “Water and Sustainable Development” symposium, Abdel Atty said that Egypt suffers from a 54 billion cubic meter water shortage. Egypt’s usable water, coming from the Nile River, precipitation and groundwater, only reached 60 billion cubic meters.

Abdel Atty added that Egypt currently makes up for water shortages through the reuse of agricultural drainage water, of which 20 billion cubic meters is available, accounting for 33 percent of the total usable water. Meanwhile, the country needs 34 billion cubic meters to produce food stuff rather than importing it.

About 50,000 homes have been destroyed, according to one Kerala legislator, and people are flocking to the camps as the scale of the desolation is revealed by receding waters.

A total of 1,028,000 people were now recorded in about 3,200 relief camps across the state, a state government spokesman told AFP.

Six more bodies were found Monday, he added, taking the toll to more than 410 since the monsoon started in June.

At Chengannur, one of the worst-hit towns, more than 60 centimetres (two feet) of water still blocked many roads as more rain fell Tuesday.

Army teams said several thousand people in the town remained in homes inundated by 10 days of torrential downpours that have battered the state.

Rescue teams in Chengannur on Tuesday finally reached the house of retired army officer K.G. Pillai, who said up to 2.4 metres (eight feet) of water had engulfed the house where his family had lived since 1952.

“In the past there has never been more than one foot of floods and people are not used to this,” he said.

Many roads and homes around Pillai’s house remained inaccessible.

“Around 26 people moved into the first floor of our home” to take refuge from the floods, he said.

A senior army officer involved in the rescue operation in Chengannur said authorities believed most of the people left in town did not want to be evacuated and were instead seeking food and water.

“We received a distress call late yesterday to rescue a disabled child and will be going in today on boats to check if there are others who need assistance,” he said.

Relief efforts

Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out across the state to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas.

Dozens of helicopters and even drones have been dropping food, medicine and water to cut-off villages.

Tens of thousands of people in Chengannur and surrounding towns and villages are relying on community kitchens for meals, after water from hilly districts in Kerala’s north poured down into lowland regions.

“People have lost all or most of their belongings in the last few days,” the officer said.

Shashi Tharoor, a deputy from Kerala and former UN official, estimated that 50,000 houses had been destroyed. He said he would seek possible UN assistance in relief efforts during a trip to Geneva this week.

Millions of dollars in donations have poured into the state from the rest of India and abroad since the extent of the devastation became known.

Supreme Court judges have donated $360 each while the British-based Sikh group Khalsa Aid International has set up its own relief camp in Kochi, Kerala’s main city, to provide 3,000 meals a day.","Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/09/flood-1.jpg,"['relief', 'water', 'kerala', 'house', 'india', 'state', 'chengannur', 'floods', 'million', 'homes', 'officer', 'flood', 'camps']", ,flood
36,36,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flash Flooding: Is Egypt Really Prepared? - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/311488/Egypt/Politics-/Flash-Flooding-Is-Egypt-Really-Prepared-.aspx,"In 2015, seven lives were lost in Alexadria to flash flooding. However, official reports covering that period had expected little to no rain. In the following years various promises were made to prevent an incident of this sort from occurring again.

Yet, in the wake of global increases in the effects of climate change, Mahmoud Shahin – the Head of Meteorological Authority's Analysis Center – two weeks ago warned that Egypt ought to expect a flood season around the 22 September.

Meanwhile, the question of our preparedness for dealing with the consequences of climate shifts remains unanswered. Whilst previous floods have resulted in lost lives, damage to private and public property, power cuts, closing of roads, road accidents and public outrage, Shahin cautions that the highest amount of rainfall of 2018 could be this autumn.

While official reports failed to predict the 2015 Alexandria flash flood, according to a statement on the official website of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, they assert their reliance on a precise warning system through the monitoring of weather patterns all in an effort to ensure preparedness for heavy rainfall and flash floods.

In response to the loss of twenty-six lives across three governorates in 2016, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi promised to improve drainage networks within the span of one year. By December 2017, he issued a statement assuring that these improvements have taken place. In contrast, in another call for improvements, necessary after the flash flooding earlier in 2018 that affected many cities including Cairo, former Prime Minister Sherif Ismail called for precautions to be taken in all governorates to ensure the prevention of flash floods.

In a statement to Masrawy last week engineer Abd El-Latif Khaled, head of the irrigation department, said that for the past two months a systematic maintenance and clearance of waterways had taken place, including 117 artificial water passages. He added that the ministry ensures its preparedness for this flash flood season through dams and man-made lakes, robust equipment and established outlines for the direct coordination between governorates.

Mohamed Faheem, the Executive Manager of the Information Center of Climate Change, said to Al-Ahram Online that the effects of global warming are not merely confined to rainfall. The summer is expected to get longer and hotter, in which it is predicted to exceed 50% of the year. Meanwhile the winter is expected to get shorter and colder. He elaborated that the changes are obvious and accumulative, and that they are expected to have exponential impact on agricultural production.

Faheem, who anticipates rainfall throughout the southeast of Egypt to start around 7 September, states that preparedness for flash floods also varies by terrain: the desert has the largest capacity for storing excess rain but the facilities are lacking, agricultural land should be using the water for rationed irrigation, and urban areas are in desperate need for drainage channels as well as possibly filtering and draining water into canals and rivers.

""2-3 billion meter cubed of rainfall is expected to fall this winter throughout Egypt. If we had the facilities to store this water, which we don't, we could plant a million acres in the desert"", Faheem says.

He asserts water levels of rivers and canals should be reduced to allow for expected increases in water levels. He added that sewers are currently too overloaded to drain rain water.

On September 1, Saint Catherine in South Sinai had unanticipated rain which surprisingly caused no damage. The rain provided water for irrigation and formed ponds and lakes between valleys, aiding wildlife. The lack of damage was attributed by many to be due to the precautions taken by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. On the other hand, Faheem stated that it was not a flash flood, as due to the nature of the terrain, the rain was successfully stored. He attributed the lack of damages to the nature of the terrain and lack of built infrastructure.

Faheem sums up, ""We are not ready for the next rain season and cities are expected to suffer severe damages due to the lack of separate drainage channels, thus the rain is expected to overload sewer channels.""

Globally, there is growing significant alarm over these changing conditions caused by climate change. Most recently, typhoon Jebi caused severe damage in Japan forcing the closure of Kansai Airport, near Osaka.

On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a speech at the UN Headquarters that ""runaway climate change"" is an imminent probability if the current attitude to climate change remains till 2020. Runaway climate change is a theoretically anticipated point in which the accumulative effects of climate change would create an irreversible loop of extreme heat, wildfires, storms and floods. This point is suggested by some scientists to be the cause of the inhabitability of Venus.

In the midst of different definitions of what constitutes preparedness for adverse weather, and conflicting views on climate change and ways in which to potentially deal with it, the only certainty is that increasing rainfall and colder winter ought to be expected.

37,37,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Fears flood water runoff could 'smother' Barrier Reef - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/fears-flood-water-runoff-could-smother-barrier-reef/,"Runoff from recent floods in northern Australia is flowing onto parts of the Barrier Reef, scientists said Friday, starving coral of light and providing fodder for the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish.

Parts of northern Queensland are still reeling after nearly two weeks of unprecedented rainfall that turned roads into rivers and inundated hundreds of homes with floodwater.

Scientists at James Cook University say the floods swelled a number of rivers along hundreds of kilometers of coastline, spilling sediment onto the reef which has reduced water quality and much-needed sunlight.

“Coral reef and seagrass need light to maintain their growth and health,” researcher Jane Waterhouse from James Cook University told AFP.

Calm weather following the extended period of rain means the murky water is yet to disperse.

It threatens to “smother” coral in areas worst hit, like at the mouth of north Queensland’s Burdekin river, where a brown flood plume has spread some 100 kilometres offshore.

“If that were to stay there then eventually, it would not take that long for some of those systems to die off,” Waterhouse added.

The effects will not be fully understood until monitoring was completed over the next few of months after sediment has dispersed and settled.

The 2,300-kilometre (1,400-mile) reef has already suffered from back-to-back coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017, where swathes have been killed by rising sea temperatures linked to climate change.

The predatory crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat coral, have also proliferated on the reef due to pollution and agricultural runoff.

The recent floods have exacerbated the runoff, causing algae to grow in some areas.

“This provides a brilliant food source to allow those populations to thrive,” Waterhouse added.","Sat, 16 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2019/02/30434595e8f6132be254266480dda1cbffe6b878.jpg,"['recent', 'reef', 'water', 'university', 'rivers', 'runoff', 'coral', 'floods', 'barrier', 'flood', 'waterhouse', 'smother', 'fears', 'sediment']", ,flood

The villages were close to the Dez and Karkheh rivers, Shush county governor Adnan Qazi was quoted by IRNA as saying.

At least 47 people were killed in the past two weeks in flash floods in various provinces in Iran, from north to south, after the heaviest rains in the country in at least a decade.

Iran has announced a state of emergency in several provinces threatened by flooding and tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes in the flood-hit provinces, where dozens of villages have been evacuated already.

President Hassan Rouhani, accused by critics of mishandling the crisis, has promised compensation to all those affected.

The head of the judiciary, hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, has said that officials who mishandled the disaster and caused the death of civilians could face prosecution.

Authorities are concerned about rising threats of dam failures and water releases that could create further damage in various provinces.

Officials in Tehran have called on people to stay away from rivers and areas near dams, saying that all the relevant organizations were on high-alert due to possibility of flooding in the capital.

Floods have affected at least 26 out of Iran’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19.

39,39,FL-2019-000179-CAN,The Nile: Longest River in the World - Live Science,https://www.livescience.com/57023-nile-river-facts.html,"The Nile River, considered the longest river in the world, is approximately 4,258 miles (6,853 kilometers) long, but its exact length is a matter of debate. Flowing northward through the tropical climate of eastern Africa and into the Mediterranean Sea, the river passes through 11 countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt.

The Nile has two major tributaries: the longer White Nile, considered the prime stream and headwaters; and the Blue Nile, which carries about two-thirds of the river's water volume and most of the silt.

The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, which touches the countries of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. But Lake Victoria isn't necessarily the most distant and ""true"" source of the Nile River because the lake itself has many feeder rivers coming in from the surrounding mountains. In 2006, a British explorer named Neil McGrigor said he'd traveled to the Nile's most distant source at the beginning of the Kagera River, Lake Victoria's longest feeder river.

Still, experts do not agree which tributary of the Kagera is the longest — and therefore the most distant — source of the Nile. Ultimately, it would be either the Ruvyironza in Burundi or the Nyabarongo from the Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.

Much less disputable is the Blue Nile's source at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The Blue Nile meets up with the White Nile near Sudan's capital city, Khartoum. From there, the river flows north through the desert in Egypt, and finally, by way of a large delta, the Nile flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The Nile Delta

The Nile waters flow at an average volume of 300 million cubic meters (79.2 billion gallons) per day, according to Travelling Along Rivers, a Dutch bilingual travel magazine. It takes approximately three months for the waters near the town of Jinja, Uganda (the point where the Nile leaves Lake Victoria), to reach the Mediterranean Sea.

The Nile Delta is approximately 100 miles (161 km) long from north to south, and it spreads out along about 150 miles (241 km) of Egyptian coastline, from Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east. It is one of the world's largest river deltas with about 40 million inhabitants — approximately half of Egypt's population. Just before reaching the Mediterranean Sea, the river splits into two main branches, the Rosetta Branch (to the west) and the Damietta (to the east).

Ancient mythology of the Nile

Perhaps no river on Earth has captured the human imagination quite like the Nile River. From stories of Pharaohs and man-eating crocodiles to the discovery of the Rosetta stone, it was here, along the river's fertile banks, that one of the world's most remarkable civilizations — Ancient Egypt — was born around 3000 B.C. The Nile was not only the source of life for the ancient Egyptians, but is still so today for the millions of people living along its banks.

Known as both the ""Father of Life"" and the ""Mother of All Men,"" the Nile was the center of life in Ancient Egypt. In the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile was called ?'pi or Iteru, meaning ""river."" The Ancient Egyptians also called the river Ar or Aur, which means ""black,"" in reference to the black silt left behind after the yearly flooding.

The Nile River was central to the Ancient Egyptians rise to wealth and power. Since rainfall is almost non-existent in Egypt, the Nile River and its yearly floodwaters offered the people a fertile oasis for rich agriculture.

The Nile is associated with many gods and goddesses, all of whom the Egyptians believed were deeply intertwined with the blessings and curses of the land, weather, culture and abundance of the people. They believed the gods were intimately involved with the people and could help them in all facets of their lives.

In some myths, the Nile was considered a manifestation of the god Hapi who blessed the land with abundance, according to the Ancient History Encyclopedia. Isis, the goddess of the Nile and the ""Giver of Life,"" was believed to have taught the people how to farm and work the land.

The water god Khnum, who ruled over all forms of water, even the lakes and rivers in the underworld, was believed to be in charge of the amount of silt that flooded the river banks every year. In later dynasties, Khnum branched out to become the god of rebirth and creation as well.

Flooding

Each year, heavy summer rains upstream and melting snow in the Ethiopian Mountains would fill the Blue Nile well over its capacity and send a torrent of water downstream. The extra water would then spill over the banks onto the dry desert land of Egypt. Once the floods subsided, thick black silt, or mud, would be left behind on the ground. The silt created rich, fertile soil for planting crops — vital in this land of so little rain. Approximately 96 percent of the sediment carried by the Nile River originates in Ethiopia, according to the New World Encyclopedia. The silt area was known as the Black Land, while the desert lands further out were known as the Red Land.

Each year, the Ancient Egyptian people eagerly awaited and thanked the gods for the life-giving floods. If the floods were too small, there would be difficult times ahead with little food. If the floods were too large, it could cause flooding harm in the surrounding villages.

The Egyptian calendar was divided into three stages based on the yearly flood cycle: Akhet, the first season of the year, which covered the flooding period between June and September; Peret, the growing and sowing time from October to mid-February; and Shemu, the time of harvesting between mid-February and the end of May.

In 1970, the Aswan High Dam was built in Egypt to help regulate the Nile's flooding. Although the floods were desperately needed in older times, they are less necessary and even a nuisance to modern civilization with its irrigation systems. Even though the floods no longer occur along the Nile, the memory of this fertile blessing is still celebrated in Egypt today, mainly as an entertainment for tourists. The annual celebration, known as Wafaa El-Nil, begins on August 15th and lasts for two weeks.

Sharing the Nile

Because 11 countries must share one precious resource, there are bound to be disputes. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), an intergovernmental partnership among all the Basin States, was formed in 1999. It offers a forum for discussion and coordination among the countries to help manage and share the river's resources.

Joseph Awange is an associate professor in the department of spatial sciences at Curtin University in Australia. Using satellites, he has been monitoring the volume of water in the Nile River and reporting the findings to the Basin countries so they can effectively plan for sustainable use of the river's resources.

Of course, getting all the countries to agree on what they believe is fair and equal use of the Nile's resources is no easy task. ""Lower countries (Egypt and Sudan) rely on some old treaty that they signed with Britain decades ago to impose unrealistic water use conditions to the upper countries,"" said Awange. ""For this reason, some countries, e.g., Ethiopia, have decided to disregard the treaty and are busy constructing large hydropower dams within the Blue Nile.""

Awange is referring to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), currently under construction on the Blue Nile. It is located just over 300 miles northwest of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. When complete, the GERD will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa and one of the largest in the world. Controversy has surrounded the project since its beginning in 2011 as downstream nations rely heavily on the Nile's waters for their drinking water, agriculture and industrial needs.

Wildlife

The Nile River and its banks are abundant with many varieties of animal life. These include the rhinoceros, African tigerfish (the ""piranha of Africa""), Nile monitors, enormous Vundu catfish, hippopotamuses, wildebeests, baboons, frogs, mongooses, turtles, tortoises and over 300 species of birds. Hundreds of thousands of water birds spend their winters in the Nile Delta. This includes the world's largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns.

Possibly the most well-known animal — and most feared — is the Nile crocodile. This fearsome predator has a reputation as a man eater and rightly so. Nile crocodiles can reach lengths of 18 to 20 feet, and unlike their American cousins, can be quite aggressive toward people. Estimates say that about 200 people a year are killed by these reptiles, according to National Geographic.

But at the ancient temple of Kom Ombo, 400 miles south of Cairo, where archaeologists recently unearthed a stack of decaying mummies, peril takes a more prosaic form: waterlogged foundations.

Decades of flood irrigation in the surrounding fields, which were once desert, have soaked the soil beneath the temple. Water has penetrated the sandstone foundations, combining with salt and heat to scrub some hieroglyphs from the temple walls. The symbols and figures, effectively the lines of an ancient story, are fading to dust.

The solution, according to engineers on a $9 million American-financed project, is some modern drainage. Since October 2017, dozens of laborers have been digging a 30-foot-deep trench around the temple walls in an effort to drain the groundwater and divert it back into the Nile.","Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/world/26egypt1-print/00egypt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2f7532b53a7859b27668ce26b696ac219c1e9fdb65cf3dccd0cf33f5bf3ca7de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['ombo', 'water', 'walls', 'temple', 'mummy', 'waterlogged', 'valley', 'newest', 'bad', 'unearthed', 'curse', 'kom', 'drainage', 'ancient', 'egypt']", ,none

“The Blue Nile flood is known to last from June until the end of September each year.

The river receives great inflow of water and then later on in the year the flow drops,” Hossam al-Imam, spokesperson for the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said in a statement.

He reiterated that the quantities of water present in that lake do not represent any damage to Egypt’s water quota.

Egypt fears the dam will affect its historic Nile water share of 55 billion square meters, which it has had access to since the historic 1959 agreement with Sudan.

Ethiopia, meanwhile, has reassured Cairo that its water share will not be affected.

In 2011, Ethiopia started construction on the Renaissance Dam over the Blue Nile River, one of the major sources of the water that forms the River Nile downstream.

The dam is expected to be ready in 2017.

Ethiopians see it as is a great national project and a means of overcoming poverty.

Earlier in June, the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry official spokesperson Ahmed Abu Zeid asserted that Egypt’s water security is non-negotiable, saying that it is considered a red line that no one can approach.

When completed, the dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa, and one of the largest of its kind in the world. It was estimated in 2016 that the process of filling the dam with water (approximately 74 billion cubic meters) may take between five to 15 years.

According to global calculators of water scarcity, Egypt is already classified as being a water-stressed country, while Ethiopia is classified as being on the brink of water stress.","Thu, 13 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/09/aleqm5hdal-cous0epcvr_jamiuzc5m71w.jpg,"['water', 'ministry', 'affect', 'river', 'level', 'spokesperson', 'dam', 'statement', 'flood', 'share', 'resources', 'nile', 'renaissance', 'egypts', 'security']", ,none

Changes in summer flooding of the Nile are driven by volcanoes as far away as Iceland.

Ancient natural changes, or man-made ones, can affect modern man today, researchers say.

© Getty Images In 2010, the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland grounded flights to and from Europe, causing the largest air-traffic disruption since World War II. Now, a new study shows that violent volcanic eruptions in Iceland and elsewhere led to social and political unrest in ancient Egypt by disrupting the regular flooding of the Nile on which agriculture depended.

In addition to shedding light on Egyptian history, the findings highlight the value of socio-ecological framework in understanding history.

The analysis started with data from the Islamic Nilometer, an annual hydrological meter tracking Nile flood levels as far back as 622 CE. The team correlated Nilometer records from 622 until 1902, when the Aswan Low Dam was completed, with evidence from ice cores showing when volcanic eruptions had occurred.

“It’s only since 2015 that the ice core data has been precise enough to give us dates for these events with an error of about one year instead of plus-or-minus ten years by the time we get back to the Ancient period,” says Francis Ludlow, a historical climatologist at Trinity College Dublin who was one of the lead authors of the study.

With the more precise data, the team discovered a link between volcanic eruptions and the extent of Nile flooding.

Explosive eruptions launch sulphurous gases into the atmosphere which become aerosols and reflect away sunlight, decreasing average global rainfall and temperatures. The cooling effect of eruptions that occur at high latitudes, such as in Iceland, is concentrated in the northern hemisphere. This imbalance causes a shift in monsoons, which fail to migrate as far northwards as normal.

Regions such as Ethiopia see a major drop in rainfall normally brought by the monsoon winds, leading to a drop in the level of the Nile’s summer flood, supplied mainly from the Blue Nile arising in the Ethiopian Highlands.

“We moderns tend to think we are exempted from natural changes, or man-made ones. But we are not.""

According to the analysis, an average drop of 22 cm occurred in eruption years, with the drop increasing as the analysis was restricted to larger and larger eruptions. The reduction would have been devastating for farmers, who weren’t able to carry or pump enough water for irrigation and so relied on Nile flooding to water their crops.

“Depending on how flat your land on either side of the Nile was, it could mean the difference between having a crop or having no crop,” says Ludlow.

Next, the team turned to Ptolemaic Egypt, a period with less thorough records of Nile flooding levels but rich in other historical documents.

By combining information from these documents with ice core data about volcanic eruptions, they showed that periods of social unrest coincided with eruption years.

Tax records and land ownership records revealed that uprisings against the rule of the Ptolemies were more common during and shortly after eruptions, when the researchers predict flooding levels would have been lower.

Ludlow emphasizes the value of tracking the ownership of land, which ancient Egyptians kept within a family for generations. The sale of land outside of families significantly increased after eruptions, which Ludlow calls “a real reflection of the stress in society.”

Volcanic disruptions of the Nile’s activity were also linked with how the Ptolemies dealt with their neighbours. Around 245 BCE, Ptolemy III abruptly abandoned a successful military campaign against the kingdom’s rival, the Seleucid Empire. This about-face “changed everything about Near-Eastern history,” says Joseph Manning, a Yale University historian who co-led the study.

Manning and Ludlow’s findings lend credence to the theory that Ptolemy abandoned the war because he had to deal with disturbances in Egypt.

The team believe that major eruptions in 247 and 244 BCE led to a failure of Nile flooding which incited domestic unrest.

Their analysis showed that volcanic eruptions throughout the Ptolemaic period correlated with the end of military campaigns but not their start, suggesting that unrest linked with the eruptions may have limited the Ptolemies’ ability to continue prosecuting expensive wars abroad.

However, while the study shows a clear influence of volcano-related climatic disruptions on the course of Ptolemaic Egypt’s history, the researchers stress that many other factors were also at play, with Nile flooding interacting with and amplifying other stressors.

The findings also have implications for contemporary societies. For example, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is expected to dramatically alter hydro-politics in the region, will be affected. However, the researchers raise the concern of a possible impact of volcanic eruptions on water availability, which could add stress to an already sensitive situation.

“We moderns tend to think we are exempted from natural changes, or man-made ones. But we are not,"" says Manning.

Next, the team plans to turn their attention to other ancient civilizations, such as Chinese dynasties and Babylon, where excellent records of the level of the Euphrates were kept for centuries.

In addition to revealing how climatic factors affected the history of these societies, the analysis also serves as “a tool to investigate the relative vulnerability of different social and agricultural systems globally,” says Ludlow.

“I’m hoping to see which societies were more vulnerable and which were more resilient and then follow up by examining the context of these differences. Was their agriculture different? Was their political setup different?”

According to Manning, there’s still “a long way to go in understanding how to deeply integrate climate change into historical analysis.”","Wed, 25 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/figures/1665/volcano-nile-main.jpg,"['history', 'team', 'eruptions', 'records', 'land', 'analysis', 'volcanic', 'flooding', 'nile', 'researchers']", ,flood
43,43,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Who were the mysterious Neolithic people that enabled the rise of ancient Egypt? Here's what we've learned on our digs - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/who-were-the-mysterious-neolithic-people-that-enabled-the-rise-of-ancient-egypt-heres-what-weve-learned-on-our-digs-121070,"To many, ancient Egypt is synonymous with the pharaohs and pyramids of the Dynastic period starting about 3,100BC. Yet long before that, about 9,300-4,000BC, enigmatic Neolithic peoples flourished. Indeed, it was the lifestyles and cultural innovations of these peoples that provided the very foundation for the advanced civilisations to come.

But who were they? As it turns out, they haven’t actually been studied much, at least relative to their successors. But our excavations of six burial sites – with some of the analyses recently published – have now provided important insights into their mysterious ways of life.

One reason why we know so little about Neolithic Egypt is that the sites are often inaccessible, lying beneath the Nile’s former flood plain or in outlying deserts.

Author provided

With permission from Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) we – members of the Combined Prehistoric Expedition – explore Neolithic sites in Egypt’s western desert. The sites we are currently excavating lie along the former shores of an extinct seasonal lake near a place called Gebel Ramlah.

Though not lush, the Neolithic was wetter than today, which allowed these ancient herders to populate what is now the middle of nowhere. We focus on the Final Neolithic (4,600-4,000BC), which was built on the success of the Late Neolithic (5,500-4,650BC) with domesticated cattle and goats, wild plant processing and cattle burials. These people also made apparent megaliths, shrines and even calendar circles – which look a bit like a mini Stonehenge.

During the final part of the Neolithic period, people started burying the dead in formal cemeteries. Skeletons provide critical information because they are from once living people who interacted with the cultural and physical environments. Health, relationships, diet and even psychological experiences can leave telltale signs on teeth and bone.

Author provided

In 2001-2003 we excavated three cemeteries from this era – the first in the western desert – where we uncovered and studied 68 skeletons. The graves were full of artefacts, with ornamental pottery, sea shells, stone and ostrich eggshell jewellery. We also discovered carved mica (a silicate mineral) and animal remains, as well as elaborate cosmetic tools for women and stone weapons for men.

We learned that these people enjoyed low childhood mortality, tall stature and long life. Men averaged 170cm, while women were about 160cm. Most men and women lived beyond 40 years, with some into their 50s – a long time in those days.

Strangely, in 2009-2016, we dug two more cemeteries that were very different. After analysing another 130 skeletons, we discovered that few artefacts accompanied them, and that they suffered from higher childhood mortality as well as shorter lives and stature. We’re talking several centimetres shorter and perhaps ten years younger for adults of both sexes.

Astonishingly, the largest of these two cemeteries had a separate burial area for children under three years of age, but mostly infants including late-term foetuses. Three women buried with infants were also found, so perhaps they died in childbirth. In fact, this is the world’s earliest known infant cemetery.

Interpreting the findings

So what can this tell us about these peoples, let alone their descendants? As it turns out, a lot. We can use the findings to make interpretations about gender, life-stage, well-being, status and other things.

For example, why were there such differences between the two grave sites? They could have been separate populations, but it is unlikely based on overall physical similarities. So perhaps they imply variation by status – with one graveyard being for the elite and the other for workers. This is the earliest such evidence in Egypt.

The sites also shed light on the family structures of the time. The overall sex ratio across all cemeteries is three women to each man, which may indicate polygamy. However, the total number of burials and a lack of reference to individual houses suggests these were extended family cemeteries.

We also believe that attainment of “personhood” – the age children are socialised into being “people” – was from three years, given their inclusion in adult cemeteries.

There is also clear evidence of respect for previously buried people by later mourners reusing the graves to bury their dead. When coming across old skeletons, they often carefully repositioned the bones of these ancestors. In some interesting cases, they even made attempts to “reconstruct” the skeletons by replacing teeth that had fallen out back into the skeleton – and not always correctly (see lead image).

These behavioural indicators, together with the seemingly innovative technological and ceremonial architecture mentioned earlier, such as the calendar circles and shrines, imply a level of sophistication well beyond that of simple herders. Taken together, the findings provide a glimpse of things yet to come in Ancient Egypt.

Conservation of sites

A key component of our work involves conservation of Egyptian (and world) heritage. We found no evidence of grave looting, unlike for sites in the Nile Valley. The last people to touch Neolithic material at Gebel Ramlah lived during that time. However, wind-related erosion has reached a point where once-buried remains lie on or near the surface.

In fact, the pace of destruction has increased significantly since 2001. Once exposed, the context of these sites can be lost and organic material can get sandblasted to bits. This means that if we hadn’t discovered these remains when we did, they would have soon been lost forever. But sadly this likely means that other sites from the time are literally disappearing.

For that reason, we and the SCA have decided that, when we have studied our material, all will be reburied on site to, hopefully, survive for thousands more years.","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/285871/original/file-20190726-43104-foaqvq.JPG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['heres', 'sites', 'peoples', 'digs', 'cemeteries', 'long', 'material', 'mysterious', 'egypt', 'women', 'weve', 'skeletons', 'learned', 'neolithic', 'rise', 'remains', 'enabled', 'studied', 'ancient']", ,none

The incident alarmed the state, which worried that climate change is contributing to rising sea levels and eroding Egypt's coasts.

In a Dec. 11 media statement, the head of the Egyptian Public Authority for Shore Protection, Mahmoud Saadi, said the authority has started implementing three projects to protect the coasts of Kafr El Sheikh, starting with the protection of the Kitchener Drain and the coastal area north of the fish farm in Berket Ghalyoun as a first step. This is in addition to coastline protection, including beach nourishment in the Shark al-Rous area, to the east of the basin. The Kitchener Drain, also known as the Gharbia Drain, passes through Gharbia, Kafr El Sheikh and Dakhalia governorates, with the majority of it in Gharbia.

Saadi said the authority is making great efforts to build new breakwaters in a bid to keep waves that have exceeded 5.5 meters (18 feet) at bay as well as to replenish beach sand and prevent the sea from further eroding the coast.

The cost of the three projects, aimed at protecting the northern coast of the governorate and stretching over 28 kilometers (17 miles), is 250 million Egyptian pounds (about $14 million), according to a Dec. 11 statement from Kafr El Sheikh governorate.

Kafr El Sheikh Gov. Ismail Abdel Hamid told Al-Monitor that the governorate has managed to protect several towns from further flood damage following the storm surge.

The beaches of the Baltim resort and other towns were nourished with sand.

He added that the governorate has been preparing every year for such incidents, given that Kafr El Sheikh’s coastal areas are threatened with inundation as a result of climate change. He said towns along the coastline were not built much above sea level and therefore are threatened with flooding.

The governor also said Kafr El Sheikh is an agricultural governorate and that the sea water in the recent flooding made its way into the Abu Dukhan canal, which feeds agricultural lands in the area.

Engineer Mahmoud al-Saadi told Al-Monitor that the authority went on full alert following the Kafr El Sheikh inundation and announced a state of emergency for all the nation’s coasts, mainly for the delta beaches that are more prone to erosion due to violent thunderstorms.

He said the authority has set up a central operations room in its headquarters, operating 24 hours to monitor any storm surge and to follow up on coastal protection work through communication with all its departments.

Saadi said this time of year is critical, as thunderstorms and strong tides cause sea level surges and flood coastal areas.

He said the authority is implementing several projects in three governorates, including Damietta, Alexandria and Kafr El Sheikh, to protect shores from erosion, at a total cost of 1.8 billion pounds ($100.8 million).

Mohamed Suleiman, former director of the Coastal Research Institute (CORI), told Al-Monitor the Nile Delta is the most threatened delta in the world, as it is so low-lying and is gradually sinking.

He said the coast of the Nile Delta is sinking at a rate of 1 to 3 millimeters (0.04 to 0.12 inches) per year, which does not seem alarming. But he said that the Mediterranean Sea level is also rising by 2 millimeters (0.08 inches) a year and that this is what makes things worse in the delta. He said sea level is expected to rise by 50 centimeters (20 inches) over the next 50 to 100 years, which will inundate many areas along the coast.

Suleiman said climate change is evident in the increase of weather events involving high winds and major storms, which used to occur every 20 years on average. He said that after such events occurred only a couple of years apart, in 2013 and 2015, ""The month of January 2018 saw two major storms, which threaten the Egyptian coasts.”

He said many risks resulting from sea level rise are economic, as much arable land will become salinized in the affected governorates. He said it is unlikely that residents in the coastal governorates will be displaced at this time because the sea has not risen to a threatening level of complete inundation.

Suleiman also said methods of protection vary from one case to another, noting that beach said nourishment is the most practiced method in Egypt, followed by submerged or high breakwaters depending on the area. He said the areas that are most threatened with sinking are ones adjacent to lakes, including ones in the delta, because of human encroachments on them.

He called upon the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources to preserve the wall of Mohammed Ali, located in the Abu Qir Bay, as it protects the southern part of the area as well as Lake Mariout. He said the wall was the first means of beach protection used in Egypt.

Of note, the Egyptian government accepted a $31.5 million grant from the Green Climate Fund on Oct. 2 to protect the areas that are most affected by climate change. This is the biggest grant Egypt has ever received for environmental projects.

The Water Research Center of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources held a meeting for the project’s Steering Committee on Dec. 17. The project was implemented in the five most affected governorates, Port Said, Damietta, Dakahlia, Kafr El Sheikh and Beheira.","Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/almpics/2018/12/RTX6IGIW.jpg/RTX6IGIW.jpg?h=a5ae579a&itok=yEdxcJZX,"['egyptian', 'water', 'threaten', 'levels', 'coasts', 'el', 'coastal', 'level', 'sheikh', 'kafr', 'sea', 'protection', 'authority', 'rising', 'delta']", ,flood

Communities remain cut off and thousands are still without power in the state of Queensland, but the weather bureau said the downpours that have seen areas doused with more than 300 millimeters (11.8 inches) of rain daily were easing.

“It looks like the worst is probably over,” Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Vinord Anand told AFP.

“We are still seeing rainfall rates that are meeting our severe weather warning criteria, but rainfall totals are not high as they have been in the last five to 10 days.”

The daily rainfall totals were falling below 250 millimeters and would “ease slightly” on Thursday and Friday as the monsoonal trough slowly moves offshore, he added.

Australia’s tropical north typically experiences heavy rains during the monsoon season, but the recent downpours have seen some areas get a year’s worth of rainfall in just a week.

The rains turned roads into rivers and were so incessant authorities were forced to open floodgates of a major dam on Sunday.

With floodwaters receding in some areas of the hard-hit city of Townsville, residents headed home to help each other clean up their mud-caked properties.

“Just coming up the driveway, looking at all the mud, that’s when it hit home,” resident Clayton Linning told national broadcaster ABC Wednesday.

“There are a lot of neighbors we’ve never met before and now we have, which is really nice. It’s an unfortunate way to have to build community but it does.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said Wednesday that officials were working to ensure affected locals would get access to recovery payments and support.

The Insurance Council of Australia added that claims were “rising by the hour”, with losses of Aus$45 million (US$32 million) from 3,500 applications so far.

More than 100 extra police have been deployed to help with the disaster, while the army, which has a major base in Townsville, has also been active.

47,47,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Volcanic Eruptions Could Have Spurred Revolts in Ancient Egypt - Smithsonian,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-volcanic-eruptions-spurred-revolts-ancient-egypt-180965306/,"Some of the most well-known characters in ancient Egyptian history were actually Macedonian. In particular, the Ptolemaic Kingdom, a dynasty founded after the death of Alexander the Great by his general Ptolemy I Soter, which began in 305 B.C. and continued until Rome’s conquest of Egypt in 30 B.C. during the reign of Cleopatra VII. It was a time of great cultural sophistication spawning such thinkers as Euclid and Archimedes, and the Great Library at Alexandria, which aspired to house a copy of every book in the world. At the same time, the Ptolemaic Dynasty was also known for isolated, inept rulers spawning a period of political instability, civil war and revolts in Egypt. But Craig Welch at National Geographic reports that there may have been more at play than just poor leadership. New research shows that volcanic eruptions half a world away may have impacted Egypt’s climate, leading to social unrest.

According to a press release, from its very beginnings, about 5,100 years ago, ancient Egyptian society was reliant on summer monsoon rains in Ethiopia that caused the river Nile to flood, allowing a narrow band of agriculture along its banks. According to Welch, Yale historian Joe Manning and Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College in Dublin were looking at ice-core data of eruption dates collected in Greenland and Antarctica. It struck Manning, an expert on the Ptolemaic dynasty, that some of those eruptions corresponded with uprisings in Egypt, which usually happened one or two years after the massive eruption. The research appears in the journal Nature Communications.

Nicholas St. Fleur at The New York Times reports that the researchers believe these massive eruptions may have suppressed the annual monsoon rains, preventing the Nile from flooding, leading to poor harvests in Egypt. That in turn could have easily led to civil unrest. And it wasn’t a rare event—volcanoes were particularly active during the Ptolemaic era. “They might have been dealing with two or even three huge volcanic eruptions occurring in a given decade,” Ludlow tells St. Fleur. “They were unfortunate. They were living in a period where the Nile had extra variability because of these eruptions.”

According to the press release, the volcanoes injected sulfurous gases into the stratosphere. Those gases react to form aerosol particles that reflect solar radiation into space, producing a cooling effect on Earth. Without that extra heat from the sun causing evaporation, rainfall is reduced, and if that happened primarily in the northern hemisphere, it could more or less stop the monsoon winds that pushed rain to the headwaters of the Nile.

While in some cases rulers were able to ration stored grain to hungry citizens, if a volcanic eruption was strong enough, it could impact agriculture for several years in a row. “We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,” Manning tells St. Fleur. “There was fear about what’s going to happen. ‘Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?’”

To support their claim, the researchers also looked at records of the Islamic Nilometer, a measuring device in Cairo that kept track of the river’s flooding from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D. The researchers compared the 60 major volcanic eruptions that occurred during that period to the flood data, finding that during eruption years the flood levels were on average nine inches lower than average.

Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona not affiliated with the study, tells St. Fleur that the research does not take certain factors into account like the effects of El Niño. He also observes that the Nile River's dispersion in flooding during eruption years is relatively small. Ludlow, however, points out that the amount is consistently lower after eruptions, and a larger dip occurred in parallel with larger explosions.

Within two years of an eruption, eight out of the ten largest revolts in Ptolemaic Egypt occurred, according to the study's ice-core data?. The largest, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., two years after a major eruption. During the reign of Cleopatra VII, the final years of the Ptolemies, the authors report that there were two massive eruptions in 46 B.C. and 44 B.C. that led to agriculture failures, though Cleopatra's stockpiling of grain ""could reflect short-term coping efforts,"" the authors tell Welch of National Geographic?. Still, by the end of her reign, the authors write, Egypt was suffering ""famine, plague, inflation, administrative corruption, rural depopulation, migration and land abandonment.”

The conquering Romans lucked out as the following two centuries had little major volcanic activity, reports Welch. That's similar to our own last century, which comparably has had few climate-disrupting eruptions. However, the authors caution that 70 percent of the world’s population lives off of agriculture that is still dependent on monsoon rains. Another round of increased eruptions could cause drought and chaos in our own historical period.","Thu, 19 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/WDAgfb8Z8Hr_mBf7KKgh3akIIX4=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/8b/0b/8b0b9434-8b55-4a57-972b-f130b9a3711e/682px-egyptian_harvest.jpg,"['spurred', 'eruption', 'eruptions', 'ptolemaic', 'nile', 'revolts', 'bc', 'welch', 'st', 'volcanic', 'ancient', 'egypt', 'period']", ,none
48,48,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Did the 10 Plagues of Egypt Really Happen? Here Are 3 Theories - TIME,https://time.com/5561441/passover-10-plagues-real-history/,"When the Passover holiday begins — on the evening of April 8 in 2020 — Jewish people around the world will celebrate by retelling the biblical story of the Exodus from Egypt — including the 10 plagues that God inflicted on the Ancient Egyptians.

As the Passover story tells it, after Pharaoh refuses Moses’ entreaties to let the enslaved Israelites go free, God sends a series of ten plagues to pressure the Egyptian ruler. Each time, Pharaoh promises to free the Israelites, but reverses his decision when the plague is lifted — until the last one. The plagues are: water turning to blood, frogs, lice, flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hail, locusts, darkness and the killing of firstborn children.

The question of whether Bible stories can be linked to archaeological discoveries is one that has long fascinated scholars. The ten plagues are no exception, and over the years scientists have been curious about whether the story of the plagues may have been based on some event that can be proved to have happened. Here are three of the major theories to know.

Volcanic Eruption

This theory argues that the plagues were really the fallout of volcanic eruption on the island of Santorini in the south of Greece around 1620-1600 BCE. Microbiologist Siro Trevisanato, author of The Plagues of Egypt: Archaeology, History and Science Look at the Bible, argues that ancient Egyptian medical texts support this idea.

Winds would have carried the volcanic ash to Egypt at some point over the summer, and the toxic acids in the volcanic ash would have included the mineral cinnabar, which could have been capable of turning a river a blood-like red color, Trevisanato holds. The accumulated acidity in the water would have caused frogs to leap out and search for clean water. Insects would have burrowed eggs in the bodies of dead animals and human survivors, which generated larvae and then adult insects. Then, the volcanic ash in the atmosphere would have affected the weather, with acid rain landing on people’s skin, which in turn caused boils. The grass would have been contaminated, poisoning the animals that ate it. The humidity from the rain and the subsequent hail would have created optimal conditions for locusts to thrive. Volcanic eruptions could also explain the several days of darkness — which means nine plagues are accounted for.

Trevisanato also found an ancient Egyptian account of the children of aristocrats lying dead in public and archaeological data matching the account. He believes that, amid all this destruction, firstborn children could have been sacrificed out of desperation, in the hopes that such a meaningful sacrifice would lead their gods to stop punishing them.

Red Algae

This theory — put forth by scientists like John S. Marr, an epidemiologist who wrote a 1996 journal article featured in the New York Times — argues that red algae could have sucked oxygen out of Egypt’s waterways, killed the fish and turned the water red. Just as in the volcano theory, frogs then leapt out looking for food, and died. Without frogs to eat the insects, the pests proliferated and feasted on corpses, a feeding frenzy for flies and locusts. The paper argued that the lice could have been a type of insect called culicoides, which can carry two diseases that could explain the livestock deaths: African horse sickness and Bluetongue. The boils on humans could have been caused by glanders, an airborne bacterial disease spread by flies or tainted meat.

In this theory the darkness is coincidentally caused by a sandstorm. The darkness would have left the crops — well, whatever crops were left after the other problems — moldy, and the mold could have produced airborne toxins that might explain widespread childhood death.

Climate Change

This addendum to the algae theory points out that, for red algae to flourish in the first place, there needs to be slow, sludgy, warm water. In 2010, research on stalagmites —elongated mineral deposits that form out of calcium in precipitation — suggested that there had been a dry period towards the end of the rule of Pharaoh Ramses II. That change would have dried up the Nile and significantly slowed down the flow of water, according to paleoclimatologist Augusto Mangini. These conditions are ripe for the growth of the bacterium Oscillatoria rubescens, more colloquially, Burgundy Blood algae, according to biologist Stephan Pflugmacher.

But ask someone who’s celebrating Passover, and they’re likely to say that the question of whether scientists can prove the plagues really happened in ancient history is irrelevant to the holiday.

“To me it doesn’t matter whether scientists are able to find a historical basis for something that happened around 3,500 years ago. The central message is that God brought the plagues on Egypt in order to free the Israelite slaves,” says Jerusalem-based Rabbi Yonatan Neril. God was teaching the ancient Egyptians a lesson about justice, he says, and when they refused to do the right thing and free the Israelites, they suffered the consequences.

However, Neril — as the co-founder and executive director of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development — does say that science has a key role to play in how the story of the plagues is told and received today. That’s because he sees another lesson in it, one for the era of man-made climate change. The pollution of Ancient Egypt’s water echoes water-pollution and water-scarcity issues today. Frogs, with their very sensitive skin, are an indicator species, meaning that their suffering is seen by scientists as a marker of a larger imbalance in society around them. And to Neril, the parallels don’t stop there.

“The Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the form of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were reluctant to change,” he says. “Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, have replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. There’s a Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something that’s not right.”

Correction, April 18:

The original version of this story misstated Yonatan Neril’s affiliation with the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development. He is the founder of the organization, not a co-founder.

CAIRO – 28 May 2018: During the Middle Kingdom era, King Senusret III established castles and fortresses to protect Egypt from the south, such as the Buhen fortress that sunk in the Nile as a result of a flood.Buhen was a massive fortress located on the west bank of the Nile in Lower Nubia (northern Sudan). The walls of the fortress were made of brick and stone walls, approximately 5 meters (16 ft) thick and about 10 meters (33 ft) high, covering an area of about 13,000 square meters (140,000 sq ft) and extending more than 150 meters (490 ft). It was constructed during the reigns of King Senusret III in the Middle Kingdom era (12th dynasty) to protect Egypt and the commercial ships from rebel Nubians in the south, according to “Ancient Egypt” by David P. Silverman.The massive fortress was built in 1860 BC. It had about 1,000 soldiers, 300 archers and their families. Queen Hatshepsut ordered a Horus temple to be built inside the Buhen fortress for worship and prayer, and also for traders to take a break while transporting their goods. Interestingly, during that time, Egypt imported and exported many products, such as oils, ivory, pottery, and tiger and elephant skins.The Middle Kingdom era saw many other fortresses besides Buhen, such as Mirgissa, Shalfak, Uronarti, Askut, Dabenarti, and ending with the paired fortresses of Semna and Kumma, located on opposite sides of the Nile River. Each fortress was in visual contact with the immediately adjacent forts.Ahmed Saleh, director of antiquities in Aswan, told Egypt Today that the Buhen fortress no longer exists because it was submerged under the waters of Lake Nasser in 1964 due to the flood; the Buhen fortress is now located 300 meters from the High Dam. He added that the Ministry of Antiquities did not search for it because it was certainly destroyed, like several other Egyptian antiquities. Among the most important ancient monuments lost under Lake Nasser are Nubian fortresses.“But if the Ministry planned to look for antiquities under the waters of Lake Nasser, they could find nothing other than bones, noting that the level of water was higher than the level of the ground. Therefore, the Egyptian government built the High Dam, but it unfortunately swept away several pharaonic artifacts; still, the Ministry of Antiquities saved many artifacts, in cooperation with more than 22 foreign research teams, such as the UNESCO Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, which began in the 1960s.The site was entirely submerged beneath the reservoir waters and rendered inaccessible. However, the campaign saved many temples, including the Hatshepsut and Philae temples, which were rescued and moved to places nearby,” Saleh added.The Middle Kingdom era is called the era of economic prosperity because of many economic projects, such as irrigation, trade, industry and agriculture. Among the most famous kings of the Middle Kingdom were King Mentuhotep II, who restored the unity of the country and spread security after the chaos that plagued Egypt in the era of the Old Kingdom, and King Senusret III, who was one of the greatest kings of Egypt. Senusret III took care of the army to protect Egypt and led many campaigns to secure its borders. He also ordered the digging of the Sesostris Canal to link the Red Sea and the Nile, as well as building a dam to protect the land in Fayoum from the flood.The Sesostris Canal was the source of the idea to build the Suez Canal to connect the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, which became the most important navigational channel in the world and an important source of income for Egypt.King Amenemhat III ruled from c. 1860 BCE to c. 1814 BCE. He was interested in agriculture and irrigation, and he ordered the building of the first pyramid at Dahshur, the so-called ""Black Pyramid"", near Fayoum. Around the 15th year of his reign, the king decided to build a new pyramid at Hawara, as well as a huge temple called “Labyrinth,” named so due to the large number of rooms, roads and corners inside it, making it difficult for any visitor to exit.Unfortunately, as a result of the kings’ weaknesses and greed, chaos spread in the country, which allowed the Hyksos, who came from Asia, to occupy Northern Egypt. The Hyksos abused the Egyptians very much and destroyed many temples and several ancient antiquities. The Egyptians were determined to fight and expel the Hyksos from their country. The struggle started from Upper Egypt, led by Seqenenre Tao, who was martyred in the war with the Hyksos, but his wife Ahhotep encouraged the Egyptians to continue the struggle. She urged her eldest son, Kamose, to continue the struggle, but he was also martyred in one of the battles. Then, the army was taken over by the younger son of Seqenenre Tao, Ahmose I, who continued to fight the Hyksos until they were expelled from Egypt. He then ruled the country.One of the greatest civilizations throughout history is the ancient Egyptian civilization, which has stunned the entire world for ages. During the Middle Kingdom era, when Egypt was at the highest degree of culture and development, and kings were interested in projects of benefit to the people, handicrafts were developed and literature and art flourished.","Mon, 28 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/47682.jpg,"['sunken', 'iii', 'kingdom', 'king', 'senusret', 'fortress', 'buhen', 'middle', 'era', 'nile', 'antiquities', 'egypt']", ,none

CAIRO – 15 June 2018: In the era of King Djoser, King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neterkhet and founder of the Third Dynasty in the Old Kingdom, a shortage of the Nile flood in 2,700 BC led to a seven-year famine, leaving Egypt in a state of extreme distress. The king was perplexed as grains were insufficient, seeds dried up, people robbed each other, and temples and shrines closed. Looking for an end to his people’s suffering, the king consulted his architect and prime minister, Imhotep, commanding him to dig for a solution in the old sacred texts. Obeying the king’s order, Imhotep headed to a temple in the ancient city of Ain Shams (Old Heliopolis), where he discovered that the solution could be found in the city of Yebu (Aswan or Elephantine), the source of the Nile.Imhotep, the architect of the Djoser pyramid in Saqqara, traveled to Yebu, where he visited the Temple of Khnum and saw the granite, precious stones, minerals, and building stones. Khnum, the god of fertility, was believed to have created mankind from clay.After his state visit to Yebu, Imhotep updated king Djoser on his journey. On the day following his meeting with Imhetop, Khnum, came to the king in his dream, promising to end the famine and to allow the Nile to flow again if Djoser restores the temple of Khnum. Consequently, Djoser executed Khnum's wishes, allocating the revenue of the area from Elephantine to Khnum temple. Shortly afterwards, the famine and people’s suffering came to an end.The famine story had been engraved on a granite stone in 250 BC during the era of Ptolemy V on the Sehel Island, Aswan. The Stela, which is 2.5 meters in height and 3 meters in width, includes 42 columns of hieroglyphic texts read from right to left. The Stela had a natural horizontal fissure when the Ptolemies engraved the story on it. Above the inscriptions, there were drawings depicting King Djsoer’s offerings to the triad of the Elephantine deities (Khnum, Anuket, and Satis), which were worshipped in Aswan during the Old Kingdom.The stone was discovered in 1889 by American Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour, according to his notes preserved in Brooklyn Museum Archives. Wilbour tried to translate the inscriptions on the Stela, but he only managed to recognize when the story was engraved on the stone. The engravings were deciphered for the first time by German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch in 1891 and it took 62 years for the mission to be completed. The texts had to be translated and revised by four other Egyptologists. The complete translation was later published in a book penned by Miriam Lichtheim, titled “Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings”.Perhaps, the story was previously documented on papyrus and reformulated on stone in the Ptolemy era, General Director of Aswan Antiquities Ahmed Saleh told Egypt Today.,Some Egyptologists, including Saleh, think that the story of the Khnum famine is a fictional story invented during the era of Ptolemy V to consolidate Khnum’s priesthood and perpetuate the idea that Khnum has the upper hand, thereby, ensuring his control over Egypt. The same theory is backed by Lichtheim in her book “Foundations of Atlantis, Ancient Astronauts and Other Alternatives.”“The Stela demonstrates a religious conflict between Khnum priests and goddess Isis’ clergymen,” Saleh explains, adding that another story on a famine engraved in the Philae temple states that Isis, a goddess of ancient Egypt, is the source of the Nile water.During the Ptolemaic era, Isis was worshipped all over Egypt. With the revenues from land plots extending from Aswan Dam to the city of Mahraqqa, southern Aswan, were allocated for Isis’ Philae Temple priests. Khnum’s clergymen were angry for not having the upper hand in Egypt; thus, it is believed that the story of the famine is just a fictional tale invented by the jealous priests, according to Saleh.“Such conflict could be the reason behind the creation of the famine story engraved on the Stela as it would empower them to religiously take control of Egypt,” he said.At Isis’ Temple of Philae, another story on a famine was engraved on granite. Isis’ story was engraved in the era of Ptolemy VI (186–145 BC), Saleh explained. “Each party (Khnum priests and Isis’ clergymen) wanted to bestow their favors on Egypt,” and to have the revenues of the 12-mile-long area between Aswan dam and Elephantine, Saleh confirmed.At the end of the story, according to the inscription of the Famine Stela in Sehel Island, the Khnum priests were honored by the revenues.Egypt depended on the Nile flood water, and was exposed to several famines. However, in Minya, Upper Egypt, another inscription was engraved in the tomb of Amenemhat, from the 12th Dynasty during the era of Senusret I, in Beni Hasan Cemetery; it talks about a just king, whose era had never seen a famine, Head of Minya Antiquities, Gamal Samastawy, told Egypt Today.Many people believe that this story is related to Prophet Joseph's story of the seven-year starvation in Quran and the Old Testament. However, Saleh said that the two stories are not necessarily connected.“There are no historical facts that prove the famine story is related to the divine one,” Saleh said, continuing that that number seven in Sehel’s Famine Stela does not necessarily mean “seven years” but could merely be a symbol of perfection and completion.Stela of Famine engravings have been affected by erosion. “Some inscriptions were scratched due to erosion, rains and winds,” Saleh pointed out. “These inscriptions were restored in 2015 by the Egyptian archeological mission,” he added, noting that the Ministry of Antiquities plans to build a tent over the Stela to protect it from the rains.Sehel Island, where the Stela exists, is considered by the Egyptologists as a piece of Pharaonic diary of 550 stones engraved by ancient Egyptian kings, rulers, pilgrims, travellers, and patients.“The Sehel Island is a book of memories. Whenever a king or priest passed by the island, he wrote his memory like ‘I am…son of…my mother is…’. The area has 550 engraved memories dating from the prehistoric period to Roman Greek era,” Saleh said.The engraved stories also served as a way of documenting tasks. “Any state official who was sent to get gold from the South used to engrave his mission on the stone,” Saleh continues.Sehel was a place of worshipping the Goddess Anuket, one of the Elephantine triad; the stones could be classified into two categories: royal engravings and inscriptions by individuals.Most engravings include the depiction of the triad, where travelers or patients asked for success in life or treatment from an illness.The stones also include one of the most important engravings that prove that Senusret III (1878 BC to 1839 BC) decreed to dig and expand a canal in the western side of the Sehel Island, for his warships and to serve as a maritime trade passage.","Sun, 15 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/49998.jpg,"['diary', 'stela', 'piece', 'pharaonic', 'engraved', 'saleh', 'khnum', 'island', 'famine', 'era', 'aswan', 'king', 'egypt']", ,drought
51,51,FL-2019-000179-CAN,'Cannot go back': Malawi floods leave thousands homeless - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/cannot-go-back-malawi-floods-leave-thousands-homeless/,"“We just sleep on the floor in the tents,” said 28-year-old mother-of-five Mary Amidu who like thousands of other Malawians fled her flood-ravaged home.

“It’s a camp, so the situation is dire. You just find a small space in the tent with your family and make it home.”

Her village is just ten kilometers (six miles) away on the Mozambique border, beside the west bank of the Shire river which has burst its banks following days of torrential rain.

Across Malawi, at least 56 people have been killed following flash floods while the government estimates almost 83,000 people have been displaced.

The waters last week invaded her home so swiftly that the young widow had to scramble to get her family to safety.

“The floods came very quickly and we had no time to rescue anything. Most of my property went with the floods,” she said. “What was important was to save lives.”

They are now at the emergency camp, located in Bangula, southern Malawi — close to the border with Mozambique, which was hit by tropical cyclone Idai late Thursday, cutting off the coastal city of Berea.

“Although we have food, we have no cooking utensils to prepare the food because everything was lost,” said Amidu who said she fears a long stay at the camp as waters begin to subside.

‘No other choice’

“We cannot go back soon because the water has not receded and so the house has been destroyed. So we will hang around the camp until the situation normalizes. We have no other choice.”

Pilirani Andulu walked 15 kms to the camp after her home collapsed and has been forced to sleep in the open with her two-year-old girl because the tents are full.

A lack of blankets and mosquito nets means her child is exposed to mosquitoes, malaria and cold.

Relief official Humphrey Magalasi has been battling to ensure the 21 camps opened to handle the crisis can keep up.

“We have huge gaps in terms of resources such as food and non-food items,” he told AFP. “What we desperately need right now is food, tents, medication and mosquito nets.”

As many as 1,700 households had settled at the Bangula camp as of Thursday.

So far, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs has received just 5,000 bags of rice, supplied by China.

At Bangula airfield, Magalasi has also been dispatching food and emergency supplies to areas cut off by flooding including Makhanga, 65 kms from Bangula.

‘Accessible by boat or by air’

“We are airlifting supplies to Makhanga where about 2,000 households have been affected,” he said.

“Due to the flooding, the area is only accessible by boat or by air. We intend to airlift 600 bags of rice and other non-food items to Makhanga.”

At least 56 people have died in flood-hit areas as of Wednesday, according to the government, while 577 had been injured and three are missing.

“Most of the displaced families are living in camps. So far, a total of 187 camps have been established in the affected districts,” said the government in a statement.

“Assessments to establish the extent of damage in all the 14 affected districts (of Malawi’s 28) are still underway.”

The floods also caused heavy damage to property, including roads and crops which forced President Peter Mutharika to declare a state of disaster.

An AFP correspondent saw extensive damage to fields of corn, also known as maize, around Bangula. The destruction could potentially wreak havoc with the harvest due in April and May.

The country’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned Malawians to expect further downpours.

The Australian Defense Forces delivered 70,000 sandbags, deployed amphibious cargo vehicles and helped pluck flashlight-wielding residents from their rooftops Monday, as monsoon rains drenched the northern state of Queensland.

Australia’s tropical north typically experiences heavy rains during the monsoon season, but the recent downpour has seen some areas get a year’s worth of rainfall in a week.

The authorities were forced to open floodgates of a major dam late Sunday, unleashing what they called “dangerous and high velocity flows.”

In hard-hit Townsville, cars were mostly submerged, with picket fences barely poking through waist-deep flood waters.

“We’ve never seen so much water in our lives,” said local radio journalist Gabi Elgood. “You think there can’t possibly be any more to come but the rain just doesn’t stop.”

Desperate residents had to contend not only with flash flooding, landslides and power blackouts, but also several saltwater crocodile sightings in residential roads and cul-de-sacs.

Queensland Police issued a blunt warning for people to stay out of floodwaters.

“If the thought of coming face to face with a crocodile isn’t deterrent enough, before you start playing in flood waters you should always remember the distinct possibility you could be wading in your neighbour’s faeces”, the statement said.

Emergency services have struggled to respond to the scale of the disaster, with more than 1,100 people calling for help and 18 “swift water rescues” conducted overnight.

“Small boats worked through the night to evacuate members of the community,” said local commander Brigadier Scott Winter.

Around 400 Townsville residents have sought shelter at nearby Lavarak military barracks.

‘Unprecedented’

State premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the communities face more difficulties ahead. Schools and courts remain closed, more rain and high winds are on the way and emergency warnings still in effect for more than a dozen rivers.

Up to 20,000 homes are at risk of being inundated if the rains continue, officials said.

“It’s basically not just a one in 20-year event, it’s a one-in-100-year event,” said Palaszczuk.

“This is unprecedented, we’ve never seen anything like this before,” she said.

Ergon Energy’s spokesperson Emma Oliveri told the AFP that more than 16,000 people were without power, with the supplier unable to say when the lights will come back on.

The main transport artery linking the north of Australia with the rest of the east coast was also affected, prompting concerns about food shortages.

Woolworths Northern Queensland Operations Manager Tina Anandji said the company had “secured two charter planes to carry 3,000 tonnes of fresh food and essential items” to the northern city of Cairns.

“We’ll continue to do all we can to get stock into Far North Queensland while the roads are cut,” she said.

The Bureau of Meteorology’s Adam Blazak told AFP the downpours could continue until Thursday, while floodwaters will take some time to recede even when the rains lessen.

A silver lining to the deluge is that it has boosted drought-stricken farmers in western Queensland.

“Queensland has already born its fair share of extreme weather recently, with unprecedented bushfires, drought, heatwave, a cyclone, and now intense rainfall and flood,” said Richard Thornton of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.

He warned resources “are now being stretched beyond normal with the severe weather seasons getting longer and more complex”.","Mon, 04 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2019/02/9fb3827ae760337a6fb92ee2fed6a923ea5b3e34.jpg,"['continue', 'north', 'water', 'crocs', 'australia', 'bring', 'military', 'steps', 'rains', 'floods', 'residents', 'northern', 'face', 'weather', 'flood', 'seen', 'streets']", ,flood

CAIRO - 27 November 2017: Years ago, Gamal Abdel Nasser; Egyptian former leader, instructed to build Egypt’s biggest national project: the High Dam. Do displaced Nubian migrants deem the dam as great or it is true that every pro has a con?The High Dam was built under the name of Aswan Dam. It was mainly meant to generate power and regulate the seasonal flooding of the Nile. Being one of the former leader’s greatest achievements, for the Egyptians, especially the farmers, the dam was the dream that came true as they have suffered for years from the loss of their crops due to the seasonal unexpected floods.The establishment of the Dam started with Aswan Dam/reservoir in 1902. The increasing rate of water flow behind the dam flooded 44 Nubian villages and displaced 18000 Nubian families in the aftermath. The area is known now as “old Nubia.”Nostalgic were the Nubians who deserted their houses and saw them sink beneath the rising water, they had to migrate to Kom Ambo area known as “New Nubia.” The biggest migration took place when the construction of the High Dam occurred in 1963. Nubians witnessed a shift in the way of life around the Nile view to a new desert life in villages built for them in Kom Ambo.As sad as the story might sound, the full half of the cup is that the old Nubian Area is full of picturesque remains and main attractions made the place as a main destination for tourists worldwide.Amada Temple, the oldest Egyptian temple in old Nubia built in the eighteenth century and located 180 KM behind High Dam. Though small and abandoned, Amada contains some important inscriptions. For instance, some inscriptions on one of the temple’s columns describes Amenhotep II leading an Egyptian military campaign into Asia, and bringing back the bodies of rebel chieftains to hang on the walls of Thebes. On another column a story describes his ship sailing through Nubia as a warning for his rivals.Qasr Ibrim is an archeological site in old Nubia. It was originally a major city perched on a cliff above the Nile, but the flooding of Nasser's Lake after the construction of Aswan High Dam transformed it into an island and flooded its outskirts. Ibrim stands as the only major archaeological site in old Nubia to have survived the Nile floods.Ramses II Temple in Abu Simbel is one of Egypt’s most famous archeological sites and a top attraction for visitors despite its far distance from Cairo. The temple was designed in the 13th Century BC to strike awe into travelers, introducing them to the grandeur of Egyptian culture. The four largest statues in front are Ramses II, and the smaller ones next to them are fashioned to resemble his favorite wife, Nefertari and Prince Amonherkhepshef, his son. Egyptian engineers moved the temple block by block to save it from the rising waters of Nasser Lake in the late 1960.","Mon, 27 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/32932.jpg,"['egyptian', 'temple', 'high', 'old', 'nile', 'dam', 'nubian', 'aswan', 'nubias', 'memories', 'bittersweet', 'nubia', 'page']", ,none
56,56,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Alexandria: locals adapt to floods as coastal waters inch closer - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/alexandria-egypt-locals-adapt-storms-floods-coastal-waters-rise,"“Before we were flooded a couple of years ago, we didn’t imagine the water could reach this level,” said cafe manager Samir Gaber, gesturing at a cluster of tables overlooking the Mediterranean.

Gaber has managed the Latino cafe in Alexandria for six years, during which time the business has had to adapt to increasingly dramatic winter storms. With the storms come the floods, crashing waves engulfing large chunks of the many cafes nestled on the coastline.

“There was another wall here before the flooding, but the steel bars [supporting it] were destroyed,” explained Gaber. “Now we’ve constructed a drain to absorb floodwater,” he said, gesturing below the new stone wall running along the outside edge of the cafe.

Many of the cafes and businesses on the Alexandria coast have begun adjusting to extreme weather without making the link to climate change.

On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings.

The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them.

Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change.

An hour to the east from Alexandria, the quiet of the town of Rosetta ignores the urgency of the lapping waters. Life in the town, famed for the discovery of the Rosetta stone, is at one with the sea.

“You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” said fisherman Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, reciting a local saying.

Storms annually disrupt the calm of this low-lying town where houses sit at sea level, many only separated from the coast by a winding coast road. But in recent years the weather has been more violent.

“Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives,” said Gowayed. The storm also destroyed barges and kiosks that local fishermen rely on for their livelihoods. “If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk,” smiled Gowayed, undeterred by the prospect of the next storm.

Mohamed El Raey, professor of environmental studies at Alexandria University, believes that climate change is contributing to an increase in “extreme events”, across Egypt. “The government needs to increase awareness among the population,” he said.

They also need to be more stringent about urban planning, he added. “If people don’t find places to live that they like, they build houses wherever they find an area.”

In 2011, the government released a report detailing how the country must adapt to climate change, estimating that about 13% of Egypt’s northern coastline was at risk.

Political and economic upheavals have since diverted their attention elsewhere, but in Alexandria and Rosetta the impact of climate change is becoming increasingly hard to ignore.","Thu, 19 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d1e14a62066c7844058c81e9518d1403c8183a7/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2121db24eb1ff8b0ef313648e3fdd606,"['inch', 'adapt', 'water', 'coastal', 'closer', 'town', 'alexandria', 'weather', 'floods', 'rosetta', 'locals', 'sea', 'climate', 'rising', 'waters', 'egypts']", ,flood
57,57,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Measuring the Nile - EgyptToday - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/15/16993/Measuring-the-Nile,"Nilometers were used in Egypt, particularly during the Pharaonic, Roman and medieval periods, to measure the Nile’s water level during the annual summer flood. Essentially, apart from such ritual functions they may have served in ancient Egypt, nilometers worked on the Goldilocks principle as far as the rulers of Egypt were concerned. If the water level in August–September was too high, the effects on the narrow band of fields either side of the river, and the surrounding infrastructure, would be devastating and there was no point sending out the tax collectors. If the water level was too low, the population would starve, and there was also no point sending out the tax collectors. If the water level was just right, a rich layer of alluvial silt would be deposited as the flood subsided, crops would grow, and off would go the tax collectors, no doubt singing merrily to themselves.The structures were of three types: a simple vertical column in the water (as in the medieval example in central Cairo, the modern ornate housing of which is pictured above); a well with a culvert to the Nile (as, supposedly, at Kom Ombo temple, although this may simply be a well rather than a measuring device); or a set of steps cut into the bank (as at Elephantine Island, Aswan). Each was calibrated in Egyptian cubits (roughly 54 centimeters or 21 inches) subdivided into seven palms, and then into four fingers.The medieval nilometer at the end of Roda Island in Cairo—though of the simplest type—is particularly beautiful with its nineteenth-century Turkish conical roof, though, as a rather small uninteresting building from the outside, it is often overlooked even by those who have lived in Cairo all their lives.Standing on the site of an older building (destroyed in AD 850, ironically enough, by the Nile’s flood) from AD 715, and probably on the site of a Pharaonic nilometer, the current structure dates to 861, when it was ordered to be built by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil under the direction of Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Hasib. It was restored by Ibn Tulun in 872–73, and again in 1092 by the Fatimid caliph Al-Mustansir.The architect of the existing structure, Abu’l ‘Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir Al-Farghani—rather more pithily known in the west as the astronomer Alfraganus—was a native of Farghana, in West Turkistan (now Uzbekistan), an important staging post on the North Silk Road from Xi’an. There is a statue dedicated to him at the entrance to the Roda Island site.Alfraganus’s design was quite straightforward. Three tunnels at different heights lead in from the river to the east into a stone-lined pit around a central marble column, resting on a large millstone and capped with a Corinthian capital, marked in 19 cubits. Thus, the nilometer was capable of measuring a flood of 9.2 meters. If the flood measured much below 16 cubits, it was too low, and if it measured above 19, it was too high.In the days immediately preceding the maximum flood, the column was anointed with saffron and musk in order to help induce the most beneficial water level.In addition, around the top of the pit are talismanic Qur’anic inscriptions in Kufic script (said to be the earliest surviving examples of architectural epigraphy in Egypt):“We sent down water from heaven as a blessing, causing gardens to grow, and grain for harvest” (50:9).“See you not how God sends down water from heaven so that the earth becomes green?” (22:63).At one time, a short dedicatory inscription, indicating that the nilometer was built in 861, completed the frieze. This was removed in 872 and replaced by more Qur’an inscriptions, probably by Ibn Tulun as a means of asserting his independence from Abbasid Baghdad.The stone-lined pit—circular at the bottom and rectangular at the top—is accessed by a staircase hugging the interior wall. At one level the walls have recesses on each side with pointed arches and framed by thin columns, decorated with zig-zag patterns. These ‘tiers-point’ arches are, remarkably, of the same type that would characterize Gothic architecture in Europe some three hundred years later than their appearance here.In the medieval period, and possibly before, the moment the Nile flood reached 16 measured cubits along the vertical central column was a key moment for celebration. This was the signal for the Festival of the Opening of the Canal at Fumm Al-Khalig (the mouth of the canal). The Khalig lay along modern Port Said Street and consisted of a narrow waterway that bisected Cairo from south to north until it was finally paved over in 1898.The Khalig was dry for most of the year, and, certainly in its later years, widely considered a health hazard. Cesspit workers were employed to clean the canal every year by hand, and as late as 1870 a petition was presented to the Ottoman authorities urging them to do something about the awful stench and “forestall the possibility of an epidemic.”Nonetheless, John Gardner Wilkinson (1797–1875), considered by many to be the father of British Egyptology—he first numbered known tombs in the Valley of the Kings from KV1 to KV21, among other achievements—wrote extensively about the Festival in the 1847 Handbook for Travellers in Egypt, published as part of the well-respected John Murray handbooks for travelers (a series which eventually mutated into my all-time favorite set of guidebooks, the Blue Guides).On the night before the festival, according to Wilkinson, thousands of Cairenes crowded booths on the shore or boats on the river where they were suitably entertained. Marquees were also pitched along the north bank of the canal for the Governor of Cairo and other dignitaries.At about 8 am on the morning of the festival, the governor would arrive with his troops and attendants, and upon a signal, men would cut the dam holding back the Nile with hoes. A pillar of earth, ‘Arousat al-Nil’ or ‘The Bride of the Nile,’ would be left in the middle of the dam which, tradition held, was a substitute for a human sacrifice to the river gods in Pharaonic times.While the flood rushed into the canal, the governor would throw silver coins, and the men who had cut the dam would dive into the rapidly swirling water to retrieve them, with the occasional unfortunate result.As soon as sufficient water had entered the Khalig, boats full of Cairenes would pass through the canal.This no-doubt colorful spectacle came to an abrupt end, of course, when the Khalig—which was a particularly noisome ditch running through the center of the city for most of the months of the year—was paved over (and became the first tram line in Cairo).After the initial damming of the Nile at Aswan in the early twentieth century, nilometersalso began to fall out of use, and, indeed, the fine example on the end of Roda Island no longer connects to the river at all, though it may have done so as late as 1970.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/16847.jpg,"['nilometer', 'water', 'river', 'level', 'ibn', 'island', 'flood', 'canal', 'medieval', 'nile', 'measuring']", ,none

Western Leaders Are Promoting Dictatorship, Not Democracy, in Egypt

The severity of the Egyptian authorities’ crackdown on dissidents in recent years has left many activists unwilling to defy the regime of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The waves of political activism that preceded the 2011 revolution and peaked in the wake of that uprising have been fading since the military coup of July 2013. Fewer and fewer democrats and human rights activists are willing to subject themselves to the regime’s wrath, which can include military trials as well as “torture, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances,” according to Human Rights Watch.

Given this environment, it was a surprise when a series of short, straightforward videos started to flood Egyptian social media networks on Feb. 6, featuring citizens from various backgrounds making a unified statement: “I am an Egyptian citizen, and I say no to the constitutional amendments.” If adopted, the government’s proposed amendments could pave the way for Sisi to stay in office until 2034. (When he was the country’s defense minister, Sisi led the 2013 coup that ousted then-President Mohamed Morsi before becoming president himself a year later.)

As it stands, Egypt’s Constitution, drafted and adopted in January 2014 in the wake of the coup, stipulates that no amendments may be made to the article that limits the presidency to two four-year terms. This is exactly what pro-Sisi forces are trying to change. After the idea was first floated in the media by pundits known for their ties to the country’s rulers, the amendments were proposed in Parliament, which provisionally approved them on Thursday.

The amendments will now be reviewed in a parliamentary committee before they are put to another vote. If passed in Parliament, a national referendum will be held. Unfortunately, Sisi’s latest power grab has been met with nearly universal silence from Western leaders who profess to care about human rights and democracy.

Many Egyptians have already announced their opposition to the amendments online. The majority of the videos have been posted by ordinary people rather than high-profile activists. Many among the latter group are in political detention or in exile anyway, or they are trying to keep a low profile to avoid the fate of those who are already under the security forces’ grip.

Instead, anger is being expressed in hundreds of videos that are posted on an anonymous Facebook page that defines its mission as helping Egyptians seek “change for the better” and “organize” to make that change happen. Ordinary people have been filming themselves expressing their opposition to the amendments and posting their videos online, in rapidly increasing numbers, via this page. The videos feature random faces of women and men, young and old, and bourgeois and working-class citizens as they make short statements against the backgrounds of simple Egyptian homes.

Some have no faces at all; they recorded only their voices to avoid being identified and harmed by the government’s security agencies. Commenters cheer for those who have had the courage to express their rejection of the amendments. The commenters also express their fear: “May God protect you” and “Stay safe” appear alongside “Bravo” and “We will prevail.”

None of those who posted the videos are reported to have been arrested or harmed, but fear for their safety is growing and justified. The Sisi regime has not taken action against every single dissenter, but it typically takes action at random, and when it does, it can be vicious and merciless. An estimated 60,000 people have been arrested “on political grounds” since the coup.

The regime’s response has already started—not toward those in the videos but toward a prominent public figure: Khaled Youssef, a film director and member of Parliament who had expressed support for Sisi amid the 2013 coup and who was a member of the committee that drafted the constitution in 2014. Youssef announced on Feb. 3 that he was against the amendments, adding on his Facebook and Twitter accounts that he realized this stance might result in imprisonment on “fake charges.”

His prediction has partially come true. Two actresses were arrested on Feb. 7 for committing “debauchery” over a leaked video in which they appear dancing in their underwear. The actresses reportedly told investigators that the video was filmed by Youssef in his apartment, according to Egyptian media outlets. While Youssef himself has not been arrested, he is being subjected to what he described to BBC Arabic as a “moral assassination.” In the context of a conservative Egyptian society, extramarital sexual relationships can seriously damage a public figure’s reputation. The two actresses’ arrest also constitutes an indirect threat against Youssef: If they were arrested, then he might soon be detained, too.

In a similar episode, a pro-government lawyer filed a lawsuit against yet another lawmaker, Haitham al-Hariri, who voiced his criticism of the amendments. The lawyer accuses Hariri of “harassment over the phone” in relation to a leaked call between him and his female office manager.

The issue is not whether the leaked recordings are real or whether Youssef and Hariri engaged in behavior that requires prosecution—it is rather about the timing at which their purported mistakes have surfaced. The current security agencies and judicial system are by no means known for supporting women against harassment and abuse.

Less than five months ago, an Egyptian court sentenced a harassment victim to two years in prison for a Facebook video in which she condemned sexual harassment and expressed resentment of the authorities’ failure to protect women. So when a pro-government lawyer, who is known to have acted on the regime’s behalf for years, accuses Hariri of phone harassment, this means that the regime is simply being opportunistic. After all, the same lawyer also filed a lawsuit in December against an actress, accusing her of “incitement to debauchery” after she wore a dress that was allegedly revealing and inappropriate. He is clearly no supporter of women’s rights and freedoms.

The silver lining is that the anti-amendment videos have continued to flood social media despite the attacks on Youssef and Hariri and in defiance of the fear that Sisi and the state’s security apparatus have been cultivating since 2013. This is not a sign of imminent regime change or radical progress toward more democratic rule in the country. It is nonetheless significant that Egyptians are undertaking collective action and becoming conscious of their ability to challenge a ruling elite that has created what Amnesty International calls an “open-air prison for critics.”

Popular anger has been growing, slowly. Sisi no longer enjoys the popularity he had when he first seized power in 2013 and 2014. The Egyptian polling center Baseera found that the president’s popularity fell from 54 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2016. In addition to resentment of human rights violations under his rule, anger against Sisi’s policies escalated after he devalued the Egyptian currency and lifted fuel subsidies that had been in place for decades. Both steps were implemented in 2016, leading to a hike in the prices of basic goods. This has in turn affected Egyptians’ standard of living and made it harder for many of them to make ends meet.

In the same year, there were rare and massive protests against Sisi’s decision to cede Egypt’s sovereignty over the two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, whose rulers have supported Sisi and supplied him with aid and loans since the coup. The protests were suppressed, and dozens of protesters were arrested but only after they had signaled that Sisi’s actions would not always go unchallenged.

Unfortunately, the international community, by siding with Sisi, is defying the Egyptian people’s will. This is true of French President Emmanuel Macron, whose visit to Egypt in late January was an unmistakable show of support for Sisi and the ruling elite. Macron’s criticism of the human rights situation in the country boils down to empty rhetoric when assessed alongside the fact that France has become the top supplier of arms to Egypt in recent years. In addition to Rafale fighter jets, warships, and a military satellite, France also provided armored vehicles that have been “used to violently crush dissent in Cairo and Alexandria,” according to an Amnesty International report.

It is no wonder that the heads of Rafale producer Dassault accompanied Macron on his visit to Cairo, the very visit in which he said in a joint press conference with his Egyptian counterpart that “stability cannot be dissociated from the question of human rights.” Sisi responded by saying that “Egypt does not advance through bloggers.”

Macron’s policies are only part of a larger pattern across an international community that has recently engaged in unprecedented complicity with Sisi’s authoritarianism. U.S. President Donald Trump told the Egyptian president during a meeting in September 2018 that the U.S.-Egyptian “relationship has never been stronger. And we’re working with Egypt on many different fronts, including military and trade. … It’s an honor to be with you again.” Trump is also a strong supporter of the Saudi regime, which has backed Sisi economically and politically since the coup. And most recently, on Feb. 10, the Egyptian president assumed the chairmanship of the African Union—a first for Egypt since the regional organization’s establishment in 2002.

After being appointed the AU’s chairman, Sisi said in a speech to the AU assembly that the continent is facing the threat of terrorism. In doing so, he played a card that has served him well in international forums. Despite his tough talk on terrorism, Sisi has failed to defeat the Islamic State’s affiliate in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula nearly five years after he became president. And he has repeatedly misled his international audience by arguing that all his opponents are Islamist terrorists and that this justified their detention. This is not true. Many of the regime’s critics are secularists and liberals.

And those who do come from the Islamist-leaning Muslim Brotherhood cannot be described as terrorists, either. The group has repeatedly stressed its adherence to peaceful means of opposition. Its ability to pose a threat to Sisi’s power in any way has been dramatically weakened because thousands of its members were jailed or fled the country after 2013. Only a small minority of its younger members have reportedly become radicalized and disillusioned with the group’s leadership in recent years. If a small minority of younger Islamists have become extremists, it only proves that flagrant injustice breeds grievances and raises the chances of radicalization.

Egypt’s post-2011 political spectrum, which saw a stark division between Islamists and non-Islamists, does not represent the country’s scene any longer. Resentment and bitterness are now rising among Egyptians from various backgrounds, and many of Sisi’s critics are ordinary people with no political experience or interest in ideology.

It is up to European and U.S. leaders to side with the Egyptian people or with a regime that has trampled its citizens’ human rights. It is up to Western powers to live up to their claims that they value and champion justice, rights, and freedoms—or to turn a blind eye as their ally violates these values.","Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/macronsisi.jpg?w=1000,"['leaders', 'egyptian', 'sisi', 'democracy', 'youssef', 'president', 'amendments', 'dictatorship', 'videos', 'human', 'western', 'rights', 'regime', 'sisis', 'promoting', 'egypt']", ,none

But most Egyptians view his rule as a time of painful belt-tightening, with soaring inflation, a currency crash and cuts to subsidies that have made fuel, electricity and water more expensive.

Now there is a ray of hope emerging a hundred miles offshore.

It comes in the form of a windfall natural gas discovery with the potential to lift Egypt’s limping economy, build a new commercial alliance with Israel and, maybe, even revive the country’s diminished regional clout.

Egypt’s gas push is part of a tectonic shift in energy and geopolitics. Natural gas, long a poor cousin to oil, is gaining importance and becoming a tool for countries to leverage power and prestige. Advances in the shipping of liquefied gas have made it a global fuel and strengthened the hand of countries that until recently were not major energy exporters, including the United States and now Egypt.

The flood of new gas has been bad news for traditional exporters, particularly Russia, which has had to slash gas prices to maintain sales to Europe. Many European countries have long sought to reduce their dependence on Russia and are eager to establish new suppliers even if that means doing business with autocratic states like Egypt and Qatar, a longstanding gas supplier embroiled in a bitter diplomatic feud with its Persian Gulf neighbors.","Mon, 11 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/business/07egyptgas0/07egyptgas0-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=6a1ed7d8a46105592510a45b68ef3b292c3ce8e19c8e7be7527603e1ef1b84b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['egypt', 'states', 'gas', 'field', 'natural', 'russia', 'growth', 'exporters', 'long', 'fuel', 'energy', 'countries', 'looks', 'influence', 'offshore']", ,none

Slideshow ( 5 images )

The quantity of drugs seized In Gaza in January was as much as for the whole of 2016, officials said. Eight major dealers were arrested in one of the biggest police stings to date.

Palestinian and Egyptian gangs move marijuana and an opioid painkiller called tramadol from Egypt into Gaza, where two million Palestinians live in a territory about 45 km long and up to 12 km wide and where four in 10 young men have no job, pushing some towards drugs.

“They think tramadol will change the reality and will make them feel at peace,” said Fadel Abu Heen, a psychiatrist. “They want to lose awareness and any feeling of reality.”

In their latest raid, police seized more than 100 kg (220 pounds) of marijuana, worth as much as $5 million on the streets of Gaza, and 250,000 tablets of tramadol, which sells for between 130 and 170 shekels ($35-$45) for 10 pills.

Until 2013, most smuggling was through a network of tunnels Palestinians and Egyptians had built under the border to move everything from food and consumer goods to cars, cattle and rockets.

But Egypt destroyed the tunnels - blowing them up or flooding them - in 2014 and 2015 to crack down on the trade. Since then, smugglers have found new ways of shifting merchandise.

Drugs are moved inside cooking gas canisters or washing machines. Sometimes, small quantities are thrown or catapulted from Egypt into Gaza. There are kilometers of tubes used to move small packages, and in some cases drugs are shipped inside goods imported from Israel.

“It is a problem but not a phenomenon,” said Ahmed Al-Qidra, head of Gaza’s anti-drug squad. “We suffer from it just as most countries all over the world.”

But sentences for drug dealing had become more lenient over the years and may have helped spur a resurgence, he said. The law allows life sentences and even the death penalty for drug smugglers, but many manage to escape long prison terms, he said.

Yehya Al-Farra, an aide to Gaza’s attorney-general, said the courts needed to get at least at tough as they were in 2009 when one dealer got 15 years in prison.

“The dealer who sells poison is a killer of the soul, he is the same as the killer who uses a gun or a knife,” Farra told Reuters. “Therefore, the law states that a punishment up to the death penalty can be applied.”

He and Qidra want more recruits to the anti-drug squad and more medical facilities to treat addicts.

Inside a Gaza prison, convicts urged men to reject drugs. A 26-year-old barber said he started taking half a tramadol a day after a friend offered him some. Soon he was addicted.

“I urge young people ... to give up bad friends, otherwise they will be destroyed like me,” he said. “I was a respected man who knew a loser friend and I became a loser myself.”","Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170307&t=2&i=1175275019&r=LYNXMPED261EC&w=800,"['drugs', 'hamas', 'tunnels', 'squad', 'smuggling', 'tougher', 'young', 'tramadol', 'marijuana', 'flood', 'gaza', 'smugglers', 'egypt']", ,none

The levels of the White Nile and Blue Nile was reported at 17.14 meters in Khartoum, a record high due to heavy rain in Ethiopia.

The ministry warned, in a statement on Monday evening, of serious floods over the next two days, flooding large areas of Khartoum and 12 other states in the north and center of the country.

Water level showed an increase above the annual average in the Blue Nile, due to rain and floods during the past few days, Director of the Nile Forecast Center of the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Eman Sayed, confirmed.

The benefit to Sudan from the rainwater is limited, she added, the flat Sudanese terrain prevents water from reaching the riverbed.

The heavy rainfall in Sudan has caused severe flooding in some areas, Sayed said, pointing out that this weather change will increase water in Lake Nasser in Egypt in the coming few days.

According to Sayed, 85 percent of water flowing into the Egyptian Nile comes from the Ethiopian plateau during this season, beginning the first of August and ending in October, .

So far, the flooding is within the average rate, despite heavy clouds above the Ethiopian plateau. The flood will show its semi-final results next month, she sxplained.

Although the Nile recorded its highest rise at the confluence of the Blue and White rivers in Sudan, the floods will not have an impact on the High Dam in Egypt, sources said.

Big banners and posters supporting the constitutional amendments have been put up across Egypt before the parliament takes its official vote on April 14 and the national referendum that is yet to be announced.

The amendments include extending the presidential term from four to six years in Article 140 of the constitution, which could allow President Sisi to stay in power until 2034, and a quota specifying at least 25 percent female representation in parliament as well as an “appropriate representation” of the youth, farmers, workers and Copts.

The amendments also give the president new authorities over appointing members of the judiciary and increase the army’s role in “safeguarding the constitution and the ideals of democracy, and maintaining a civil state.”

There is suspicion regarding the funding of these posters, yet it is most likely by members of the House of Representatives in the parliament who support the amendments and pro-state political parties, such as the Nation’s Future Party (NFP).

Around 485 members of the parliament who support the amendments have already held hundreds of seminars in various governorates in Egypt, in which they explained the need to participate and vote for the constitutional amendments.

Meanwhile, the parliament is still preparing the ground for the final constitution vote on 14 April, after organizing several hearing sessions throughout last month.

After the hearing sessions were concluded, the Legislative and Constitutional Affairs Committee met this week to finalise a draft of the amendments.

The amendments must first be approved by two-thirds of the members of the House, then it proceeds to a national referendum to be fully enacted into law.

Who is for the amendments?

The parliament took a provisional vote on 14 February, which saw an overwhelming majority (485 out of 596) approve the constitutional amendments.

Parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Aal defended the proposed changes, arguing they will reinforce stability and move Egypt forward on the road to political reform and democratisation.

“When we compiled the first draft of the current 2014 constitution we were under heavy pressure. We had been given one month, and we were doing our job at a time of curfew and terrorist threats,” he said.

“Haven’t we seen many states, some of them members of the UN Security Council, amend their constitutions to increase the presidential term? We also want to have a strong president who can deliver stability and development. And it is up to President Al-Sisi to decide whether he wants to run.”

The Egyptian Federation of Investors held a conference entitled “Constitutional Amendments, Stability for Investment”, which stated that the amendments will ensure more stability and a better investment climate, adding that Sisi’s rule saw greater economic achievements and gains for investors.

Mohamed Rifaat, who works for Amirty for Investment, told Egyptian Streets that as an investor, the current government introduced more flexibility in the laws and created a stable environment that encouraged more investment.

The Egyptian Cultural Club and the Coptic Association in the United States also held a seminar in New Jersey on Saturday for the Egyptian community to discuss and support the constitutional amendments.

MP Margaret Azer noted that President Sisi’s era as “the golden age for Egyptian women.”

“We are talking here about a real representation of Egyptian women in various fields,” Azir added.

Who is against the amendments?

However, a number of leftist and secular parties as well as several human rights organisations have expressed their objections to the constitutional amendments.

The Egyptian Social Democratic Party, the Karama (Dignity) Party, the Conservatives Party, the Tagammu Party and the Reform and Development Party all denounced the amendments during the hearing sessions on 27 and 28 March.

Mohamed Anwar Al-Sadat, head of the Reform and Development Party, said the amendments “serve the interests of one person”, and described the debate surrounding the amendments as “pre-packaged”.

“The media has been effectively prevented from reporting the dialogue. The only figures allowed to appear on television are those who support the amendments. There has not been a single opposition voice in the national media.”

“The current amendments are an attack on the principle of the rotation of power. They are there to allow one figure to stay in power. They also place the president of the republic as head of the Higher Council for Judges, undermining any separation of powers,” Mohamed Farid Zahran, head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said.

Eight Egyptian human rights NGOs have also rejected calls to amend the constitution, and called on “free Egyptian voices to push on against Al-Sisi’s commitment to the provisions of the 2014 constitution and to leave office as soon as his second and final term ends in June 2022”.

The organisations added that running for presidency for only two terms “is – almost – the only gain won by the democratic movement on 25 January 2011,” and that the amendments represent a real threat to the political and social stability of the country.

Nazra for Feminist Studies also wrote a research paper titled “The Constitutional Amendments Do Not Establish A Democracy that Supports Women in Politics,” expressing its concern for the democratic transition in Egypt.

“Separating the proposed amendments to Article 102 from the rest of the constitutional amendments and centralizing only raising women’s quotas may not truly empower women,” the paper stated.

“The myopic focus on women’s quotas irrespective of the larger democratic atmosphere governing it may exclude many women, rather than boost their representation and empower them.”

“Symbolic” rights for women cannot replace their active participation as important social actors playing a role in a true pluralist democracy, rooted in a firm belief in women’s diversity and voices and the values of pluralism, equality and freedom for both women and men.”

Two notable actors, Amr Waked and Khaled Abul Naga, attended a Congress panel criticising proposed amendments to Egypt’s constitution in Washington in late March.

Following the panel, the two actors were expelled from The Egyptian Actors Union and were accused of “high treason”, as the two actors unilaterally spoke to “external powers” to back the “agendas of conspirators” aiming to undermine Egypt’s security and stability.

A number of youth who were part of the Jan 25th 2011 revolution also expressed opposition.

“I personally believe that supporting it is equal to betraying the revolution and its martyrs,” one source who preferred to stay autonomous told Egyptian Streets, “I also do not think it is completely democratic, I remember that around 20 people were detained for starting a campaign called “?? ? ????? ?? ????” against the constitutional amendments.”

CAIRO - 26 October 2019: Director of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority Mahmoud Shaheen denied on Saturday what NASA had predicted of an ""unusual"" tropical cyclone unprecedentedly hitting some parts of Egypt.



Shaheen said that Egypt will not be hit by hurricanes but exposed to tropical depressions, which can be as violent and in-depth as the depression we are currently experiencing.



NASA published a picture showing block of giant clouds approaching Egypt amid warnings of heavy rain and thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday.



The Washington Post said NASA's image suggested an unusual tropical cyclone in some areas of Egypt and Israel, threatening storms and heavy rains and possibly even coastal flooding.



Risk areas



Shaheen said that the tropical depression between Cyprus and the Egyptian coast affects us with rain and wind, and this is what happened in the province of Alexandria this morning is scheduled to continue on the north of the Delta and the rest of the coast of Egypt Northern «Baltim, Port Said, Damietta, Ismailia, Arish and Rafah Central Sinai», these areas are experiencing rain on Saturday.



Shaheen confirmed that moderate rainfall is expected in Cairo and northern Upper Egypt.



The Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) warned officials in coastal areas, Canal cities, Central and North Sinai to take the necessary measures to face the risks that may arise from floods.



Flights cancelled



The General Authority for Meteorology advised to cancel school and other trips to the governorates of the northern coasts, Delta, Canal cities and north and central Sinai on Saturday.



The authority also demanded the cancellation of safari trips and non-residence in the compounds in these areas in order to ensure the safety of citizens and to prevent traffic jams.



The authority also advise citizens in the governorates of the northern coasts, Delta, Canal cities, North and Central Sinai not to be present in places where there is rain as much as possible, except in case of extreme.



The Meteorological Authority called on the citizens to help the concerned authorities in removing the accumulated quantities of water after the rain falls and advises the Authority not to be present under the metal plates or next to the lighting poles and electricity kiosks.



Date of stabilization of weather conditions



The Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) announces to citizens that as of Sunday, 27 October, the weather conditions will improve with light rainfall on the northern coastal areas and central Sinai.



Ashraf Saber Zaki, Acting Chairman of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority, said that the weather instability is expected to continue from Friday October 25 evening for 24 hours.



Zaki explained that the proliferation of low and medium clouds accompanied by rainfall and heavy and thunder on the northern coasts and Alexandria and Rashid and Baltim and Damietta and Arish and Rafah



Zaki said that the governorates of North Sinai, Delta and the cities of Ismailia Canal, Suez and Port Said reach the limit of floods, which leads to disruption of maritime traffic on the Mediterranean



Not out of homes



The cabinet instructed officials in Mediterranean, Delta, Canal and North and Central Sinai cities to raise the state of emergency to the maximum degree in preparation for instability in weather conditions.



The cabinet appealed to citizens to abide by homes on Saturday and count out except in cases of extreme necessity and commitment to drive vehicles quietly, especially on highways.



The warning concerned the people of the northern coastal governorates, the Delta, the Canal cities, and North and Central Sinai, in order to protect their safety and prevent traffic jams and to allow the concerned authorities to remove the accumulated quantities due to the expected heavy rains.



Flood Forecasting



The flood forecasting center affiliated to the Ministry of Irrigation reported that the maps of rain forecasting throughout the country during the next 72 hours showed the continuation of rainfall and may reach 20 mm on North Sinai and the Gulf of Suez and less severe on the northern and western coasts.","Sat, 26 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/60375.jpg,"['hit', 'official', 'northern', 'meteorological', 'weather', 'canal', 'sinai', 'authority', 'central', 'typhoon', 'rain', 'north', 'delta', 'egypt', 'cities']", ,none

As recently as the 1990s, it was filled with water, but now it is bone dry.

The Middle East is experiencing its most severe drought in 900 years, according to NASA-- one which is seemingly endless. The drought peaked between 2006-2010, and although 2007, 2009 and 2010 saw “normal” amounts of total rainfall, the region was still in drought.

And therein lies the paradox. A combination of factors, including water management and when the rain falls, means there can still be drought and water scarcity even if it rains a “normal” total amount. If winter rain is typically spread out between November and May, these non-drought-ending rains fell between, say, January and April, often in torrential downpours. This has led to flash flooding of the sort that much of the Middle East has seen this winter, which in turn has led to the erosion of topsoil that farmers rely on for a successful crop. And these extreme drought/flooding events are becoming more frequent.

We all know that water is necessary, and that a lack of water in a country or region is destabilizing. And now we’re watching the fearful possibilities of longterm water instability play out across the Middle East and North Africa. Several countries are experiencing instability or conflict connected to climate change-linked drought:

Syria has been engulfed in violence, a shadow of the former country it once was.

In an Iraq teetering on the edge of stability, water is threatening to topple the order and systems that are in place both in the north, which receives more rainfall, and in the south. Drought coupled with water mismanagement in the south have led to mass protests, specifically in the southern city of Basra, once known as the Venice of the east for its abundance of water. In northern Iraq in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, there are brewing tensions over water between the Kurds and the Iraqis, as well as between the Kurds, Iranians and Turks, who share borders and rivers.

Jordan witnessed their largest anti-government protest in recent years last summer, with water availability as a contributing factor. The protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki, but the unrest has not totally subsided.

Lebanon is on the brink of a water crisis due to a combination of government failures and climate change.

Yemen is continuing to undergo what the United Nations calls the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The ongoing war and power struggle has been tied to drought and resource mismanagement.

The revolution in Egypt was, too, at least partially connected to climate change impacted water scarcity. As Thomas Friedman writes, the numbers tell the story: “Bread provides one-third of the caloric intake in Egypt, a country where 38 percent of income is spent on food,” notes Sternberg. “The doubling of global wheat prices — from $157/metric ton in June 2010 to $326/metric ton in February 2011 — thus significantly impacted the country’s food supply and availability.” Global food prices peaked at an all-time high in March 2011, shortly after President Hosni Mubarak was toppled in Egypt.

Sudan is in the middle of an ongoing peaceful protest led by women that led to the removal of their longtime dictator, Omar al-Bashir. Weather.com last year that the looming instability in the northern African country was due in part to resource mismanagement and lack of water availability, which in turn has been linked to climate change.

Even the United Arab Emirates, famous for Dubai, the Manhattan of the Middle East, is not without its concerns. A 2005 report said that the UAE had the highest per capita consumption of water in the world. This, coupled with the fact that the water table has dropped about one meter per year for the last 30 years is cause for concern. The situation is not unlike the one that eventually led Jordanians to protest over water and food.

While all of these waves of instability were due to more than just water scarcity, water scarcity is one of the pressures that encourages instability. Take the war in Syrian as an example. When the drought peaked between 2006-2010, farmers started draining any groundwater they could find to tend to their crops. The farmers then depleted the groundwater, which was not replenished by rain. As their new waterless reality took shape, many men moved to larger cities like Hama, Homs and Damascus in search of work to support their families. They found no jobs and ended up living in shanty-towns on the outskirts of the cities, still desperate for work, for money, for sustenance.

One Syrian refugee told weather.com last year, “It would go from not raining at all to raining a lot to the point that it caused small floods,” and that the government did not provide support to all of the farmers who needed it.

Advertisement As Friedman wrote in 2013, “Since the first cry of ‘Allahu akbar,’ we all joined the revolution. Right away,” an activist told him. Was this about the drought, he asked her. “Of course,” she said, “the drought and unemployment were important in pushing people toward revolution.”

The trend of climate change prompting agricultural desperation leading to migration is becoming more prevalent. There are often other steps in this breakdown. Climate change factors could lead to other forms of scarcity, too, which leads to radicalization or often conflict, thus resulting in migration. “Most people don’t realize how much climate affects everything, from their property values to how hard people work,” Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told Rolling Stone.

Climate data indicates that the rain in the Middle East primarily comes from two directions (and I’m oversimplifying this): there’s the rain that moves over the Mediterranean Sea and then brings rain to parts of Israel, Lebanon and Syria, and there's the rain and melted snow that moves downwards from the mountains in Iraq, filling the rivers that flow through parts of the Fertile Crescent.

Much of the rain in the region comes off the Mediterranean in the west and moves eastward. As the system moves eastward, it becomes weaker and less rain falls. So even when there isn't a drought, a place like Raqqa averages less annual rainfall than places farther west like Damascus.

Or, put in more geopolitical terms, there are heavy rains in areas that are closer to the coast and less water inland, until eventually the rain just doesn’t make it there, as is illustrated in the map of rainfall through the land formerly known as the British Mandate over TransJordan. Tel Aviv and Jerusalem receive more rain than Amman. And Amman receives more rain than Basra, Iraq, which is on a similar latitude to the aforementioned two cities.

Water scarcity exacerbated by climate change has only made more apparent what’s been present throughout history, as articulated by Joshua Landis, a professor at the University of Oklahoma: that identity and water are inextricably tied in the region.

“The identities of the Middle East can really be understood in a simple map of a big Arabian Desert around which are sprinkled those cities on the coastline, with their own ships of the sea — the camels being the ships,” he says.

Speaking to weather.com for the Exodus series, Landis breaks down the Middle East in geographic and weather terms: “The Fertile Crescent is an upside down horseshoe that spreads through Israel up through Lebanon, Syria, over to where the Kurds are and then down the Tigris and Euphrates to Basra.”

The desert cities are “a string of cities like a pearl necklace encircl(ing) the vast desert. They demarcated two different societies and ways of life: those who were settled and derived their incomes from agriculture in the rain fed regions of the Fertile Crescent and those who pursued a more nomadic existence.”

Landis explained that “the Bedouin and their caravans were the ships of the desert, carrying goods between the cities sprinkled around the great expanse of the desert, just as the Mediterranean Sea served to connect the many city states that surrounded it. The cities served as entrepôts where goods were exchanged between the desert and sown and where the different communities came together. They were divided into quarters marked out by each community, and had Jewish, Armenian, Kurdish, Christian, Shia, and Sunni quarters.”

Interestingly, ISIS’ trajectory indicates that they played into the narrative of defending Sunni interests, a Brookings Institute study found, which means they were also conquering wetter territory. At its peak, the ISIS state in 2015 pushed up against the rain-line cities and took the desert cities, the cities of the Bedouin tribal Sunni part of that region. This is not a coincidence, according to Landis: it had everything to do with both water and identity.

All of this isn’t to say that the conflict in the Middle East are the sole outcome of identity clashes and water scarcity, but rather to illustrate that these factors, often overlooked in shorter conversations, are vital pieces to this larger puzzle of instability in the region. The ripple effects of these two factors are proving catastrophic, both in the Middle East and globally. And as the long term climate forecast is for more heat and more water scarcity, it’s likely that more conflict, more instability, more war and more refugees are coming.","Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/SIR_8537_0.jpg,"['scarcity', 'water', 'east', 'probably', 'desert', 'led', 'middle', 'drought', 'rain', 'climate', 'easts', 'refugees', 'cycle', 'lead', 'cities']", ,drought
68,68,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ancient Egyptian uprisings triggered by volcanic eruptions | Research - Chemistry World,https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/ancient-egyptian-uprisings-triggered-by-volcanic-eruptions/3008247.article,"Atmospheric chemistry played a surprising life and death role in ancient Egypt. New evidence has emerged that links volcanic eruptions with disruption of the rainfall that fed the Nile. This in turn led to rising food prices, riots and even open revolt against the ruling Ptolemaic dynasty.

The climate scientists and historians behind the discovery uncovered a strong relationship between major volcanic events and low water levels in the river Nile. Historically, the Nile’s annual flood was crucial for agriculture. When flooding was lighter than usual there were severe societal pressures as harvests failed and food prices rose. Ptolemaic era (305–30BC) documents reveal that this often culminated with civil unrest and rebellions against the authority of the Greek kings who ruled Egypt at the time.

‘Volcanoes can inject millions of tonnes of sulfur gases high into the atmosphere, where they form a layer of tiny, reflective liquid aerosols that scatter sunlight back into space,’ explains Michael Mills an atmospheric chemist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, US, who was not involved in the project. ‘These particles can remain in the upper atmosphere for several years, reducing sunlight and temperatures at the Earth’s surface. Changes in precipitation patterns can follow, including a southward shift of monsoon regions following eruptions in the northern hemisphere.’

Chemical record Sulfur aerosols released into the stratosphere by volcanoes eventually make their way towards the Earth’s poles. Once there they drift back to the ground in snow and are incorporated into ice sheets, leaving a pristine record of when major eruptions took place. ‘The sulfur usually indicates the contribution from marine biogenic sulfur emission – the ocean emits a lot of sulfur,’ explains Michael Sigl, of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. ‘But every 10 years on average you get a big spike in total sulfur, and that’s coming from a volcanic eruption.’ Sigl helped analyse ice cores extracted from depths of 150–200m in the Antarctic, and around 400–500m in Greenland, to determine dates of large volcanic eruptions over the last 2500 years.

Water meter

To understand the impact that volcano-driven shifts in rainfall have had on the river Nile, a team led by Trinity College Dublin’s Francis Ludlow compared a historical record of the Nile’s water level, known as the Islamic Nilometer, with chemical tracers of volcanic activity locked away in the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

The Nilometer, housed on Rhoda Island in Cairo, preserves a chronicle of the Nile’s high water mark, stretching back to 622. ‘It’s an actual fully quantitative measurement. It’s a beautiful, fixed climate record – but often weirdly overlooked by climatologists,’ says Ludlow. When they analysed the Nilometer data alongside ice core data, Ludlow’s team found a clear link. ‘In these eruption dates – and we looked at about 60 of them – you can see a big decrease in Nile summer flooding in those years.’ In fact, in eruption years the summer flooding was, on average, 22cm lower than in non-eruption years.

Having modelled the Nile’s recent response to volcanic events, the team then looked further back in time, to the Ptolemaic era – a period stretching from the death of Alexander the Great to the time of Cleopatra VII. Polar ice cores extracted from depths of several hundred meters allowed the team to date volcanic events – and therefore low Niles – over the last 2500 years. By scouring ancient documents the researchers found that these dry cycles were strongly associated with periods of revolt in ancient Egypt and a lack of funds to wage war with its rivals.

A house divided

But the University of Cambridge’s Dorothy Thompson, an expert on Hellenistic Egypt, points out that in addition to the impact of climate, the Ptolemaic ruling family was a fractious one and discord at the top was likely also a factor. Ethnic tensions between immigrant Greeks and native Egyptians were another running issue, while from the second century BC, the growing threat of Rome – a new Mediterranean superpower – added to the Ptolemaic dynasty’s problems.

‘What this study provides is strong support for the importance of economic factors since both the livelihood of individuals and overall the wealth of Egypt depended on the agriculture made possible by the flood of the Nile. The Nile flood was always key,’ says Thompson.

The Ptolemaic era came to an end with Cleopatra’s suicide in 30BC, a year after her naval defeat by Rome at the Battle of Actium. By then the state’s power had been weakened by a decade of repeated poor flooding of the Nile, famine and rural depopulation – this followed the third largest volcanic eruption of the past two and a half millennia.

With 70% of the world’s population currently living in monsoon-dependent regions, the findings also have significance today. ‘There has not been a large-magnitude eruption since the year 1991 and our understanding of the hydroclimatic response following volcanic eruptions is far from complete,’ says Anja Schmidt, who researches the environmental impacts of volcanic aerosols also at the University of Cambridge. ‘Therefore past records as utilised in this study are of great value and serve as a potential warning sign as to how susceptible certain regions of the world may be to drought when the next large eruption occurs.’

History meets chemistry

Thompson says that this study underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary dialogue. ‘I look forward to further work of this kind. It would, for instance, be interesting to know if the market prices for wheat recorded in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia in the same period were similarly affected by volcanic activity.’

This sentiment is echoed by University of Southern California historian Christelle Fischer-Bovet. ‘It is extraordinary to have now a new independent set of evidence about Nile floods during the three centuries of Ptolemaic rule,’ she says. ‘Historians of the Ptolemaic period have looked at ancient documents informing us on the Nile flood, whether directly or indirectly, but the level of reliability of these texts is variable.’

Fischer-Bovet hopes that future partnerships of this sort will enable greater understanding of the pressures faced by ancient societies. ‘Any additional piece of evidence can be a great help, especially in ancient history where our sources are so scarce. Soil quality, level of salinisation, actual nutritive level of ancient cereals are all examples of new information we may be able to have access through this kind of collaboration,’ she observes.","Wed, 08 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/1/2/133912_CW241017_Daily-stories_Chemistry-tracking-the-decline-of-ancient-Egypt.jpg,"['egypt', 'egyptian', 'sulfur', 'eruption', 'eruptions', 'ptolemaic', 'uprisings', 'niles', 'ice', 'triggered', 'volcanic', 'ancient', 'nile']", ,flood

It was built on loosely packed soil which was heavily saturated—the by-product of both a high water table and recent flooding. On top of that soil, incredibly heavy structures had been built. And it was in a seismically active area, abutting the long Hellenic arc, a subduction zone where the Mediterranean joins the Aegean. Today, few places are as ripe for catastrophe—but many carry risk factors for disaster.

Soil liquefaction is a horrifying phenomenon. Videos of its occurrence look like found-footage documentaries of the Second Coming: Buildings seem to simply slip away, the earth gives out, and the once-steady structures slide into the morass. But the science behind this phenomenon is straightforward. It tends to occur in loosely packed soils—silty areas near rivers, infilled harbors and reclaimed land, marshy regions—that are highly saturated, often due to poor drainage conditions. Then add weight: buildings, roads, anything large and heavy that an engineer (or anyone else, for that matter) would not want to have move suddenly.

Most of the time, nothing will happen. The saturated land will bear the weight, the soil will hold steady, and life will go on. But when pressure is exerted abruptly on the soil, combined with the weight from heavy structures atop it, the ground will stop behaving like a solid material and begin behaving like a liquid. The most common instigator for that sort of pressure is a seismic event—an earthquake.

Quakes cause the exact sort of back-and-forth motion required to raise the water pressure within the ground, which causes the weight of the buildings and roads above to be borne instead by the water—and water cannot support large buildings. That causes collapse, essentially instantaneously.

“People aren’t prepared like they should be,” says Dan Ander, the vice president of Washington Surveying and Rating Bureau, an insurance-ratings agency. “I don’t know if people understand liquefaction. They understand earthquake damage—I don’t know if they understand how that damage happens.”

The risk factors that lead to liquefaction could be compounded further, as climate change induces sea-level rise. Because liquefaction vulnerability increases when soil becomes more saturated, rising seas will naturally cause greater vulnerability in at-risk areas and have the potential to endanger previously safe points further inland. Thonis-Heracleion experienced flooding before its liquefaction event, possibly caused in part by relatively minor changes in the Mediterranean, which has seen its sea level rise incrementally since the last Ice Age. “If you raise the water level, you raise the pressure in the water all the way down the profile,” says Peter Campbell, an underwater archaeologist. “You consequently reduce the contact stress between the particles [so] you have less margin if any excess pressure is generated by the earthquake.”","Fri, 28 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/fvRvbwxdR9V1LGAvCx1XA7bhOkk=/0x0:2048x1067/960x500/media/img/mt/2019/06/RTRJ91P-1/original.jpg,"['rise', 'water', 'structures', 'buildings', 'sealevel', 'risk', 'hidden', 'saturated', 'liquefaction', 'pressure', 'demise', 'weight', 'hints', 'understand', 'ancient', 'soil', 'citys']", ,none

CAIRO – 28 September 2018: Egyptian Minister of Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati traveled to Kampala, Uganda on Sept. 26 to attend the closing of the Averting Flood Risks Project’s first phase in Kasese, Uganda.



The minister stated that he is pleased to be in the brotherly country and to attend the closing of the project’s phase one which was finalized in Feb. 2018.



The Egyptian minister was welcomed by the Ugandan Minister of Water and Environment Sam Cheptoris on Wednesday, Sept. 26. Wednesday’s meetings revolved around technical cooperation activities between Egypt's Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation and Uganda's Ministry of Water and Environment.



During the meeting in the Ugandan Ministry of Water, Abdel Ati referred to Kasese’s tragic history with floods, as it was subjected to many raging floods in the past 20 years, which come as a result of severe landslides in mountainous regions in the direction of residential areas, farms, Livestock and poultry, causing huge material and human losses.



Uganda sought Egypt’s assistance to limit the floods’ averts, which received immediate response from the Egyptian side. The ministry started to execute a project to protect the country’s citizens and properties within the framework of the technical cooperation between both countries.



A group of the Egyptian ministry’s experts were sent in a mission to examine the area and collect the required data to implement an urgent project to secure the country against flood dangers. The mission identified some high priority areas in grave danger.



A memorandum of understanding for the project was signed by both ministries in April 2016 in order for the project to be executed in several phases. The first phase was assigned to El-Mokawloon El-Arab (Arab contractors), one of the biggest Egyptian companies operating in Uganda and it officially started in March 13, 2017 and ended in Feb 2018, the minister of irrigation stated.



Ugandan Minister of Water and Environment Cheptoris expressed his pleasure with the technical cooperation between Egypt and Uganda in the fields of irrigation and water resources. He also commended the major technical expertise in the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources as they managed to put the floods’ water into use instead of being wasted, and causing losses.



Additionally, Cheptoris expressed the gratitude of Kasese’s citizens for the Egyptian government’s support to implement the project.



The Egyptian minister will visit the project’s location in Kases on Sept. 27; he will be accompanied by the Ugandan minister and the technical and guiding committees for the collaborative water projects between Egypt and Uganda to present the results of the committees’ meetings.



Abdel Ati stressed that these meetings come in the light of the standing collaboration between Egypt and Uganda to pursue the progress in the dual projects between both countries in the fields of irrigation and water resources.



This collaboration is represented in the memorandum of understanding signed in Jan. 2010 between both ministries to execute a number of vital projects worth $ 4.5 million. These projects include 75 boreholes in different areas in Uganda to provide drinking water, which were finalized in Dec. 2016.



Moreover, huge mechanical machines were exported to Uganda to be used in establishing the projects, especially the project of water containment dams to use rain water in providing drinking water for citizens, the containment dams' contract was signed with a Ugandan company in August 2017 and will be implemented soon.



Head of Nile Water Section Ahmed Bahaa el-Din stated that Egypt is always a source of technical assistance and expertise for Uganda. He added that this is obvious in the three developmental projects; The Egyptian-Ugandan Project to Resist Sea Grass, Controlling Sea Grass in Kyoga and Albert Lakes’ Project and the third project includes building five tanks to reserve rain water, building several boreholes and training Ugandan workers in the fields of water resources and irrigation.","Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/53025.jpg,"['egyptian', 'yields', 'water', 'ministry', 'min', 'minister', 'ugandan', 'irrigation', 'results', 'basin', 'project', 'projects', 'uganda', 'collaboration', 'countries', 'nile', 'technical']", ,flood

Fars Gov. Enayatollah Rahimi said a short but intense rainfall caused sudden flash flooding that inundated a main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers leaving the city. City officials did not have enough time to warn people in the area ahead of the deadly weather conditions.

The heavy storm system over the region delivered a month’s worth of rainfall in only a few hours, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Coupled with the terrain in the area, this may have caused a funneling effect, which is not uncommon to see in some extreme flash flooding episodes. “With the arrival of new precipitation into the country, more than 13 provinces of the country are involved in severe rainfall, snow and blizzard in a way that 22 communications routes of the country have been completely blocked,” semi-official Mehr News Agency said. Emergency and rescue organizations are on full alert in Esfahan and Tehran as the heavy rain is predicted to continue to fall in much of the country, especially in southwest to central Iran. The storm will continue to impact Iran Monday night and into early Tuesday morning before the weather system begins to ease late Tuesday.

Flash floods swamped a number of towns and villages around the fortress city of Carcassonne, leaving a trail of overturned cars, damaged roads and collapsed homes.

An elderly nun was swept to her death as rising waters smashed through a nunnery in the village of Villardonnel to the north of Carcassonne. Meanwhile, at least four people died overnight in the hard-hit village of Villegailhenc, local authorities said Monday. As Prime Minister Edouard Philippe headed to the scene, the French interior ministry said a total of 13 people had died after the equivalent of three months’ of rainfall in just a few hours.

“There’s water everywhere in the house. Everything is flooded,” Helene Segura told AFP by telephone from Villegailhenc where at least one small bridge had collapsed.

“When I look out the window, I can only see water and mud everywhere. It’s sad when you’re 70 years’ old like me and you need to redo your house, change the furniture and all the upholstery,” she said.

Authorities rushed in helicopters and 600 firemen to help with rescue operations, particularly those in the floodplain of the Aude river which hit its highest level in 100 years, according to the Vigicrues flood agency.

In the town of Trebes, near Carcassonne, the water in the Aude rose eight meters (26 feet) in just five hours, officials said. Around 1,000 people were evacuated in the area of Pezens, also near Carcassonne in the Aude area, due to fears that a nearby dam could burst.

The storms were triggered when a front of warm and humid air from the Mediterranean Sea slammed into colder air around the Massif central mountain range in central France, inundating an area from the eastern Pyrenees to Aveyron further north.

Violent storms on Sunday also hit Portugal, leaving 28 with minor injuries and hundreds of thousands without power amid flooding in the region around the capital Lisbon.

The heavy rain, which later rolled on through Spain, was the tail end of hurricane Leslie in the Atlantic which weakened to a post-tropical storm as it made landfall. Last week, an unrelated weather system moving across the Mediterranean left 12 dead in the Spanish island of Majorca and another two died in southeastern France.

Firemen responded to more than 250 calls overnight, as 160 to 180 mm (6 to 7 inches) of rain fell within five hours in Carcassonne.","Mon, 15 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/10/franc.jpg,"['aude', 'water', 'village', 'flooding', 'france', '13', 'weather', 'dead', 'villegailhenc', 'storms', 'carcassonne', 'died', 'rain', 'southwestern', 'hits', 'area']", ,flood

The authors of a paper published Tuesday developed a more accurate way of calculating land elevation based on satellite readings, a standard way of estimating the effects of sea level rise over large areas, and found that the previous numbers were far too optimistic. The new research shows that some 150 million people are now living on land that will be below the high-tide line by midcentury.

Southern Vietnam could all but disappear.

The first map shows earlier expectations of submerged land by 2050. But the new outlook, the second map, indicates that the bottom part of the country will be underwater at high tide.

More than 20 million people in Vietnam, almost one-quarter of the population, live on land that will be inundated.

Much of Ho Chi Minh City, the nation’s economic center, would disappear with it, according to the research, which was produced by Climate Central, a science organization based in New Jersey, and published in the journal Nature Communications. The projections don’t account for future population growth or land lost to coastal erosion.

Standard elevation measurements using satellites struggle to differentiate the true ground level from the tops of trees or buildings, said Scott A. Kulp, a researcher at Climate Central and one of the paper’s authors. So he and Benjamin Strauss, Climate Central’s chief executive, used artificial intelligence to determine the error rate and correct for it.

In Thailand, more than 10 percent of citizens now live on land that is likely to be inundated by 2050, compared with just 1 percent according to the earlier technique. The political and commercial capital, Bangkok, is particularly imperiled.

Climate change will put pressure on cities in multiple ways, said Loretta Hieber Girardet, a Bangkok resident and United Nations disaster risk-reduction official. Even as global warming floods more places, it will also push poor farmers off the land to seek work in cities.

“It is a dire formula,” she said.

In Shanghai, one of Asia’s most important economic engines, water threatens to consume the heart of the city and many other cities around it.

The findings don’t have to spell the end of those areas. The new data shows that 110 million people already live in places that are below the high tide line, which Mr. Strauss attributes to protective measures like seawalls and other barriers. Cities must invest vastly greater sums in such defenses, Mr. Strauss said, and they must do it quickly.

But even if that investment happens, defensive measures can go only so far. Mr. Strauss offered the example of New Orleans, a city below sea level that was devastated in 2005 when its extensive levees and other protections failed during Hurricane Katrina. “How deep a bowl do we want to live in”? he asked.

The new projections suggest that much of Mumbai, India’s financial capital and one of the largest cities in the world, is at risk of being wiped out. Built on what was once a series of islands, the city’s historic downtown core is particularly vulnerable.

Over all, the research shows that countries should start preparing now for more citizens to relocate internally, according to Dina Ionesco of the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental group that coordinates action on migrants and development.

“We’ve been trying to ring the alarm bells,” Ms. Ionesco said. “We know that it’s coming.” There is little modern precedent for this scale of population movement, she added.

The disappearance of cultural heritage could bring its own kind of devastation. Alexandria, Egypt, founded by Alexander the Great around 330 B.C., could be lost to rising waters.

In other places, the migration caused by rising seas could trigger or exacerbate regional conflicts.

Basra, the second-largest city in Iraq, could be mostly underwater by 2050. If that happens, the effects could be felt well beyond Iraq’s borders, according to John Castellaw, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general who was chief of staff for United States Central Command during the Iraq War.

Further loss of land to rising waters there “threatens to drive further social and political instability in the region, which could reignite armed conflict and increase the likelihood of terrorism,” said General Castellaw, who is now on the advisory board of the Center for Climate and Security, a research and advocacy group in Washington.

74,74,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Would flooding the deserts help stop global warming? - NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/would-flooding-deserts-help-stop-global-warming-n934551,"Imagine flooding a desert half the size of the Sahara. Using 238 trillion gallons of desalinated ocean water to do the job. Creating millions of 1-acre-square micro-reservoirs to grow enough algae to gobble up all of Earth’s climate-changing carbon dioxide. For an encore: How about spreading the water and fertilizer (the dead algae) to grow a vast new forest of oxygen-producing trees?

A Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Y Combinator, unveiled the radical desert flooding plan as one of four “moonshot” scenarios that it hopes innovators will explore as potential remedies to catastrophic global warming.

But would it work? And should it even be tried?

With unlimited capital and political will — both far from given — experts said the scheme would stand a chance of reducing dangerous greenhouse gas levels. But while they generally believe the climate crisis has become severe enough to push even extreme options onto the table, the experts cautioned against interventions that might create as many problems as they solve.

“We do not want to have this be purely profit driven,” said Greg Rau, a University of California, Santa Cruz climate scientist and part of the team that helped Y Combinator craft the request for proposals. “We are trying to benefit the planet, not just make money. So we need this kind of research and development first, but then oversight and governance over how any of this is deployed.”

The Y Combinator proposal grows out of what is now the consensus of climate scientists — that humanity needs to move beyond slowing the production of carbon dioxide and begin removing excess levels of the gas already straining Earth’s atmosphere.

The startup accelerator that helped finance Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit asked innovators last month to come forward with specific proposals on desert flooding and three other extreme plans for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. The existential threat posed by climate change requires research into solutions that the investment firm itself conceded could be “risky, unproven, even unlikely to work.”

Y Combinator said it had a rush of interest in its challenge. It declined to say how many took up the desert flooding option. But Sam Altman, Y Combinator's president, predicted that in 2019 his firm will fund three companies to pursue the “Plan B” climate solutions.

A host of scientists who have studied Earth’s ecosystems, climate change and bio-engineering said further exploration might be warranted. But they were quick to cite many reasons that desert flooding is not likely to succeed.

Massive size

Y Combinator called filling 1.7 million acres of arid land with 2-meter-deep pools of water “the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken.” Just to pump ocean water inland and desalinate it would require an electrical grid far greater than the one Earth now devotes to all other uses.

“It’s a desert for a reason,” said Lynn Fenstermaker, a research professor at Nevada’s Desert Research Institute. “Flooding the desert and then keeping the water there, in an already water-poor area with all the evaporation, is hard to imagine.”

Y Combinator doesn’t deny the magnitude of the challenge. “Economies of scale as well as breakthroughs in material science and construction technology will all be necessary for success,” its proposal says.

Unprecedented cost

Y Combinator pegs the price tag at $50 trillion. That’s roughly half the entire globe’s economic productivity for a year. Altman said in an interview that the cost for any solution will need to drop into the billions to become more realistic. “You can do a lot of things that require spending more money than you will ever be able to get,” Altman said, “and it just doesn’t come.” Brought to a more realistic price, he believes that governments will pay.

Destruction of unique ecosystems

Many species would be wiped out by massive man-made flooding of deserts. “People think there is nothing valuable in the deserts, but that is far from the truth,” said Henry Sun, a microbiologist and research professor at the Desert Research Center. “These diverse species deserve, and need, the desert to survive.” Most of the world’s countries would set a high bar, Sun said, before destroying habitat.

Potential for making things worse

Interfering with nature can have unexpected consequences. Katherine Mackey, a University of California, Irvine climate scientist, noted how Australia has long tried, and failed, to combat overpopulation of native species by introducing non-native creatures. Famous case in point: toads were introduced in 1935 to tame sugar cane-eating beetles. But the toads couldn’t climb sugar cane. So the beetles thrived, alongside their new neighbors — an out-of-control toad population.

“Saying that we intervened and created a problem with global warming, so let’s further intervene, that’s not the thing to do,” Mackey said. “That’s not how you fix the problem, by replacing it with another problem.”

Distracting from more workable solutions

Climate scientists believe that most, if not all, the needed solutions for limiting new greenhouse gas emissions and reducing current CO2 concentrations already exist. Environmentalist Paul Hawken has catalogued solutions in his Project Drawdown. Taken in total, Hawken has said, they would reduce emissions and sequester enough carbon to more than meet the goals laid out by world leaders in the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Among the carbon-sinking projects that would require little or no new technology: creating new forests in degraded pasture, farm and other land; criss-crossing fields with trees to create so-called silvopastures, which absorb far more carbon than open fields; and preserving and restoring peatlands, the boggy wetlands that store carbon at twice the rate of the world’s oceans.

“I think it’s far easier to, for instance, make our houses better insulated and solar powered, than to flood deserts. Also, from a timescale perspective, how quickly will this technology be available at scale?” said Mathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, an Oakland, California-based sustainability think tank. “If we want to solve climate, why not bet on the easy stuff?”

The case for a moonshot

Altman’s answer is that he and Y Combinator already support, and fund, pragmatic green energy companies. But big reductions in greenhouses gases are still needed and don’t appear to be coming quickly enough, the firm said.

Y Combinator suggests that flooding the deserts may be less risky than another solution on its list — fertilizing the oceans with massive amounts of iron or other nutrients to spur the growth of CO2-gobbling phytoplankton. Compared to ocean phytoplankton seeding, “doing so in desert reservoirs reduces systemic risk and exposure of the marine ecosystem to our widespread meddling,” Y Combinator’s request for proposals says.

“The window for easy solutions is already closed. Doing nothing is guaranteed suicide,” the firm said. Altman, 33, added: “All of this stuff is scary. However, runaway global warming where we all die is also quite scary. ...None of this is where we would like to be. But here we are.”

Activists and scientists interviewed by NBC News said exploration of far-out solutions is warranted — as long as researchers, governments and funders don’t lose focus on other fixes.

“The concern I have is that Silicon Valley seems very excited about these moonshots, when maybe what we need is a bunch of Boeing 737s,” said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a clean energy think tank and lobbying organization. “And to do it on a 10- to 15-year development cycle, not one that takes 30 years.”","Sun, 11 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_45/2640736/181109-desert-climate-change-sahara-cs-229p-2640736.jpg","['global', 'water', 'far', 'combinator', 'desert', 'research', 'solutions', 'y', 'firm', 'climate', 'deserts', 'help', 'warming', 'flooding', 'stop']", ,flood
75,75,FL-2019-000179-CAN,What Causes Flash Floods in the Middle East? - Eos,https://eos.org/research-spotlights/what-causes-flash-floods-in-the-middle-east,"Across the vast expanse of the Middle East, the climate varies with the terrain, but it is typically hot and dry throughout most of the region. Extreme precipitation events, although rare, are a crucial part of the region’s climate. These sporadic storms recharge the area’s freshwater stocks, supporting agriculture in the otherwise dry environment. But they can also cause deadly and economically devastating floods. Researchers have long sought a better understanding of the factors driving extreme precipitation events in the Middle East to improve our ability to predict major storms. This endeavor has been made both more complicated and more urgent by climate change.

Previous studies have linked heavy-rainfall events to two atmospheric features. Stratospheric potential vorticity (PV) intrusions, which occur when air from the stratosphere invades the upper troposphere, have been shown to precede extreme precipitation events in, for example, the Alps, southern Africa, and northwestern Africa. Atmospheric rivers, in which moisture travels along plume-like tracks, have been linked to rain and flooding in North America and Europe. Atmospheric rivers are often detected using vertically integrated water vapor fluxes (IVT), but few studies have looked at data on both IVT and PV intrusions.

Here de Vries et al. combined both into a single algorithm to detect extreme precipitation in an area covering eastern Egypt, southern Israel, Jordan, and parts of Saudi Arabia—all regions with low annual rainfall that have, nonetheless, been hit repeatedly with devastating rainfall events. The authors used data from a global reanalysis project, Interim-ERA, to identify stratospheric PV intrusions and IVT structures from 1979 to 2015 as well as extreme precipitation events, defined as days with rainfall that exceeds the 97.5th percentile.

First, the team demonstrated the success of the algorithm for four major precipitation events that inflicted severe damage in the Middle East: a 1979 storm that killed 50 people and displaced over 66,000, a 1994 storm that killed 600 people, another in 2005 that killed 29 people, and another in 2009 that caused 161 deaths and $900 million in damages. The authors found that in all four cases, stratospheric PV intrusions and IVT structures were clearly apparent. Next, a climatological analysis showed that PV and IVT features coincided with nearly 90% of all extreme precipitation days over the 37-year study period. Both PV and IVT occurrences were highly associated with the precipitation severity and mirrored seasonal rain trends, frequently appearing in October and tapering off around May. The longer the features persisted, the farther south the PV intrusions extended; the larger the IVT values were, the more extreme the rainfall was. IVT incursions were a particularly strong predictor of extreme precipitation days.

False alarms—or days in which both IVT and PV intrusions were present but the weather was dry—were not infrequent, but the authors found that in many of those cases, a key ingredient for extreme rainfall was missing: high tropospheric moisture content.

Finally, the authors evaluated the performance of the algorithm against precipitation observations. PV and IVT features contributed to about 40%–70% of the annual rainfall amounts and 50%–90% of the extreme precipitation days. This result provides strong evidence of the importance of PV and IVT in extreme precipitation events in the region.

Ultimately, the algorithm allows researchers to identify local-scale extreme rainfall events on the basis of large-scale meteorological features. The tool could help to improve both weather forecasts and warning systems and could help researchers evaluate how extreme precipitation events respond to a changing global climate.

The Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture will soon launch a new “modern” irrigation system.

This is a change of method recommended by the experts. It involves replacing flood irrigation practises, such as runoff, used to grow cereals such as rice. Instead, the government advocates drip, bubble irrigation and mist spraying.

These new systems should enable Egyptian farmers to work without depleting water resources. For several months, the Egyptian government has been engaged in a plan to rationalise water consumption. The decrease in the flow of the Nile River is partly responsible for this new policy. According to the government, the amount of rainwater entering the Nile from Ethiopian mountain ranges is below seasonal standards.

As a result, the flow of the Nile will decrease by 5 billion m3. “This deficit represents 10% of Egypt’s share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic metres of water, as established in a 1959 agreement allocating Nile water rights,” the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources recently stated. In response to this situation, in August 2019, the Egyptian government decided to amend Law 53/1966 on agriculture. Restrictions are now imposed on the cultivation of rice, sugar cane, bananas and all crops with a high water content.

Other alternatives

After having long played the role of the first source of surface water in Egypt, the Nile is no longer able to supply the entire country of the Pharaohs. The current government is relying on new water supply resources, including seawater desalination. A few days ago, the government announced that it had received an offer from an Emirian company for an investment of $800 million to build several desalination plants. They will produce 500,000 m³ of water per day. A committee has been formed at the Ministry of Housing to study in detail this major offer.

The company, whose name has not been revealed, wants to take advantage of the opening of desalination to private companies. The Egyptian government’s goal is to commission 21 new desalination plants by the end of 2022. Currently, 19 factories with a capacity of 400,000 m3 per day are under construction in the coastal governorates. These facilities will be in addition to the 63 desalination plants located in the governorates of North Sinai, Matrouh, the Red Sea and South Sinai.

Ismail visited the Red Sea town in order to inspect the official response to 48 hours of flooding from heavy rain that destroyed homes, cut roads and power supplies, killing and injuring dozens.

The government has ordered emergency funds to restore services and repair damaged infrastructure, as well as compentation for the families of those killed and injured.

However, Ismail's visit to Ras Gharib lasted only 25 minutes, with several relatives stopping his motorcade and preventing him from entering the downtown area.

Dozens of residents cut the coastal road leading to Cairo, chanting slogans against the prime minister, complaining about water and electricity cuts resulting from the floods.

Ismail tried to calm citizens and promised to meet all their demands.

He said that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had informed him by telephone that LE50 million would be allocated for compensating those affected by the floods, in addition to another LE50 million to repair damaged infrastructure.

According to the Health Ministry, 27 people have so far been confirmed dead across four governorates, although the number may rise as more bodies turn up.

The death toll in Ras Gharib rose to 11 after residents found a dead man 20 kilometers south of the city.

A committee from the Ministry of Solidarity carried out an inventory of the losses prior to compensating those affected in Ras Gharib.

Each of the families of those killed will be granted LE10,000, with the familes of those injured getting LE2,000 to each.

These dual threats now jeopardize the future of a river that is the lifeblood for millions.

Though politicians and the press tend to downplay the idea, environmental degradation is often an underlying cause of international crises — from the deforestation, erosion, and reduced agricultural production that set the stage for the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s to the prolonged drought that pushed rural populations into the cities at the start of the current Syrian civil war. Egypt could become the latest example, its 95 million people the likely victims of a slow motion catastrophe brought on by grand-scale environmental mismanagement. It’s happening now in the Nile River delta, a low-lying region fanning out from Cairo roughly a hundred miles to the sea. About 45 or 50 million people live in the delta, which represents just 2.5 percent of Egypt’s land area. The rest live in the Nile River valley itself, a ribbon of green winding through hundreds of miles of desert sand, representing another 1 percent of the nation’s total land area. Though the delta and the river together were long the source of Egypt’s wealth and greatness, they now face relentless assault from both land and sea. The latest threat is a massive dam scheduled to be completed this year on the headwaters of the Blue Nile, which supplies 59 percent of Egypt’s water. Ethiopia’s national government has largely self-financed the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), with the promise that it will generate 6,000 megawatts of power. That’s a big deal for Ethiopians, three-quarters of whom now lack access to electricity. The sale of excess electricity to other countries in the region could also bring in $1 billion a year in badly needed foreign exchange revenue. GERD can only begin to meet these promised benefits, however, by holding back river water that would otherwise pass down the Nile to Sudan and then Egypt, and that’s obviously a big deal for both those countries — so much so that, according to Wikileaks, government officials in Cairo at one point talked about aerial bombing or a commando raid to destroy the dam.

The dam will create a reservoir more than twice the size of the Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States. It will ultimately store 74 billion cubic meters of Blue Nile water. (That’s about 64 million acre feet, or the amount of water need to cover 100,000 square miles of land one foot deep.) Filling it could take anywhere from five to 15 years. “During this period of fill,” a new study in the Geological Society of America’s journal GSA Today reports, “the Nile’s fresh water flow to Egypt may be cut by 25 percent, with a loss of a third of the electricity generated by the Aswan High Dam.” That is of course Egypt’s own massive dam on the Nile, completed in 1965, roughly 1,500 miles downstream. The GSA study, led by Smithsonian Institution geologist Jean-Daniel Stanley, says Egypt faces “serious country-wide freshwater and energy shortage by 2025.” Agriculture in the delta, which produces up to 60 percent of Egypt’s food, could also suffer from shortages of irrigation water. The GSA study makes clear, moreover, that the new dam is only one of a series of environmental threats now facing Egypt. Rising sea levels, brought on by climate change, are the most obvious of them. Much of the Nile Delta is only a meter or so above sea level, and a 2014 analysis led by Assuit University geologist Ahmed Sefelnasr predicted that a half-meter rise in sea level would shrink the delta by 19 percent, an area equivalent to all of metropolitan Los Angeles. That was the conservative scenario. If the sea level rises by one meter in this century, as many climate scientists think likely, a third of the delta could disappear under the Mediterranean. That analysis did not consider the likely effects of the significantly greater rise predicted by a 2016 study in Nature.

Egypt is already one of the poorest nations in the world in terms of water availability per capita.

It also ignored the compounding effect of land subsidence in the delta, particularly along the Mediterranean coast. In an interview, the Smithsonian’s Stanley attributed subsidence there to continuing compaction of underlying geological strata and to seismic activity. “The region is considered tectonically stable,” he said. “But it’s not inactive.” Earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater occur about every 23 years there, and “earthquake events of shallow origin and small magnitude” are frequent. The delta is also subsiding (and becoming less fertile) because it is no longer replenished each year by 100 million tons by flood sediments from the Nile. Instead, those sediments now drop out where the Nile enters the reservoir created by the Aswan High Dam. A new delta is now forming there, but underwater. Other studies have attributed increased seismic activity in the region to the weight of the dam and the water stored behind it. In addition to the almost certain loss of land area in the delta, the combination of sea level rise and land subsidence will also increase saltwater intrusion. Egypt is already one of the poorest nations in the world in terms of water availability per capita; it has just 660 cubic meters of freshwater a year for each resident, compared, for instance, to 9,800 cubic meters in the United States. But according to the Sefelnasr study, saltwater intrusion from a one-meter rise in sea level could jeopardize more than a third of the freshwater volume in the delta. “If you talk to farmers in the northern delta,” said Stanley, “they will tell you they have lost production consistently, and that saline wedge is moving toward the middle of the delta. So it doesn’t look like a very happy thing,” especially with Egypt’s population set to double over the next 50 years.

So how should Egypt, with its struggling economy and recent history of political unrest, address what are plainly life-threatening challenges? Despite the loose talk about destroying the Ethiopian dam, war appears highly unlikely. In 2015, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan signed a mutual do-no-harm agreement, and just this past January, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met in Addis Ababa, on apparently cordial terms, with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. But a formal agreement on exactly how to share Nile resources is still lacking. Ethiopia could minimize the immediate downstream damage by lengthening the time it takes to fill the reservoir. But that means delaying the benefits of the dam, which Ethiopia may already have oversold. The river flow will produce the promised 6,000-megawatt output only during peak periods, according to Asfaw Beyene, a mechanical engineering professor at San Diego State University. He notes that the Italian company building the dam also performed the initial feasibility studies, an obvious conflict of interest because of the potential to inflate costs and profits by installing excess capacity. Beyene calculates that even a 2,000-megawatt rating might have been “a little excessive.” Pressure to get a return on its investments could make Ethiopia less likely to delay. Egypt in any case has little ground for negotiating a favorable deal, said Harry Verhoeven, a professor of African politics at Georgetown University. It has always asserted its right to the lion’s share of Nile River water, formalizing that claim in the 1959 Nile Waters Agreements, with little regard to the needs of upstream countries. Hosni Mubarak compounded that slight during his long reign as Egypt’s president, taking other Nile Basin countries for granted and effectively withdrawing from the rest of Africa. “In that sense, it’s hard to feel sorry for Egypt,” said Verhoefen.

Climate change will up Nile flow variability, but to exploit flood periods, more water storage is needed.

Nadine El-Sayed

Nile basin countries need to up their storage capacity to catch up with demand.

© Image Source / Alamy Stock Photo The Nile River’s seven-year cycle of flood and drought has historically been the only way its riparian countries could predict its flow. Science has now evolved enough to help predict variability in the ancient river’s stream. But, the revelations are not all good news.

A new study into the river's flow has been undertaken by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Breene M. Kerr, professor of hydrology and climate, Elfatih Eltahir, professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Mohamed Siam, a postdoctoral associate, have revealed that climate change will mean greater variability in the Nile River flow in the next century compared to the last; with more extreme droughts and heavier floods.

“Until this paper, we didn’t know what will happen to the Nile due to climate change,” Eltahir tells Nature Middle East. “What this paper emphasizes is not whether we are going to have more or less water; but that whatever we get in the future is going to happen with more fluctuations; more years of above-average flood and more […] droughts.”

Over six years the MIT researchers analyzed data and looked at climate models to reach this conclusion.

“Part of our work is based on climate models and part is based on observations to see whether the same trends exist,” explains Siam. “So we did that for the past 140 years looking for a trend similar to the one we will see in the next 100 years.”

There will be, however, an overall average increase of the Nile’s annual flow from the current 80 cubic kilometers per year to around 92 cubic kilometers — about 10 to 15 percent increase over the last century. It’s equivalent to the amount of water that evaporates from Lake Nasser, “which is significant,” according to Eltahir.

The countries benefiting most from this increase, Siam explains, are the eastern Nile basin countries; mainly Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan.

The study, published in Nature Climate Change, is based on the observed effect of El Niño/La Niña cycles in the Pacific Ocean, which have become more intense and more frequent as a result of global warming. Previous research Eltahir had conducted found that this phenomenon is strongly related to the annual rainfall variations in the Ethiopian highlands and adjacent eastern Nile basins; an area representing 80 percent of the river’s waters.

The researchers say that the findings of their study can help governments and scientists plan for short-term water resource management.

Siam and Eltahir, however, also insist that if Nile basin countries wish to make use of this average increase to ease the hardships of the predicted extreme drought years, they will need more reservoirs and storage capacity.

Generally, an increase in water supplies is positive, says Siam. “But if we can’t manage this increase, then we won’t make use of it.”

In light of the new information, Nile basin countries would need around 55% additional storage capacity to maintain existing levels of reliability. “I am not arguing that people should go and build dams,” says Eltahir. “The reality is that we are going to have more variability and a little more water, the only feasible thing to do is to have additional storage.”

Besides climate change, the Nile basin countries face another problem: a population boom. “The population increases and we divide the same amount of water on them, which means that each individual’s portion decreases,” says Siam. “So yes, we will have more water, but the population growth is far higher.”

Siam argues that controlling population is key, but the ultimate goal should be better integration between Nile basin countries when it comes to water management. “Ethiopia has water, Sudan has land, Egypt imports a big portion of its food and has the technology of agriculture,” Siam says. They should work together, says the scientist.","Mon, 15 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/figures/1600/Nile River MAIN.jpg,"['water', 'change', 'droughts', 'river', 'rains', 'eltahir', 'flow', 'basin', 'climate', 'heavy', 'extreme', 'siam', 'countries', 'increase', 'nile']", ,flood
80,80,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Find out how Abu Quir used social capital to reduce flood effects - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/55159/Find-out-how-Abu-Quir-used-social-capital-to-reduce,"Frequency of natural hazard (L) and mortality caused by natural disaster (R) in Egypt as a percentage - Egypt Today

CAIRO – 2 August 2018: Natural disasters are no longer seen as extreme events caused entirely by hazards; instead, they are understood as results of a combination of hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and steps taken to deal with extreme events, according to a 2016 published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and a 2004 report published by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).Consequently, disaster risk reduction (DRR) frameworks, like the Hyogo Framework and the Sendai Framework, have repeatedly emphasised the importance of reducing vulnerability and increasing coping capacities prior to the occurrence of extreme events, suggesting that better cooperation between society members, different societies, and formal institutions would result in better DRR, affirms two studies by the UNISDR in 2005 and 2015. Consequently, recent research has examined the link between social capital and DRR, concluding that social capital contributes positively towards reducing disaster risk.The central idea of social capital is that relationships and social networks are a valuable asset, a resource, from which one draws power, according to multiple researchers. The central idea of social capital is that relationships and social networks are a valuable asset, a resource, from which one draws power. An individual, according to the social capital theory, is defined, at least partially, by whom they know and the extent to which they know them.Social capital is often categorised into bonding, bridging, and linking ties. Bonding social capital refers to horizontal, egalitarian networks built around shared identities, like gender, ethnicity, geography, language, or religion. It is often inward-looking and exclusive, or even discriminatory against those who lie outside the mainstream identities, according to a 2016 report by the UNDP. A high level of bonding social capital means that societies can identify those who are most vulnerable amongst them, which would be useful to DRR initiatives.Bridging social capital is also horizontal, and is accumulated through exchange relationships based on common interests, like political affiliations or social gatherings, as per a 2016 report by the UNDP. Despite being weaker than bonding networks, bridging networks often allow societies to move forward and develop, making it of key importance in preparing for natural hazards.Linking social capital refers to vertical ties between community members and leaders or state institutions, according to a 2016 report published by the 2016. Linking is important as it allows effective coordination between people and government agencies in preparation for natural hazards.In short, bonding, bridging, and linking ties all have their own role in maintaining a prosperous and solidary society, as well as their different contributions to DRR strategies.The second concept, DRR, is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and reducing disaster risk through several socio- economic actions, the UNISDR decided in 2009. DRR initiatives require holistic frameworks that are often not confined to moments in time. The most significant framework to date has been the Hyogo Framework—UNISDR, 2005—which set out many key actions grouped under five priorities: two of which represented a ground-breaking development from the 1994 Yokohama Strategy. The Yokohama Strategy, whilst being an important document, neglected the role of the community and the link between societies and government institutions or NGOs—UNISDR, 1994.To fill this gap, the Hyogo Framework stressed the importance of knowledge, innovation, and education at a local level, arguing that a society is better equipped to reduce its own vulnerabilities than anyone else. It suggested that societies could, at least to an extent, reduce their disaster risk on their own. Moreover, it pioneered the idea that disasters are not simply caused by extreme events but rather by a combination of factors, including hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and capacity to adapt.Like the Hyogo Framework, the Sendai Framework echoes the idea of a multi-hazard approach—UNISDR, 2015. The Sendai Framework acknowledged the success of the Hyogo Framework but suggested that more emphasis should be placed on studying context- relevant, people-centric DRR approaches, implying that social capital and social networks have much to offer in this field. This is further illustrated in the Sendai Framework’s prioritization of the promotion of cooperation between community members; between different communities; and between society and diverse institutions, authorities, and stakeholders.In other terms, it emphasises the accumulation of different levels of social capital. This emphasis is especially important for this study as it validates the study’s purpose and suggests that it is aligned with the core priorities of the UNISDR, which according to its mandate is the agency responsible for the coordination of disaster reduction, according to the United Nations General Assembly in 2002.Social capital allows communities to stand together and act collectively to reduce disaster risk and vulnerability as a direct result of its main characteristics: trust, reciprocity, shared norms and beliefs, information sharing, civic engagement and participation, according to the UNDP. Moreover, researchers argue that high social capital allows for the mobilisation of invisible resources, such as skills and knowledge held by society members, which encourages and generates new ideas, often leading societies to be less vulnerable in the face of natural hazards.The positive correlation between high levels of social capital and effective DRR also seems to be rooted in the collective nature of DRR initiatives. When social capital is high, society members are willing to work together and invest time and money to develop the community and reduce vulnerability, even if they are not vulnerable. Moreover, social capital can substitute for the typically weak formal infrastructure and support systems in developing countries.Nevertheless, social capital is not without its pitfalls. In fact, some argue that social capital should be contested and then rejected, arguing that it is merely a ‘buzzword’ that academics and practitioners use to get funding. This is somewhat ironic as most of Fine’s work revolves around social capital. Moreover, social networks have the potential to be ‘violent, repressive, bigoted, or otherwise destructive’. Those ostracised by society face increased vulnerability because of the decreased vulnerability of the ‘others’, concluding that social capital has more negative consequences than positive ones. It seems, therefore, that social capital is not apolitical, rather it goes up and down with the political wheel, concluding that those who benefit from the political system will often be the same people who reap the benefits of social capital, leaving the opposition or others behind.Additionally, bonding social capital may create strong local cohesion but lead to disenfranchisement from the societal level. Daniel P. Aldrich, the amous social capital theorist, echoes this fear but does not agree with their conclusion, suggesting that in the developmental realm, social capital largely has a positive effect. Furthermore, studies on marginal settlements in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Kenya and Nicaragua, and the US empirically confirm the high relevance of social capital for DRR purposes.Abu Quir is urban, and is situated in Egypt’s second largest city, Alexandria, spanning 230,000 hectares. Abu Quir suffers from rapid urbanisation and lack of proper land planning; however, residents are relatively affluent compared to other Egyptian cities. Abu Quir residents rely primarily on fishing and tourism, as Abu Quir is a summer and winter getaway, according to the World Bank.With Egypt ranked 158th, according to the 2016 World Risk Index, its most frequent and deadly natural hazards that take place within the three countries are floods, according to the OFDA/CRED 2015 publication.As a result, Abu Quir’s population suffers from marine elevation because of being on a narrow and partly raised coastal ridge on the Mediterranean Sea. Coastal erosion, and annual rainfall, coupled with informal areas, deteriorating infrastructure, rapid urbanisation, and a weak drainage system has made the population particularly vulnerable, as per the World Bank.Abu Quir’s social capital is partially based around youth teams and residents’ associations, however, more importantly it is based on the relationships between family elders, neighbours, and kinship, according to AUC researcher Dalia M. Gouda. Social networks are also built around schools or education centres via parents’ committees and in universities, social networks are also built through memberships in sports clubs, which are relatively cheap or government-sponsored in Alexandria and therefore attainable to everyone.Abu Quir’s society has been battling coastal floods and floods caused by a weak and underdeveloped drainage system for decades.Recently, climate change has led to increased flooding, resulting in unprecedented deaths in Abu Quir, according to The National.Initially, this led to families, apartment-block committees, and neighbourhood watch committees to discuss the issue and the failures of the current risk reduction strategies. As people began to talk more about the issue, local media proliferated the subject. Civil leaders then emerged with the aim of fighting vulnerabilities that cause floods, like improper infrastructure. They spoke to, reportedly, tens of committees to collect theories and ideas from the community, and then took the issue to the local authorities, demanding a solution. It is clear that bonding ties allowed the community to put pressure on governments through linking ties, meaning that both were essential for the communities’ success.Abu Quir’s urban community, which had resorted to the local government, enjoyed many positive changes because of mobilising their social capital. First, the local government instructed the establishment of a research team to identify the vulnerabilities, identifying deteriorating infrastructure, underdeveloped drainage system, and inaccurate weather forecasts as the primary three challenges.Second, to address these issues, the research committee established an action branch, which established, monitored, evaluated, and maintained the DRR strategies implemented.Third, the DRR action committee, after consulting scientists at the Alexandria University, rebuilt the deteriorating 16- kilometre seawall and jetties, according to research conducted in 2002.Fourth, the DRR committee instructed builders to dry-proof the most vulnerable houses based on a vulnerability map developed by researchers.Fifth, the DRR committee raised awareness on how households could safeguard in-home electrical systems by ensuring that the wires and electrical equipment are placed high. Furthermore, it advised that outdoor equipment be anchored and/or raised.Sixth, the DRR committee established a route for emergency services, including fire engines, ambulances, army and police vehicles, and trucks with pumps, to take during floods to reach people as quickly as possible. This plan has been practiced multiple times, according to witnesses, and has shown great success during the 2015 flood, explains Khater.Seventh, the Egyptian government has updated and is continuing to upgrade the drainage system in Abu Quir.Eighth, newspapers and television channels have been urged to update their weather forecast equipment to allow for more accurate forecasts, as the recent vulnerabilities in the face of the 2015 flood in Abu Quir were partially because of inaccurate weather forecasts.","Thu, 02 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/50813.jpg,"['natural', 'society', 'vulnerability', 'disaster', 'framework', 'social', 'capital', 'according', 'used', 'reduce', 'flood', 'effects', 'networks', 'quir', 'drr', 'abu']", ,none
81,81,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How climate change might affect the Nile - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/08/03/how-climate-change-might-affect-the-nile,"TO THE untrained eye, the satellite photos of north-west Ethiopia on July 10th may have seemed benign. They showed a relatively small pool of water next to an enormous building site on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile river. But the project under construction is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is more than halfway complete. And the water is why it is so controversial. Since Ethiopia announced its plan to build the dam, it has inspired threats of sabotage from Egypt, which sits downstream and relies on the Nile for electricity, farming and drinking water. Egypt claims that it is entitled to a certain proportion of the Nile’s water based on colonial-era treaties. Ethiopia dismisses those agreements. The pool of water in the photos suggested that it was beginning to fill the reservoir behind the dam, reducing the river’s flow.

That turns out not to have been the case. The pool was deemed by Egypt to be a result of construction and seasonal Nile flooding. But the alarms it raised are indicative of how sensitive negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have become. Talks over such things as how fast to fill the reservoir and how to operate the dam have stumbled. And a potentially huge complication looms over any discussion of the Nile’s future: climate change.

By 2050 around a billion people will live in the countries through which the Nile and its tributaries flow. That alone will put enormous stress on the water supply. But according to a study by Mohamed Siam and Elfatih Eltahir of MIT, potential changes to the river’s flow, resulting from climate change, may add to the strain. Messrs Siam and Eltahir conclude that on current trends the annual flow could increase, on average, by up to 15%. That may seem like a good thing, but it could also grow more variable, by 50%. In other words, there would be more (and worse) floods and droughts.

There is, of course, uncertainty in the projections, not least because differing global climate models give different numbers. But the idea that the flow of the Nile is likely to become more variable is lent credibility, the authors argue, by the fact that trends over decades seem to agree with them, and by consideration of the effects of El Niños. These colossal climatic oscillations, driven by changes in the temperature of the Pacific, are correlated with the Nile’s flow, and climate-change studies suggesting more extreme El Niños in years to come thus bolster the idea of a more variable Nile.

More storage capacity will be needed to smooth out the Nile’s flow. But unlike Egypt’s large Aswan Dam, which was built with storage in mind, the new Ethiopian one is designed for electricity production. Once water starts gushing through its turbines, it is expected to produce over 6,000 megawatts of power. It is unclear, though, if the structure has the necessary flexibility to meet downstream demands in periods of prolonged drought.

The talks between the three countries seem to be glossing over the potential effects of climate change. The filling of the reservoir is being negotiated in terms of years, but nature may not co-operate with their timeline. The countries would be better off focusing on how much water is needed downstream, which will vary in wet and dry years, say experts. Similar considerations will need be taken into account when running the dam. “Nowhere in the world are two such large dams on the same river operated without close co-ordination,” says another study from MIT. But so far co-operation is in short supply. The latest round of talks has been postponed. Even the methodology of impact studies is cause for wrangling.

Once the dam is up and running, the Nile’s variability will be controllable for some 60 years, say Messrs Siam and Eltahir. That assumes the dam is flexible enough and that the countries work together. Even then, storage would have to be increased by about 45% to keep things steady for the next 60 years. So the countries have time to build new dams; but that will need even greater co-operation.","Thu, 03 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['egypt', 'water', 'change', 'affect', 'niles', 'climate', 'variable', 'flow', 'ethiopia', 'countries', 'dam', 'nile']", ,flood

Parliament's Undersecretary Soliman Wahdan affirmed that the government should be ready for winter, pointing out that the Ministry of Irrigation has a plan to collect flood waters in certain places so as not to affect the citizens.



Special standards should be set to complete paving roads and streets in a declined way to help in the collection of rain directly to sewage ditches or on the sides of the road, Wahdan said.



He also called for full coordination between the operating rooms in different provinces and the Egyptian Meteorological Authority to take the necessary measures concerning rainfall and prepare systematically to prevent probable negative impact on citizens.







MP Mohamed Abo Hamed warned against the repetition of the Fifth Settlement's 2017 disaster, affirming the necessity of taking arrangements in the cities where floods are expected.



There is a number of corridors or storm drains that may be blocked or not working, Abo Hamed said, adding that they should be checked and fixed. He pointing out that the government has supposedly checked the places where floods usually occur.



In April, videos and photos showing water levels in the streets of the Fifth Settlement and El-Shorouk city rising over one meter went viral; the vehicles were submerged in the flooded districts.



Even though the Egyptian Meteorological Authority warned of unstable weather before the disaster, officials failed to take sensible precautionary measures or provide assistance after torrential rain hit several parts of Cairo and Giza.



Rainfall throughout the capital caused some buildings, houses and bridges to collapse; some governorates such as Suez, Ain Sokhna and Ismailia were also affected. The residents of New Cairo seemingly got the lion’s share of the damage.







For his part, MP Hassan al-Sayed, called on the prime minister and the minister of irrigation to remove the buildings illegally constructed on storm drains in various provinces.



He added that procedures should be taken to protect certain areas from floods, including border governorates such as the Red Sea, and North and South Sinai, pointing out that the government must coordinate with the governors in this regard before the start of winter.



The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation has worked on finishing the preparations for winter rains and downpours by carrying out a plan to check the pumping stations, clear canals, water banks and storm drains.



Mohamed Abdel Aati, an official in the ministry, said in October that the preparation plan included maintenance of all pumping stations nationwide to be ready for sudden rains.

The ministry installed more than 25 emergency units in West Delta near the critical areas to avoid the recurrence of the 2015 floods.



Khaled Madin, head of the ministry's Irrigation Department, said that flood protection projects have been executed, in addition to the projects that have already been accomplished, including 119 dams, about 16 man-made lakes, about 500 underground rainwater tanks, and five channels.



For her part, Nadia Abdel Hamid, a ministry's official, said that a series of flood control projects have been accomplished. The projects included the establishment of numerous man-made lakes, and dams.



In September, Agriculture Minister Ezzedin Abu Stait urged all bodies concerned to take the necessary measures to face possible floods with the beginning of the winter season.

83,83,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Egypt's Economy Isn't Tanking. It's Thriving. - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/26/egypts-economy-isnt-tanking-its-thriving-sisi-muslim-brotherhood-imf/,"Egypt’s Economy Isn’t Tanking. It’s Thriving.

Yehia Hamed’s article for Foreign Policy earlier this month wrongly casts a bleak outlook on Egypt’s economy. Hamed, who served as investment minister in Mohamed Morsi’s ousted government, which led Egypt between 2012 and 2013, implicitly suggests that international investors must be clueless—having poured billions of dollars into the country’s equity and fixed-income markets—and that the government is mismanaging the economy despite lowering Egypt’s international risk, as measured by credit default swaps, to almost half the risk premium as when he was removed from his position as investment minister.

The article, which includes a somewhat reasonable criticism of Egypt’s high debt levels and its rise in poverty levels after the economic reforms of 2016, goes on to paint an unrealistic and unfair view of the country’s economic challenges. It was equally surprising to me, as an Egyptian living and raising my children here, to hear that Egypt was about to collapse. Hamed theatrically warns that Egypt is overstating its income by excessive borrowing and cries wolf that the international community may soon face an imminent flood of Egyptian immigrants at the shores of Europe.

Ironically, Hamed warns readers about the rising deficit, which is now at least 300 basis points lower than when he was a minister (calculating deficit as a percentage of GDP), while blaming the current government for using strong fiscal policies to control it. Although I am not a fan of extreme fiscal tightness in a country such as Egypt, where domestic demand comprises the lion’s share of GDP, Hamed uses a questionable methodology to support his thesis.

Government intervention and interest-rate policy do not mix. There are many serious issues for which Egyptians can blame the government, but it is folly to blame the government for the temporary high interest costs, as interest rates remain the mandate of central banks everywhere, and it is particularly harsh to apportion blame to a government that has fully delivered on its fiscal targets.

Criticizing austerity measures, in a country that suffers from structural fiscal imbalances, and blaming policies instituted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the rise in poverty levels among Egyptians would have been very understandable had it come from Egypt’s left, which has genuinely stood against the measures the government has taken since 2016 to fix public finances. In fact, the IMF’s international reform programs have seen many failures, and its policies have never guaranteed success.

But it is a surprising critique coming from a member of the right-wing Muslim Brotherhood, which has long promoted itself to the West as a strong advocate of free market and investor-friendly policies. Hamed was a minister in an ousted economic cabinet that ironically enough approached the IMF in 2012 and was very close to inking a deal with its representatives in response to what was at the time a bleak economic situation: a severe foreign currency shortage, a mammoth black market, shortages in energy supplies and basic products, painful capital flight, and an investment slump that led to anemic growth, stagflation, and a rise in unemployment.

The period from 2012 to 2013 could indeed be labeled Egypt’s worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Unless Hamed can publicly claim that the IMF had proposed to the Brotherhood’s government a different program than the IMF’s classic historical combo of fiscal discipline and monetary tightness—or that his government was ready to reduce the massive twin deficits without raising tax revenues, rationalizing subsidies, and floating the currency—his article will remain nothing more than a polite attempt at political positioning that seeks to muddy the waters of the current government’s financial successes, rather than a serious analysis of Egypt’s financial and economic conditions.

Hamed’s article is a polite attempt at political positioning that seeks to muddy the waters of the current government’s financial successes, rather than offer a serious analysis of Egypt’s financial and economic conditions.Egypt’s economy is only collapsing if the definition of an economic collapse is when a country has managed to cut its current account deficit from more than 5 percent of GDP to less than 2.5 percent—from sustainable income sources (excluding grants)—and nearly halved its budget deficit from 16.5 percent in 2013 to 8.5 percent of GDP in five years, while growing by 5.5 percent (up from the anemic 2.2 percent growth in 2013), according to IMF and Ministry of Finance data. By every definition of the phrase, this is a strong economic recovery.

Egypt has indeed accumulated external debt in the past couple of years, and its public debt has increased, but this is only one side of the story. But before coming to the startling conclusion that the economy is collapsing, one must first compare the growth in debt to that of GDP, analyze the balance of payments’ fundamentals and sustainable sources of foreign currencies, and examine the cost of servicing the external debt.

The answer to these questions would take only a few minutes to obtain by comparing domestic and external debt levels to GDP in both emerging and developed markets. In fact, according to World Bank and CEIC data, Egypt’s external debt at approximately 32 percent of GDP is well below the emerging markets average of 42 percent and much more favorable than most of its emerging peers, such as Turkey (58 percent), Malaysia (63 percent), Chile (62 percent), South Africa (48 percent), Morocco (44 percent), Vietnam (43 percent), and Mexico (36 percent).

Apart from the macroeconomic ratios, the structure of Egypt’s external debt is key. Of the country’s external debt of about $100 billion, more than 60 percent of this is from international institutions (such as the IMF and World Bank) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) allies at a subsidized cost, averaging less than half of what Egypt pays today for its Eurobonds. Egypt’s foreign debt service obligations in the next two years, which include interest and principal repayments, currently stand at $15 billion, according the Central Bank of Egypt (excluding the GCC deposits that were rolled over recently)—almost 70 percent of the net portfolio inflows that Egypt has managed to attract into its capital markets since the start of the economic reform program.

Even assuming Hamed’s extremely pessimistic scenario—that Egypt will fail to reschedule any of its outstanding foreign currency debt, will not improve its balance of payments any further, and will be unable to attract even $1 of foreign direct investment—the total external funding gap (defined as the foreign debt obligations plus the current account deficit) would still not exceed $25 billion in the next 24 months, which amounts to just 55 percent of the country’s current foreign reserves. No international investor in his or her right mind would call this a default scenario.

The economy in Egypt is by no means perfect, but the country has delivered on the financial and monetary side of its reform program, with the exception of the still very high interest rates that are a real burden. There remains a long way to go to fix the structural imbalances in the economy. The informal sector remains large enough to weigh on overall economic efficiency; capital accumulation remains below target; the domestic savings rate is very low, even after the consumption shock the economic rebalancing process has triggered, as disposable income for Egyptians has been hit by inflation and the government’s fiscal controls; and foreign investors remain challenged by global emerging-market risks, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and poor domestic institutional capacity.

Egypt’s middle- and lower-income citizens have borne the brunt of the reforms and are yet to reap the benefits in terms of more jobs, recovery in real income, and overall state services. Egyptians need to see inclusive growth strategies and a stronger safety net, despite the various initiatives and social programs the government has so far implemented. Most importantly, Egypt needs a vibrant, dynamic, and healthy private sector to lead growth and employment. Egypt’s private sector suffers from crowding out by the state, higher input costs, and, hence, a lower return on capital in its traditional industries.

Egypt still needs to unleash the potential of its private sector, which could turbocharge the country’s economic growth potential, by further supporting small businesses and investing heavily in innovation, financial inclusion, and vocational training to foster growth and sustainable development. Even so, if you compare Egypt’s economic challenges today to those of five years ago and reflect on other emerging markets’ structural economic and financial challenges, it is clear that Egypt is far more likely to boom than bust.

84,84,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Here We Go Again: Houston, Flooding, and the Five Stages of Grief - Texas Monthly",https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/houston-flooding-five-stages-of-grief/,"In recent years, whenever Houston floods, I think of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the famous Swiss psychiatrist who outlined the five stages of grief experienced by the dying: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. That may sound a little grim to you, but when you are focused on climate change and its attendant extreme weather events, a certain amount of grimness is allowed, given the state of denial that we live in, literally and psychically. This notion struck me again yesterday, when the rain from Imelda—what may be a thousand-year flood for some parts of Southeast Texas—came pelting down on us here in Houston, bringing the city once again to a standstill. Just like during Tropical Storm Allison (2001), Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005), Hurricane Ike (2008), the Memorial Day Flood (2015), the Tax Day Flood (2016), and, of course, Hurricane Harvey in 2017. That’s not to mention all the severe unnamed storms that also wreaked havoc on Houston in between. What struck me most of all yesterday is how we—okay, I—have fallen into a predictable pattern as I’ve adapted to the increasingly extreme weather here.

Denial is the stage most Houstonians, including me, live with most days, but particularly days when the weather turns bad. (This kind of denial led my husband John and me to try to make it home from the grocery store during the Memorial Day Flood. We ended up sleeping in the parking garage of the movie theater where we parked and saw Mad Max: Fury Road, blithely failing to draw any irony from our situation.) In fact, I had just been complaining to John about the lack of rain and its effect on a relatively young and struggling magnolia tree in our backyard. In a recent adaptation, I now have two weather apps on my phone—a friend just recommended Dark Sky in the conspiratorial tones of someone telling me about a great sale at Neiman Marcus, but I was way ahead of her. Still, I hadn’t been checking my apps until the rain actually started to fall. Then I looked at Dark Sky and saw a pattern of undulating blue waves stretching forward into the next 24 hours.

Kübler-Ross has written that the five stages do not always come in order, so I would say I skipped over Anger and moved on to Bargaining. As the sky turned black and school and business closings started turning up on my email—no yoga for the perpetually rattled today!—the mayor and the county judge Lina Hidalgo (Hidalgo in English and Spanish) started telling people to shelter in place. But I couldn’t: I was supposed to talk to a group of about fifty people across town at lunchtime. I checked my Nextdoor site—as usual, my neighbors had started posting which streets were flooding and which were still passable. I could probably make it to I-10, and then maybe still have time to make the meeting. So now I was faced with a genuine issue of mortality: Should I cancel and risk disappointing a group of people waiting on me or get in the car and risk my life? What would be the most fair?

I used to scoff at friends who cancelled dinners when the rain started falling, but ever since my husband lost his Acura after trying to get through a flooded underpass, I have dropped the phrase “It’s only a little rain” from my lexicon. Finally, after several emails, my host graciously let me off the hook: “Flash flood here but ok,” she emailed. “If you want to cancel we can entertain ourselves. Don’t want you hurt.”

The Anger came when, after being cooped up in the house all morning and into the afternoon, John and I decided to make a break for a late lunch to a place no more than two miles away that would not require traveling through any streets that usually flooded. (We checked the best route on Waze, another weather-induced habit.) We got there fine—“Ummm, why are you in your car?” a friend texted—but it took us 45 minutes to get home because the freeway was underwater and all the cars were diverting to the surface streets in our neighborhood.

I know I’m not alone in feeling the gods—or, more accurately, our ceaseless carbon emissions—are punishing us a bit too much. Alejandro De Almaida, a Houston father quoted in the Chronicle, summed up the feeling in the city this way: “We shouldn’t be used to this. Harvey was the 500-year flood, so we weren’t expecting this after two years.”

And then there was Acceptance. This came when the rain stopped around 6 p.m., and John and I fell into the now time-honored ritual of walking the dogs to our nearby bayou to survey the damage. This post-storm period is my neighborhood’s version of a hurricane party: we ooh and ahh over how high the water is—since our bayou is lined with concrete, it always looks so much prettier when it’s full of water. We watch cars drive into flooded intersections. We reminisce about previous storms and worry that the gas pumps half under water at the nearby convenience store may be rendered useless. “It’s good to see you,” we say cheerfully to the people we only see once in a while, usually after a heavy rain.

The most novel post-storm event this time around was the appearance of an enormous city of Houston military-style truck that would be better served saving people in Syria. It was clear that Mayor Turner was speaking the truth when he said that we had many more trucks to pull people out of the water. Thank you, Hurricane Harvey.

Depression had been creeping in and out of my consciousness all day. First it crept in while I watched the local weather, which always has a hypnotic effect. There’s now a soporific sameness to it all. With more frequent storms, it’s déjà vu all over again: Again, the underpasses with only the tops of cars, trucks, or buses visible. People wading in water up to their knees, thighs, or waists, some wearing good-natured smiles, others wearing the harried been-there-done-that expressions. I got a message on Facebook, inviting me to join the Tropical Storm Imelda Flooding Group. Matt Lanza, a meteorologist with Space City Weather who, along with Eric Berger, has been doing essential work keeping Greater Houston informed on our extreme weather events, captured the feeling in a Twitter thread on Thursday night:

Processing this whole event and a few thoughts in the immediate aftermath. I feel soul-crushed. For us in Houston (and the Golden Triangle), the last 4-5 years have been a never ending hell for so many people. It's cruel. It's depressing. It's weather, and sometimes it sucks. — Matt Lanza (@mattlanza) September 20, 2019

But by this morning, the freeways were bustling, and the sun was peeking tentatively from behind the clouds. Denial? All I can say is it ain’t no river in Egypt.","Fri, 20 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.texasmonthly.com/2019/09/mimi-on-houston-flooding.jpg?auto=compress&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&h=750&ixlib=php-1.2.1&q=45&w=1200&wpsize=landscape-1200,"['stages', 'water', 'started', 'houston', 'grief', 'day', 'weather', 'denial', 'rain', 'flood', 'john', 'hurricane', 'flooding']", ,flood

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amy E. Robertson for NPR Amy E. Robertson for NPR

Koshary is to Egyptian cuisine as the pyramids are to its culture. Emblematic. Iconic. Beloved.

Also spelled koshari or kushari (those pesky transliterations from Arabic script!), it is widely considered Egypt's national dish. Rice, lentils (black or brown), chickpeas and pasta are cooked individually, then tossed together and topped with cumin-scented tomato sauce and crunchy fried onions. Things get kicked up a notch with condiments of garlicky vinegar and a peppery hot sauce called shatta. Heavily laden with carbs and calories, a plate of koshary fills up even the hungriest of stomachs for just a few Egyptian pounds.

Notwithstanding its enormous popularity, koshary is a relatively recent invention of this ancient civilization.

""I had never eaten or known of koshary in Egypt before 1952, when I went to school in Paris,"" says Claudia Roden, an award-winning cookbook author and food historian who was born and raised in Cairo. ""No one ever mentioned the recipe when I was researching my first book almost sixty years ago. Other people, who like me left Egypt in the fifties, have also told me that they did not remember it. Of course, it might have been sold in some quarter of Cairo that that I never went to.""

Its cousin, mujaddara, made of rice, lentils and fried onions, has long roots in Arab culture, and Roden guesses that koshary evolved from that culinary classic. She adds, ""It's possible that the addition of short macaroni is an Italian influence.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amy E. Robertson for NPR Amy E. Robertson for NPR

Pasta is called maacarona in Egyptian Arabic, which at first glance lends credence to the theory that the Italians brought their macaroni to the dish. ""On the other hand,"" Roden points out, ""pasta is an Arab thing mentioned in medieval culinary manuscripts.""

It may be a question of the chicken and the egg.

While no one can say for sure where koshary came from, everyone has an opinion on where to eat it. For Ahmed Hameed, it's at his mom's. But as a private tour guide in Cairo, he has found that the famed Koshary Abou Tarek restaurant makes a fine substitute.

""Koshary is a hard meal to cook as it consists of several elements, each of which should prepared separately,"" says Hameed. ""It's one of the most traditional meals in Egypt, and food in general is an experience that you shouldn't miss while traveling. The recipe is a secret formula that can be different from one restaurant to another. Abou Tarek has his own recipe.""

From the locals thronging the restaurant for both sit-down and take-away, it's clear that Hameed is not the only one who favors Abou Tarek's. Cook staff are lined up behind a long counter, dishing up plates and take-away packages at a breakneck pace. What started as a food cart in 1950 is now a bustling, four-story restaurant. Foreigners are led to the top floor, where English-speaking waiters are on staff and an oversized portrait of Abou Tarek smiles down on customers. Portions are generous, and prices range from about 50 cents for a small bowl to a dollar and change for a large. Tucked away on a narrow side street just a couple of blocks from the Egyptian Museum, Koshary Abou Tarek is a convenient pit stop during a day of sight-seeing.

Ali Zayed, an Egyptian living and working in Lebanon since 2003, makes sure to tell his Lebanese friends to try koshary when they travel to Egypt. ""I miss koshary when I am in Lebanon,"" he says. ""I eat it two or three times a month when I visit Egypt."" But while ""mama"" makes a tasty koshary, Zayed confesses that he prefers to eat it out. ""I like to eat it outside the home and when I'm alone, because I put too much hot sauce and...."" Zayed puffs out his cheeks and fans his face to demonstrate the perils of adding a lot of spice. He adds, ""If I am going to be out all day, koshary is the No. 1 food I want to eat.""

Not every koshary joint is as elaborate as Abou Tarek's. Many are hole-in-the-wall eateries and others are simple food carts. Guys on bicycles deliver individual portions of it around town, even famously pulling up in Tahrir Square in 2012 to feed hungry protesters.

""I was surprised to find it everywhere when I went back after 32 years,"" Roden says. ""I love it and make it myself. When I visit now I always eat it.""","Wed, 22 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/02/01/koshary-1_wide-45769d7d0718d810bebc21c9b077029ca0efa8b4.jpg?s=1400,"['food', 'egyptian', 'egypt', 'koshary', 'tarek', 'roden', 'cuisine', 'eat', 'beloved', 'abou', 'robertson', 'mystery', 'modern', 'egypts', 'amy', 'ancient']", ,none

Unprecedented heavy flooding in South Sudan’s Maban County has affected nearly 200,000 people, including refugees and host population.

Situated in the Upper Nile State, the affected area is home to more than 150,000 refugees from Sudan.

South Sudan is on a gradual path to recovery from six years of civil war and now faces flooding that the region has not witnessed in almost four decades.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, working with its partners and the local authorities is rushing emergency support. People are seeking safety from the flood waters wherever they find dry land, mostly on small islands as unprecedented water levels have submerged vast areas.

The area, near Maban’s capital town of Bunj, is prone to flooding this time of year because of heavy seasonal rains. However, flooding rivers in South Sudan come from the highlands in the neighbouring Ethiopia, where rainfall is becoming more intense and irregular, is also carving its way through neighborhoods in broad, swift rivers.

The most recent precipitation data for west Ethiopia shows above average rainfall over the past 90 days, increasing markedly since late September. The data indicates that over the last 30 days, over 230 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall has fallen there, with an estimated 425 mm falling compared with the average just less than 200 mm. This is more than double the average rainfall in the past four weeks.

The affected population is in dire need of humanitarian assistance. People have fled their homes, carrying their belongings and seen gathering together on little islands of dry ground. Flood waters have submerged major roads, making access to the refugee camps difficult for humanitarians. Schools in the region also remain closed.

The floods have also impacted access to public services, including hospitals and damaged sanitation facilities– increasing health risks. We remain concerned that the flooding may increase the risks and spread of diseases. South Sudan was recently declared cholera free last year with the fears that the deadly disease could make a comeback.

Emergency shelter, food, water and sanitation remain the main needs for refugees and locals. As an immediate response, UNHCR has pre-positioned emergency shelter kits and material assistance to help more than 5,000 affected families/some 25,000 people to rebuild and repair damaged shelter, but more support is needed.

Currently, South Sudan hosts almost 300,000 refugees mainly from Sudan’s Blue Nile and South Kordofan. An additional nearly 1.5 million are internally displaced inside the country.

87,87,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Residents of flood-ravaged Wharton County feel forgotten in Harvey's wake - Houston Chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Residents-of-flood-ravaged-Wharton-County-feel-12199385.php,"WHARTON - Kenneth Pospisil saw the flood coming in the city of Wharton, while he and his neighbors grilled ribs on their Freedom Road lawn.

Sharon Thyssen noticed it in the town of Glen Flora, where she'd planned to celebrate her 62nd birthday with her husband and friends.

Linda Holmes spotted it in her country home, when she looked out a window and saw her yard shining.

For residents of rural Wharton County, located some 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston, the floodwaters came quickly - in a matter of hours, perhaps faster. They arrived as a wall of water, pushing across fields, over roads and up to doorsteps.

The flooding caused by the Colorado River surging far beyond its banks would cause damage that would leave the area forever changed, even as the nation's eyes remained fixed on the devastation in Houston.

Outside of Wharton, no one seemed to notice the force that residents of this rural community struggled against.

""We feel like we're the forgotten city,"" Wharton City Secretary Paula Favors said.

Four days after Harvey made landfall on Aug. 25, the rising river took thousands by surprise as it swamped neighborhood after neighborhood in a string of towns and into the city of Wharton.

It stayed high for days, flooding more than one in three homes in the county seat. People likened it to a war zone. The floods affected more homes around it.

The county of some 42,000 saw the bulk of the damage in its eastern half, where much was affected, the emergency management coordinator said. A tally of the damage has not yet been completed.

Residents recalled it the same way. Until that moment, they considered themselves safe. Then they had no time to think. Some fled. Some stayed put. Some found themselves forced onto rooftops or into attics.

But they saw water and knew it was time to go - or figure out how to stay and survive.

***

Just as Houston planners knew to watch certain spots after Hurricane Harvey swept through, emergency management officials in outlying counties knew to watch the rivers. They knew how ferocious they could become.

In Fort Bend and Brazoria counties, the Brazos River threatened levee systems. In the Tierra Grande subdivision, the San Bernard River put numerous homes at risk.

Wharton County residents had the Colorado and San Bernard rivers with which to contend. The former had caused issues before, repeatedly flooding the historically black section of the city of Wharton in recent years.

Before Harvey struck, Wharton County Emergency Management Coordinator Andy Kirkland asked around about other past floods. He expected the river this time, as previously, to connect with and fill other waterways around the city. But he didn't predict that it would hit with such force.

""We were not expecting that water to come rolling across the prairie,"" Kirkland said. ""We did not know that it would be of the magnitude that it was.""

The city began with a voluntary evacuation, said Favors, the city secretary. Then the unthinkable happened: Water entered her 1880s-era home in Egypt, a town upriver from Wharton and 11 miles west. Water hadn't gotten into that house since 1913. Favors knew things would be bad.

She was right. By the time the river would crest, the city would be nearly boxed in by water. Emergency Medical Services would be flying people out in helicopters. The EMS director would lose his own home.

Fuel would run low. So would groceries.

The already-saturated ground would have an impact on water rising faster, said Katie Landry-Guyton, senior service hydrologist for the National Weather Service. Rain had fallen constantly, and in great amounts, both locally and upstream.

It would become critical how people communicated, said John Hofmann, executive vice president of water at the Lower Colorado River Authority, which provides a service to help keep people informed.

That became the first challenge. The radio station isn't based in their town. The newspaper prints only a few days a week.

It was hard to believe what was coming.

Aug. 29, 4:37 p.m.

TO GLEN FLORA RESIDENTS: PLEASE LEAVE THE AREA ASAP. FM 102 IS EXPECTED TO BE CLOSED WITHIN THE HOUR.

For 34 years, Sharon and Michael Thyssen had lived in their storybook purple home in Glen Flora. They loved the precious town. Made up of roughly a dozen streets, it was home to artists, the elderly and farmers, they said. Michael, 64, was the town barber.

The Thyssens knew the river was rising. On Tuesday afternoon, they decided to take some documents to a safe place - just in case. They saw the water coming across the corn field in the distance.

Forty-five minutes later, the couple returned, expecting to join neighbors to celebrate Sharon's 62nd birthday. Water now was up to their ankles. There would be no birthday supper.

They fled with water lapping at their shins.

""It was just a shock to everybody,"" Sharon said.

Down the street, Trish Winkles felt like she was living in a nightmare. She had numerous rescue animals that she could not leave.

Winkles herded dogs into crates on the porch. She ushered cats inside. She watched, panicked, as the water began to rush past her house like Niagara Falls.

Her legs would ache for days from the effort of trying to walk through the torrent that defied prediction.

""Everybody was caught off guard,"" said Winkles, 63. ""This was like nothing anybody had ever experienced before.""

Flooding here was wreaking havoc, and still Houston remained the focus of the news, noted her neighbor, Roy Freese, 66.

Along with many other properties, the Thyssens' home flooded. So did the post office and Winkles' antique shop, one of the only businesses still open in town.

Winkles would have trouble calming her mind in the weeks that followed. The tears would keep coming.

""It's never going to be the same now,"" said Freese, who works in real estate.

He stood on the wraparound porch of his home, picturesque except for the step still caked in dirt.

Aug. 29, 10:44 p.m.

URGENT MESSAGE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE ORCHARD OR PEACH CREEK ACRES: If you live in these areas you should be leaving immediately and seeking shelter elsewhere.

Linda Holmes flicked off her TV. The network had changed from constant news to regular programming. ""I guess we're done,"" Holmes recalled thinking.

That's when she saw her lawn shining with water.

Here, in the unincorporated county, Holmes and her husband had retired 10 years prior. It felt like the country. They had a horse.

Holmes woke up her husband. Already, the water seemed too deep to leave safely.

Water seeped through the floors. It didn't stop rising. Finally, Homes concluded, they had to get in the attic.

The 71-year-old turned on all the lights in the house to signal their location. She called her daughter in California. She hung up quickly to conserve power.

Her son-in-law contacted law enforcement. No one could come rescue them until morning. Holmes prayed.

""I thought we were going to drown,"" Holmes said.

Time and again, Holmes climbed down the ladder to look and listen. But a boat didn't arrive until daylight. She is 5-foot-4, and, by then, the water came up to her chin. It would be days before Holmes could return. She watched for any news of her home. But she saw none on TV. It was only ""Houston, Houston, Houston,"" she said.

Water did reach the ceiling. It ruined everything. Her mother's Bible. The ""final furniture,"" as she'd put it, referring to fancy leather sofas they'd recently bought. All her clothes, save the red shirt she had worn since her rescue.

She hadn't died, but in a way it felt like she had.

Community members rallied together.

""That's how we survived,"" she said.

Aug. 30, 3:22 p.m.

We have reports that the water from the Bauman (sic) Slough and Peach Creek is entering the north side of Wharton ... Please be careful and be aware of this situation.

It was early afternoon and Kenneth Pospisil, 54, had just returned from helping to rescue someone. They put some of the evacuated woman's baking supplies in their freezers but had two slabs of ribs that wouldn't fit. So they decided to cook them.

Pospisil had raised a family in this one-story Wharton home with a sweeping lawn. His 29-year-old daughter, Annie Zimmerhanzel, and her husband, Cody, had come over with their 1-year-old and planned to stay for the storm. They expected it to be safer here than in their home a short drive away.

Then they noticed the water coming up the ditch, across the pastures. They grabbed medicine and clothes. In 15 minutes, water rushed over the driveway. They needed to go, even if the ribs weren't done cooking.

""We just left everything,"" Zimmerhanzel said.

At least 2 feet of water would enter the home. It would ruin her wedding dress, her baby books. Their possessions, like those of so many others, would end up in a soggy, stinky pile on the street.

Wharton is a place where relatives live across the street from one another. Some, like Zimmerhanzel, have known their neighbors their whole lives. Much of the city that was affected is low-income or working class.

Officials estimate roughly 1,300 of 3,200 homes in the city of Wharton suffered damage.

Across town, Juan Cantu and his family faced the same decision. They thought the storm was over, that they were safe. And then the road became a river.

""It was just unreal,"" said Cantu, 40. ""You can't believe it.""

They, too, left immediately and returned later to devastation. He still remembers how the family's house smelled when they first got to it, like sewage and crawfish. Now Cantu and his father sleep on mattresses in the gutted residence.

Across the street, a relative, Enedina Castellano, goes to her ruined home each day to wait for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To fix the house, the 76-year-old worries she might need to use money she had set aside for her burial. She sat on a swinging bench in her driveway on Monday when the mail arrived. She checked to see if she'd gotten any bills.

She longed for more help to deal with the devastation.

""It was a lost town,"" she said. ""That's what they say.""","Fri, 15 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/65/65/23/14111943/3/rawImage.jpg,"['county', 'forgotten', 'water', 'wharton', 'river', 'residents', 'town', 'saw', 'houston', 'knew', 'harveys', 'floodravaged', 'feel', 'city', 'holmes', 'wake']", ,flood
88,88,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Is War About to Break Out in the Horn of Africa? Will the West Even Notice? - Council on Foreign Relations,https://www.cfr.org/blog/war-about-break-out-horn-africa-will-west-even-notice,"This article was originally published here on Salon.com on Tuesday, January 16, 2018.

Around the time I was a Washington intern in the spring of 1989, I began hearing that the “next war in the Middle East will be over water.” These warnings continued fairly regularly throughout my years in graduate school and the early part of my professional career, but because there were thirteen wars (not including various skirmishes) in the region in the intervening decades that had nothing to do with water scarcity, it became easy to dismiss the “water war” reports and op-eds that came across my desk.

I have not heard much about the issue recently, with the exception of the hypothesis that drought in southern Syria was a contributing factor to the uprising-turned-civil-war that began there in March 2011. Now an actual conflict over H2O may be boiling, but no one in Washington has put down Michael Wolff’s book long enough to notice. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia may come to blows—with the help of Turkey, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates—over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project.

The World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers. Every Friday. View all newsletters >

This is a conflict that, if it actually comes to violence, is one that has long been in the making. In 1929, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty gave Egypt the lion’s share of Nile River water—about 50 billion cubic meters, whereas Sudan was allowed just 4 billion. The Egyptians were also granted the right to reject upstream construction projects. Postcolonial Egypt and an independent Sudan signed a new agreement in 1959 that increased both parties’ share of the river’s flow but maintained Egypt’s overwhelming benefits. Other riparian states such as what is now Eritrea, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and South Sudan had no say, either because they didn't yet exist or were not independent nations.

Over the years the Egyptians haven’t been terribly interested in altering the terms of the 1950s-era agreement for one simple reason: The Nile is a matter of life or death. Egypt gets negligible rainfall, and as a result has always relied on the Nile to feed itself and provide for the country’s economic well-being. The annual flood waters made it possible to grow fruit, vegetables, and cotton. These floods were life-giving but also dangerous: The annual deluge sometimes destroyed property and killed people. In 1956, the Egyptians began constructing the Aswan High Dam—with proceeds from the nationalized Suez Canal and the help of the Soviet Union—which would control the flood waters, ensure Egypt had adequate supplies of water during droughts, and provide hydroelectric power that would propel President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s plans for industrialization.

The Nile is so important that, setting aside terrorism and internal stability, Egypt’s most significant security concerns lay largely to the south and are directly related to the unimpeded flow of the river’s waters. At the same time, even though Sudan could often be a problematic neighbor, the idea that there might be a conflict over the Nile always seemed theoretical—until April 2011. That was when the Ethiopians began construction of the GERD project along the Blue Nile. Just as the Egyptians did in the 1950s with the Aswan High Dam project, Ethiopia’s leaders regard their dam as a critical component of development. They, and officials from other riparian states, reject the argument that Egypt should continue to enjoy the largest share of water. That was always based on an Egyptian position that essentially amounts to “We are Egypt and you're not; you get rain and we don’t.”

When GERD is completed, it will reduce Egypt’s share of Nile water by 22 billion cubic meters per year, devastating Egyptian agriculture and hydroelectric production, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources. This is obviously of critical concern to Egypt’s leaders, but they have not been able to reach a diplomatic solution to the problem. The country has been preoccupied with internal developments since the uprising in 2011 that pushed President Hosni Mubarak from power. In addition, the issue of the Ethiopian dam has been managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is not as influential as it once was, especially in comparison to the Ministry of Defense and the General Intelligence Directorate. There was an effort to resolve the problem in 2015, with Sudan acting as a broker between Egypt and Ethiopia, but that failed.

Now the Egyptians and Sudanese are engaged in a spat that has become caught up in regional rivalries, and threatens to become intertwined with Ethiopia and GERD. The Sudanese recently welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Khartoum, where he signed a number of security-cooperation agreements, including a provision to allow the Turks to administer Suakin Island, located at a strategic point in the Red Sea between Egypt, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia. The island used to be home to an Ottoman naval base, and the Egyptians fear the Turks plan to renovate the island and establish a permanent military presence there.

A few months earlier, Qatar also upgraded its security relations with Sudan. This has not made the Egyptians very happy, given Turkish and Qatari support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which has exacerbated tension between Cairo and Khartoum over the Hala’ib and Shalateen disputed zones, which are located on the border between Egypt and Sudan but administered by the Egyptians. Now Sudan is mucking about in the sensitive issue of the Sanafir and Tiran islands, implying that Egypt did not have the right to transfer them to Saudi Arabia—which caused an outcry among many Egyptians—because they may actually have been Sudanese in the first place. This is Sudanese trolling to malevolent ends.

In response to all this, the Egyptians deployed a helicopter carrier in the Red Sea and sent troops to an Emirati base in Eritrea. This in turn angered the Ethiopians. Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia in 1993 and the two countries fought a border war in the late 1990s that killed an estimated 80,000 people. In 2016 they briefly clashed again, killing hundreds more. In response to the presence of Egyptian troops in Eritrea, the Ethiopians not only rejected a Cairo proposal to cut Khartoum out of negotiations over GERD, but Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn hosted the Sudanese defense minister and vowed to speed up dam construction. All the while the Sudanese deployed thousands of troops to its border with Eritrea.

The Egyptians have both called on the World Bank to help resolve the impasse over Ethiopia’s dam and vowed to protect Egypt’s share of Nile waters. There is a certain amount of implicit bellicosity in this rhetoric, given that Egyptian leaders have openly threatened war in the recent past. But this is something they can ill afford, given the instability they face from an insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula and a terrorist threat in the Western desert.

It is not hard to imagine how all this escalates into warfare. We are not dealing with the best militaries in the world, which reduces the margin for error and miscalculation. It is also a potential conflict that involves a number of important American allies against each other. Turkey, a NATO ally, and Qatar, which hosts the largest American military base outside the United States, have aligned themselves with Sudan and by extension with Ethiopia, another American ally. On the other side we have Egypt, a longtime partner of the United States in the Middle East, and Eritrea. The United Arab Emirates, a critical player in the Persian Gulf and beyond, would also likely be involved given its ties to Egypt and Eritrea.

This is a situation that calls out for American mediation, but the Trump administration has hobbled the State Department. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster have global portfolios in which conflict in the Horn of Africa rates lower than the North Korean threat and the ongoing protests in Iran. Everyone else in Washington seems to be rereading Fire and Fury for the second or third time. Perhaps sensing another opportunity to reinforce the idea that Russia, not the United States, is a broker of security and stability, Vladimir Putin might step in and stave off the conflict over water that finally seems to have ripened.","Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_xl/public/image/2018/01/BP01162018.jpg?h=67d04f17,"['water', 'states', 'break', 'egyptians', 'war', 'conflict', 'sudanese', 'west', 'united', 'notice', 'horn', 'africa', 'nile', 'dam', 'egypt', 'sudan']", ,none

A rare bout of heavy rainfall, thunder, and lightning has attacked Egypt’s capital and other parts of the country for the second day running, causing flooding and incapacitating the city’s traffic – and its people.

The state news agency, MENA, reported that the authorities were forced to close highways, with parts of Cairo’s ring road being shut. As a result, some travellers had to spend the night in their cars.

Little seems to have been spared the vicious downpour, with videos emerging on social media of water pouring through the ceiling of Point 90 mall in Fifth Settlement, alongside parked cars which were almost completely submerged in water. In addition, buildings, houses, and bridges collapsed reports Egypt Independent and Egypt Today.

New Cairo – the area most badly hit by the rains – saw electrical cables landing in floodwaters, meaning that people were trapped inside their cars.

According to the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the police today had to rescue 24 people – 21 students, their driver, and two supervisors – who were trapped while on a trip to a nature reserve near the city.

Meanwhile, actress Nashwa Mustafa reassured her Facebook audience after having called the police to save her house from flooding.

Egypt’s Meteorological Authority says that the unstable weather is expected to improve across the country, starting on Friday.

91,91,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Italy to resume unfinished barrier project that could have stopped Venice floods - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/14/italy-to-resume-unfinished-barrier-project-that-could-have-stopped-venice-floods,"In 1984, Italy launched a flood barrier project called Mose. It was supposed to protect the lagoon city of Venice from high tides.

If everything had gone according to plan, Tuesday’s high tide should never have reached Venice, let alone flood its basilica, submerge its squares and inundate its historic palaces.

But Venice's Mose project was never completed, and in November 2019, the city suffered its worst flooding since 1966.

The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia said the ""aqua alta"", or ""high tide"", has done ""apocalyptic damage"" to Venice, while the mayor Luigi Brugnaro said: ""The future of Venice is at stake.""

On Thursday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte visited the lagoon city, in the hope to conclude the flood barrier project as soon as possible.

What happened to the Mose project?

Mose is an acronym for “Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico”, or “Experimental Electromechanical Module”, and refers to the biblical figure Moses who parted the Red Sea to enable the Israelites to flee to safety from Egypt.

It was designed in 1984 when the Italian government asked engineers to draw up plans to build a barrier at sea to defend the fragile city of Venice from the constant threat of high tides.

Work began in 2003, with the project's inauguration by Berlusconi, and should have been finished by 2016.

But the project was plagued by corruption, cost overruns and prolonged delays, and was at the centre of many bribery cases.

Such as...?

A report by Italy's L'Espresso magazine highlighted one particular case study after accessing court documents:

Their findings outlined how, in April 2013, the Italian finance police (Guardia Finanza) seized 12 million euros and bank accounts belonging to Giancarlo Galan, former governor of the region and undersecretary in Berlusconi's administration.

According to prosecutors, the bribes Galan cashed in were reinvested in luxury apartments in Dubai as well as factory buildings in Italy's northern Veneto region.

In 2014, Galan entered a plea deal for a 2 year and 10 months sentence for corruption.

The investigation into money laundering related to the Mose project involves a number of players and a network of offshore enterprises, some of them based in Panama. Galan's accountants, Guido and Christian Penso, ended up named in the now famous Panama Papers investigation. According the the prosecutors, they were helping Galan transfer money abroad totalling over 1.5 million euros. This sum was later transferred to a Croatian bank account belonging to the wife of another Galan's accountant, Paolo Venuti.

Venuti, L'Espresso's investigators reported, is also at the centre of a separate money laundering investigation, tied not to Mose but to a shoe factory: he is accused of moving around 33 million euros abroad and investing part of them in real estate in Dubai.

What happens now?

The modern-day Moses consists of 78 bright yellow mobile underwater barriers, when activated, rise above the surface and prevent surging tides from the Adriatic Sea flooding the Venetian lagoon.

All 78 gates are now in place and engineers are working on the mechanics of raising them simultaneously once tides of more than 110 cm are forecast, up to 3m.

The first testing is expected next year.

Engineers are predicting the sea defence system will be ready at the end of 2021 at a cost of €5.5 billion. The total cost, including all expenses, is estimated at €7 billion.

Will it be enough?

Experts worry that the Mose system was not designed to deal with the sort of rising sea waters that recent climate-change models have predicted.

A report by the U.N.’s science and culture agency UNESCO said Mose was planned on a base scenario of sea levels in the northern Adriatic rising some 22 cm by 2100, but many scientists fear that assumption is far too optimistic.

""A rise of 100 cm should not be excluded"" [...] with the projections given in this report there should be no doubt that the sea level will eventually rise to a value that will not be sustainable for the lagoon and its historical city,"" the report warned.

""The planned mobile barriers (Mose) might be able to avoid flooding for the next few decades, but the sea will eventually rise to a level where even continuous closures will not be able to protect the city from flooding. The question is not if this will happen, but only when it will happen"".

Georg Umgiesser, an oceanographer and researcher at the CNR and at the Institute of marine sciences, told Euronews that his projections showed a similarly worrying trend.

""In the scenario of sea levels rising by 50 centimetres, we will have to close it once a day, while it is designed to close twenty times a year, no more. There are maintenance cycles to be respected, associated costs... At this rate, in 30 to 40 years, it will already be out of date,"" Umgiesser said.

Mario De Marchi, Vice-President of the Order of Engineers of Venice argues, however, that it's important to finish the project: ""It would not make sense to leave it unfinished because it is now considered useless . Even If it were to last for 30 years, we would at least solve the problem for that period of time.""

Inspection has shown that the Mose hinges, which have been underwater for three and a half years, are already in an advanced state of corrosion.

The Irrigation Ministry is designing flood protection facilities on the basis of the highest rainfall recorded in the last 100 years, Abdel Aty said.

He added that the ministry has an operations room with all officials of the country, working 24 hours and monitoring every site in Egypt to prepare for any rains and floods.

Red Sea Governor Ahmed Abdallah said that the cost of the first phase of the protection measures from the flood hazards in the cities of the province amounted to LE 400 million.

He explained that these projects included the construction of dams and storage lakes from Ras Ghareb in the north to Halayeb and Shalateen in the south, which will contribute to increasing the capacity of the reservoir.

In his review of flood protection projects, Abdallah said that global climate change has changed the map of the four seasons, resulting in natural disasters beyond the capabilities of the Great Power, resulting in loss of lives and infrastructure in billions.

93,93,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why Egypt Is at the Forefront of Hepatitis C Treatment - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/why-egypt-is-at-the-forefront-of-hepatitis-c-treatment/561305/,"With affordable drugs secured, the country set out to distribute them at a scale never before attempted. In 2014, they debuted an online portal for those with the disease to register for treatment; within three days, 200,000 people had signed up. Over the next three years, more than 1.6 million Egyptians received hepatitis C treatment, according to data from the World Bank. That is more than all the patients treated during that time in the United States and Europe combined.

But that first flood of Egyptians seeking a cure were largely those already diagnosed with hepatitis C, and over time the challenge has shifted from making the drugs available to identifying additional people who need them. “The people going to those treatment centers tend to dry up,” explains Ward. “Obviously if you’re not testing, you’re not diagnosing, and you don't have anyone to treat.”

So in 2017, the Ministry of Health initiated a nationwide screening program. More than 260 teams of community-health workers are proceeding village by village. By late 2017, they’d screened 1,200 communities. Still, treatment has slowed from a high-point in 2016. According to the CDA Foundation, which compiles epidemiological data on viral hepatitis, the number of Egyptians treated in 2017 fell by roughly 30 percent compared to 2016, despite an estimated 4 million people still infected in the country.

With the promise of free drugs from the government for those diagnosed, civil-society organizations from factories to churches to mosques have gotten involved in screening, too. The prevalence of hepatitis C is around twice as high in the poorest quintile of the population compared to the wealthiest, but J. Stephen Morrison, the senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the epidemic cuts across society in a way that has benefited the elimination efforts. “[Hepatitis C] may carry a stigma but there are few families in Egypt who haven’t had some loved one who has struggled with this.”

Last year, in the upscale neighborhood of Katameya Heights in New Cairo, a chapter of the Rotary Club arranged a hepatitis C screening for the neighborhood residents and their household staff. One of the organizers was Mohamed Ziwar, who had recently retired from a leadership role at the drug company Bayer. He says the club contracted nurses from a local lab that does genetic analysis to spend three days in the neighborhood, where they screened about 1,000 people, and then arranged treatment for the 30 who tested positive. “After we finished this, we got other requests from relatives of these people, that they would love to go through the investigation,” Ziwar said.

Ziwar estimated that the club ended up spending about $5,000. It could have been much higher but since it was a charitable effort, the lab did the blood analysis nearly at cost. But screening the whole group was significantly more expensive than the price of the drugs needed to treat the 30 infected residents. This is proving to be true at the national level as well. While the diagnostics are inexpensive, as many as 20 people must be screened to identify one new person who is infected, and it adds up. To ensure all the residents of a given community get tested, screening teams must sometimes return multiple times.","Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vCexjlGgI4Z0Y7N8KH3kpi7Ia2E=/0x610:4926x3176/960x500/media/img/mt/2018/05/GettyImages_845268896/original.jpg,"['drugs', 'screening', 'treatment', 'screened', 'egyptians', 'hepatitis', 'residents', 'infected', 'neighborhood', 'forefront', 'c', 'egypt']", ,none
94,94,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ancient Water Underlies Arid Egypt - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/ancient-water-underlies-arid-egypt,"A hidden trove of groundwater is left over from the last ice age.

Aside from the Nile River’s green corridor, much of northeastern Africa is desert. But the arid landscape hides a secret: Vast quantities of groundwater fill an underground aquifer that spans four countries.

In the future, as Egypt’s population and agriculture expand, groundwater will become a more important resource. A new study using chloride isotopes to date the groundwater under Egypt’s Eastern Desert has found that the water in smaller, shallower aquifers is refilled by the larger, deeper aquifer, where vast quantities of groundwater date to the last ice age.

Most Egyptians live along the Nile and get their drinking and irrigation water from the river. Currently, just 7% of the country’s water usage is supplied by groundwater, but that number is expected to rise, said Mahmoud Sherif, a hydrogeochemist at the University of Delaware and lead author of the new study, published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “In the future, as Egypt’s population and agriculture expand, groundwater will become a more important resource.”

The research team set out to date the age of the groundwater under the Eastern Desert to determine the aquifers’ responses to climate conditions and the recharge rates of shallower formations called alluvial aquifers. “These aquifers are closer to the surface and easier to access than the deeper Nubian aquifer,” Sherif told Eos.

“We expected the water in the shallow aquifers to be less than 100 years old,” Sherif said, with the clock starting when the rainwater falls from the atmosphere onto Earth. Instead, some of the water samples were more than a thousand times that age.

The researchers used the radioactive isotope chlorine-36, which has a half-life of 300,000 years, to date groundwater samples collected from 29 wells scattered around the Eastern Desert. They found that the oldest samples in the alluvial aquifers were more than 200,000 years old. “This was really surprising,” Sherif said.

Mixing with the Nubian aquifer helps explain the age: “This region is tectonically active and has a lot of deep-seated faults. Groundwater from the Nubian aquifer is making its way up along these faults and recharging the alluvial aquifers,” Sherif said.

The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is the largest known fossil water aquifer in the world. Spanning more than 2 million square kilometers across Sudan, Chad, Libya, and Egypt, it contains more than 150,000 cubic kilometers of groundwater—more water than the Nile River discharges in 500 years.

The water in the Nubian aquifer dates back to the Pleistocene epoch, when Earth weathered periodic deep freezes.

“During the Ice Age, what is now desert was a lot greener and wetter,” said Cliff Voss, a hydrogeologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who was not involved in the new study. Today, the Nubian aquifer may receive a little water during flash flood season, but the recharge rate is “effectively zero,” Voss said.

The new study offers new data on the little-studied Eastern Desert, and the findings match up well with previous studies of the Western Desert and the rest of the region underlain by the Nubian aquifer, said Voss.

“In 2014, we mapped out the Nubian aquifer in the hopes that the four countries wouldn’t have to compete over their share of the water,” Voss said of his 2014 study published in the Hydrogeology Journal. “Fortunately, all four countries essentially have water forever, especially Egypt and Libya.”

To date, Libya is the only country to tap into the vast water reserves of the Nubian aquifer on a large scale. The pipelines known as the Great Man-Made River carry water from 1,300 wells more than 2,800 kilometers inland across the desert to the coastal cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sirte.

The connection between the alluvial aquifers and the Nubian aquifer means that communities and agricultural operations in the Eastern Desert have an almost unlimited supply of groundwater without having to drill very deep.

“It’s a gorgeous supply of water, clean, not salty,” Voss says. “You can drink it without any filtration or treatment.”

95,95,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ramses II—facts and information - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/ramses-ii,"What makes a king mighty? Ramses II (ca 1303–ca 1213 B.C.) recognized that diplomacy and an exhaustive public relations campaign could mitigate any military shortcomings. His celebrated building accomplishments, including the marvels at Karnak and Abu Simbel, reflected his vision of a great nation and of himself as the “ruler of rulers.” He erected more monuments and statues—and sired more children—than any other pharaoh. As a result, he has long been regarded by Egyptians as Ramses the Great and his 66-year reign is considered to be the height of Egypt’s power and glory.

It was Ramses II’s grandfather—Ramses I—who had elevated their commoner family to the ranks of royalty through his military prowess. Ramses II’s father, Seti I, secured the nation’s wealth by opening mines and quarries. He also fortified the northern frontier against the Hittites, a tribe out of modern-day Turkey. When 14-year-old Ramses II ascended the throne, the Hittites saw an opportunity to test the young king and his empire’s northern border. They invaded and took over the important trading town of Kadesh in modern-day Syria.



Ramses II led his forces to recapture Kadesh, but he was duped by spies into thinking the Hittites were far from the Egyptian camp. Instead, they were lying in wait nearby and attacked. The Egyptians were on the brink of defeat when reinforcements arrived just in the nick of time. Ramses II won that battle but he did not win the war. (Was Ramses II the Pharoah who challenged Moses?)



5:58

His battered troops withdrew from Kadesh, but Ramses wasn’t about to let a little truth tarnish his perceived triumph. On temple walls across Egypt, he ordered the creation of murals depicting him single-handedly defeating the aggressors. In reality, after years of negotiation, Ramses II eventually signed a peace treaty with the Hittites. It was the earliest peace accord whose text has survived. Among its articles, both sides agreed to extradite refugees and not exact retribution after their return. Further, they agreed to aid one another if attacked by foreign or domestic enemies. One copy of the treaty, in hieroglyphics, was carved on a stela in the temple of Karnak. A second copy, written in Akkadian on a clay tablet, was discovered in Turkey in 1906. The significance of this peace treaty is reflected in the fact that a replica of the tablet is on display at the United Nations headquarters in New York.

LIVING UP TO HIS GREATNESS



As a sign of diplomatic good faith, Ramses II married the eldest daughter of the Hittite king. She joined him, Nefertari (his chief queen), and his enormous family—he sired more than a hundred children—at his new capital, Per Ramessu, aptly, though audaciously, named after himself. (See inside the wedding of Ramses II and the Hittite princess.)



The wealth of Ramses II’s reign is evident in his opulent building campaign, the largest undertaken by any pharaoh. The temples at Karnak and Abu Simbel are among Egypt’s greatest wonders. His funerary temple, the Ramesseum, contained a massive library of some 10,000 papyrus scrolls. He honored both his father and himself by completing temples at Abydos.



For all of Ramses II’s efforts to ensure his legacy would live on, there was one testament to his power he could not have foreseen. After his death, nine subsequent pharaohs took his name upon ascending the throne, solidifying his stature as “the great” among Egypt’s rulers. (Read why the mummy of Ramses II was issued a modern passport.)

Abu Simbel, monumental temple Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. An elevated view of the Ramses temple and the Nile shoreline. Photograph by David Boyer, Nat Geo Image Collection Ramses II wanted there to be absolutely no question which pharaoh had built the magnificent temple at Abu Simbel. At its entrance, four 60-plus-foot-tall seated statues of him serve as sentries. Dedicated to the sun gods, the temple extends 185 feet into its cliff via a series of three towering halls. Scenes depict Ramses II at the Battle of Kadesh as well as the pharaoh and his principal wife, Nefertari, making offerings to the sun gods. Ramses ordered a second, smaller temple built nearby for Nefertari.



Because of its remote location, Abu Simbel went undiscovered until 1813. In 1959, when the construction of the Aswan High Dam threatened to flood the site, UNESCO embarked on an unprecedented, 20-year rescue effort that relocated both Abu Simbel temples—stone by stone—to higher ground some 200 feet farther up the cliff.



Prince Khaemwaset Among the more than 100-plus offspring of Ramses II, Prince Khaemwaset truly stands apart. He held the prestigious post of high priest of Ptah, the patron god of Memphis. Bas-reliefs depict him in his important duty of tending the tomb of Ptah’s sacred Apis bulls in the underground complex known as the Serapeum. Khaemwaset’s larger legacy is his groundbreaking role as one of the first known archaeologists. He was entranced by the thousand-year-old landmarks from the Old Kingdom that surrounded him in Memphis. He inspected and restored several temples and pyramids. At each restoration, he inscribed the names and titles of the building’s original “owners,” as well as his and his father’s names. A millennium after his death, he was revered as a scholar and featured in a series of stories about his accomplishments.

96,96,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Indonesia, like Egypt and South Korea, plans new capital - Quartz",https://qz.com/1608402/indonesia-like-egypt-and-south-korea-plans-new-capital/,"Jakarta is sinking. In fact, it is one of the fastest-sinking cities in the world.

That alone is reason enough to consider relocating Indonesia’s capital city to a less flood-prone area of the country, so the fact that it is also one of the world’s most gridlocked cities and has the worst air pollution in Southeast Asia makes the case for a new capital city ever more urgent.

On Monday (April 29), Indonesia announced that it would relocate the capital out of the country’s main island, Java. President Joko Widodo, who appears to have secured a second term in office per preliminary results, asked his ministers to draw up plans for candidate cities in the coming months.

According to the Jakarta Post, the country’s planning minister Bambang Brodjonegoro outlined three possible alternatives to the current capital.

The government could keep Jakarta as the capital, but move government offices to a special zone near the presidential palace about 30 miles outside of the city. Or it could set up a new capital up to around 30 to 40 miles beyond Jakarta. But because neither of the two options addressed the problem of overcrowding in Java, the government ultimately settled on the third: moving the new capital outside of Java altogether. A new location has not been chosen.

Indonesia is not alone in searching for new locations for its capital. Like Jakarta, Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is prone to flooding. That is why the country has begun to build a new “back-up” city, named New Clark City, in case Manila is hit by a natural disaster.

In South Korea, Sejong City is slated to be the country’s new administrative capital. Inaugurated in 2012, Sejong is part of a plan dating from 2002 to shift official functions out of Seoul. Since then, Sejong has become something of a baby-boom town, with the highest fertility rate among 17 Korean provinces and cities in a with a record-low fertility rate of 1.05, the lowest among OECD countries in 2015. The government expects to have 500,000 living in Sejong by 2030.

Egypt, too, is building a capital from scratch. Construction began on the as-yet nameless new administrative capital in 2015, and when completed it will span 700 square kilometers (270 square miles), about the size of Singapore. The idea is to ease pressure on cramped Cairo, replacing the current capital with a smart city in the desert with wide boulevards, neat rows of high-rises, luxury housing, and lush greenery. Whether ordinary folk can actually afford to move there is uncertain. Also unknown for now is how much the project will cost, how Egypt will pay for it (paywall), and what will happen to Cairo once the new capital takes root.

While talks between Egypt and a Chinese developer, China Fortune Land Development, for a $20 billion development of the new city fell through in late 2018, the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has agreed to loan Egypt $3 billion to develop a central business zone in the new capital.","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RTR4IY8R.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['building', 'countrys', 'miles', 'cities', 'capital', 'city', 'sejong', 'java', 'capitals', 'zone', 'countries', 'jakarta', 'egypt', 'scratch']", ,flood
97,97,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Original opera The Flood reflects ripple effects of Columbus catastrophe - The Columbus Dispatch,https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190207/original-opera-the-flood-reflects-ripple-effects-of-columbus-catastrophe,"Opera Columbus, ProMusica Chamber Orchestra are co-commissioners of the new opera ""The Flood,"" about the 1913 deluge that ravaged Columbus.

In recent seasons, Opera Columbus productions have transported audiences to Egypt in “Aida” and Japan in “Madama Butterfly.”

For its latest undertaking, the troupe is looking closer to home for inspiration.

In partnership with the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra, Opera Columbus has co-commissioned “The Flood,” a brand-new work revolving around Ohio’s disastrous flood of 1913. Over Easter that year, a storm system entered central Ohio, resulting in the failure of levees along the Scioto River and enveloping Franklinton in as much as 17 feet of water. More than 90 people lost their lives.

In the opera’s telling, the flood led to a legacy of tragedy for a fictional family in Franklinton.

“The flood is mainly the curtain, the backdrop to the story,” said Opera Columbus General and Artistic Director Peggy Kriha Dye.

The production — Opera Columbus’ first opera commission in about two decades — will have its world premiere Friday and continue through Sunday in the Southern Theatre.

Dye said the show reflects the troupe’s renewed commitment to makers of contemporary operas.

“To be a forward-thinking leader in the opera field, you need to be creating and commissioning new works as part of the programming,” Dye said. “Just like in literature, you would hate to just sit back and count on all the books that have been written but never want more to be written.”

Led by conductor Steven Osgood, ProMusica’s musicians will perform the score, which features music by Korine Fujiwara, violist of the Carpe Diem String Quartet; and a libretto by Stephen Wadsworth, director of opera studies at the Juilliard School in New York City.

“Because we get to work with the composer — she’s alive, she’s in the room every day and she gives us her feedback regularly — we’re able to know exactly what she meant,” said soprano Meroe Khalia Adeeb of learning the never-before-performed score.

Planning for the production began several years ago, when Dye approached ProMusica Executive Director Janet Chen about embarking on a collaboration; ProMusica has commissioned many original orchestral pieces.

“It just started as a little nugget,” Chen said. “We have never done a commission of this caliber in terms of creating a new chamber opera.”

Dye and Chen agreed to join forces, but first, they needed to settle on the subject of the prospective opera. Eager to tie the production to central Ohio, the two met with Cindy Gaillard of WOSU, producer of the series “Columbus Neighborhoods.”

“I thought if anybody knows the stories of Columbus, WOSU has been researching this for years,” said Dye, who asked Gaillard for an episode of local history that was both epic and operatic.

“She said, hands down, the flood of 1913,” Dye said.

To devise a story, Dye turned to Wadsworth, whose resume includes writing the libretto for Leonard Bernstein’s 1983 opera “A Quiet Place.”

“I was able to go and chase things around on the internet a little bit to research it, and a lot of different things came up out of that,” said Wadsworth, who decided that the drama should take place over the course of a century, with specific years — 1913, 1940, 1970 and 2014 — represented by different rooms onstage.

“Quite early on, I had the idea that it had to be different rooms and maybe different time periods, and it was really about the fallout — the long-term effects of civic and personal trauma,” said Wadsworth, also the director of the show.

In the 2014 portion of the opera, bass-baritone Kevin Deas plays Clement, who is fielding questions about the flood — and its impact on his family — from his grown daughter Annie (Adeeb). Multiple members of the fictional family tree perished as a result of the flood.

“There’s a line that I say that the flood never stops drowning people because of the lasting effects through generations from this horrific event,” Deas said.

As the opera skips from one year to another, Fujiwara’s score shifts in style.

“The music is as complicated as the story in the sense that every room has its own flavor musically,” Dye said.

Yet, with a story inspired by central Ohio history and a run time of around an hour, Adeeb said that “The Flood” could be ideal for first-time operagoers.

“They’ll understand a lot of the local references about different locations and historical figures from this area,” she said.

99,99,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Geospatial Work Identifies High-Risk Flooding Areas in Egypt Region - GISuser.com,https://gisuser.com/2016/11/geospatial-work-identifies-high-risk-flooding-areas-in-egypt-region/,"UT Dallas researchers and their colleagues have developed geospatial science methods to help the Egyptian government determine how to avoid flooding in a coastal mountain region.

The government wants to develop the area for tourism, but flash flooding and associated hazards have hampered efforts, said Dr. May Yuan, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences.

“We developed methods in geospatial information sciences (GIS) to combine all the environmental factors associated with flash flooding and created a model to identify the high- and low-risk areas,” she said.

Yuan conducted the research, published in the Journal of Arid Environments, with co-authors from other universities in the United States and Egypt. The study focused on Nuweiba, a town on the east coast of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and its surrounding area where flooding threatens economic growth. The region is hot and dry during the summer, and gets heavy rain in the winter.

Researchers analyzed satellite imagery, conducted fieldwork and used other tools to determine a variety of factors that affect flooding, including rainfall and runoff patterns, flooding history, soil types, geology, vegetation, erosion, the steepness of the mountains and land elevation. By layering all the features on one map of the region, the scientists developed a GIS model to identify the most vulnerable areas.

“We developed methods in geospatial information sciences (GIS) to combine all the environmental factors associated with flash flooding and created a model to identify the high- and low-risk areas.” Dr. May Yuan, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences

The assessment could be used to help officials make decisions regarding flood prevention and land use, Yuan said. The researchers recommended that the government focus on flood mitigation near a highway that runs along the Wadi Watir valley and two intersections.

The project is an example of how UT Dallas researchers are using GIS to help solve problems across the globe, said Dr. Denis Dean, dean of the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences.

“GIScience is a wonderfully broad field, and a study such as this demonstrates how it can integrate diverse disciplines such as economics, geology, hydrology, and so forth,” Dean said. “Since real-world problems are almost always interdisciplinary, GIScience is exceptionally well-suited to address these issues.”

UT Dallas offers bachelor’s, master’s and PhD programs in GIS, and graduate certificates in geospatial intelligence, remote sensing and geographic information systems.

Co-authors of the study were Dr. Sara Abuzied, of the University of Oklahoma, where Yuan previously taught; and Dr. Samia Ibrahim, Dr. Mona Kaiser and Dr. Tarek Saleem of the Suez Canal University in Egypt. The University of Oklahoma received financial support for the study from the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.
