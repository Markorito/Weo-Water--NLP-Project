When disaster strikes, the immediate death toll is first to hit the headlines. But a much longer-term problem is the potentially huge number of people forced to move – a figure set to surge amid the rising impact of climate change.

Over 17 million people worldwide were displaced by disasters last year, the vast majority of which were weather-related, according to a new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC).

The number of people currently estimated to be living in internal displacement as a result of conflict and violence is also at its highest ever, at 41.3 million, the report states, adding: “Despite policy progress in several countries, the root causes of internal displacement are still not being adequately addressed.”

“Even a country that is relatively well prepared and disaster-aware is going to experience a disproportionate impact on its poorer population,” IDMC director Alexandra Bilak

One of the biggest issues in the coming years, the report highlights, will be rising rural-urban migration, with 95 per cent of urban growth expected to happen in developing countries. Adding to rapid, unplanned sprawl, this threatens to make people even more vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as the now “staggeringly high” risk of floods, the authors warn.

Poorer citizens will undoubtedly take the brunt of the hit. “Even a country that is relatively well prepared and disaster-aware is going to experience a disproportionate impact on its poorer population,” says IDMC director Alexandra Bilak.

New displacements in 2018: Breakdown for conflict, violence and disasters

Bangladesh tackles cyclones

As a low-lying, flood-prone nation, Bangladesh has sought to address this issue, developing early warning systems for cyclones.

Having long realised climate change was a problem, “we haven’t sat idle waiting”, says Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Dhaka. “We’ve been trying to figure out what to do about it, and as a result have gone up a steep learning curve.”

That means cyclones now claim far fewer lives in Bangladesh, he says – pointing out that people knew what to do when Cyclone Fani hit in May, with over a million moving to shelters.

Disaster response has been boosted by the spread of tracking tech, smartphones, social media and new apps, aiding communication even among those who lack literacy skills, says Huq. But the longer-term effects of displacement from flooding remain a problem, he adds.

Even with systems in place, Dhaka – already among the world’s fastest-growing cities, with slums full to bursting – is unable alone to absorb the further 10 million people expected to be displaced in Bangladesh over the next two decades.

So in what Huq describes as a “people-centred” pilot scheme, ICCCAD has pinpointed around 20 smaller towns deemed suitable for resettling up to a million migrants each in the future. Its aim is to get towns on board and allay economic fears.

“The carrot is that it will help their town grow,” says Huq. “We’re looking at how we make these towns climate-resilient but, more importantly, migrant-friendly to enable migrants to become citizens… We talk to the mayors and the people, and I wouldn’t say we’ve convinced them all, but they’re sufficiently interested to engage.”

Community mapping

The need to combine social and tech approaches for long-term solutions strikes a chord elsewhere, too. Innocent Maholi works on community-based mapping initiative Ramani Huria in Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam, a frequently flooded city where more than 70 per cent live in unplanned settlements and with a population expected to more than double by 2035.

The initiative, run by international organisation the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), has been using drones and data from community mapping, including door-to-door surveys, to assess the position, types and material composition of buildings, roads, drainage systems and flood-prone areas, plus identify evacuation routes and safe refuges.

Engagement of citizens is key, says Maholi, adding that the ethos for the community is: “If we develop the map together, it should be our map, not Ramani Huria’s.” This has involved training local people on the tools, and enthusing them via initiatives such as “mapathons”, or mapping parties, as well as collaborating with universities to train hundreds of students.

A recent graduate who joined Ramani Huria has been developing a rapid-assembly drone made out of bamboo in a bid to create one at a cost of less than US$200. “I see a bright future in terms of us processing our own imagery so we can help people on the ground,” says Maholi.

Satellite solutions

Meanwhile, smaller, cheaper and higher-resolution satellites are also improving displacement tracking. US firm Planet currently has about 140 satellites – including over 120 of its shoebox-sized Doves – collecting 1.2 million images daily, hitting sufficient fleet density by late 2017 to image the whole of Earth’s landmass each day.

Andrew Zolli, the company’s vice president of global impact initiatives, says the technology can help analyse where floods and landslides might happen, pre-position emergency services, and manage urban growth to avoid vulnerable areas.

Planet has also been working with the World Bank to develop AI tools to find every building in its imagery, enabling them to be viewed as they’re being built, says Zolli. “This allows you to see the kind of progress of urban growth that is otherwise totally invisible, even to the urban managers who manage those cities.”

In the Kutupalong camp in southern Bangladesh, populated by Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar, the imagery was harnessed to identify people to move from areas that became prone to landslides after trees were removed to build houses and cook food.

New displacements (disasters)

Planet is also working on satellite-linked financial instruments to help release funds the moment a disaster strikes. In addition, its imagery can also help people retain ownership of their land if they are temporarily displaced, even if a disaster has made an area unrecognisable. “Someone can say definitively that this is mine and this is where my family lives,” says Zolli.

Other breakthroughs are being made in artificial intelligence, which will eventually replace the often “resource-intensive and time-consuming” manual analysis of imagery, says Matthew Wencel, global GIS manager and settlement specialist at humanitarian association IMPACT Initiatives. He added that IMPACT partner UNOSAT (the Operational Satellite Programme of the UN Institute for Training and Research) has just produced its first AI-derived shelter analysis map for a resettlement camp in Syria.

AI technology in general, however, has not yet been effectively automated enough to save time, says Wencel, adding: “We continue to rely mainly on manual analysis, as the success rate of AI tools has historically been too low to offer any advantage over it.”

Freedom to innovate

Elsewhere, the UN’s Pulse Labs in Indonesia and Uganda are seeking to pioneer cutting-edge methods for harnessing big data for development by encouraging innovation through experimentation.

Pulse Lab Jakarta’s methods have led to the development of CycloMon, which tracks satellite data on the path of cyclones, and Haze Gazer, which wraps in user-generated data and has been adopted by Indonesia’s government to monitor wildfires.

“If something looks promising, the idea is to share it as widely as we can and map out how we go from here,” explains Derval Usher, head of office at Pulse Lab Jakarta, which she says is able to experiment in a “safe-to-fail” environment.

The challenge, she emphasises, is working with governments to put the infrastructure in place, adding: “It’s very difficult to apply these methods in disaster contexts if you don’t have the agreements and regulatory frameworks in place.”

This need to cooperate closely on tech with governments is echoed by Einar Bjorgo, manager of UNOSAT, which runs the CommonSensing satellite project in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands aimed at improving climate resilience.

“I would say the technology is there,” says Bjorgo. “Now what we want to focus on is not necessarily new algorithms or tweaking to make it one per cent better, but to actually make use of it at the country level.”

The IDMC report points to some progress in this regard. In late 2018, for instance, Niger became Africa’s first country to incorporate the Kampala Convention – the world’s only legally binding regional instrument on internal displacement – into its domestic legislation.

Kerry-Lynn Maze, senior migration crisis analyst at the International Organization for Migration (IOM), believes that momentum will grow with other African countries following suit. “I strongly hope that this is going to be the year of turning commitment into action,” says Maze. “Adopting the Kampala Convention alone won’t be sufficient, but I think having it creates an impetus to address these issues.”","Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.scidev.net/global/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bangladeshflooding_MAIN.jpg,"['imagery', 'million', 'climate', 'disaster', 'urban', 'map', 'tech', 'displacement', 'report', 'targets', 'adding', 'impact', 'help', 'peoplecentric']",

This story appears in the July 2019 issue ofmagazine.

It was when the body of a long-dead friend surfaced near her front door that Bulu Haldar knew her house was as good as gone.

For weeks, the embankment shielding East Dhangmari, in the Khulna district of southwestern Bangladesh, had been threatening to sink into the Pusur River. First, a ferocious storm had ripped into the outer layer of concrete. Then, at the end of 2017, the river had begun eating into the porous earthen wall itself. Locals rushed in sandbags, but that bought only a few days’ respite. When the river finally surged into the cemetery across from Haldar’s garden, disinterring skeletons and contaminating the village’s drinking pools, it filled her one-room hut waist-deep in muddy brown water.

“There was nothing else I could do to protect my house,” she said. “We were powerless, like children.”

Haldar, a meticulously dressed widow of about 50, had at least had some inkling of what was to come. She’d watched as the nearby Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest that flanks the village, had retreated, its trees looking increasingly weedy. She’d noted how the water appeared to draw strength from the forest’s weakness. The only surprise, Haldar insisted, is that the village’s earthworks held out for so long. “The trees defended us, but we treated them very badly,” she said. “So now we are all suffering the consequences.”

In Bangladesh and the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, there are thousands of villages like East Dhangmari—places that are losing their natural defenses against climate change just as it is intensifying. The land is paper-flat and crisscrossed by rivers bulging with meltwater from the Himalaya. Cyclones frequently roar in off the Bay of Bengal, sometimes killing thousands. Flooding is pervasive.

Some farmers in Bangladesh—a country the size of Iowa with a population of 160 million—refer to their homeland as a divine prank: The soil is fantastically fertile, but you’re always in danger of getting washed away. In 1998 an especially monstrous flood inundated about 70 percent of the country.

One thing the region’s coastal communities felt they could always bank on, though, is the Sundarbans, the world’s largest contiguous mangrove forest. Spanning nearly 4,000 square miles on both sides of the Indian-Bangladeshi border, this dense swamp of flood-tolerant trees stands as a green wall, absorbing storm surges and blunting even the worst cyclones. For villagers, the forest is also an abundant source of honey and its waters a source of fish. “The Sundarbans is our mother,” said Joydev Sardar, secretary of the fishermen’s association in Harinagar, Bangladesh. “She protects, feeds, and employs us.”

But after years of abuse from man and nature, the mangroves seem to be nearing their limits. Illicit logging, mostly for building materials to house the region’s booming population, has thinned out the periphery of the forest. At the same time, increasing water salinity caused by the encroaching sea is killing off many higher value, storm-stopping tree species, such as the sundari that gives the forest its name. The salinity assault comes from both land and sea: Upstream dams on rivers in India have reduced freshwater flow into the Sundarbans, while sea-level rise caused by climate change is flushing more salt water into the mangroves.

“The salinity front is just going up and up and up,” said Mashfiqus Salehin, a professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s Institute of Water and Flood Management. “New areas will salinize, and moderately salinized areas might become unlivable. It’s becoming a big problem.” In the worst-case scenario, in which sea levels rise by more than six feet this century, Bangladesh alone stands to lose some 800 square miles of mangroves in the Sundarbans. The best-case scenario is a loss of roughly 80 square miles. Salehin and other scientists fear even that much might prove disastrous for a country so poor the forest is besieged by human needs.

The land itself is disappearing. Without the tangled roots of the mangroves to stabilize it, land erodes into the sea—and with upstream dams trapping river sediment, it’s not replenished as it once was.

The islands in India’s Hugli River, in the Ganges estuary on the western edge of the Sundarbans region, illustrate advanced stages of the decay. At least three islands that a century ago were covered in mangroves—Lohachahara, Suparibhanga, and Bedford—have vanished. Others are eroding fast: Sagar Island has shrunk by about 20 square miles since the mid-20th century, even as its population has swollen with new arrivals from its disappearing neighbors. Crop-growing conditions on Sagar have deteriorated so much that residents now survive largely off seasonal labor elsewhere.

In some parts of the Sundarbans, the sea is advancing about 200 yards a year. “The people around the Sundarbans will lose a lot,” said Tuhin Ghosh, an associate professor at Jadavpur University in Kolkata. “This is happening now.” But even cities like Kolkata and Dhaka that lie some distance from the vanishing mangroves, he added, will find themselves “extremely exposed to cyclones and storm surges.”

In February 2018 part of the embankment that holds back the Chunar River west of East Dhangmari, Bangladesh, collapsed for the third time in a year. Sixteen houses were swept away in what for locals had become an almost routine tragedy. But as the catalog of misfortunes mounted over the following months, even the oldest, most judicious residents knew these were no ordinary crises. Rice yields during the 2018 dry-season harvest were way down—often well under a ton an acre, which pushed up food prices. In many fields, vegetables simply wouldn’t grow in the salty soils.

“Because of the water damage, it sometimes seems like only the carpenters have work,” said farmer Bimol Sardar.

In the spring of 2018, a disease that has proliferated across some of southern Bangladesh struck this quiet corner of the country. Cholera, thriving in the hotter temperatures and increasingly brackish waters of the Sundarbans, has come roaring back in the swamps in which it was supposedly born. When I visited, the local doctor was overwhelmed.

“Almost every one of my patients is here because of water-related diseases that were nowhere near as much of a problem before,” said Shivapada Mondol. “The circumstances are verging on dangerous.” On a stretcher outside his office, a skeletally thin old man retched loudly; the man’s daughter tried to push more fluids into him.

Finally, as if to illustrate the impossibility of living in the new Sundarbans, several dozen families pulled up stakes in April and moved to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. No longer able to make much of a living off the land, they opted to join the million to 1.5 million other villagers from southern coastal communities who’ve already relocated to the overloaded city, according to Atiq Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies. The World Bank suggests that by 2050, more than 13 million Bangladeshis—including most of those on the margins of the Sundarbans—might migrate because of climate-related crises. The forecast in West Bengal is similarly alarming.

Despite the challenges, some people here remain guardedly optimistic about the future. The governments on both sides of the border have gotten a grip on the worst of the mangrove cutting, heavily punishing offenders, and they’ve learned from past natural disasters. By building more cyclone shelters and deploying up to 150,000 volunteers before major storms strike, Bangladeshi officials have drastically cut death tolls. In even the poorest parts of the Sundarbans, villagers have displayed an impressive capacity for adaptation. As salinity surges, they’ve abandoned rice farming in favor of shrimping.

But in the battle to preserve the mangroves—and in the long run, perhaps Bangladesh itself—the difficulties are increasing. Dhaka has green-lit the construction of a large, Indian-backed, coal-fired power station at Rampal, on the edge of the Sundarbans, a move that could pave the way for other polluting industries. China is proposing more dams in the Brahmaputra basin, potentially jeopardizing the mangroves’ remaining freshwater supply. And the climate keeps on changing, bringing ever more erratic rains, storms, and temperature swings.

As the troubles mount, some locals wonder: In the land that mangroves built, will climate change be king?

“The Sundarbans built this country,” Bulu Haldar said. “Perhaps the Sundarbans”—or the loss of this forested region—“will destroy it.”","Wed, 17 Feb 2021 15:05:59 GMT",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/81d35608-08f5-434e-9e0d-0685d450a55c/flooding-sundarbans-rising-waters-india-bangladesh-1_16x9.jpg?w=1200,"['land', 'away', 'mangroves', 'climate', 'respectful', 'forest', 'bangladesh', 'change', 'copyright', 'unauthorized', 'river', 'prohibited', 'sundarbans', 'washed', 'shrinks', 'lives']",

24/7 Wall Street

The steady rise in global surface temperatures is largely attributed to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. With rising temperatures, the world’s ice has been melting and sea levels have been rising. As a result, barring major interventions, sooner or later thousands of coastal communities around the world will become uninhabitable.

With the ice in Greenland and Antarctica melting at record rates, scientists currently estimate sea levels could rise 2-7 feet by the end of the century, with some estimates even higher. Antarctica has about 90% of all ice in the world, enough to raise global sea levels by 200 feet, in theory. This kind of catastrophic sea level rise is just one of many potential disaster scenarios caused by climate change.

Change on such a large scale is incremental and can seem quite distant, but any solution to the problem would need to be implemented relatively soon. Already, for many areas in the United States, recurring flooding is inevitable and the problem is imminent.

24/7 Wall St. reviewed data modeled by environmental watchdog group the Union of Concerned Scientists. The UCS in June 2018 released a report identifying U.S. coastal communities expected to face chronic and disruptive flooding before the end of the century.

We reviewed the coastal communities in which at least 10% of habitable land is expected to experience chronic flooding by 2060. Places are ranked by the number of residents that live in parts of the community expected to be regularly flooded by 2060. In many of these communities, more than one-third of the current population lives in areas expected to be regularly flooded by 2060.

Other factors, such as the possibility that global climate change could increase the prevalence and intensity of severe weather events such as hurricanes, could make actual outcomes in these cities even more dire. There are already places in the United States where weather appears to be getting worse because of climate change.

Across U.S. coastal cities, more than 300,000 homes worth a combined $117.5 billion are likely to be at risk of chronic tidal flooding within 30 years, according to UCS analysis and projections. By the end of the century, that total could rise to 2.4 million homes and more than $1 trillion in property damage – and those estimates are based only on existing homes. The regular inundation these cities face in the near future could make the worst floods in American history seem tame by comparison.

Methodology

To identify the cities that will soon be under water, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from “Underwater,” published June 2018 by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based environmental watchdog group the Union of Concerned Scientists. The study identified U.S. coastal communities where the largest number of residents live in properties that are projected to face by 2060 the highest level of chronic and disruptive flooding, or effective inundation – defined as being at risk of flooding 26 times or more per year. We reviewed the number of properties and total value of properties that are exposed to flood risk based on a “high” scenario calculated by the Union for Concerned Scientists, which entails a 6.6 foot rise in sea level by the end of the century. The places on our list, which are county subdivisions, are those in which the largest number of residents live in housing that would be exposed to the effective inundation.

Cities and institutions can mitigate flood damage by implementing wetlands, levees, and other mechanisms, and many of the cities on this list have taken steps to implement these measures. It is important to note that the estimates published by the UCS do not take into account the mitigating effects of such mechanisms.

3,3,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Scientists Vow to Report Flood Risk for Every U.S. Property for Free - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/14/529215.htm,"In a major research undertaking, a group of scientists and a technology nonprofit technology organization have set a mission to calculate the past, current and future flood risk of every property in America.

While institutional real estate investors and insurers have privately purchased this type of information for years, the tech nonprofit First Street Foundation and its partners say they plan to release it for free and make it easily accessible and understandable through its online database, Flood iQ.

Scientists from Columbia University, flood modeling firm Fathom, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the research institute Rhodium Group, Rutgers University, the University of California–Berkeley, and the University of Bristol are partnering with First Street on the project. The team includes 57 people, 25 of them Ph.D.s.

“The government has failed to inform the American people about the true risk of flooding be it past, present or future facing. Large institutional investors are capitalizing on that,” said Matthew Eby, First Street’s executive director of First Street, which is, naturally, housed on Water Street in New York City. “We will put this otherwise privileged information into the hands of every American, so they are empowered to protect themselves.”

The group wants to see properly-calculated flood risk applied to “all insurance rates, mortgages, land use decisions, bond ratings and other financial instruments.”

Flooding in the U.S. has cost more than $1 trillion in inflation adjusted dollars since 1980 and represents more than 63% of the cost associated with all natural disasters causing $1 billion or more damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The recent historic flooding in the Midwest, along with multiple hurricanes during 2018, destroyed thousands of homes that were classified as low-risk by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which runs the federal flood insurance program.

The group says the Midwest flooding again “highlights the need for complete, up-to-date, publicly available flood risk data that takes rising sea levels and increasing atmospheric and sea surface temperatures into account.”

First Street’s scientists say they will create a probabilistic flood model that accounts for tidal flooding, storm surge, pluvial (rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) flooding. They will then adjust the models to account for anticipated future sea level rise, increased precipitation and intensified cyclonic activity. The team also plans to analyze the flooding history of individual homes over the past 50 years.

The result will be a complete flood risk data set for every home in the U.S.

(In previous work, First Street and Columbia University researchers found that tidal flooding caused by sea level rise eroded $15.8 billion in property values in 15 East Coast states between 2005 and 2017. For three million coastal properties in Texas, sea level rise has eroded $76.4 million in property values over the same period.)

Steven McAlpine, First Street’s head of data science, said that a large percentage of FEMA flood maps are outdated and they rely solely on historic observations and do not use changing environmental factors to forecast future risk. “On top of that, there are many areas across the country that aren’t mapped at all,” he said.

Dr. Paul Bates, chairman and co-founder of Fathom, said his firm’s inland pluvial and fluvial model has already identified 27 million Americans left out of FEMA’s 100-year flood zones. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Bates.

Coupling Fathom’s inland model with other coastal models will provide the First Street project with the country’s “first ever comprehensive, publicly available flood risk data set,” according to Bates.

“Flooding is the costliest natural disaster in the United States,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group which, along with collaborators at Rutgers University and the UC Berkeley, will be leading the project’s coastal storm surge modeling. “This group of cutting-edge scientists, economists, flood modelers, and data engineers are coming together to meet a critical need, one that the government has been unable to effectively address.”

The flood risk data will be available through an Application Programing Interface (API) for distribution platforms like real estate websites and for academic institutions.

The Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center and the University of North Carolina Center on Financial Risk and Environmental Systems have already partnered with the foundation to use the data for further economic analysis.

“Markets are only efficient when participants have full information. Today, housing markets are not fully reflecting changing flood risk,” said Dr. Carolyn Kousky, executive director of the Wharton Risk Center. “Free, peer-reviewed hazard information is the first step toward closing that gap.”

Data analytics firm Verisk sells a product to insurers called WaterLine that scores flood risk for all properties in the U.S. on a 0-to-100 relative risk scale and shows the factors contributing to the score.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines catastrophic climate change as a temperature increase of 1°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels.

If the earth’s climate temperature increased by 2°C, subsequent floods would eliminate 280 million people, earthquakes would wipe out 17.6 million and drought/famine would result in 230.8 million fatalities, scientific studies have shown.

Global heating

According to research conducted by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the climate has warmed at a rate of roughly 0.15-0.20°C per decade since 1975.

The IPCC estimates that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052, meaning the climate could reach 2°C as soon as 2055 - and that’s if warming takes place in a linear progression.

If the earth’s climate heated up to 44°C, catastrophic floods would wipe out the earth’s population due to melting glaciers causing sea levels to rise. If the world’s climate continues to warm at roughly 0.20°C per decade after hitting 2°C in 2055, this temperature would be reached in 2,136 years from today.

Bangladesh is the most likely location of origin for a catastrophic flood, having had 14 historic incidences of flooding since 2008.

Every so often a new speculation or conspiracy will go viral that claims that the end of the world is near. But how credible are these theories, and what is really the biggest threat to the global population?

Comprehensive guide

How Will the World End reveals how the world could really end by breaking down theoretical but conceivable infectious disease outbreaks, nuclear warfare, climate change induced natural disasters and asteroid impact events.

The comprehensive guide curates and analyses official reports, historic incidences and pioneering scientific studies to predict the potential location of origin for each event, estimate the likely death toll and calculate the total number of days until the global population is eliminated.

But it’s not just gradual temperature increase that could result in catastrophic climate change. According to Senior Meteorological Consultant Jim N R Dale, an asteroid impact could intensify global warming to a cataclysmic level.

He said: “An asteroid impact that was not immediately catastrophic is likely to increase the likelihood of climate change - more likely towards significant cooling.

“This would be due to the amount of gasses/debris released from the impact and subsequent masking of the sun’s light/heat, rather like history shows r.e. major volcanic activity.”

Catastrophic risk

Alongside natural disasters, the world faces several other significant threats. These include infectious disease outbreaks, nuclear warfare and asteroid impact.

The 2018 Global Catastrophic Risks report suggests that mass destruction poses a larger threat today than it has for many years.

The comprehensive guide is released in the run up to World Environment Day. Hosted by China, the annual event seeks to encourage worldwide awareness and action for the protection of the environment, with this year’s focus on reducing air pollution.

NRC invests in floating homes research as part of flood mitigation strategy jpg

Article content Imagine a flood without sandbags, berms, pumps or panic — one that did little or no damage to waterfront homes. That’s the vision of University of Waterloo professor Elizabeth English, an architect who has pioneered research into the use of buoyant foundations and floating homes. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or NRC invests in floating homes research as part of flood mitigation strategy Back to video The foundations allow a home to rise straight up on guideposts when flood water moves in, float above trouble, and settle back into place when the water recedes. “It’s exactly like putting a floating dock under your house,” explains English, an expert in amphibious architecture and the founder of the Buoyant Foundation Project, a non-profit dedicated to advancing the flood mitigation strategy in places such as Louisiana, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nicaragua and Jamaica. English is now working with the National Research Council (NRC) to test whether the strategy could work in Canadian flood zones. The research is part of the NRC’s $42-million Climate Resilient Buildings and Core Public Infrastructure Initiative, a program designed to help communities and builders adapt to the challenges wrought by extreme weather events.

Article content With a four-year, $500,000 NRC grant, English is developing two prototypes for use in Canada — one a cottage retrofit and the other a new home build. The prototypes are being designed for First Nations communities that experience frequent spring flooding. The principal challenge, English says, is finding materials that will survive Canada’s extreme freeze-thaw cycle, and identifying places where the strategy can succeed. “This is not an appropriate solution for every situation,” she notes. “It’s not a one-size-fits all kind of thing.” Buoyant foundations can only be used on homes without basements, and they’ve not yet been engineered to withstand the destructive force of fast-flowing rivers, ice floes or big waves. But advances are being made, English says, and existing models could be used in protected bays along the Ottawa River.

Article content jpg “It’s just so simple. That’s why I like it,” English says. “It works with nature; it’s not challenging nature. It’s not saying we have to stop the flood or move the water. “It says, ‘The water is going to come and we’re going to accommodate it.’ The water becomes your friend rather than your foe: It’s the water that lifts the house and carries it up to safety.” To retrofit a home, it first has to be raised. A structural subframe is built with cross beams and buoyant blocks. The floats can be made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) — commonly used under floating docks — or plastic barrels. The subframe and home have to be affixed to vertical guideposts sunk into the ground. The posts can be static or can telescope out of the ground in the event of a flood, allowing the house to rise and fall without floating away from its foundation.

Article content The homes also use coiled “umbilical lines” for water supply and hydro, and breakaway connections for gas and sewer lines. The advantage of the design is that homes retain much of their original appearance until flood waters arrive. Enough buoyancy blocks can be added beneath a home to lift almost anything out of the water. The real limitation is stability: Keeping the centre of gravity of a floating home low enough to prevent it from tipping over in wind and waves. “Low and wide is good,” says English. Amphibious design is not new. Floating communities can be found throughout the Mekong Delta, and one of the largest slums in Africa — Makoko — is built on stilts and floating barrels in Lagos, Nigeria. The Uro people have been building floating communities on Peru’s Lake Titicaca for centuries. Even in Louisiana, residents of Old River Landing have been using amphibious design for more than 40 years to limit damage from Mississippi River floods.

Article content Still, the need to improve amphibious design has never been more pressing. In the past two decades, the world’s 10 worst floods have displaced more than one billion people while causing an estimated US$165 billion in damage. And although flooding is complicated by the way people divert, collect and store water, most climate scientists believe it will only get worse as Earth’s atmosphere warms. Simply put, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which results in more snow, rain and havoc. Born and raised in New Jersey, English began to think about floating homes after Hurricane Katrina inundated low-lying neighbourhoods in New Orleans. At the time, in August 2005, she was a professor at Louisiana State University’s Hurricane Center where she studied the effect of wind on tall buildings and how to protect them against hurricane damage. (She holds an undergraduate degree in architecture from Princeton University, a master’s degree in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a PhD in architectural theory from the University of Pennsylvania.)

Article content English was appalled when she discovered that the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s answer to flooding was to raise homes on stilts: It put them one-storey above the ground and made them more susceptible to wind damage. “I was just horrified at what happened to New Orleans, and the inadequacy of FEMA’s response,” she says. “I figured, if someone who was an architect and engineer working at a hurricane centre couldn’t come up with a better solution than putting houses up on stilts, then who could?” English went in search of more elegant alternatives, and discovered floating homes. After founding the Buoyant Foundation Project, English sought to improve on existing designs. Many people laughed when English told them what she was working on, but the first full-scale prototype floated to the surface of a flood tank on the L.S.U. campus in the summer of 2007.

Article content “That was a religious experience for me,” she says. Engineered to be used in places like New Orleans’ impoverished Ninth Ward, the initial design was simple and inexpensive: It cost as little as $10 a square foot to install. More advanced models cost $20 — $25 per square foot. In late 2007, English accepted a job at the University of Waterloo, where she has sought to broaden the application of buoyant foundations. Amphibious architecture is now the subject of an annual, international conference. “I want it to come out of the clouds and be accessible to everyone,” says English. “There are an awful lot of people who need this technology.” ALSO IN THE NEWS How city council let control of the Château Laurier expansion slip through its fingers Egan: Just so Ottawa — let’s mangle three of five Quebec bridges at same time Renfrew beating victim airlifted to hospital

8,8,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Take the Flood Insurance Quiz - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/12/529052.htm,"The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) released an online quiz, “What the Flood!,” as part of its #YourRiskIsReal campaign, an ongoing effort to educate consumers about flood risks and the need to consider purchasing flood insurance.

The short, interactive quiz presents several insurance concepts in easy-to-understand terms. Sample questions include: “Is damage from a busted bathroom pipe and a burst levee covered by the same policy?” and “If a hurricane floods your car, do you file a claim with auto or home?”

“There’s a lot of confusion out there about insurance coverage for water-related damage. Insurance Commissioners want consumers to understand which insurance covers the various flood perils,” said Eric Cioppa, NAIC president, who is superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance.

According to a recent national survey sponsored by NAIC, 41% of Americans agree or strongly agree that flood insurance is a “good idea,” yet only 17% say they have purchased flood insurance. The Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) estimates that only about 3% have flood protection.

Some erroneous beliefs about flood insurance commonly held by consumers include:

Myth: Homeowners insurance covers damage from floods.

Reality: Most homeowners and business insurance policies do not cover damage caused by flooding.

Myth: FEMA assistance is just as good as an insurance policy.

Reality: Not everyone will qualify for FEMA assistance after a disaster, and grants (averaging less than $8,000) are not enough to cover all costs after a flood.

Myth: Flooded homes are fine once they dry out.

Reality: Flooding can damage the foundation of a house, as well as the walls and subfloors, causing mold and other problems. Fixing the damage is expensive.

Flood insurance policies are available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in the private market.

The NAIC, together with FEMA, will host a Twitter chat from 2 to 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday, June 18. Responding to questions in real time, @NAIC will lead the chat focusing on disaster preparedness (floods, wildfires and other events) using the hashtag #YourRiskIsReal.

DHAKA — Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has slammed Myanmar for delays in the repatriation of Rohingya refugees who fled violence in the neighbouring country.

Some 740,000 Rohingya took shelter in fetid, overcrowded camps in Bangladesh after Myanmar’s military drove them over the border in a 2017 crackdown.

Many still fear for their safety if they return to Myanmar, where the Muslim minority has faced decades of repression and erosion of rights.

But the Bangladeshi prime minister’s comments late on Sunday are a sign that the country’s patience is wearing thin.

Support more independent journalism like this. Sign up to be a Frontier member.

The two governments signed a repatriation deal in November 2017, yet so far virtually no Rohingya have volunteered to return.

“The problem lies with Myanmar as they don’t want to take back the Rohingyas by any means,” Hasina told a press conference.

She also criticised international aid agencies working in the refugee camps in the border district of Cox’s Bazar – who object to any forced relocations – saying they are not interested in ending the crisis.

“The problem that I now see is that different international agencies that are providing voluntary services or working at Rohingya camps in Cox’s Bazar never want any refugee to go back,” she said.

“The principal problem lies here.”

Bangladesh has said it will not force Rohingya to return to Myanmar, where the Muslim minority faced several waves of persecution before the 2017 crackdown which saw widespread murder, rape and arson.

But Hasina called for an investigation into the organisers of protests against repatriation that have been held within the squalid camps.

“Who instigated the movement?” she asked.

“Those who provide assistance to Rohingyas have a serious objection, though the government has constructed very beautiful houses and structures at Bhashan Char,” Hasina said of the shelters Bangladesh has built on a barren, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal.

The House Financial Services Committee, by a bipartisan vote of 59 to 0, approved the comprehensive measure (H.R.3167) that includes a number of reforms from Republican and Democratic lawmakers to increase affordability, improve mapping, enhance mitigation and modernize the NFIP.

The bill reauthorizes the NFIP until Sept. 30, 2024 and allows for a retroactive effective date in the event of a lapse.

This bill was advanced by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.).

“Flooding is a humbling and equalizing force,” said Waters. “In the wake of the many catastrophic natural disasters we experienced just in the last three years, we’ve seen the best of America during the worst of times, with everyone putting aside their differences, to come together to help one another in a time of need. Now it’s time for Congress to do the same thing.”

The bill will now go to the full House of Representatives for consideration.

2019 Private Flood Insurance Report

There has for years been bipartisan support in the House for a long-term extension and major reforms of the NFIP. But various bills championed by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who chaired the Financial Services committee before Waters, were passed by the House only to stall in the Republican-controlled Senate. Now lawmakers are trying again.

In addition to the five-year reauthorization of the NFIP, the bill includes a “continuous coverage” provision that allows borrowers leaving the program to purchase private flood insurance to return to the NFIP without penalty. It also authorizes the government to offer umbrella policies for commercial properties, including multifamily and agricultural properties and requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make NFIP coverage available to co-op and condo owners.

It also creates a revolving loan fund for states to encourage them in their mitigation efforts. States can use the funding for a number of eligible activities such as elevation or relocation of homes but cannot use the funds for new construction or to assist high-income homeowners.

Other provisions would:

Expand flood mapping to all areas of the country while requiring FEMA to utilize updated mapping technology and adequately identify future flood risk.

Provide $500 million for each year over five years for flood mapping.

Allow for appeals if an aspect of the map is inaccurate, or factors exist that mitigate the risk of flooding.

Grant local variances for flood proofing certain agricultural structures.

Require an annual independent actuarial study of the NFIP to analyze its financial status of the NFIP.

Repeal surcharges currently assessed on policyholders, which in FY 2018, would have saved policyholders $380 million

Raise the minimum loan amount that triggers the mandatory purchase requirement from $5,000 to $25,000.

Authorize monthly payments instead of the current annual payment for flood insurance premiums.

Double to $60,000 the amount of Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) coverage available to policyholders.

Require better accounting of flood risks in urban areas along with a new classification for properties protected by levees.

The NFIP, as a result of federal disaster legislation signed last week by President Trump, is currently slated to expire Sept. 30, 2019.

However, a village in Lakhimpur district of the state is embarking on a different strategy altogether. Instead of building embankments to prevent the overflowing river water from entering their villages; they are busy making boats.

Several villages in the district such as Mudoibil No 1, Mudoibil No 2, Rantijan and Kahiduwar on the banks of Subansiri river submerge under more than 6ft of water during monsoon every year. The situation remains the same for the next six months, cutting them off from any kind of communication. Thus, building boats remains the only option for villagers to connect with the highland areas.

Villagers involved in building a boat by the bank of Subansiri river

Arun Dutta, a resident of Mudoibil No 3 village, said, “During flood, the entire area submerges under flood. There also several houses that reel under flood and in such condition boats are the only option we are left with. In fact, each household here requires a boat for conveyance. Water has already started inundating some of the areas. The paddy field just opposite to my house has already been submerged.”

It is not just the monsoon that affects the area but water starts reeling from the month of March itself and with monsoon; the entire area inundates and remains so till October. The boats are carved out of logs of Ajar wood and takes around three people to build them. They are built in three different sizes as per the requirement of transportation of people, goods and domestic animals.

The smallest of the boat can carry around 10 people at a time and is sold for around Rs 10,000. It takes around a week for two people to prepare the boat of that size. There are also larger boats that cost around Rs 12,000 with a capacity of up to 15 people while the largest one can carry around 50 persons at a time. The largest boat costs around Rs 1 lakh and takes around a month for two people to build. Such boats are mostly used for transporting domestic animals.

The floods do not just take a toll on the households but also affect their harvest. In 2018, around 3,560 hectares of standing crop was damaged while affecting more than 25,000 people in the district. As per a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, 67 areas in Lakhimpur are categorised as flood hazard. Mudoibil and Rantijan fall under the high and very high flood hazard categories.","Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.eastmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3930-scaled.jpg,"['flood', 'assam', 'ready', 'water', 'monsoon', 'boats', 'mudoibil', 'rs', 'lakhimpur', 'villages', 'village', 'remains', 'boat', 'takes']", 
12,12,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Viewpoint: Fixing America’s Flood Insurance Problem in 5 Steps - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/19/529774.htm,"The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was originally created by Congress to transfer U.S. flood insurance risk to private insurers. However, in 1978, (when private insurance carriers assumed over 40 percent of the nation’s flood insurance risk), NFIP administrators used a loophole in the law to remove private flood insurers from the flood insurance marketplace thus essentially nationalizing the nation’s flood insurance industry.

While it has helped many people recover from flood events, in almost every other instance, it has not helped to facilitate the private flood insurance market and has cost taxpayers about $40 billion so far. Congress should act to transform the NFIP from a government-subsidized monopoly into what Congress originally intended it to be – a facilitator of privately underwritten flood insurance and an insurer of last resort.

Five Steps to a Self-Correcting NFIP

In a May 2019 letter to Congressional leadership, the four most recent administrators of FEMA, which houses the NFIP, expressed concern over the NFIP:

“…..the National Flood Insurance Program …..is in desperate need of reform. Change is needed to allow the NFIP to pay off its debt and serve its purposes.”

There are five simple reforms that will leverage the strength of competition to cure the negative outcomes delivered by the NFIP monopoly.

Assure Meaningful NFIP Rate Increases

Beginning in 2013, the NFIP was directed by Congress to increase rates ranging from 25 percent to 5 percent per year depending on categories defined by Congress until actuarially valid pricing was achieved.

Rather than achieving overall increases, NFIP data indicate that rates per hundred of insured value remained essentially static for most structures at about $.27 during 2013, 2014 and 2015, but then sank to about $.266 in 2016 and down even further to $.255 in 2017 for an overall rate decrease of about 0.1 percent. Under its Congressional mandate, the NFIP could have increased the overall rate by a significantly larger percentage than it has and by now, might easily have achieved an average overall rate of $0.35 to $0.60. Had the NFIP taken such increases, it would have already generated many billions of dollars in additional premium and borrowed billions less from taxpayers.

Greater competition will see that rate correlates more closely with risk while greater efficiencies drive down overall rates without taxpayer bailouts.

Reduce the Number of Repetitive Loss Properties

In that same May 2019 letter to Congressional leadership, the four most recent administrators of FEMA expressed concern over the NFIP’s funding of repetitive losses:

“By incentivizing Americans to live in vulnerable areas without taking steps to mitigate the risk, the NFIP gives property owners a false sense of security,” they wrote. “In the absence of reforms, costs in taxpayer dollars and lives lost will only get worse.”

Congress should require the NFIP to publish the location of all repetitive loss properties so they may be properly rated by the private flood insurance market. To incentivize mitigation of these properties, the NFIP should be required to initiate ascending deductibles for repetitive loss properties that increase with each claim. This may inconvenience repetitive loss property owners, but it is necessary to be fair to the rest of the Americans that are currently rebuilding these structures repeatedly.

Assure That “Risk Rating 2.0” Increases NFIP Income

Under the NFIP’s proposed new rating method referred to as Risk Rating 2.0, the NFIP aims to use methods pioneered by the private flood insurance market to more accurately determine the flood risk of an individual property.

Congress should assure that 2.0 actually captures enough premium to fund 100 percent of expected losses.

Create Accurate Flood Zones

In a recent report, CoreLogic found that 23 percent of U.S. homes are at high or moderate risk of flood, but are located outside official FEMA flood zones. In Florida, 54 percent of homes fall into this category.

This study along with others indicate that the nation’s flood insurance premium pool can easily be doubled.

End Anti-Consumer, Anti-Taxpayer NFIP Rules

It appears that only Congress will be able to pressure the NFIP to step back from two practices that limit consumer choice in flood insurance and guarantee continuing taxpayer losses.

First, Congress must disallow NFIP rules that prohibit NFIP policyholders from getting a premium refund when a policy is cancelled prior to its expiration and coverage is replaced with a private flood policy. There is no practical reason to continue this abusive practice.

Second, Congress must end NFIP’s “continuous coverage” rule, which requires policyholders to “remain loyal” to the NFIP or risk having their rates go up should they choose to return to the NFIP from the private market.

You can make a difference. Contact Congress and tell your representatives that by taking these five simple steps, they can flip a switch that will automatically restore the original intent of Congress and turn a money-losing government-sponsored monopoly into a problem-solving insurer of last resort. They can reduce flood insurance costs for virtually all Americans as competition drives efficiency and lowers prices.

Her Excellency Mrs Paulette Lenert, Luxembourg Minister for Development Cooperation & Humanitarian Affairs, visited the chars in Gaibandha and Kurigram on June 11, 2019 at the invitation of Friendship NGO. She primarily visited Friendship's development projects.

The minister started the visit from Emirates Friendship Hospital, which is a ship hospital that serves the remote communities in the riverine areas. She also visited other projects including ICT enabled schools (where students learn from video classes recorded by teachers from Dhaka), legal booths (where the distant communities can get legal advice and help), theater shows (on the awareness of child marriage), flood resistant cluster village on plinths, vocational training centre, disaster response groups and agricultural projects in the Char Sidhai (Gaibandha) and Char Goynerpotol (Kurigram).

Ms Runa Khan, Founder & Executive Director of Friendship and Mr Marc Elvinger, Chairman of Friendship Luxembourg, accompanied the visiting team.

Mrs Lenert remarked on the resilience and willpower shown by the shifting river islanders in Bangladesh, praising the work that Friendship is doing for them. She expressed that Luxembourg wishes to prioritize on projects that are cohesively replicable, and solutions provided by Friendship fall very much into that category.

Ms Runa Khan remarked that the Luxembourg Government has been a major contributor of Friendship in Bangladesh for over a decade, and this support has allowed Friendship to have the kind of impact it has today; improving millions of lives in the most hard-to-reach areas of Bangladesh.

A country in Western Europe, Luxembourg is known for a strong dedication to overseas cooperation, dedicating 1% of its GDP to provide support to low and middle income countries, 15% of which are granted via NGOs.

ABOUT FRIENDSHIP INTERNATIONAL

Friendship International in Luxembourg was opened by Runa Khan, in 2006. It is an independent structure cochaired by Runa Khan and Marc Elvinger. Friendship Luxembourg, chaired by Marc Elvinger, co-financed by the Ministry of Development cooperation is the largest partner of Friendship Bangladesh.

ABOUT FRIENDSHIP BANGLADESH

Friendship Bangladesh, is a non-governmental organization, whose core project is working for the vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. Founded by Ms. Runa Khan in 2002, Friendship began with the innovative concept of a floating hospital and progressively built its distinctive integrated community development model, which includes health, education, climate change adaptation and disaster management, sustainable economic development, inclusive citizenship, and cultural preservation, besides its work with refugees and disaster stricken communities for relief and rehabilitation.

Dramatic images captured the county venue completed covered by flood water, which has forced the 'A' game on Tuesday and Worcestershire's ongoing County Championship clash against Sussex to move 25km north to Kidderminster Cricket Club.

New Road has been the home for Worcestershire County Cricket Club since 1896 and is located in the western bank of the River Severn, the longest river in Britain that stretches 354km.

Australia A head coach Graeme Hick is a legend of Worcestershire having played 25 seasons at New Road and says he is surprised not by the flooding but the timing of the deluge.

""It's a strange time for it to flood,"" Hick, who played club cricket at Kidderminster, told cricket.com.au.

""This time of year, June/July is a bit rare, I must say. It's normally earlier in the season or, in the year I retired, 2008, it flooded and we missed the whole of the last month at New Road.

""It's disappointing that we're not going there with the 'A' tour but we've got a three-day game there (from August 7-9) during the Ashes.""

The Worcestershire match will be Australia A's third fixture of their six-week tour following one-day matches against Northamptonshire on Thursday and Derby on Sunday.

The 50-over leg of the tour concludes with a pair of matches against Gloucestershire in Bristol on June 30 and July 2.

Following the one-day component, Australia A play three four-day first-class games; against Sussex in Arundel (July 7-10), against England Lions at Canterbury (July 14-17) and against an Australian XI in Southampton (July 23-26).

What is consciousness? When did it evolve? Even — does it actually exist? Most of the debates center on people. Do you think that you are conscious? We know people that would quarrel with that. The two of us are just a bit too busy for all this, but we would like to raise a similar issue today. Do clams have consciousness? Clams? Consciousness? Does that sound like an issue that would only turn up in an On the Rocks column? Probably not, but let’s get on with it.

First of all, one of us, Robert, is a paleontologist; the other, Johanna, is a biologist so we have some first-hand experience with clams, including having dissected some of them. Clams have nothing much that resembles a central nervous system, so it would seem that they could not have any level of consciousness. They cannot be deep thinkers (or even shallow thinkers!).

But we are familiar with some clam fossils that raise some doubts about this. And they are right here in the Catskills, perhaps near to where you live. Take a look out the nearest window. If you live anywhere near Woodstock, then there was once the top of a great delta out there — the Catskill Delta. That was about 400 million years ago. It would have reminded you of today’s Ganges River Delta in Bangladesh. As in Bangladesh, rivers, some of them very large, flowed by — right in your neighborhood. There were floods in those rivers too. Take a look at the photo to the left. It shows a sequence of Catskill bluestone strata. These are matched by a lot of other bluestone sequences, all throughout the Catskills. Those bluestone sands were deposited in those Devonian age Catskill Delta rivers. They were commonly flood deposits. They conjure up images of powerful stream floods, carrying great masses of sand in their dirty waters. That was during the flood, but then the flood currents subsided. Slowing flows cannot carry very much sediment, so those sands were quickly deposited. They, much later, hardened into sandstone. There is nothing unusual about any of this.

But keep looking. See those two vertical structures. What on earth are those? We see these, also all through the Catskills and they have attracted a lot of attention. Geologists have determined that they are fossil clam burrows. They were dug by clams who were working their ways upward through those flood sands, probably right after the floods had passed.

The clams, themselves, have been found and they belong to a genus name Archanodon. See our second illustration. This was a relatively common clam, living in the many streams that crossed the old Catskill Delta.

We have seen a lot of these and typically these burrows are found in flood strata measuring two to three feet in thickness. When we are looking into the past, we see that these flood sands must have posed quite a problem for our clams. When you are a three-inch-long clam, buried in three feet of sand, then you have a problem. Fortunately for our clams, they were well equipped to deal with this problem. They had large and strong burrowing muscles (curiously, they are called “feet”) that enabled them to work their ways upward. That’s where these burrows came from. They are called escape burrows.

If clams can be gregarious, then Archanodon was. They lived together, in large numbers, on the floors of their streams. When the floods struck, they were all buried together. Each one faced the same life-or-death decisions. They could dig, or they could die. They dug. Our photo shows the escape burrows of two clams, but at this outcrop there are dozens more. Every member of this colony went to work digging itself out. They seem to have always succeeded; we have never found one only halfway up.

Well, that gets us back to our initial question: do clams have consciousness? Did our clams experience fear? Did they have any awareness of what had befallen them? Did they actually decide what to do? We really don’t know. We suspect that they may well have been equipped with some sort of automatic response system that allowed them to deal with what should have been a scary situation. We guess that we will never know for sure. We will bring this up for debate the next night we are in a geology bar — or at a faculty meeting.

Talks to open up these ports to trade from the Northeastern states have been ongoing for a while, and subsequently the Bangladesh Cabinet passed a resolution to grant access in September last year. However, a pact is yet to be inked between the two governments.

The Northeastern states have been asking the Centre to expedite talks with Dhaka as it will bring down transportation costs drastically. This will also help trade from the region reach out to other parts of India. Apart from Assam, in Tripura, too, India is building a 15-km long railway line connecting Agartala and Bangladesh’s Akhaura near Chittagong port.

Sonowal also asked PM Modi to help expedite the construction of the Asian Trilateral Highway from Thailand’s Mae Sot to Manipur’s Moreh via Myanmar. Sonowal said that it will go a long way in restoring trade links between the Northeast states and ASEAN countries and will also give a strong push to the Centre’s Act East Policy.

18,18,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Annual Report 2018 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/annual-report-2018,"MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

As 2018 drew to a close, a paradox became more starkly evident: although overall, the global population is healthier, wealthier and better connected than ever, progress has not necessarily led to peace.

Conflicts raging in particularly vulnerable parts of the world continue to have a massive impact on local people and neighbouring countries, often fueling regional instability. In these conflicts we have seen regular breaches of international humanitarian law, disproportionate attacks in urban areas, and the targeting of civilians, civilian services and humanitarian workers. Men, women and children have suffered not only the immediate impact of death and injury, but the destruction of their homes, schools and livelihoods.

Today, it is the combination of threats – violence, “terrorism”, anti-terrorist measures and policies, together with developmental deficits, injustice, exclusion and climate change – that is driving people further into need.

In 2018, on every continent – in over 90 countries – the ICRC made a difference in people’s lives, with its biggest operations taking place in the Syrian Arab Republic (hereafter Syria), Iraq,

Yemen, the Horn of Africa, the Lake Chad Basin and the Sahel, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. In some protracted conflicts, it has been operating for decades; in other places, it increased its activities in response to fresh emergencies.

In all contexts, the ICRC upheld the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence. With increasing restrictions placed on humanitarian action, this approach was challenging in many contexts, requiring the ICRC to gain acceptance through negotiation and diplomatic efforts to reach people in need and to protect humanitarian methodologies. The ICRC prioritized staying close to those who needed its support and in so doing, demonstrated the unique value of its approach.

The terrible images of the devastation in Eastern Ghouta, the eerie landscape of Rakhine, and the drawings of children in the camp in Kaga Bandoro stayed with me throughout the year – and so did the dedication of our colleagues, who put the humanitarian spirit into practice in the face of adversity, every day.

As every year, the ICRC stepped up when crisis struck – the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, renewed fighting in the Gaza Strip, the migration crisis in Central America – often with the support of its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

In many places, from South Sudan to Ukraine, the ICRC maintained the capacity to act as a neutral intermediary. In the Astana and Stockholm processes for Syria and Yemen, it was recognized as having the legitimacy and expertise to speak about humanitarian concerns regarding detention and missing persons. The humanitarian forensic project it carried out in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas, which involved exhuming and identifying soldiers buried there, not only brought real relief for the families, it also showcased a creative model of humanitarian action.

The generous support of our funding partners signaled continued trust and confidence in the ICRC. We are grateful for their contributions, which helped us cover our expenses in 2018 (CHF 1.93 billion for our field operations, headquarters and innovation initiatives, with an implementation rate of 94%), and are hopeful that the downward trend of flexible funding – so critical to the delivery of neutral, impartial, independent humanitarian action – will be reversed.

Despite this, the humanitarian funding ecosystem still needs to improve the way it functions and transition to a new business model – one where the needs of communities trapped in protracted conflicts are addressed through a wider lens, by breaking down silos in our approach through partners, and reinforcing the sustainability of the ICRC’s activities, which in turn will allow us to support the resilience of the communities we want to serve. We need to be innovative if we want to bridge the steadily growing gap between people’s needs and what we are actually able to deliver to address those needs.

The ICRC’s new Institutional Strategy 2019–2022 has identified key priorities for the coming years. Given the challenging dynamics of today’s conflicts, it focuses on areas such as strengthening protection and prevention, ensuring a sustainable humanitarian impact, digital transformation, and partnering with others. The strategy has been well-received by our donors and supporters, and I am confident that it will help us to meet the humanitarian challenges ahead.

In this respect, our ability to create partnerships and collaborate in new and different ways will be key. No single sector can respond alone to the depth and breadth of humanitarian crises: progress will require strong support from States, international organizations and civil society at large.

While the neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian space is still the best place to reset lives and reconcile, humanitarian practitioners can spearhead efforts at front lines and guide others through the landscape of fragmented societies, security challenges and multifaceted needs.

19,19,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Options to placate ‘Tandava’ of the mighty son of Brahma (Part-IV) - Northeast Now,https://nenow.in/north-east-news/assam/options-to-placate-tandava-of-the-mighty-son-of-brahma-part-iv.html,"Complete immunity from floods in Brahmaputra valley is a utopian concept and techno-economically not viable. Even in the most advanced countries, complete immunity has not been achieved despite colossal investment for flood protection in many of their rivers that are much smaller and less complex than the Brahmaputra. Therefore, flood control measures are ideally aimed to reduce the frequency and magnitude of floods, to provide reasonable protection and to mitigate flood damages. These measures can be–i. Engineering structural measures and ii. Administrative and non-structural measures.

An Engineering measure is aimed either to reduce flood volume or to confine the floodwater within the river channel. Both the measures aim at avoiding the spill of floodwater into the inhabited areas. These are discussed below-

Reduction of Flood volume: This can be achieved through–i. diversions, ii. detention basins or iii. storage reservoirs.

In the case of the Brahmaputra, the diversion of water required is of the order of 15000-20000 m3/sec to have any impact on its floods. Because of the narrow and thickly populated valley area, the possibility of such a huge artificial channel through the already flooded valley is not advised. The alternative is the intervention of floodwater in the Himalayas and diverting it along the hills which is an even more difficult proposition, is impractical and plagued with adversity.

The Brahmaputra valley is very flat. The construction of a detention reservoir in the valley itself with adequate storage volume to have an impact on flood in the valley is estimated to bring more area under submergence rather than its reduction. Therefore, the construction of storage reservoirs in the hills is the only option available to reduce flood volume in the Brahmaputra river.

All experts in Government or otherwise agree on this aspect. The Master Plan of Brahmaputra river finalized in 1986 by Brahmaputra Board strongly recommends for construction of large storage reservoirs in some of the major tributaries including on the Siang (the main stem of the Brahmaputra) for the reduction of flood volume. In fact, this is the most successful and preferred method of flood mitigation across the world.

For this reason, studies and investigations towards the construction of such reservoirs were taken up by the Government around 1975. Based on exhaustive investigations, the Detailed Project Reports (DPR) of storage projects on Siang and Subansiri – the two largest contributors of Brahmaputra were prepared initially in 1983-84 by Central Government through the Brahmaputra Board. Flood storage provided in these 2 projects were estimated at 8500 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and 2700 BCM respectively.

As per the recommendations of the Brahmaputra Master Plan, investigations on other major tributaries for DPR preparation of Reservoir Projects were taken up from 1983-84 onwards with an aim to create more storage reservoirs. It may be mentioned here that such reservoir projects were not found viable on economic consideration of flood benefits alone as such benefits were mostly intangible. However, it was realized that along with flood mitigation, these storage projects would generate a huge amount of electricity at a very competitive price which made these projects techno-economically attractive.

As per the study carried out in the Master Plan of Brahmaputra, the lowering of flood levels estimated due to these projects would be substantial. The Siang project alone would reduce the flood height of the Brahmaputra by 1.41m at Dibrugarh and 1.15 m at Guwahati. Similarly, reduction of flood level by four dams (Siang, Subansiri, Lohit, and Burhi-Dehing) at Pandu would be 1.63m. These figures are for a very large and rare flood that is likely to occur once in a 100 years period. Therefore, the reductions in flood height would be much better for a flood of lesser magnitude.

What do these reductions in flood level mean in terms of relief? The Brahmaputra valley is very flat and even a 30 cm reduction in flood height may stop water spread by a km in many locations. Thus, the relief would be huge for a reduction of 1m or above in flood level. However, for various reasons, none of these projects investigated by the Government has been taken up so far for execution as planned initially.

Later developments- Moderation of flood through Storage reservoirs:

The initially planned mega storage project on the Siang river at Rotung was ruled out later in view of strong objections by host state due to the expected submergence of important towns of Along, Pangin, Kambang, Yingkiong, etc besides a number of villages. Similarly, the planned storage project on the Subansiririver at Gerukamukh was also ruled out due to objections for the expected submergence of Daporizo town, Tamen town, and several villages.

A Run of River scheme is under active consideration on the Siang at downstream of Rotung whereas a Run of River scheme is already under implementation on the Subansiri river at Gerukamukh itself. All rivers/Projects of significance in terms of storage for mitigation of floods in Brahmaputra valley were gradually handed over to private developers as per the decision of Central Government and concerned State Governments. Unfortunately, almost all these projects have been planned and DPR prepared keeping the generation of power as the main objective and as run of the river schemes. A run of the river scheme has no flood moderation aspect. Rather, it distorts downstream flow adversely if used as a peaking power plant.

Many people would like to argue that a series of lower height dams may deliver similar benefits. In this regard, it may be mentioned that a number of dams in a river in a cascade may result in the generation of electricity close to the generation of an alternative single large dam but total storage put together would be only a small fraction of a single large reservoir. Therefore, the benefits of flood moderation originally anticipated from these storage projects would not be forthcoming if developed in the manner they are being planned now.

Moderation of flood through Storage reservoirs – options left

The Siang river contributes 33% of flow at Pandu and is critical to flood control in the Brahmaputra basin. Although the original storage site in the Siang river has been ruled out due to objections of the state concerned and no alternative sites have similar storages, there is still scope for a reservoir of substantial volume on the Siang river in the upstream of Boleng town.

A reservoir at this site has the potential to moderate floods in the valley. Similarly, there are also possibilities to create reservoirs with good storages in the upper region of the Subansiri and Kamala River (a major tributary of Subansiri) to offset the loss of storage in the present run of the river proposal under implementation at Gerukamukh as compared to the original reservoir proposal. There is a need to review the project proposals of Lohit, Dibang and Jia-Bhoreli rivers for increasing storage capacity in these major tributaries of Brahmaputra.

The projects in these rivers are either already framed or are in the process of framing by private developers, mostly as Run of the River schemes which will have little or no bearing on flood control. The creation of storage reservoirs with flood cushions in the remaining lesser tributaries of the Brahmaputra will also moderate flood in the flood plains of these tributaries in the valley and improve the overall flood situation. Further, the integration of reservoir operations of all present and future reservoir projects in tributaries will also result in better management of floods in the Brahmaputra valley.

From the experience of the Ranganadi project, inter-basin transfer of water for generation of power in a run of the river scheme, especially in Himalayan rivers, has been found to have far-reaching disastrous impacts. In such projects, most of the floodwater and silt is released to the original river whereas clean water during most periods of the year is diverted for the generation of hydropower.

Therefore, bedload propagation is deprived in the original river during the long silt free period of flow. It may be mentioned that bedload propagation is high in a river during its silt free period which makes the river bed deeper. The absence of silt-free flow causes a rapid rise of the river bed, decreases channel capacity and causes floods in the countryside as has happened in Ranganadi. Thus, this kind of projects are to be discouraged at the proposal stage itself as hydropower at the cost of people’s misery is not desirable.

From this discussion, it can be concluded that the most potent weapon for mitigation of flood in Brahmaputra valley remains totally unutilized today for various reasons. For this to happen, a strong political will along with a highly attractive ‘Relief and Rehabilitation Plan’ and alternative livelihood to project affected people with an emphasis on conservation of their cultural and political identity are needed in tandem.

However, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sought the approval for raising the height of its platform by 3.5 feet to protect the machines from getting damaged due to flooding in monsoon The DGCA is sitting on the file for the past many months and the AAI is still awaiting its nod.Airport director, Sanjay Kumar Panigrahi said, “If heavy rains continue in the city for four to five days at a stretch, we fear that the ILS system would get submerged in flood waters .

The UK is set to become the first major economy to commit to completely avoiding emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry or offsetting them by planting trees and sucking carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere.

The amendment to the Climate Change Act has been widely welcomed as a significant milestone.

However, some environmental groups are concerned that even this pledge does not go far enough and they have raised concerns about the UK using international carbon credits to shift the burden of carbon cutting to other nations.

Craig Bennett, UK chief executive of Friends of the Earth, warned it was “still too slow to address catastrophic climate change”.

He said the next prime minister must put carbon-cutting “at the centre of policy-making and pull the plug on plans for more roads, runways and fracking”.

Legislating for international carbon credits means the UK could pay for other countries to cut their carbon instead of reducing domestic emissions. Critics said this showed the government is not taking the issue seriously enough and could mean it shirks environmental obligations.

“It is disappointing that the government has ignored its climate advisers’ recommendation to exclude carbon offsets,"" Mr Bennett said.

He added: ""Having declared a climate emergency, parliament must act to close these loopholes.”

Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, also said it was a “big moment” for the climate, but added there were “questions to be asked about (the) offsetting loophole”, which has a history of failure.

“As the birthplace of the industrial revolution, it is right that the UK is the world’s first major economy to commit to completely end its contribution to climate change, but trying to shift the burden to developing nations through International Carbon Credits undermines that commitment,” he said.

✕ Greta Thunberg says climate change message is 'clearly not getting through' in speech to MPs

Professor Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London (UCL), said Britain should adopt a 2030 zero carbon target. He said that if there was any chance of keeping the planet from warming more than 2C, the whole world must hit zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“Britain is one of the leading countries in the fight against climate change and we must adopt a 2030 zero carbon target,"" he said. ""This will give us 10 years to put in place win-win solutions that reduce carbon emissions, save money and make Britain a better, cleaner place to live.""

Climate change activists Extinction Rebellion, who staged demonstrations in a number of British cities earlier this year, blocking parts of central London for days, were most scathing about the 2050 target, describing it as a “death sentence”.

Number 10 said the move would boost public health, air quality and nature and will make the UK a leader on climate action. But it said it was “imperative” other countries follow suit.

The government will review the pledge within five years to ensure other nations are taking similarly ambitious action and that British industries are not facing unfair competition.

Lord Deben, chairman of the government’s advisory Committee on Climate Change, praised the “major commitment” and said he was looking forward to cross-party consensus on the issue.

“This step will send a strong signal to other countries to follow suit – and will help to drive the global effort to tackle climate change required by the Paris Agreement,” he said.

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said UK companies were “squarely behind” the commitment and called it the “right response to the global climate crisis”.

But she urged the government to ensure the legislation was followed by long-term policies to support decarbonisation across the economy.

Hitting net zero – a 100 per cent cut in emissions – will mean an end to heating of homes with traditional gas boilers, more green electricity, and a switch from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles, walking and cycling.

Any remaining pollution in 2050 from areas including aviation will need to be “offset” through measures to cut carbon such as planting trees.

Environment analyst Tom Burke said there was “quite a gap” emerging between announcements on climate change and the implementation of policies.

“The reality is it’s what you do, not what you say, that matters,"" he told BBC Breakfast. “There’s been quite a gap, in a way, emerging recently between what the government has said it wants to do on climate change and the fact that the policies aren’t in place to deliver on the existing budgets, let alone the carbon budgets we’ll need if we’re to meet this new commitment.”

Shadow energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey raised concerns over how the commitment would be put into practice.

“While this announcement is welcome in theory, in practice it comes from a Conservative government that is off track to meet existing climate targets, that has no plans for legislation or investment needed to cut emissions, and that has dismantled the UK renewable energy sector while pushing fracking,” she said.

This was recalled by Ogong Yirang, a survivor of Siang River flood of June 11, 2000 which had shook the entire Siang and Brahmaputra valley and had affected entire topography of the region.

Ogong Yirang, now around 53 years, was a lower divisional clerk under PHE & WS Division, Pasighat then who along with his friend and uncle late Tarin Tabing, driver of Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) had went for fishing to an island of Siang River in the early morning of June 11 in the year of 2000, some 19 years ago.

After crossing Siang River from Komlighat in a country boat to the island across present Komlighat (the then ferry ghat) located in between Pasighat and Mebo circle, Yirang recalls that, both Ogong Yirang and late Taring Tabing were fishing.

Yirang recalls that, it was a sunny day and both of them used country made small boat to reach that Island. They had also observed that water level of Siang River was normal like ever before and the island across Komlighat where they reached was an ideal place for fishing.

As per verbal recounting of the entire story on this day after passing of 19 years after the incident, Yirang narrates that, they reached at island around 7:30 am and started fishing towards the Mebo side. While fishing they suddenly felt that the water level rose rapidly upto their thigh height. Even though they didn’t take it seriously and went on fishing.

After some time around half an hour later both of them were shocked to see the water level of Pasighat side over flooded and it was by then appeared unnatural flow of river which they hadn’t seen it before.

Then they felt that the danger is approaching to them and they tried to find out some safety place. They couldn’t find any place but only the high tension electrical tower which were located in the middle of that island.

Both of them climbed on that electric pole out of sudden shock and grief. As the water level rose more they also climbed up and up.

When they realized that they were near to the peak point of the pole then they realized that it was an electric power supply cable and they could be electrocuted. Feeling nervous and shocked seeing the never seen before kind of massive flood, they couldn’t think and decide where to go, but after deciding for some time they thought whatever may be, they should climbed up hoping there were not electric current on the high tension wire and so they caught the cable to save themselves (fortunately there were no current on the wire as the Hydel of Yembung was also destroyed by the initial flood that morning).

The people of both sides of riverbanks (especially Komlighat in Pasighat side) witnessed all these incidents. Witnessing the situation under distress, eight SOS messages were also sent to the Chief Secretary through East Siang Dy. Commissioner. But unfortunately, the Swearing-in-ceremony of Rtd. Lt. Gen. S.K Sinha was going on as a Governor of Arunachal Pradesh. So the rescue helicopter could not reach Pasighat on time.

The entire tragic incidents were going on for more than two hours and the people from Komlighat witnessed them while they were fighting for their survivals were a big timber log hit their tower and as a result both of them were washed away in the flow of flood current.

As per story narration of Ogong Yirang, they had talked for last while felling down in the river flood after high tension electric pole was hit down by a huge log floating along the river. They shared last view and chatted for a while if any one of them had ever saw such incident even in their dream, but none of them saw such and both shouted each other to hold tight of the electric pole.

But then as luck would have it, a huge timber log hit their cable and both of them were washed away and there Yirang saw late Taring Tabing for last time that his hand flapped for some time and he was drawn in the flood water. However, Yirang kept on struggling for survival in waves and tides. His constant struggle and presence of mind helps him to save his life. Some of his narration about how he struggled from death qwas noted by me and as follows.

Floating on floodwater, he saw a small piece of wood/log flowing just besides him, he quickly jumped over it and there he went on floating in a very danger point from where River Siang get diversion into two big tributaries. With full strength he rowed with the hands to divert the log in a proper direction so that he may be saved.

While floating he saw from distant an island, gathering some courage he again used his last strength by using his both hands to row some how to reach that island and he managed to reach the island.

All these struggled took place for the whole day and Yirang felt deadly tired and wanted shelter for the night then he looked around and his eyes struck upon a big tree. He climbed up and spent for one nights and a day.

Hours after, he heard a sound of helicopter then he quickly climbed to the peak of the tree and took off his shirt and swung and waved. He also shouted for many times that I am alive, rescue me (Bachao). But the helicopter flew off without noticing him and he thought, may be because of the colour of his shirt they couldn’t notice him. So, he stayed back there in the tree till evening.","Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasighat-flood.jpg,"['flood', 'water', 'saw', '11', 'death', 'arunachal', 'yirang', 'island', 'pasighat', 'river', 'siang', 'komlighat', '2000', 'tale', 'electric', 'escape']", 
27,27,FL-2019-000079-BGD,The forgotten generation: The elderly are most at risk of suffering from climate change - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/elderly-climate-change-death-risk-a8938716.html,"When it comes to discussing climate change, older people may have one advantage: they watched it happen.

In the nine northeastern states of the US, for instance, where average winter temperatures climbed 3.8F between 1970 and 2000, they have seen fewer snow-covered days and more shrubs flowering ever earlier.

And they have experienced hotter summers. In New York City, daily summer temperatures at LaGuardia Airport have risen 0.7F per decade since 1970, according to the city’s Panel on Climate Change.

Older Americans are also significant contributors to climate change. A recent study has found that residential energy consumption rises as age increases.

Recommended British billionaire attacks governments for failing to tackle climate

Buildings, and residential buildings in particular, are the world’s largest energy consumers. Two researchers recently analysed US government data on household energy usage that was gathered from 1987 to 2009, involving nearly 30,000 owner-occupied units. Distinct patterns emerged by age.

Usage was lowest among young adults, who typically occupy smaller households, says Hossein Estiri, a computational demographer at Harvard Medical School and an author on the paper.

Consumption rose rapidly among those aged 30 to 54 – “the peak of having kids and larger houses”, he notes – then stabilised when people reached their sixties. But “after 70, it goes up and it keeps going up”, Estiri says.

The trend persisted when the researchers controlled for income and housing types, but it varied by geography. When the researchers looked at climate, they found that “energy consumption in warmer regions becomes really elevated for the older group”.

But in a world that is both warming and greying, older adults suffer disproportionately from climate change

Why do older people use more juice? The study could not provide explanations, but air-conditioning might be a cause, Estiri speculates, and older people may not be able to maintain the energy efficiency of their homes as well as younger people. Estiri adds: “Maybe their appliances are old and less efficient. All of these could contribute.”

The climate change story has plenty of villains; the elderly are hardly wrecking the environment on their own. Still, the demographic trends do not bode well.

“There will be more warm days in most areas because of climate change,” Estiri says. “There will be more energy use by the older group. And because of the population ageing, there will be more people in that age group. These trends will amplify each other.”

But in a world that is both warming and greying, older adults suffer disproportionately from climate change.

Consider extreme heat. “It puts a stress on anybody’s body, but if you’re old and frail, it’s harder,” says Patrick Kinney, who studies the effects of climate on health at the Boston University School of Public Health. In addition, he says, “certain medications older people take, for blood pressure or cholesterol, reduce the body’s ability to thermo-regulate.”

The risk of heatstroke, which is potentially fatal, increases because older adults may be less mobile and thus less able to reach cooler locations in a heatwave. They may also be socially isolated and less able to seek help.

Impaired cognitive function may also make it harder for the elderly to find solutions, Kinney says. The air pollution often associated with heatwaves intensifies the problems. The Chicago heatwave of July 1995, for instance, caused 514 heat-related deaths; those older than 65 accounted for 72 per cent of the fatalities.

Humans can adapt to these extremes, of course. Kinney and his colleagues found that the risk of dying from heat in New York City declined 65 per cent from the early 1970s to 2006 as the proportion of households with air conditioning surged. But air conditioners also contribute to climate change.

Any particular episode of extreme weather may be linked only loosely to climate change. But the overall relationship is clear: aside from heatwaves, climate change will bring other kinds of extreme weather and disasters. Elderly people will be disproportionately affected.

“The mortality is always higher among older people,” says Lisa Brown, director of the Risk and Resilience Research Lab at Palo Alto University. “They can’t get out of harm’s way fast enough.”

Nearly half of the individuals who died during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were 75 or older. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, almost half of those who died were over 65.

Hurricane Katrina caused the deaths of nearly 2,000 people and created $125bn worth of damage (Getty)

Blackouts have proved particularly dangerous. Older people may become unable to use power scooters and wheelchairs, refrigerate medications or summon help. After Sandy, many were trapped in high-rise apartments without functioning elevators.

An unhealthy 75-year-old in a care facility may fare better than a healthy 75-year-old living on her own, Brown points out. The facility most likely has a generator and stockpiles of food and water; few individuals do.

But in California, Pacific Gas and Electric recently announced that it would consider turning off transmission lines when deemed necessary to prevent wildfires.

“If the power goes off for three or four days, people here are not prepared,” Brown says. She thinks older people – indeed, all people – should always have enough food and water to last five to seven days and a plan to evacuate or seek help in emergencies.

Perhaps older Americans, as disproportionate contributors to and victims of climate change, could play an additional role, as active participants in the global campaign to mitigate the damage.

A decade ago, Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist at Cornell University, began exploring environmental volunteerism among older adults. He found that most environmental organisations had not recruited older members or adapted to support their participation, leaving a major resource untapped. He established a programme called Rise, for Retirees in Service to the Environment, to prepare older volunteers for leadership roles in environmental stewardship.

There’s a common notion that older adults care less about climate change than young adults. But that holds true only for Republicans, a Pew Research Centre survey found last year, and may be less a result of age than of political affiliation.

Millennial and Gen X Republicans were more likely than boomers to say that they saw the effects of climate change and that the US government was doing too little to reduce it. But among Democrats, who were far more concerned about climate change and energy policy than Republicans were, the pollsters found only modest differences by age.

Older volunteers would benefit by working to halt climate change, Pillemer says: “Participants gain fulfilment from activities that have results they will not be here to enjoy.”

Later-in-life or “generative” volunteerism has been shown to improve health and psychological wellbeing.

“If the boomers could be motivated to take this on as their defining generational legacy, they could have incredible impact,” Pillemer says. “With their huge numbers, they could potentially do something about it.”

Bangladesh has been ranked 101th out of 163 countries with a global score of 2.128. Last year, its position was 93 with a score of 2.084.

According to the report, China, Bangladesh, and India score in the bottom half of the GPI and have significant exposure to climate hazards, with 393 million people in high climate hazard areas.

A total of USD 22,297.4 million was the cost of violence in Bangladesh last year while it is 3 per cent of the GDP, the report said.

Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Austria, Portugal, and Denmark.

India has been ranked 141th while Pakistan 153rd and Afghanistan 163rd.

The 13th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI) measured the peacefulness of 163 independent states and territories.

The GPI covers 99.7 per cent of the world’s population, using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace using three thematic domains: the level of Societal Safety and Security; the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict; and the degree of Militarisation.

According to the latest report, global peacefulness improved very slightly in the 2019 GPI with the average country score improved by 0.09 per cent.

It said peacefulness improved in 86 countries while deteriorates in 76 countries.

Bhutan has recorded the largest improvement of any country in the top 20, rising 43 places in the last 12 years.

Afghanistan is now the least peaceful country in the world, replacing Syria, which is now the second least peaceful. South Sudan, Yemen, and Iraq comprise the remaining five least peaceful countries.

Climate change can indirectly increase the likelihood of violent conflict through its impacts on resource availability, livelihood, security and migration, the report said.

The report said in Dhaka’s slums, 81 per cent of migrants cited a climate-related cause as the main reason for their move. High levels of resource scarcity and strained public resources contributed to violence in these slums, with climate refugees intensifying already present social stress.

“Future rises in sea levels are projected to affect around 18 million people in Bangladesh and result in a 16 per cent loss of land, displacing many coastal citizens and putting the country under high migration pressure.”","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/gpi-web.jpg?itok=M6iM1L5-,"['countries', 'bangladesh', 'country', 'peaceful', 'gpi', 'score', 'report', 'global', 'cent', 'world', 'peace']",

Bangladesh On A Pathway To Prosperity

Time is Ours, Time for Bangladesh

Madam Speaker

01. I seek your kind permission to place before this august House the proposed budget for FY 2019-20 and the supplementary budget for FY 2018-19.

Chapter I

Madam Speaker

02. Bangladesh is now well poised to celebrate the golden jubilee of our glorious independence and the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which is a rare occasion in our national history. We are committed to the nation to realize fully the Vision 2021 and implement the agenda for 2030 for building a happy and prosperous future for the nation, and thus materialize the Father of the Nation’s cherished dream of establishing Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal), which is the fundamental premise of our current election manifesto too.

Madam Speaker

03. First of all, I pay my profound tribute and deepest gratitude to the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the man with colourful political personality, the possessor of a magical voice, the greatest Bengalee of all times and the architect of independent Bangladesh; I remember with profound respect all the martyrs of the fateful night of August 1975. I also pay tribute to the four most competent comrades of the Father of the Nation who were killed in jail, thirty lakh martyrs in the war of liberation, all the valiant freedom fighters and two lakh women who were brutally persecuted during the war. I pray to the Almighty Allah for the salvation of their souls.

Madam Speaker

04. At this auspicious moment for the nation, on behalf of our people, I would like to humbly dedicate, through you, the proposed national budget for FY2019-20 to the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and to those who stood by him in response to his clarion call for independence.

Madam Speaker

05. I feel myself proud and most fortunate for getting the opportunity to present this budget for the first time before the august House. I express my profound gratitude to the Almighty Allah. I again pay my tribute to the Father of the Nation who imbued with the national consciousness embedded in him the vision of a prosperous Bangladesh. I would not have got the opportunity to present today’s budget before this august House had he not freed our beloved motherland. Alongside, I convey my gratitude to our beloved leader Jananetri Sheikh Hasina, the worthy successor of the Father of the Nation, the most successful and widely acclaimed statesman in the country after the Father of the Nation. Had she not reposed trust on me and given me the portfolio of the Finance Ministry, I would have never got this rare opportunity to present the national budget for FY 2019-20 before this august House. And, my life would have remained unfulfilled.

06. Hon’ble Prime Minister, for you, I have a lot of respect, a lot of gratitude. May the Almighty Allah bless you. May your life dedicated to the cause of our people be strewn with many successes.

Hon’ble Prime Minister, I am committed to repay all my debt to you and to the Father of the Nation, by working for our beloved motherland with full dedication.

Madam Speaker

07. I would like to inform the countrymen that the proposed national budget for FY2019-20 has been structured around the spectacular achievements of our government during the last 10 years, which surpass even the fairy tales. While recounting all these successes achieved under the leadership of our successful Prime Minister is a huge task; I would like to highlight some of the major successes before the nation, especially to the young generation through this august House.

08. You are aware that all our successes during the last 10 years did not begin only in 2008; rather the seeds of development of the country were sown in 1972 under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After the glorious liberation war, the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu took up the task of transforming this war-ravaged country into the ‘Golden Bengal’. Unfortunately the anti-liberation forces temporarily halted that effort in 1975 by killing Bangabandhu, his family, and the jailed four national leaders in the worst killing spree in the history of Bangladesh.

09. Jananetri Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of the Father of the Nation, came back to her own people on 17th May 1981 spending long six years in exile with endless miseries after 1975. The people of the country became leaderless after the brutal murder of Bangabandhu. Her return from exile was, therefore, a great source of jubilation for the people. Indeed, this was a great boon for the nation.

10. Following a series of struggles for long 15 years, Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took up the task of revitalizing the nation after winning the National Elections in 1996.

Madam Speaker

11. Under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister the country witnessed many revolutionary changes during the period from 1996 to 2001. The economy was also growing during this time. Inflation went down to 1.9 percent, the lowest in the history of Bangladesh, GDP growth rose to 5 percent, and power generation increased from 1,600 to 4,300 megawatts. Incentive system was introduced for farmers for the first time in the history of the country. The country achieved self-sufficiency in food by raising foodgrains production to 2 crore 68 lakh metric tons.

Community clinics were established throughout the country in nrural area to provide healthcare to the doorsteps of the people, telephone service was made cheap and easily available for the people. Unfortunately, the people could not enjoy uninterrupted delivery of these basic services.

Progress in Bangladesh was again halted in 2002.

12. After Jananetri Sheikh Hasina’s assumption of office following the 2008 elections, Bangladesh again began to rise from the ashes like the phoenix bird in Greek mythology. The whole world was then reeling with the 2009 recession. Even the developed world lost an average of one-fourth of employment, the capital market and their economies were in total disarray. Bearing in mind the daunting challenge of global meltdown, Hon’ble Prime Minister declared the charter for change - ‘Vision 2021’, wherein she set a number of ambitious targets. These include, among others, cent percent boys and girls will go to school by 2021. Electricity will be available for every household in the country. Healthcare will be taken to the reach of all people. Poverty will be reduced to a great extent. Bangladesh will be made digital, and will be elevated to the status of a Middle Income Country.

Madam Speaker

13. Hon’ble Prime Minister has fulfilled her pledges to the nation. Almost cent percent boys and girls in the country go to school, the rate of drop-outs has also reduced. Electricity has reached almost every household long before 2021. Community clinics have been established across the country. The poverty line has dropped from 40 percent in 2005 to 21 percent. Extreme poverty dropped from 25 percent to 11 percent. Inflation has been kept at a tolerable level despite the sustained high growth rates in our economy. We have been able to attract the attention of the world community by achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) surpassing the performance of other countries. We have elevated ourself from the status of a poor, least developed country to that of a lower middle income country. We share the glory of achieving the same level of development with countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

Madam Speaker

14. I would like to inform the fellow countrymen about the outstanding achievements of our government during the last ten years in some basic areas of macroeconomic management by comparing our achievements with that of the previous government, achieved during their tenure in FY 2005-06.

15. Please allow me to present first the performance of our import-export trade: Our imports in FY2005-06 was US$ 14.7 billion, which has risen now to US$ 58.9 billion. Our exports in FY2005-06 was US$ 10.5 billion, which grew 3.0 times to reach US$ 37 billion in FY2017-18.

16. Remittance receipts: Our remittance receipts in FY 2005-06 was US$ 4.9 billion, which grew 3 times to reach US$ 15 billion in 2018.

17. Foreign exchange reserve: Foreign exchange reserve stood at US$ 3.5 billion in FY2005-06, which by now grew 9 times to reach US$ 33 billion.

18. Investment: Investment is one of the determinants of economic growth. In FY2005-06, our investment was 26 percent of GDP. In FY2018-19, it rose to 31.5 percent of the GDP. Private sector investment grew from US$ 14.8 billion to US$ 70.8 billion.

19. Debt-GDP ratio: The debt to GDP ratio was 44 percent in FY2005-06, which has declined to 32 percent, which is a proof of the strength of our economy and our self-dependence.

20. Health sector: The health sector has also witnessed remarkable progress. Infant mortality (per 1,000 live births) has gone down from 45 to 24. The number of medical colleges has increased from 46 to 111. Life expectancy at birth was 65 years in 2006, which is currently 72.8 years. In almost all the indicators in the social sector, Bangladesh has fared much better than other South Asian countries.

21. Education sector: The literacy rate was 53.7 percent in 2006, which is currently 72.9 percent. Cent percent enrollment in primary education has been achieved. The drop-out rate has gone down from 50 percent to 18 percent. The rate of people receiving technical education was 2 percent, which has now risen to 17 percent. The number of universities has increased from 80 to 148. Our achievements in the social sector are presented in Table 1 of Annexure A.

22. Power sector: The power generation capacity was 4,385 megawatts in 2005, which has now increased to 21,629 megawatts. When we began our journey in 2009, the amount of power in the national grid was 3,200 megawatts, against which the generation today is 12,893 megawatts. The share of the population enjoying electricity connection was 47 percent, which has now gone up to 93 percent. Gas supply was 1,443 million cubic feet, which has now increased to 2,746 million cubic feet per day..

23. Digital Bangladesh: 5,000 digital centers have been established in all the unions and municipal areas in the country. About 23,500 km optical fibre cable was installed throughout the country. The number of internet users has crossed 9 crore. Tele-density has crossed 93 percent. Twenty eight High Tech Parks are being established in the country. Bangladesh became the 57th satellite member country last year by launching its first satellite Bangabandhu Satellite-1 successfully into the space. This achievement has taken Bangladesh to a newer height in the global arena.

24. National revenue: National revenue earning in FY2005-06 was Tk. 42,000 crore, which has increased to Tk. 3,16,000 crore. Revenue has seen seven times growth.

25. Growth in GDP: The size of our GDP was US$ 72 billion in FY2005-06, which has now increased 4.5 times to US$ 302.4 billion.

26. Per Capita Income: Per capita income in Bangladesh in FY2005-06 was around US$ 543, which has grown 3.5 times and now stands at US$ 1,909. Our achievements in the economic sector in the last 10 years are provided in Table 2 of Annexure A.

Madam Speaker, Hollis B. Chenary, an American Professor of Economics, commented in 1973 that Bangladesh’s per capita income will take 125 years to reach US$ 900. But we did not take 125 years. It reached US$ 928 in 2011; that is, in only 40 years of independence. And it has become double in the next 8 years to reach US$ 1,909 by 2019.

According to a recent estimate by the World Bank, in terms of growth in per capita income, Bangladesh remained among the top countries in the world during the last five years.

27. Size and volume of the budget: The size of our budget in FY2005-06 was Tk. 64,000 crore, and the size of the proposed budget for FY2019-20 is Tk. 5,23,190 crore, which is eight times higher than that in FY2005-06.

Madam Speaker

28. Bangladesh played the role of a trailblazer in many respects. Once we were used as an example to explain the differences and gaps between a developed country and the poorest country. We used to be labelled as a backward country with abject poverty frequented by floods, cyclone and other natural calamities. By the grace of the Almighty Allah, Madam Speaker, we have turned around. According to the latest GDP ranking based on PPP published by the IMF, Bangladesh is now the 30th largest economies in the world. In South Asia, Bangladesh is now the second largest economy after India. Even the World Bank agrees, the way a small country with a large population of 16 crore and within a limited span of time has spearheaded development is now a wonder to the people of the world. Ban Ki Moon, ex-Secretary General of the United Nations, commented, “Bangladesh can, Bangladesh is a Role Model in the area of economics”. Kaushik Basu, ex-Chief Economist of the World Bank, said, “Today’s Bangladesh is wholly a tale of success”. Jim Yong Kim, ex-President of the World Bank, said, “The progress in Bangladesh is exemplary for the entire world”. Asian Development Bank observed, “Bangladesh is an example for other Asian countries”.

29. Implementation of verdicts of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu murder case, and the cases on war crimes and crimes against humanity signaled the end of the long-prevailing culture of impunities; the nation has become free from the liability. Bangladesh’s visible success in tackling militancy has been praised internationally.

Madam Speaker

30. After working tirelessly for the last 10 years, Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, garnering the support of the people of all strata, has brought Bangladesh to this level. We are now enjoying a respectable position in the world arena only due to her dynamic, intelligent and effective leadership. The United Nations, it’s different organizations and various international organizations have conferred Hon’ble Prime Minister with prestigious awards for her commendable role in economic and social development.

31. Madam Speaker, in one word, Bangladesh is known today to the whole world by the Prime Minister’s name. She is now a world leader. A survey conducted by Fortune, the magazine of the Time Corporation in the United States, has placed Hon’ble Prime Minister among the top ten world leaders. Time, the New York-based famous weekly, has included our Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in its 2018 list of 100 most influential world leaders, along with US President Donald Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Hon’ble Prime Minister, we the countrymen are grateful to you for taking Bangladesh to such a great height.

Chapter II

The Supplementary Budget

Madam Speaker

32. At this stage, I am going to present the Supplementary Budget for the current FY2018-19 and the proposed Budget Framework of the FY 2019-20.

The Supplementary Budget for the current FY2018-19

33. The targets for revenue earning and expenditure of the current fiscal year 2018-19 was determined on the assumption that there will be impending reforms in the structure of manpower and work procedures in the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and the nation’s economy will continue to grow. The amount of revenue collected upto March, 2019 of the current fiscal year was 54.90 percent of the original annual target. At the same time, government expenditure was 44.40 percent of the annual allocation. A brief description of amendments and adjustments made in the budget of FY 2018-19 has been shown in Table 3 of Annexure A.

34. Revised Revenue Income: The target of revenue collection for FY 2018-19 was set at Tk. 3,39,280 crore. After reviewing the revenue collection in July-March of the current fiscal year, the target was reduced by Tk. 22,668 crore, and re-fixed at Tk. 3,16,612 crore.

35. Revised Expenditure: The total government expenditure in the current fiscal year was estimated at Tk. 4,64,573 crore. In the revised budget, the expenditure was reduced by Tk 22,032 crore, and re-fixed at Tk 4,42,541 crore. The size of the annual development program has been reduced by 6,000 crore taka, from the original allocation of Tk. 1,73,000 crore, and set at Tk. 1,67,000 crore. On the other hand, the estimation of other expenditures, including operating expenditure, was reduced by Tk. 16,032 crore.

36. Revised Budget Deficit and its Financing: The budget deficit for the current fiscal year was estimated at Tk. 1,25,293 crore. However, the deficit in the revised budget has been set at Tk.1,25,929 crore, which is 5.0 percent of GDP. Against the original budget deficit, the estimation for external financing was Tk. 54,067 crore, which has been reduced to Tk. 47,184 crore in the revised budget. From domestic sources, the revised estimation of financing from savings instruments and other sources is Tk. 47,850 crore.



Chapter III

Proposed Budget Structure of FY 2019-20

Madam Speaker

37. The budget of FY2019-20 is for all citizens of Bangladesh. No area is left out, neither the Hill Tracts nor the plain lands; neither from north-south nor from east-west. This budget has been prepared keeping in mind the need of farmers, blacksmiths, potters, fishermen, businessmen, bedes, various tribes, third genders, teachers, doctors, engineers and all professionals. Sufficient allocation has been made to satisfy the needs of all Ministries or Divisions.

Madam Speaker

38. I will now present an estimate of the proposed income and expenditure of the next fiscal year 2019-20, which has been presented in details in the Table-4 of Annexure-A.

39. I will first speak on our national revenue and annual probable income receipts. The basic principle of tax revenue collection by our government is boosting revenue mobilization not by increasing the tax rate but by widening the tax net and coverage. To do that, we will establish revenue offices in every Upazilas and Growth Centers in the country. These will have necessary manpower and other logistics to facilitate revenue collection. I would like to inform the august House that we have not included any component in the budget of FY2019-20 that may cause a price spiral for essential commodities.

40. There is a slur on our revenue performance that the ratio of our national revenue collection to GDP is lower than that of other countries. From now on, we are determined to raise the ratio from its current 10 percent to 14 percent in next two years.

41. A culture has been established in our revenue domain for a long time; that is, those who pay taxes to the government, only continue to do so every year. Others, despite having taxable income, continue to evade payment of taxes. We also want to get out of this bad culture. All eligible taxpayers will be brought under the tax net.

Madam Speaker

42. There are 4 crore people in our country who are included in the middle income group. However, the number of taxpayers is only 21-22 lakh. We will take the number to one crore at the earliest possible time InshaAllah. And as part of the ongoing process, efforts to bring the rest of the citizens under the tax net will continue.

43. I observe from long experience that our citizens are willing to pay tax, but we fail to collect it for various reasons. Inshallah we will now pay a special attention to that.

Madam Speaker

44. You will be happy to know that we are going to implement our long-awaited Value Added Tax Act, 2012 from the coming fiscal year (2019-20). To ensure effective implementation of this Act, we will provide all types of logistical support including necessary manpower. Further, a Joint Working Group will be constituted comprising officials from the government and the private sector, which will oversee the implementation of the law.

Madam Speaker

45. In this budget, we are proposing massive reforms in the revenue administration. All tax laws (income tax, VAT and customs) will be formulated in a simplified and transparent manner so that these are easily comprehensible to all.

46. The policy decision of our government is that we are against imposing tax as a burden on taxpayers in any way. Our policy in tax collection will somewhat follow a statement by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the Finance Minister in the court of King Louis (XIV) of France:

“The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest [number] of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.”

47. We will gradually transform all types of tax rates into fully business-friendly ones. We believe we will be able to take our tax revenue collection to the optimum level when we will be able to prevent all types of mismanagement, corruption and misuse in the tax revenue management. For that purpose, the revenue management will be fully automated. We will also ensure transparency in bonded warehouse management and stop any clearance of goods through mis-declaration.

48. Therefore, we are taking measures so that all the imported and exported goods must go through scanning machines. We will also thoroughly examine whether goods are imported through over-invoicing or under-invoicing. For this purpose, a Special Wing will be established. Special efforts will be made to enhance the efficiency and skills of the employees at the NBR. With all these measures, our revenue collection will be enhanced and money laundering or similar activities, of which we hear often times, will be stopped. Consignments intercepted due to offenses of overinvoicing or underinvoicing will be confiscated and punishments will be meted out to the wrongdoers. To effectively implement these measures, necessary legal reforms will be made.

49. Tax exemptions to different sectors will be avoided as much as possible. We will also avoid issuing SROs unless there is an emergency. This will bring transparency in revenue management, and enhance confidence among businessmen about the government.

50. Depending on these planned tax management steps, total revenue collection has been estimated to be Tk. 3,77,810 crore in the FY2019-20. Out of this, Tk. 3,25,660 crore will be collected through the National Board of Revenue. Tax revenue from non-NBR sources have been estimated at Tk. 14,500 crore. Besides, non-tax revenue is estimated at Tk. 37,710 crore.

Madam Speaker

51. In the FY2019-20, the size of the budget of the total expenditure is estimated to be Tk. 5,23,190 crore, which is 18.1 percent of GDP. Total allocation for operating and other expenditures is Tk. 3,20,469 crore, and allocation for the annual development program is Tk. 2,02,721 crore.

52. Regional parity, human resource development, infrastructural development and quality of expenditure have been given priority in the allocation for the annual development program. The allocation of the annual development program for the coming FY is presented in Table 5 of Annexure A. I propose to allocate, from the annual development programme, 27.4 percent for human resource (education, health and related others), 21.5 percent for the overall agriculture sector (agriculture, rural development, water resources, and related others), 13.8 percent for power and energy sector, 26 percent for communication (roads, rails, bridges, and related other communications), and 11.3 percent for other sectors.

53. The overall budget deficit will be Tk. 1,45,380 crore, which is 5.0 percent of GDP. It is to be noted that we had the same ratio last year. In financing the deficit, Tk. 68,016 crore will come from external sources and Tk. 77,363 crore from domestic sources. Amongst the financing from domestic sources, Tk. 47,364 crore will come from the banking system and Tk. 30,000 crore from savings certificates and other non-bank sources.

Madam Speaker

54. Overall expenditure structure: I will now present the overall expenditure structure (Development and Operating) of the proposed budget. As per the allocation of business among ministries/divisions, we have categorized various activities into three main groups, namely: social infrastructure, physical infrastructure, and general services.

55. Allocation proposed for the social infrastructure sector in the proposed budget is Tk 1,43,429 crore, which is 27.41 percent of total allocation, in which allocation for human resource (education, health and other related sectors) will be Tk 1,29,056 crore. Allocaction proposed for the physical infrastructure sector will be Tk. 1,64,603 crore or 31.46 percent, in which Tk. 66,234 crore will go to overall agricultural and rural development, Tk. 61,360 crore to overall communications, and Tk. 28,051 crore to power and energy. Total Tk. 1,23,641 crore has been proposed for general services, which is 23.63 percent of total allocation. Tk. 33,202 crore is proposed for public-private partnerships (PPP), financial assistance to different industries, subsidies and equity investments in nationalized corporations, banks, and financial institutions, which is 6.35 percent of total allocation. Tk. 57,070 crore for interest payment, which is 10.91 percent of total allocation. Tk. 1,245 crore for net lending and other expenses, which is 0.24 percent of total allocation. Detailed information about the allocations has been presented in Table 6 of Annexure A. A ministry/division-wise proposal for budget allocation has also been provided in Table 7 of Annexure A.



Chapter IV

A Journey towards a Prosperous Future

Sectoral Strategies, Action Plans and Resource Mobilization

Madam Speaker

56. At this stage, I would like to dwell upon our important policy-strategies, work plans and budget allocation for the medium-term including that for the next fiscal year. Through this budget, we will make efforts to implement the pledges made in our Election Manifesto of 2018 and achieve Sustainable Development Goals and their targets. Next year will be the terminal year of our 7th Five Year Plan; hence its implementation will get priority in this budget. Given the resource availability, we are actively considering those expenditure programmes that fulfill the basic needs of the people.

Medium-Term Policy Strategy

57. Our GDP grew consistently at a very high rate in the last decade. We expect a GDP growth of 8.13 percent in FY2018-19. Our contmmitment is to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent by FY2023-24, and maintain that rate until 2041 so that we can lay a solid foundation for becoming a high income country by that time. To achieve this objective, GDP growth rate has been projected at 8.2 percent for FY2019-20. The inflation rate during this year is forecasted at 5.5 percent. Alongside, our goal will be to enhance the competitiveness of all our business sectors, including agriculture, industry, commerce, exports, real estate and services sectors. The purpose is to reduce poverty, generate employment, and attract foreign investment. Bringing the marginal people into the mainstream of development, special measures will be adopted for small and medium enterprises, and steps will be taken to reduce income inequality.

58. The main source of our growth is the strong domestic demand. Our main attention will be on increased domestic demand through consumption and investment, and increased external demand by enhancing exports. Growth in remittances will continue to be our focus in the medium term as well. We also aim to build a modern transportation system through government investment, and ensure power and energy security.

59. To accelerate GDP growth and generate employment we need enhanced growth in the industrial sector. This objective will be achieved by establishing Economic Zones across the country. However, in order to ensure sustained and balanced growth, development of the services sector, especially tourism and real estate sub-sectors, and the agriculture sector will also be given priority.

Madam Speaker

60. Tthe main thrust of our budget is to create an investment-friendly environment for the private sector, expand export trade, ensure business-friendly tax management, bring about required reforms in the financial sector, and increase public sector investment to take our GDP growth to a higher trajectory. Furthermore, we are aiming to achieve the double digit growth as quickly as possible through timely implementation of all nationally important infrastructure projects including mega projects such as the Padma Bridge, Padma Rail Link Project, Dohajari-Cox’s Bazar rail line, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Rampal Power Plant, Payra Sea Port, Matarbari Power Plant at Moheshkhali, and Dhaka Metro Rail, etc.

61. Madam Speaker, our government’s principal commitment is not only to achieve growth, but also to ensure sustainable and inclusive development. Our objective is to bring a qualitative change in the lives of the people through poverty alleviation and reduction in inequality. To meet this objective, we will attach more importance to expanding the coverage of the social protection programme, creating employment opportunities in home and abroadt, providing microcredit and imparting efficiency enhancement trainings. Following the practice of every year, I have presented this year, along with the budget speech, a ‘Medium-Term Macroeconomic Policy-Statement (MTMPS)’ which contains details of our medium-term policies and strategies.

62. In the next section, I will present sector-based specific action plans.



Action Plans and Resource Allocation

Education, Health and Human Resource Development

63. I would like to begin with our education system and let me share a good news for the Ministry of Education.

Bringing dynamism in education through new enlistment of MPOs

Madam Speaker

64. You are aware, the MPO (Monthly Pay Order) enlistment in the Ministry of Education remained suspended for a long time. Upon request from the Ministry of Education and under the special directive of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, necessary funds have been earmarked in the budget for this year for enlistment of new schools in the MPO list. I, on behalf of the people of Bangladesh and on your behalf, extend sincere thanks to our Hon’ble Prime Minister.

Madam Speaker

65. While giving my reflection on education, I would like to present a memorable example from Japan. Japan was totally a backward country in education and science before the Meiji restoration during the later part of the 18th century. Emperor Meiji urged on acquiring western education and technological knowledge and sent the Japanese students, even the prince, to western countries, including the United States. He realized that in Japan there was a dearth of teachers, not of students. He therefore brought several thousand teachers, trained in different technologies, from the western world to upgrade and update the Japanese education system. By dint of such pragmatic and farsighted policy, Japan not only became equal to the western world, it also achieved the glory of becoming the first country which achieved 100 percent literacy. Our Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also laid the highest importance on education. With the aim of creating skilled human resource, targets have been set for the overall improvement of education, reducing discrimination in education, achieving quality, excellence, and expansion of education.

66. We do not have any scarcity of students now; but there is a dearth of suitable and trained teachers. In all areas of education beginning with the primary level, we want to engage our competent and trained teachers. Much of our future depends on how we manage our education system. It is now the demand of the time to ensure selection of competent teachers in all areas of education, provide them with training, and ensure selection of appropriate and timely academic subjects. Our government will take necessary measures from this year to ensure their implementation.

Madam Speaker

67. The world is witnessing a transition from the Third Industrial Revolution to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will have to prepare ourselves to remain at par with the rest of the world. Otherwise, our future will be at stake. Therefore, our classrooms will have to be subject-specific where Nano Technology, Bio-technology, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Material Science, Internet of Things, Quantum Computing, Block Chain Technology and other similar technologies will be taught. Receiving education in these subjects is now the demand of the time. We have no shortage of students. We lack trained teachers. In order to teach these subjects, we may, as Emperor Meiji of Japan did, have to bring in teachers from abroad, if necessary, in order to meet present day demand. We would like to start these activities from this year, and therefore, adequate budget has been allocated for the education sector in FY2019-20.

Madam Speaker

Quality education, not the numbers, is the Priority of Coming Days

68. As we kept on laying emphasis on increasing the student enrollment, Bangladesh achieved a great success in enrolling students both at primary and secondary levels maintaining gender parity. Now, the main challenge for us is to improve the quality of education and expand primary education. Various measures have been adopted to ensure quality and universal primary education. Included among them are- nationalization of 26,193 private primary schools, enactment of the Non-Formal Education Act, distribution of stipends through mobile banking, improvement of infrastructures in the newly nationalized and existing primary schools, distribution of free text books, supplying computers and multimedia to schools, and improvement of various education related infrastructures.

69. The Fourth Primary Education Development Project (PEDP-4) is ongoing for the expansion and quality enhancement of primary education. Stipends and school-feeding programmes will continue so as to ensure that education of primary school students is not hampered. The government will build infrastructures for schools, conduct basic literacy program throughout the country to build a fully literate Bangladesh, and expand digital primary education through the use of ICT. The capacity of primary school teachers will be enhanced by providing practical and modern trainings home and abroad to meet the standard of modern education.

70. To increase the involvement of private institutions including local elites in the school feeding program and expansion and coordinated implementation of the overall program, a process is underway to formulate the National School Feeding Policy will be formulated in FY2019-20. A pilot project titled ‘Digital Primary Education’ will be undertaken to facilitate qualitative improvement in education by enhancing the capacity of primary education together with the use of ICT. Under the project, interactive classrooms will be established in 503 model primary schools. The following programmes will continue in FY2019-20 to ensure the ongoing development of primary and mass education, such as construction of classrooms in schools on the basis of prioritized requirements; demand-driven repair and refurbishment of schools; construction of wash-blocks and tube wells in schools; providing budget for implementation of school level improvement plan (SLIP) and upazila primary education plan (UPEP) in all government primary schools; recruitment of teachers; providing Dip-in-Ed and subject-specific trainings to teachers; supplying comptuers and ICT equipment to schools, offices and training institutes; distribution of free text books; and the stipend programme.

71. I propose to allocate a total of Tk. 24,040 crore for the primary education sector, which was Tk. 20,521 crore in the budget for current FY2018-19.

Madam Speaker

Science and Technology-based Secondary and Higher Education

72. The government has undertaken various programmes for the expansion of quality secondary education, among which trainings for secondary school teachers, construction of classrooms in academic institutions in underdeveloped areas, providing stipends among poor and meritorious students, etc., are the important ones. To facilitate the qualitative improvement in secondary education, a five year Secondary Education Development Programme will be implemented. Under this programme, providing education service for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics will be given priority.

73. A total of 2 lakh 67 thousand secondary school teachers have already been provided with trainings during the last two fiscal years, and 1 lakh 3 thousand secondary school teachers and 3 lakh 13 thousand ICT teachers will be given trainings in the current fiscal year. As many as 580 classrooms were built in the schools in underdeveloped areas, and the process of building another 350 classrooms in the current fiscal year is ongoing. The government has introduced e-books, established upazila ICT training and resource centers, transformed 1 private school in each upazila into a model school, and established multimedia classrooms in 32,667 schools.

74. We are actively engaged in removing disparity and ensuring qualitative excellence in the education sector. Tuition fee up to degree (pass) and equivalent students is being provided from the Prime Ministers Education Assistance Trust Fund to ensure education for the poor and meritorious students who are otherwise deprived of education. Stipends in this sector are provided to 2 lakh 21 thousand students in FY2018-19. Besides, 18 crore 13 lakh free text books are being distributed to 1 crore 25 lakh students at the secondary level.

Enhanced Salary and Baishakhi Bonus for Teachers

75. To enhance financial benefits and facilities for teachers, an annual increment of 5 percent on the basic salary is being provided from July 2018 to teachers/ employees of MPO-enlisted non-government schools under the Secondary and Higher Education Division. Besides, a Baishakhi Bonus amounting to 20 percent of the basic salary is being provided from the FY2018-19. The introduction of the online system for enrollment, registration, changing institutions, and publication of the results as part of the innovative program in education management have largely reduced harassment. From FY2018-19, special grants for academic institutions, teachers and students are being provided through the online system, and payments are made through mobile banking.

Construction of Secondary Educational Infrastructure and Supply of Education Materials

76. The government has allocated Tk. 9,000 crore in FY2019-20 for development projects in the secondary and higher education sector, which is 54 percent higher than that in FY 2018-19. Construction of physical infrastructure in 1,500 non-government colleges, 3,000 non-government schools under the Secondary and Higher Education Division will be completed by June 2019. Steps have been taken to construct 48,947 multimedia classrooms, 200 language-cum-ICT labs, 1,000 science labs, 2,120 smart classrooms and 46 hostels, and supply of furniture, office materials and ICT equipment in 26,200 educational institutions throughout the country. ICT training and resource centers have been established in 125 upazilas in the country, and the process for establishing the same in another 160 upazilas is underway.

77. Stipends and other assistance amounting to Tk. 883.54 crore was provided in FY2017-18 to about 41 lakh 44 thousand students from Class VI to Degree (pass) levels, of which 75 percent were female students. An amount of Tk. 1,900 crore was allocated in FY2018-19 against 42 projects to develop physical infrastructure and other facilities at the public universities in the country. Of these, development projects for 18 universities will be completed in FY2019-20. Besides, based on the promise of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina, 5 new universities have been established as part of the program for setting up new public universities.

78. I propose to allocate a total of Tk. 29,624 crore for the secondary and higher education sector, which was Tk. 25,866 crore in the current fiscal year.

Madam Speaker

Employment-friendly Technical and Vocational Education

79. Steps have been taken to expand technical and vocational education to meet the growing demand for technical manpower. In addition, the government has also undertaken measures to diversify the technical and vocational education programmes. To reduce discrimination in technical and vocational education, stipends are being provided to students from the Dakhil, Technical and Ebtadayee levels. Again, the government is providing one time grants as allowances to the poor and meritorious students and hapless teachers, distributing free textbooks, and providing special trainings to teachers of English and Mathematics. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been included as a textbook subject from Class VI to expand technical education and improve its quality.

80. With a view to establishing one technical school at each upazila to create skilled manpower in Bangladesh, construction of technical schools in 100 upazilas at a cost of Tk. 2, 281.69 crore in the preliminary phase is underway. Necessary budget has been allocated to develop land survey education in Bangladesh, construct polytechnic institutes in 23 districts, and implement projects to enhance the capacity of 64 technical schools and colleges under the Directorate of Technical Education. Besides, polytechnic institutes for women are being established in 4 divisional towns (Sylhet, Barishal Mymenshing and Rangpur).

Madrasa Education

81. The government has taken numerous steps for the development and modernization of madrasa education. Infrastructures of Madrasas will be developed and multimedia will be set up in classrooms. Free text books are being distributed at Dakhil and Ebtedaayee levels to remove discrimination in education. A total of 1,800 new madrasas are being established in the country.

82. I propose to allocate Tk. 7,454 crore in FY 2019-20 for technical and madrasa education, which was Tk. 5,758 crore in FY2018-19.

83. It is worth mentioning here that currently 28 ministries and divisions are implementing programs related to education and training. The allocation for this purpose in FY 2019-20 is Tk. 87,620 crore, which is 3.04 percent of GDP and 16.75 percent of total budget allocations.

Health and Family Welfare

Madam Speaker

84. The government has been working with dedication and sincerity to develop a healthy and energetic population by ensuring quality health services, nutrition, affordable and quality family planning. Following the government interventions, the maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate, child (under-5 years) mortality rate, malnutrition, stunting rate, low-weight rate, etc., are constantly reducing, and the average life expectancy rate is increasing. The Fourth Health, Population and Nutritional Sector Programme (4th HPNSP) is being implemented in the health service sector at an estimated cost of Tk. 1,15,486 crore over a period from January 2017 to June 2022. Nested on 29 operational plans, the programme is providing health and family planning services and improved medical education throughout the country. It is worth to note that 84 percent of the HPNSP programme is being financed by the government.

Ensuring Health Service

85. The projects undertaken by the government to ensure health service include modernization and expansion of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, establishment of nephrology units and kidney dialysis centers in government medical college hospitals and all district headquarters hospitals, and establishment of cancer treatment units in all medical college hospitals at the divisional level. Besides, steps have been taken to establish medical college hospitals at Hobiganj, Nilphamari, Netrokona, Magura and Naogaon districts. Alongside, steps have been taken to undertake projects to construct hostels with modern facilities, establish medical waste treatment, and create child cardiac units in each divisional hospital.



Improving Maternal and Child Healh

86. Various priority programmes have been undertaken to improve maternal and child health. Of them, the main activities related to the improvement of maternal health include providing training to physicians on emergency maternity services, providing ‘community based skilled birth attendant’ training to field level health workers, providing safe MR service, providing coordinated medical treatment to pregnant mothers, encouraging the receipt of institutionalized child delivery services, expanding maternal health voucher schemes, and advance identification of cervical and breast cancer. On the other hand, to expand the neo-natal medical service, Special Care Newborn Units (SCANU) have been established in 10 district hospitals and 61 upazila hospitals. The government has undertaken steps to recruit as many as 9,792 medical officers to address the growing needs among citizens for health services.

Expansion of Health Services to the Grassroot Level

87. Bangladesh has achieved notable success in the health sector by providing free health services to different strata of people starting with those from the grassroots. Community clinic is the first service center to provide primary health services to the rural people. Currently, 13 thousand 779 community clinics are operational in the country, in each of which about 40 service recipients are getting services every day and 80 percent of them are women and children. About 4 thousand community clinics throughout the country are providing normal delivery service. Besides, the ‘Health Protection Programme’ is currently underway as a pilot project in Kalihati, Ghatail and Madhupur upazilas in Tangail to lessen the financial burden of the poor people.

Incentive to Encourage Expansion of the Pharmaceutical Sector

88. As part of the government’s effort to facilitate the development of the pharmaceutical sector, a cash incentive at the rate of 20 percent is being provided to encourage exports from the producers of pharmaceutical raw materials and laboratory reagents. Construction of a Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Industrial Park is underway at Gazaria in Munshiganj. Again, unani, ayurvedic and homeopathic medical services are also being provided alongside allopathic medical services, and relevant guidelines and pharmacopeia have been prepared. A separate testing laboratory for traditional medicine is being established to ensure quality and standards of traditional medicines (unani, ayurvedic, homeopathic and herbal) produced in the country.

89. To ensure protection of mental health of citizens, provide universal mental health service, and ensure overall welfare, the Mental Health Act, 2018 has been passed in Parliament abolishing the Lunacy Act of 1912. Among other approved laws, Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 1918, and Community Clinic Health Assistance Act, 2018 are worth noting. Besides, the drafting of the ‘Health Services Protection Act, 2019’ by repealing the Medical Practice and Private Clinics and Laboratories (Regulation) Ordinance of 1982 (amended in 1984) is currently underway.

Modernizing Medical Education System

90. The government will construct a 1,000-bed super specialized ward and a one-point check up center, introduce afternoon health services, and construct a cancer building to modernize the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. A world class bone-marrow transplant unit will be established at the University, together with vertical expansion of OPD Bhaban-1 and OPD-Bhaban-2 to enhance the scope of services for general patients. Besides, drafting of the law on alternative medicine systems, the law on the establishment and operation of private medical colleges and dental colleges, and the law on Bangladesh paramedical education board are also progressing.

Health Services for Autistic and People with Special Needs

91. The government attaches priority to the medical treatment and other social benefits for the autistic people and people with special needs. They will be made fit to work by providing specialized trainings in activities they are adept in and can perform.

Employment of Midwives and Nurses for Family Welfare

92. To fulfil the promise by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, 3,000 posts for midwives have been created with a view to reducing the maternal mortality rate. 5,100 senior staff nurses were recruited in 2018. Three nursing colleges and five nursing hostels for boys will be established in FY2019-20 to expand nursing education.

Madam Speaker

Advancement in Health Education

93. Under the directives of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, the government has undertaken a plan to establish a medical university in each division in the country to improve the quality of health education. Of these, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet Medical Universities have already started functioning. The government has undertaken various activities including offers for fellowships and donations to modernize the medical system through the use of new inventions in science and high end technology. The number of medical colleges in the country and the number of seats in the MBBS course have seen a notable increase during the last 10 years. The number of medical colleges has risen from 46 in 2006 to 111 at the moment. Similarly, the number of seats in the MBBS course has increased from 2,050 in 2006 to 10,300 in 2018.

Expansion of Science-based Medical Care

94. The government has taken initiatives to develop and expand science-based medical care system. For example, 3 nuclear medical physics institutes with ultramodern laboratory facilities have been established to promote cancer treatment management. 5 Institutes of Tissue Banking and Biomaterial Research with ultramodern laboratory facilities have been established to enable processing for use in animal/human tissue rehabilitation surgery treatment. Fifty two designated reference institutes for chemical measurement have been established to enable world class measurement and calibration in the country.

95. The government has established an Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Science, a Newborn Screening Central Laboratory in Dhaka, and a Nuclear Medicine Centre and a Sterile Insect Unit in Cox’s Bazar to diagnose the hypothyroid disease among the newborn babies. Besides, research and medical care facilities in nuclear medicine centres at Mitford (Dhaka), Comilla, Faridpur, Bogura, Barishal, Khulna, Mymensing and Rangpur have been expanded and modernized. The government plans to establish a mobile laboratory, a scientific and technological information and research center and an applied industrial research laboratory in the BCSIR and a BSCIR research centre in Gopalganj. In FY2019-20, Institutes of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) will be established at the campuses of 8 medical college hospitals in the country. Besides, and capacity of the existing 6 INMASs will be enhanced. The laboratory facility in the Institute of Electronics will be developed and modernized; a Standard Laboratory will be established for the purpose of radiotherapy, diagnostic radiology, neutron calibration and control of standards.

International Recognition for Achievements in HR Development

96. The benefits of various activities undertaken by the government in education, health and human resource development sectors are now visible as in different social indicators Bangladesh has made major advancements. The average life expectancy in Bangladesh is now 72.8 years. On the other hand, infant mortality of less than 5 years per thousand live births has gone down to 31, infant mortality rate of less than 1 year has gone down to 24, and maternal mortality rate per thousand is now only 1.72 persons. This remarkable success of the government has been duly reflected in the new Human Capital Index 2018 of the World Bank, where Bangladesh has secured 106th position out of a total of 157 countries surveyed. To keep this momentum, we will continue our activities in FY 2019-20.

97. I propose to allocate Tk. 25,732 crore for the Health Services Division, and the Health Education and Family Welfare Division, which was Tk. 22,336 crore in FY2018-19. It is worth mentioning that currently 12 ministries and divisions are implementing programs related to health and family welfare. The allocation for this purpose in FY 2019-20 is Tk. 29,464 crore, which is 1.02 percent of GDP and 5.63 percent of total budget allocations.

Employment Generation

Madam Speaker

98. While the government has taken up seriously the issue of entry of a huge number of active population in the labour market, in one hand, there is the reduction in demand for workers due to the adoption of modern technology, on the other. The government has taken various steps to resolve this dilemma. A three-year programme has been taken up to increase the job creation rate in the industrial sector through improvement of business and investment environment, ensure protection of workers, and reform the legal and regulatory framework, and policy--strategies to make them conducive for the entry of the backward population into the job market in larger numbers. As many as 10 laws/rules, policies-strategies were either formulated or amended in this financial year. The government will facilitate qualitative employment for the growing population by effecting reforms in the rest of the laws/rules and policies/strategies within the next 2 years. I propose to allocate Tk. 100 crore for the training and employment of specific group of people. The government will strive to eliminate unemployment by 2030 by generating employment for 3 crore people.

Demographic dividend: Power of Youths and Prosperity for Bangladesh

99. We will have to exploit the full potential of the demographic dividend that is available for Bangladesh. Acting under the slogan of ‘Power of Youth: Prosperity for Bangladesh’, the government is taking necessary steps to transform youths, one-third of the total population in the country, into well-organized, disciplined and productive forces. To create jobs for the unemployed youths and generate self-employment opportunity, skill development trainings in different subjects are being provided to youths through 111 formal training centres across the country, and 498 training centres at the upazila level. Extensive employment opportunity will be created in the Economic Zones. Tk. 100 crore will be allocated in the coming budget to provide start-up capital to promote all types of startup enterprizes among youths.

Madam Speaker

Skill Development

100. The government has been working sincerely for human resource development by enhancing the skills of our growing population. Steps have been taken to train 15 lakh people. Skill development contributes to the increase in labour productivity. This leads to the rise in labour wage, which in turn contributes to poverty reduction. Alongside, there is an ongoing special programme to create 1 lakh skilled and professional drivers for the transport sector. Under the Prime Minister’s Office, there is a National Skills Development Authority (NSDA) to undertake various skills development activities of the government in a coordinated manner.

There is also a ‘National Human Resource Development Fund’ to finance the activities for the development of human resources.

Overseas Employment: Promising Destination for Bangladeshi Workforce

101. Considering the fact that ‘a huge workforce is entering the job market every year’, sincere efforts have been made to expand overseas labour market alongside the domestic market. Overseas employment in Malaysia and South Korea has increased significantly owing to our successful diplomatic efforts. We have been striving to develop skills of our workers to make them competent for foreign labour markets. As a result of our time bound plans and their proper implementation, the rate of overseas employment has increased which in turn enhanced our image and also played a role in increasing the remittances. The ‘Free Malaysia Today’ report in 2018 on skilled foreign workers in the Malaysian labour market revealed that Bangladeshis holds 37 percent of foreign workforce in Malaysia in the category of managerial posts.

102. To explore new and prospective labour markets, the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment has already completed a survey titled ‘Demand Analysis of Employment of Bangladeshi Migrant Workers in the International Labour Matket’ on labour markets in 53 countries. The survey has made recommendations for enhancing the scope of overseas employment. Moreover, we have reformed the legal framework by formulating the Overseas Employment and Immigration Management Rules, 2017 and the Wage Earners Welfare Board Act, 2018 to regulate migration costs, ensure transparency and accountability of legitimate recruiting agents and ensure safe migration.

Increase in Foreign Remittance

103. To mitigate the burden of increased expenses in sending foreign remittances and to encourage bringing in foreign remittance through legal channels, an incentive at the rate of two (2) percent on money remitted by expatriate Bangladeshi will be provided from this financial year. For this purpose, I propose to allocate Tk. 3,060 crore in this year. This will significantly increase the remittance flow through legal channels and discourage the ‘hundi’ business.

104. The expatriate Bangladeshi workers and their families often face financial losses and risks due to accidents and various other cause as there are no insurance facilities available to them. Preparations have been taken to bring the expatriate workers under the insurance scheme, which will be implemented shortly.

Madam Speaker

Safe Workplace, Workers Welfare and Labor Inspection Apps

105. The government has given special emphasis on ensuring the appropriate workplace in mills and factories. With this aim in view a database containing useful information of 4,808 ready-made garment factories has been created. Preparation of a database containing information of another 27,000 factories is underway. A complete Inspection Checklist, based on labor law and labor rules in Bangladesh, has been formulated, which will enable labor inspectors to ensure compliance while inspecting factories and establishments at the field level. Compliance of 8,261 factories and establishments has been ensured from FY2015-16 to February 2019. Further, with a view to improving health, safety and workplace environment for garment workers a toll free hot line has been introduced through which workers can make complaints, free of costs, on different issues.

106. To promote a worker-friendly atmosphere in mills and factories, a piece of legislation called Bangladesh Labour Act (Amendment), 2018 has been enacted in line with standards of International Labour Organization (ILO). In addition, the government promulgated the EPZ Labour Ordinance 2019, which introduced provisions for the recruitment of workers in industries, owner-worker relationships, determination of the minimum wage rate, payment of wages, compensation for injuries to workers due to accidents during working hours, introduction of provisions on health, safety, etc. of workers, formation of Workers’ Welfare Associations, and formation of the EPZ Workers’ Welfare Association. Besides, the Labour Inspection Management Application (LIMA) has been implemented nationwide by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments under the Ministry of Labour and Employment to ensure a safe workplace, sound work atmosphere and high living standards for workers. This web portal offers the scopes for online trade union registration, publication of inspection reports, and submission of opinions by workers. In order to facilitate the employment of female workers 4,706 day-care centers have been set up in different factories till February 2019 under the supervision of the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments.

107. The present government has been working relentlessly to ensure economic growth through industrialization as well as safeguard the overall welfare of workers. As of February 2019, a total of 2,262 ‘Safety Committees’ have been formed under the Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015 in different factories to ensure a safe workplace. Minimum wage rates for workers of all categories employed in a total of 31 factories and establishments were re-fixed during FY2008-2009 to FY 2017-18. In December 2018 of the current fiscal year, minimum wages were fixed in 8 industrial sectors including ready-made garments. The ‘Bangladesh Labour Welfare Foundation Fund’, formed to ensure the welfare of workers employed in both formal and non-formal sectors, have provided assistance amounting to Tk. 28.05 crore to a total of 6,052 workers from FY2012-13 till date. A sum of Tk. 57.05 crore has been provided to 2,981 workers employed in 100-percent export oriented garment industries from the aforementioned fund from FY2016-17 till date.



Physical Infrastructure

Power and Energy

Madam Speaker

Power is the Pathway to Prosperity

108. Bearing in mind the slogan of Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for ensuing electricity in all households, the government has set targets to generate 24,000 megawatts by 2021, 40,000 megawatts by 2030, and 60,000 megawatts by 2041 respectively. To meet the demand of electricity in short, medium and in long term, the projects for generation, distribution and transmission are in different phases of implementation. The benefits of these initiatives are already visible. Currently, the power generation capacity has increased to 21,169 megawatts, and we have succeeded to provide access to electricity to approximately 93 percent of population. Besides, projects for construction of 53 power plants with capacity to generate 14,202 megawatts of electricity are underway. Alongside signing contracts for the establishment of 18 new power plants with a capacity to generate 5,801 megawatts of electricity is in progress (LOI and NOA has been given). It is expected that the plants will begin to function shortly. Moreover, invitation for tender for 7 power plants with a capacity to generate 1410 megawatts of electricity is in process. Plans have been taken to establish 17 power plants with a capacity to generate 19,650 megawatts of electricity in the near future. Besides, there are plans to generate extra electricity through BMRE of the existing old power plants.

Madam Speaker

Enhancement of Energy Security and Energy Efficiency

109. In order to ensure energy security and sustainable energy supply system, we have plans to reduce the use of fuel to 15 percent by 2021 and to 20 percent by 2030. Fuel diversification has been adopted as a strategy to reduce dependency on natural gas for electricity generation and for energy security. The present government has implemented various projects to set up coal based power plants as an alternative for natural gas. Some mega projects are being implemented at Paira, Moheshkhali and Materbari classifying these areas as power hub. We selected these areas considering the land availability, transport facilities and load centers. The mega projects that are worth mentioning include 1,320 megawatts Maitree Super Critical Thermal Power Plant, Rampal, 1200 MW Ultra Super Critical Coal Project, Materbari and Payra 1320 MW Thermal Power Plant Project. Steps have been taken to establish 10,000 megawatts coal based power plant at Moheshkhali through Joint Investment. Besides the natural gas and coal based power plants, setting up of a nuclear power plant at Rooppur with a power generation capasity of 2,400 megawatts is in progress. In order to import Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), an alternative to indigenous natural gas, to ensure energy security in the country, two Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) with a daily capacity of 1000 million cubic feet have been installed, which currently adds around 650 million cubic feet LNG daily to the national grid.

110. Power system master plan 2016 is targeting about 9000 MW installed capacity by 2041. Under this long term plan Bangladesh government is working with neighbouring countries for regional and sub-regional cooperation. As a result, power is being imported from India since 2013. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed between Bangladesh and Nepal for bilateral cross border trade of electricity and negotiation is going on to import 500 MWs of electricity from an IPP. The signing of an MOU between Bangladesh, India and Bhutan to import hydro power from Bhutan is underway.

Renewable Energy and Energy Savings System

111. There are targets to generate 10 percent of the total electricity from renewable sources by 2020. In order to promote electricity generation at the roof-tops of private buildings using solar home system, a “Net Metering Guideline” has been prepared. Steps have been taken to install solar sytem panels at the rooftops of all educational institutions.

Expansion of Power Transmission and Distribution System

112. Our government has taken a series of actions in the last two terms to improve the transmission infrustructures and to support the additional generation capacity of the nation. As a result, the total transmission line has now increased to 11 thousand 493 circuit kilometers and the distribution line to 5 lakh 8 thousand kilometers. To ensure uninterrupted power supply, the government has been implementing a plan to install 28,000 circuit km. transmission lines and 6 lakh 60 thousand km distribution line through different projects by 2030. By next year, each upazila of the country will have 100 percent access to electricity.

Oil and Gas Exploration Program and Expansion of the Distribution System

113. We have undertaken short, medium and long term plans to explore and extract unexplored gas and oil in land and sea areas. By now, the excavation work of 24 oil wells has been completed by BAPEX. After gaining new maritime boundary from India and Myanmar, Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) have been signed with international oil companies for 4 offshore blocks to explore oil and gas in the sea areas of Bangladesh. To accelerate oil and gas exploration and extraction, new bidding rounds will commence after the approval of the model PSC for both offshore and onshore.

114. I propose an allocation of Tk. 28,051 crore for the Power Division and the Energy and Mineral Resources Division in FY2019-20, which was Tk. 26,502 crore in FY2018-19.

Communication Infrastructure

Madam Speaker

115. A modern, safe and environment-friendly transportation and communication infrastructure is required to sustain economic development, and achieve a higher growth for the country. Bangladesh ranked 103 out of 140 countries in The Global Competitiveness Index, 2018 published by the World Economic Forum. Making a massive investment in the communication infrastructure sector is extremely important if we are to ensure our current advancement towards higher growth. Considering communication infrastructure, especially the railway, as one of the priority sectors, the government has taken up and is implementing numerous

projects.

Development of Sustainable and Safe Roads and Highways

116. To transform our country into a developed one by 2041, we have taken steps to develop and repair roads and highways, build new roads, construct flyovers/overpasses and bridges/culverts. Steps have been taken to gradually upgrade all national highways into four lanes or above in order to modernize the road transport system. In this respect, 509 km national highway has been upgraded into four lanes while upgradation of another 507 km highways is ongoing. Narrow and damaged bridges and culverts are being rebuilt. Rehabilitation, development and repairs of zone-based district highways are ongoing. SASEC Road Connectivity projects 1 and 2 are being implemented in order to be connected with the global transport network so as to reap the benefits of globalization. Steps will be taken to replace the risky bailey bridges with concrete

bridges.

Construction of Bridges-Tunnels and Establishment of an Uninterrupted Communication Network

117. To establish an integrated and uninterrupted communication network in Bangladesh, we are implementing the Padma Bridge, the Tunnel under the Karnaphuli riverbed, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Kutubkhali of Dhaka-Chattogram highway, and many other mega projects. About 2 km structure of the Padma Bridge, being constructed entirely with our own resources, has now become visible, and the overall physical progress of the project is 67 percent. The 2nd Kanchpur, 2nd Gomoti and 2nd Meghna Bridge have been opened for traffic after completing their construction ahead of the stipulated time. Hon’ble Prime Minister has opened these bridges for traffic.

Development of an Integrated and Modern Urban Transport System

118. To develop internal road networks in the Dhaka metropolitan area, reduce traffic congestion at the entry and exit points of Dhaka, and establish a planned and integrated modern public transport system in Dhaka and the adjacent areas, we are implementing the Revised Strategic Transport Plan (2015-35). Under this plan, the construction of the first Metro Rail in Bangladesh, MRT Line-6 from Uttara to Motijheel is in progress. Alongside, the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit or BRT from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Gazipur is underway.

Modern IT-based Safe Road Transport System

119. Steps to build a safe, environment-friendly and modern IT based road transport and control systems are underway. We have identified 121-black spots in national highway and taken preventive steps. A plan has been taken up to install directional sign-signal and kilometer posts in 8,100 spots. Steps have been taken to build a separate lane for slow moving vehicles. As part of enhancement of road safety, measures have been taken to create a pool of skilled drivers. Apart from this, mass awareness programs, namely seminar, sticker and leaflet distribution activities are going on. Four automated vehicle inspection centres have been set up in Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Khulna divisions. This service will be expanded gradually to district headquarters. And meanwhile steps have been taken to set up vehicle inspection centres in 17 districts. Electronic toll collection system has been introduced at the Meghna Bridge.

Madam Speaker

Development of Passenger- friendly Railway System

120. The present government is attaching a top priority to the railway sector in order to make railway an economical, safe and environment-friendly mode of transport. For the overall development of railway, the government has undertaken a 30-year master plan spanning from 2016 to 2045 at a cost of Tk. 5,53,662 crore. As many as 230 projects have been identified under this plan for implementation by 2045. I express my firm belief that implementation of the projects undertaken to develop the railway transportation system will ease the public transport, largely reduce transport costs, expand business and commerce, create new employment opportunity and improve the socio-economic condition of the people.

121. Activities, such as expansion of the railway service, construction of new railway lines and rehabilitation of rail tracks, conversion of rail line into Dual Gauge, opening of new rail stations and reopening of closed stations, launching of new trains, improving the quality of railway services and procurement of train coaches are underway. Steps have been taken to construct 1,110.50 km dual gauge double rail track (km) and 52 new rail track (km), procure 100 locomotives, construct 2 ICDs, procure locomotive simulators, construct 3 major bridges, procure 1,120 passenger coaches, modernize/construct 3 railway workshops, and modernize the signaling system under various development projects. The introduction of e-ticketing has not only eased railway travel for passengers, but also made it possible for them to easily learn the location of trains. The feasibility study to construct Dhaka-Chattogram high speed trains is in progress.

Development of Trade-friendly Waterways and Port

122. Considering the significance of infrastructure related to sea-river-land ports, and their efficient operational system in expanding international and domestic trade, the government is implementing a massive work plan to conduct capital dredging of our rivers, and to develop standards and modernize our ports. Dredging activities are in progress to restore navigability of 10 thousand kilometer long river ways. Alongside the river ways, development of necessary infrastructure and facilities at sea ports are also in progress. A plan for construction of the Bay-Terminal at the Chattogrm port at a cost of Tk. 17,000 crore has been undertaken. The handling capacity of the Chattogram port will be enhanced in the next financial year from 2.8 million TEUs to 3 million TEUs. Projects are being implemented to build necessary infrastructure and facilities at the Pyara sea

port.

Development and Expansion of Airports

123. To facilitate fast and standard international and domestic aviation, the government has taken various steps for the infrastructural development at airports and ensuring easy and safe air travel for passengers. Construction of the third terminal at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport is in progress to enhance its passenger handling capacity to 12 million. Besides this, the work for expanding the runways and enhancing capacity of the Cox’s Bazar Airport and the Osmani Airport is underway with a view to upgrading them to international standards. The feasibility study to improve the Syedpur Airport to the international level has been completed. Works for the site selection and feasibility study on the construction of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib International Airport is in progress.

124. I propose to allocate Tk. 61,455 crore for the communication infrastructure sector in the next FY2019-20, which was Tk. 53,081 crore in the current FY2018-19.

Madam Speaker

Bangladesh Delta Plan: Water Resource Management and Tackling Climate Change

125. Bangladesh has been placed at the 6th position among the countries vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate change. Therefore, the government has formulated an adaptive, long-term, integrated and macro-level mega plan ‘Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100’ with the vision of ‘achieving a safe, climate change resilient and prosperous delta’. The main objectives of the plan is to ensure sustainable use of water resources and prevent natural disasters.

126. Implementation of this mega plan will require a huge investment of 2.5 percent of total GDP of which 2.0 percent would have be met from public sector and the rest 0.5 percent from the private sector. 35 percent of the total investment will be spent in flood control, preventing river erosion, river excavation, dredging, river training and navigation. In the first phase, a total of 80 projects have been proposed under the Delta plan, whose implementation will begin in phases.

Flood, Drought, River Erosion and Land Reclamation

127. Steps have been taken for managing water resource, land use, and mitigating effects of the environment and climate change by re-excavating small rivers, canals and wetlands in 64 districts and assimilation of Climate Smart Integrated Coastal Resource Database (CSICRD). We have undertaken various plans to increase navigability of rivers, dredging of 510 km of rivers by 2022 to prevent river erosion and ensure supply of water during the lean season, digging and reexcavation of 4,883 km of irrigation canals, construction and repair of 200 irrigation structures to extend irrigation facilities, construction of 3 barrages and rubber dams, construction of 250 km flood protection and coastal embankment to reduce flood, salinity and water logging, renovation of 1,040 km flood protection embankment and coastal embankment, construction and renovation of 590 flood protection and drainage infrastructure, excavation and re-excavation of 1,325 km drainage canals, and conservation work of 195 km border river banks and 6 cross-dams.

128. A 20-year Haor Development Master Plan and Database has been prepared for development of Haor areas. Under this, steps have been taken in the haor areas to develop infrastructure, re-excavate rivers, canals, and haors, and fostering socio-econmic development of the people of the concerned areas.

129. In recent times, human habitations, schools, government and private installations, business enterprizes, bazars, etc. are being devastated by river erosion, and people in the affected areas are losing everything. To facilitate rehabilitation of the people affected by river erosion, I propose to allocate Tk. 100 crore in the budget.

Water Resources Management of Cross-Border Rivers

130. In view of the Framework Agreement on Cooperation for Development signed between Bangladesh and India in 2011 for water resource management and development of cross-border rivers through sub-regional cooperation, we have undertaken a plan to form an organization based on Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins, such as the River Basin Organisation/River Basin Commission.

Agriculture sector: Agricultural Development, Prosperous Country

Madam Speaker

131. Before I speak on the Agriculture Sector, I would like to present to you a quote from our Father of Nation, which is relevant to this sector. The Father of Nation Bangabandhu said- “When people have food to their hearts’ content, have a respectable life in this independent country, only then souls of thousands of martyrs will be satisfied”.

Madam Speaker

132. You know. Agriculture is vital to our national economy; 40.62 percent of total labour force is employed in this sector. Despite a gradual reduction in cultivable land, the average growth of agriculture sector stood at 3.7 percent over the last 10 years owing to sincere efforts from the government and relentless hard work of the farmers. Today, Bangladesh has secured the fourth position in rice production and the third position in vegetable production. In addition, we are in the 7th position in mango production and 8th in potato production.

133. We will continue successful interventions, such as agricultural subsidies, other agricultural input incentives and support cards including those for fertilizers and seeds, support for agricultural rehabilitation, agriculture credit at easy terms, etc. For agricultural development, a 20 percent cash incentive for exports of agricultural products is being provided in addition to general investment made for agricultural development, and a 20 percent rebate on electricity bills is provided for the electricity use in irrigation pumps. The number of farmers holding agricultural support cards now is 2 crore 8 lakh 13 thousand 477.

134. As many as 15 new varieties of different crops and 10 climate-resilient technology have been innovated in the current fiscal year. A total of 329 high yielding variety of different crops tolerant to salinity and water submergence have been innovated since 2009. Activities for innovation of crop varieties tolerant to flood, drought, salinity and high temperature by conducting applied research will get priority in the next fiscal year in order to adapt to adverse effects of climate change. Besides, extension of crop diversification, popularizing organic pest management activities and mechanization of farming will be reinforced. Research activities to develop diversified jute products will continue.

135. Providing subsidies to control the price of fertilisers in agriculture has been in practice for many years, and this has contributed to the price stability of agriculture produce through the reduction in costs of production. A total of Tk. 5,201 crore was spent for this sector in FY2017-18. The present government has kept the sales price of fertilisers unchanged in the domestic market with a view to proteting farmers’ interests even though the import price of major chemical fertilisers increased at times, which has indirectly assisted in checking consumer price inflation. The sales price for chemical fertilisers will be kept unchanged in the next fiscal year irrespective of their imuport costs, and incentives for the agriculture sector will continue.

136. Mechanization of harvesting and the follow up activities will be encouraged and subsidies will be provided to farmers to buy machinery for this purpose.

Madam Speaker

Fisheries and Livestock

137. Madam Speaker, you know, we secured the fourth position in the world in sweet water fish production. After the determination of Bangladesh’s sea area in the Bay of Bengal, the government has developed a Plan of Action to develop the marine resources. Considering the importance of marine sea resources, the government has enforced a 65 day fishing ban this year in the sea area. However, it provided 65 kg rice to 4 lakh 15 thousand fishermen during this time as food support.

138. Bangladesh is almost self-sufficient in livestock, especially cattle and goat, production. According to a report published in 2017 by the Food and Agricultural Agency of the United Nations, Bangladesh secured the fourth position in the production of goat meat. Research are being carried out jointly by local and international institutions for fisheries and livestock development. We have formulated a plan of action for: (i) innovation of four livestock related technologies and their transfer through research and extension of effective models for the cure of foot-and-mouth disease and PPR diseases, (ii) extension of dole (airtight storage) system for preservation of fodder, (iii) completion of 35 research projects in different subjects, (iv) setting up laboratories in three regional centres, and (v) providing training in

FY2019-20.

139. The government has taken strong steps to ensure food security. Apart from introducing the Food Safety Act, 2013, we have formulated 6 sets of regulations and 2 sets of rules for implementation of the law. In addition, a new food and nutrition policy is being formulated.

Combatting Climate Change and Protection of Environment

140. To ensure sustainable development through the protection of environment, containing pollution, protection of bio-diversity and tackling the adverse impact of climate, government has formulated the ‘National Environment Policy 2018’. It has allocated tasks among different ministries/divisions and departments to ensure their implementation. Steps have been taken to conduct research for projection of sea level rise in coastal areas of Bangladesh and its impact on agriculture, water resources and infrastructure. The government has enacted Brick Making and Kiln Establishment (Control) Act, 2019 to reduce air pollution. Steps will be taken in the coming days for the protection of Halda river including declaration of the river as an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), and introduction of eco-tourism in various protected areas. The allocation for climate financing was 5.37 percent of the development budget in FY2014-15, which has risen to 8.26 percent (0.75 percent of GDP) in FY2018-19. I am presenting in this august House the Climate Budget Report for 25 ministries for FY2019-20.

Local Government and Rural Development

Madam Speaker

141. Immediately after independence, the Father of Nation Bangabandh Sheikh Rahman shared his vision about the local go overnance and rural development. This has been enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The Article articulates how the local government system would work. It reads as follows:

“The State shall adopt effective measures to bring about a radical transformation in the rural areas through the promotion of an agricultural revolution, the provision of rural electrification, the development of cottage and other industries, and the improvement of education, communications and public health, in those areas, so as progressively to remove the disparity in the standards of living between the urban and the rural

areas”

Following the path shown by the Father of the Nation, a number of initiatives have been implemented under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister. These have brought a sea change in the local governance system, and made the rural economy vibrant. Activities in all sectors - both agricultural and non-agricultural - have been multiplied.

My Village, My Town

142. The present government has focused on rural development by setting up the slogan- ‘Village will be Town’. Following the concept of ‘My Village My Town’ as described in the Election Manifesto, 2018, we will ensure establishment of agricultural machinery service centers and workshops, generation of productive employment, manufacturing of light machinery, and credit facility for marketing at the village level retaining all the rural characteristics. Civic amenities and facilities of the town will be made available in the villages. These include- modern transport infrastructures, creation of opportunities for modern health care and education, ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation, increasing electricity and fuel supply, and computers and high speed internet access. We will make necessary allocation for the relevant ministries.

My House My Farm

143. At present 60 lakh poor families are organized through 1 lakh 1 thousand 42 village co-operative societies under the project of ‘My House, My Farm (Amar Bari Amar Khamar)’, a dream venture of Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to alleviate poverty permanently by 2020. Around 95 thousand 386 co-operatives have been organized until March, 2019, under which the total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries is 2 crore 12 lakh 33 thousand.

144. There is a target for construction of 5,500 km new roads and 30,500 metre bridge/culvert, maintenance of 13,000 km pucca road and 3,700 metre bridge/culvert, development of 190 growth center/markets, construction/expansion of 64 Upazila Complex building and 130 cyclone shelter along with different development activities in rural areas in FY2019-20. Furthermore, steps have been taken for the construction of roads/footpaths, drainage, expansion of sewerage facilities, repair of roads, construction of bus/truck terminal, community centre, setting up of dustbin and waste management and construction of flyovers in important sites to reduce traffic jam in urban areas. Alongside, Bangladesh has been efficiently doing massive work of providing health and other emergency services including provisioning of residential facilities, supply of drinking water, installation of sanitary latrines and building roads for more than 10 lakh Rohingya population who took refuge from Myanmar for more than two years. Moreover, implementation of a modern innovative housing program, namely ‘Palli Janapad’, is in progress along with the construction of roads, bridges and culverts, growth centres, hat-bazars, cyclone centres, the development of swamps, construction of sources of clean water and of drains, expansion of sewerage facilities, etc. in rural areas across the country as well as in three Hill districts.

145. I propose to allocate Tk. 66,234 crore for the agriculture and rural development sector in FY 2019-20, which was Tk. 59,677 crore in the current fiscal year 2018-19.

Industrialization and Trade

Madam Speaker

Science-technology based Industry in Knowledge Society

146. The government has been emphasizing on labour intensive small and medium enterprizes (SMEs) development strategies to generate greater employment opportunities and develop entrepreneurship. Heavy and basic industries are getting importance as well, as these will contribute to the growth of multi-dimensional backward and forward linkage industries. The agroprocessing sector will be given priority in the provision of special facilities. Science-technology based industries in a knowledge society will be encouraged. The contribution of the industrial sector rose to 31.31 percent in the GDP of FY 2018-19.

Madam Speaker

Secured Position in World Trade

147. To encourage the export sector, all kinds of support will be provided and all obstacles will be removed so that the sector can remain competitive. All types of facilities will be provided for those products that have high export potential. Our ICT, leather, medicine, furniture, jewellery, especially jems and stone cutting, could be important sectors.

148. In FY2017-18, Bangladesh earned US$ 41 billion by exporting 744 products and services to 202 countries. Responding to the persuasive efforts from Bangladesh, the WTO extended the pharmaceutical patent waiver rights for LDCs upto 1 January 2033, which has opened up a new horizon for export of Bangladeshi pharmaceutical products. Under the WTO, the duration of waiver on Preferential Market Access given to developing countries for LDCs’ services has been extended to 2030. Services exports from Bangladesh has increased significantly in recent years, and it is expected that the benefits of LDC services waiver will lead to a further increase in our exports.

Madam Speaker

Leather and Footwear Industries

149. You know, we are now in the 8th position in the world in footwear exports. In future, more incentives will be provided by the government to facilitate further advancement of this potential sector. In the meantime, a Social and Environmental Compliance Handbook of Leather, Leathergoods and Footwear Industry has been formulated. Giving priority to the leather sector, the government will take all the steps that are necessary for the development of the sector. Exports of leather and leather products will be increased manifold, by ensuring environment-friendly waste

treatment.

150. On the other hand, to ensure safety of citizens, all chemical warehouses are being transferred temporarily from the residential areas in the Dhaka city to Shampur and Keraniganj of Dhaka. In future, this temporary chemical village will be shifted permanently to Shirajdikhan in Munshiganj.

Golden Future of Golden Fibre

151. The Jute Act, 2017 and the National Jute Policy, 2018 have been formulated to resolve the problems that exist in the jute sector. With assistance from the government, scientists have cracked genome of jute, and invented golden bag as an alternative to polyethene bag. Steps have been taken to enhance the use of golden bags made of jute.

152. In FY2018-19, export incentives have been offered against 35 categories of products. Export incentives provided in FY2008-09 amounted to Tk. 1,500 crore, which stood at Tk. 4,481 crore in FY2017-18, and these incentives have contributed to the efforts of enhancing export earnings.

Fast Growing Textile Industry

Madam Speaker

153. You know, we have acquired the 2nd position in the world in exporting of ready-made garments. In the current context of international trade, it is considered as a growing and promising sector. Keeping this in mind, our government has kept on providing all types of facilities to this sector including the existing incentives. Currently, four sectors of ready-made garments are receiving export incentives at 4 percent. I propose to provide an export incentive of 1 percent in the next fiscal year to the rest of the sectors of ready-made garments. An allocation of additional Tk. 2,825 crore will be made in the budget for FY2019-20 for this purpose.

Promising Eco-Tourism

154. Bangladesh has many tourist spots, including the world’s largest unbroken sandy sea beach at Cox’s Bazar, which are yet to be fully introduced to the world. Work on establishing an Exclusive Tourist Zone is underway at Sabrang, Cox’s Bazar, for foreign tourists. All the potential tourist spots in the country will be gradually made suitable for both local and foreign tourists.

Madam Speaker

Blue economy - the new horizon of opportunities

155. Through the conquest of the sea in the historic judgement by the International for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), under the dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister, Bangladesh received exclusive rights to 1 lakh 18 thousand 813 sq. km of sea from neighboring Myanmar and India, which is almost equivalent to the size of Bangladesh. There are more than 13 heavy mineral resources in the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal which are very valuable. In addition, there are 475 species of fish, and 36 species of prawn, and sea algae, etc. By utilizing these resources, it is possible to increase our GDP by two percent. The proposed strategies for proper utilization of this resources with immense potential are- quick completion of multi-dimensional survey of marine resources; increase of coastal ships and modernization of sea ports and their capacity enhancement; intensify fishing in both deep-sea and shallow coastal waters; introduction of sea eco-tourism and boat tourism in the private sector; and keeping sea coasts and sea ports pollution-free.

Digital Bangladesh: Achievements and Prospects

Madam Speaker

156. Establishing ‘Digital Bangladesh’ is one of the key commitments of the Government. Work on necessary infrastructural development and extensive expansion of the information communication technologies has been undertaken with a view to providing easy public service to the doorsteps of the people in the country. Broadband internet access facilities have been extended up to the union level. Already all districts and divisions in the country have been brought under the 4G network, and mobile networks have been established in inaccessible upazilas. The government is taking necessary preparations to quickly rollout fifth generation (5G) mobile

services.

157. Around 18 thousand 434 government offices under the ministries, divisions, directorates, districts and upazilas have been connected through an integrated network. About 28 high-tech parks/ software technology parks are being set up in the country. Meanwhile, work on three high-tech parks has been completed. The setting up of ‘Bangabandhu High-tech City on 355 acres of land in Kaliakoir of Gazipur is progressing well. The government has set up the National Data Center (Tier-3 Certified). Steps have been taken to ensure all types of information security across the country to avoid security risks for the nationwide information technology network.

Caesareans saw massive boom in two years, costing patients $483m annually while the most vulnerable mothers are losing out

Bangladesh is facing a massive boom in the number of unnecessary C-sections between 2016 and 2018, the number of caesarean deliveries increased by 51%, new figures released by Save the Children show.

The country saw an estimated 860,000 medically unnecessary caesarean operations last year, while up to 300,000 women who really needed a C-section were unable to afford or access it.

The findings highlight the extent of Bangladesh’s burgeoning C-section problem, where the country’s wealthy are turning to C-sections in record numbers, even though any unnecessary operation places both mother and baby at needless risk.

Key findings of the analysis

In 2018, Bangladeshi parents paid around $483 million in out-of-pocket expenses for C-sections that were medically unnecessary. That comes to an average cost of $612 per case.

Around 77% of all C-section operations—or an estimated 860,000 procedures in 2018—were medically unnecessary, up from 570,000 in 2016.

At the same time, up to 300,000 women who desperately need a C-section every year are unable to get one.

In a dozen years between 2004 and 2016, the C-section rate in Bangladesh increased from 4% to 31%.

Save the Children has called for better regulation of the health care sector, more oversight on medical doctors who carry out the procedure, and greater funding for vital maternal health services.

Dr Ishtiaq Mannan, deputy country director of Save the Children in Bangladesh and an expert on newborn and maternal health, said: “This surge in popularity has created a situation where we have more and more affluent mothers lining up for unnecessary C-sections, under the belief that it’ll be more comfortable or because they have been misled by their doctor, while poorer women who desperately need the operation can’t access it. It is simply astonishing.”

About 80% of all births in private hospitals in Bangladesh are now C-sections, the report claims. This is in part due to poor regulation of the medical sector and some unscrupulous practitioners, for whom doing C-sections is a profitable business.

Dr Mannan further said: “Doctors and medical facilities are financially incentivized to deliver babies surgically rather than naturally, and they face few repercussions for providing misleading or incorrect advice.

“Unnecessary C-sections put mothers and babies at needless risk, increasing the likelihood of infection, excessive bleeding, organ damage and blood clots, as well as a significantly longer recovery time for the mother. It also takes away the benefits of a natural birth, which enables newborns to receive a dose of good bacteria that’s believed to boost their immune system when they travel through the birth canal, and enables a mother and her baby to have physical contact earlier, and breastfeeding to begin sooner.”

One of the biggest challenges is addressing a major shortage of accredited midwives, who not only support natural childbirth when viable, but also help reduce the burden faced by busy doctors. Across the country, there are just 2,500 midwives, barely a 10th of the 22,000 recommended by a recent health sector review.

Save the Children is supporting a midwife training program in partnership with the UN Population Fund to help address the shortage.

Dr Mannan continued: “It’s important that all women, regardless of their income, location or status in society, have access to the right information and services, so they can make informed decisions about how they choose to give birth. Increasing the number of midwives in Bangladesh is a big part of this. And if a C-section is medically required, all women must be able to have one, not just those who can afford it.”

According to international recommendations, caesarian sections are medically indicated in only 10% to 15% of deliveries.

Many other countries have experienced caesarean booms, too, including Thailand, Sri Lanka and the United States.

Where Bangladesh differs is that the C-section boom has not corresponded to a matching reduction in maternal deaths, as expected.

Criticism of the rising trend is not new in Bangladesh. But gynecologists and obstetricians have consistently denied any unnecessary use of the procedure.","Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/10/web-bigstock-c-section-bigstock-12-10-2018-1539345555270.jpg,"['number', 'sector', 'bangladesh', 'csection', 'health', 'medically', 'women', 'csections', '51', 'children', 'unnecessary']",

Police say it is difficult to prevent this as the traffickers are helping the Rohingya leave Bangladesh

Seeing no hope for their repatriation to their homeland in Myanmar’sRakhine state with dignity, a large number of desperate Rohingyas are now either opting to go abroad illegally or spread to different parts of Bangladesh, creating a fresh problem for the country.

According to local police and NGO officials, a human trafficking racket is encouraging the Rohingyas, mainly women, to take the risk of going to Malaysia and Indonesia by sea, or flee the camps in Cox's Bazar to collect Bangladeshi passports with fake documents.

This racket is providing them with the false documentsand helping them trick the authorities to get their hands on the passports. The traffickers are also helping the Rohingyas escape therefugee camps and contact their relatives living in different Muslim countries.

Contacted, Brig Gen Saidur Rahman Khan, the project directorof Introduction of e-Passport and Automated Border Control Management in Bangladesh, told UNB that almost all the Rohingyas who have taken shelter in Bangladesh have registered their biometric data.

""We are taking steps to incorporate the fingerprints of the Rohingyas in our system,to make sure they cannot get Bangladeshi passports by any means. I hope, the process will be completed by July,"" he said.

Saidursaid that some Rohingyas also show Bangladeshis as their parents, as locals help them, while collecting necessary documents for passports.

More than 1.1 Rohingyas, who have fled brutal persecution in Myanmar over the past few years,are currently sheltered in a number of camps at Teknaf and Ukhiya of Cox’s Bazar.

Abu NayeemNasim, an official at the Cox's Bazar regional passport office, said they have already identified some 300 applications submitted by Rohingyas.

He said they are now very careful in issuing passports so that Rohingyas cannot get them with false documents.

Steps taken

Refugee Relief and Repatriation CommissionerAbul Kalam said it is a very tough job to control nearly 1.2 million Rohingyas. ""They are making various efforts to either go abroad or spread to different parts of the country. Many of them have already left their camps.""

He said they are taking various steps to stop it by intensifying monitoring on the Rohingyas. ""We are strongly dealing with the issue and law enforcement officials are also playing an active role to preventthe Rohingyas from fleeing the camps.""

Local police, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and coastguards have intensified their monitoring and launched special drives to prevent the Rohingyas from escaping the camps.

Law enforcement officials set up eight check posts at Ukhiya and Teknaf, while coastguards took position at different points of the Naf River and the Bay of Bengal.

In their separate drives, BGB, coastguardsand Police detained around 600 Rohingyas over the last one-and-a-half-month, foiling their bid to flee to Malaysia through the sea.

Cox's Bazar Superintendent of Police (SP) ABM Masud Hossain said Rohingyas are mainly fleeing their camps through different secret ways in the hills and jungles.

Besides, he said, the displaced Myanmar nationals are now taking help from the locals to learn their language, dress-up style, and way of communication. ""So, they now make efforts to escape their camps pretending to be local people.""

Masud also said most of the Rohingyas detained during their escape attempts were women.

Detentions galore

On June 6, police arrested 18 Rohingyas from Cox's Bazar Link Road and produced them before a court.

On May 30, coastguards arrested 56 Rohingyas — 26 women, 20 men and 10 children — and two human traffickers from the deep sea while heading towards Malaysia.

Earlier, law enforcement officials detained 517 Rohingyas and 32 human traffickers in their different drives.The detained Rohingyas were taken back to their camps, and the traffickers were produced before the court.

Some of the Rohingyas who got scattered to different parts of the country were also detained by police.

On May 10, police arrested 23 Rohingyas from Dhaka’sKhilkhet area as they were preparing to leave Bangladesh for Malaysia with Bangladeshi passports.

Two Rohingya women were detained at HazratShahjalal International Airport while attempting to go to Saudi Arabia by a Kuwait Airlines flight on May 25.

A day before, police detained 50 other Rohingyas during a drive in Chittagong’s KazirDewri area and sent them back to their camps.

On Wednesday, Armed Police Battalion also arrested two Rohingya men with 9,000 yaba pills at the HazratShahjalal International Airport in Dhaka.

Besides, around 50 Rohingyas were detained from different parts of the country during their attempt to collect passports with fake documents.

Desperate for a better life

Saikat Biswas, an official of Inter Sector Coordination Group, said many Rohingyas are desperate to go abroad seeking a better life as there is no progress in their repatriation process.

Besides, he said, some Rohingyas are contacting their relatives who stay abroad and taking their help to flee Bangladesh through various ways.

Saikat feared Bangladesh may face a fresh problem if Rohingyas continue to flee their camps.

Sheuly Sharma, executive director of JagoNariUnnoyonSangstha — whichworks for the welfare of the women in the camps,said many Rohingya girls now dream of getting married and going to Malaysia.

""Most Rohingya girls have a perception that they will have good husbands and a better life if they can go to Malaysia by any means.Human traffickers give them these ideas,” she said.

Cox’s Bazar Additional SPIqbal Hossain said it is difficult to check the trafficking of Rohingya as they are willing to leave Bangladesh. ""The situation has turned critical with the local human traffickers assisting them.""

He said the government can consider erecting barbed wire fences around the Rohingya camps to limit their movement.","Sat, 22 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2019/05/base-1558442110519.jpg,"['traffickers', 'different', 'obtaining', 'passports', 'abroad', 'detained', 'rohingyas', 'bangladesh', 'bazar', 'bangladeshi', 'camps', 'women', 'rohingya']",

The election was held at the UN General Assembly Hall, according to a press release.

Thailand, South Korea and China are the other countries elected from the same region. ECOSOC, one of the six principal organs of UN, is also the most important platform of the UN system, the press release added.

It is also crucial for multilateral diplomacy especially in the case of development.

The victory was hailed as a global recognition of the development endeavors of Bangladesh by diplomats from several countries present at the election venue.

The election was conducted under the Presidency of María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, the president of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly through a secret ballot.

Referring to Bangladesh’s fulfillment of the LDC graduation criteria last year, the Permanent Representative (PR) of Bangladesh to the UN Ambassador Masud Bin Momen said, “This membership of ECOSOC will help us achieve sustainable graduation and accelerate progress in the implementation of Agenda 2030.”

Through the membership of ECOSOC, Bangladesh will be able to work more intensively in implementing the Agenda 2030 through various forums, commissions, committees, executive boards and regional forums such as UNESCAP under ECOSOC.

36,36,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Japan awaits big wave of Southeast Asian tourists - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Japan-awaits-big-wave-of-Southeast-Asian-tourists,"TOKYO -- Amid Japan's inbound tourism boom, the number of Southeast Asians visiting the country is particularly conspicuous.

Thai tourists to Japan topped 1 million in 2018, while their Vietnamese and Filipino counterparts also came over in large numbers. What is even better for Japan's economy is that many of these travelers ended up in stores, where they were not shy about spending.

And history shows this windfall could be about to start really gushing.

In the coming years, more Southeast Asian countries will reach a level of economic development that will leave their citizens with enough discretionary income to start indulging their travel fantasies. As more Southeast Asians take to the sky, they will go a long way toward helping Japan reach its goal of boosting the number of foreign tourists to 60 million by 2030.

""I have been to Japan twice with a friend of mine,"" said a Thai woman in her 20s who works in Bangkok. ""The quality of cosmetics and food was very high, and the streets were clean.""

She showed off a smartphone photo taken in front of a Tokyo drugstore and said she is thinking of visiting Japan again.

According to the Japan National Tourism Organization, the number of tourists from Thailand reached 1.13 million in 2018. Thais thus joined South Koreans, Taiwanese, Chinese, Hong-Kongers and Americans in breaking through the 1 million threshold.

While visitors from China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong accounted for 73% of the total number of foreign arrivals, those from Southeast Asian nations increased at steep rates from the previous year -- 26% for Vietnamese and 19% for Filipinos.

Outbound tourism from a country takes a leap when its per capita gross domestic product vaults over the $5,000 a year threshold, according to a report by Mizuho Bank.

Consider China. In 2011 it rushed by the $5,000 marker, and in the following seven years the number of Chinese outbound tourists increased eightfold, well above the 70% growth from 2004-2011.

Now take a look at Thailand, whose GDP rose above $5,000 per capita in 2010. While the number of Thai visitors to Japan had hovered around 100,000 per year in the six years through 2009, it exceeded 1 million in less than 10 years after 2010. (Thais wanting to holiday in Japan had another barrier removed in 2013, when Japan began waiving strict visa requirements.)

In the coming decade, three other Southeast Asian nations are expected to either join Thailand and Singapore in the $5,000 per capita promised land or at least approach the border.

Indonesia is expected to arrive there in 2022, and the Philippines is on a path that will put it at $4,696 in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund. In the case of Vietnam, the figure is likely to rise from $2,551 in 2018 to $3,931 in 2024.

So expect the region's airports and budget airlines to be exponentially busier in the 2020s.

No-frills carriers already control a large share of Southeast Asia's aviation market, and many, like the AirAsia Group out of Malaysia, frequently fly to Japan. While some 25% of all foreign tourists who visited Japan in the January-September period of 2016 used budget airlines, the ratio topped 50% for Filipinos and 30% for Thais and Malaysians, the Japan Tourism Agency said.

These airlines, as well as geographical proximity, are already fueling the Japan-bound travel boom.

Overseas tourists flock to Osaka's Dotonbori shopping and entertainment district.

And they are goosing the country's economy. In the first three months of this year, tourists from Vietnam spent an average 54,000 yen ($498.33) in Japanese stores, second only to Chinese visitors, who dropped more than 100,000 yen while in the country, according to the JTA.

While spending by all foreign tourists in the quarter slowed around 3% from the year-earlier period, Vietnamese tourists handed over 22% more.

Thai tourist spending in Japan came to 40,000 yen or so, while Indonesians and Filipinos were at the 30,000-yen level.

An interesting contrast: American and European tourists, who enjoy much higher incomes, spend about 20,000 yen shopping while in Japan.

At play here is the quality and availability of goods. Americans and Europeans can buy well-made electronics and cosmetics at home, but Southeast Asians feel an urgency to stock up on these items while in Japan.

Reina Kanai of Aun Consulting, a Tokyo-based research company, said Japanese retailers have a big opportunity to corral even more Southeast Asian tourists. She says merchants should engage with these visitors on ""social networking sites.""

Southeast Asians are especially fond of social networks, spending hours a day on them, and the Japan National Tourism Organization already operates Facebook and Instagram accounts that serve as digital travel brochures.","Sun, 16 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F4%252F6%252F5%252F21065642-2-eng-GB%252FCropped-1559538314tourists%2520from%2520thailand.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['asian', 'number', 'japan', 'tourism', 'million', 'asians', 'awaits', 'big', 'tourists', 'foreign', 'wave', 'visitors', 'southeast', 'yen']", 
37,37,FL-2019-000079-BGD,"TAX, FISCAL POLICIES: Not inclusive enough - The Daily Star",https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/bangladesh-budget-2019-20-tax-fiscal-policies-not-inclusive-enough-1756276,"Tax and fiscal policies framed and applied by the government are not progressive enough to reduce inequality in the society, said analysts.

Various exemptions and rebates, tax privileges given to different influential quarters, high dependence on indirect taxes and inadequate public investment in health, education as well as other social sectors never help the government achieve inclusive economic growth, five noted economists told this newspaper.

The observation came when inequality has hit all-time high, raising questions about the quality of the country’s much-lauded stellar economic growth, which is estimated to be 8.13 percent by this fiscal year.

Official data show that Bangladesh recorded more than 6.5 percent GDP growth in the past decade. Yet inequality, in Gini coefficient or Gini index, rose to .482 in 2016, up from 0.458 in 2010, in a worrying development.

The Gini coefficient is measured on a scale of 0 to 1; the closer it is to 1 the higher the inequality is in the society.

At the same time, the pace of reduction of poverty has fallen, according to the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).

The economists said tax and fiscal policies have a lot to do in addressing the inequality in society.

Debapriya Bhattacharya, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said a number of features of Bangladesh’s fiscal policy actually fosters the macroeconomic determinants that affect the employment growth and income opportunities in the country.

“This, in turn, is inhibiting the country’s transition towards economic inclusiveness,” he said.

“Our analysis shows large- and medium-scale manufacturing industries have been significant contributors in the recent GDP growth. However, their growth has originated from enhanced productivity, rather than increased employability. So, the growth could not actually benefit a large section of the population, whose income level did not rise.”

Moreover, Debapriya said, the SMEs and micro industries, which are more labour-intensive in nature, did not post growth as much their larger counterparts achieved.

Zahid Hussain, lead economist at the World Bank’s Dhaka office, said tax policy is one of the most important aspects of a country’s business environment and the distribution of income and wealth.

“It incentivises investment, corrects large inequities in the distribution of income and wealth and generates the revenue needed to fund essential public goods,” he said.

According to Zahid, one of the basic concepts of designing and implementing an equitable taxation system is to spread the taxes as wide as possible to minimise the individual tax burden.

And direct tax, which is linked to the taxpayer’s ability to pay, and hence are considered to be more progressive, he said.

Yet, indirect tax, which is paid by everyone regardless of financial situation to buy goods and services, is used by the tax authorities to generate revenue. Over 68 percent of the total tax in Bangladesh came from indirect taxes in fiscal year 2017-18, he said.

“Indirect taxation imposes a greater relative burden on the poor than on the rich.”

Debapriya Bhattacharya said the share of direct taxes covers only a quarter of the total revenue collection, and it has somewhat stagnated in the recent past.

“It essentially means that the government continues to depend more on indirect tax, which has negative implications for distributive justice.”

ABSENCE OF WEALTH TAX

Zahid Hussain said despite having structured a mechanism of progressive personal income taxation, various exemptions and rebates, which only the better off can take advantage of, dilute its actual progressivity.

“Broadening the income tax base by eliminating special treatments would improve the horizontal equity of the tax.”

Moreover, he said, Bangladesh still lacks a systematic mechanism and efforts for wealth tax assessment.

“There are provisions of imposing a 10 percent surcharge on net wealth, but complexities in determining the price of assets and taxes, combined with governance weaknesses, have severely limited the revenue yields and progressivity of the net wealth surcharge.”

Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said income tax rates are progressive. “But applications are selective, and also a lot of things are not covered.”

Debapriya Bhattacharya said research suggests that the prevalent high-level of inequality cannot be tackled by imposing tax on the current income alone; stock of assets needs to be brought under the tax net as well.

“Other than introduction of nominal surcharge on historical value of assets, no measure has been observed in the recent past, in this respect. It is time that we consider introduction of inheritance tax.”

“In the recent past,” he added, “we have also seen that the government keeps providing arbitrary special exemptions to influential quarters without analysing its overall impact of such measures; this reduces the effectiveness of revenue efforts.”

KAS Murshid, director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), said Bangladesh’s direct taxation is progressive to some extent but relatively less tax comes from influential and economically affluent people.

“It appears that those who are supposed to contribute higher amount of tax, are not contributing to that extent. Instead, we see lobbying to get tax benefits by those who are supposed to pay higher. We know who do this,” he said.

“From casual political economic analysis, it seems that power of special interest groups has increased a lot.”

He said taxation system should be more progressive and the government should pay more attention to the needs of small, marginal farmers and the poor.

“This is especially important because of the rising inequality and lack of voice of the disadvantaged,” said Murshid.

INADEQUATE ALLOCATION TO FIGHT INEQUALITY

Selim Raihan, executive director of South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM), said a large number of potential taxpayers, including many ultra-rich people, have remained outside the tax net.

“This has resulted in a tax system which is regressive, and inequality is rising,” he said, adding that economic growth since 2010 has benefited the rich more.

“A number of reasons can be mentioned as responsible for the rise in inequality. However, fiscal policy during this period can be considered as one of the major contributing factors.”

He said one of the major instruments for the government to address inequality is public expenditure in social sectors. However, this has not been prudently used, added Raihan.

CPD’s Debapriya said, “Allocations in health and education sectors have remained abysmally low in our country over some time now.”

He added that the share of health and education budget is only around 1 percent and around 2 percent of GDP.

“It is well known that a resultative approach towards inequality reduction can be forged only when the access to quality education and health services for the society’s farthest behind people will be ensured.”

The other issues that warrants concrete measures for reducing inequality in the country are prevention of institutionalised corruption, public resource leakages and illegal capital flight, he said.","Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/poor_1.jpg?itok=w8UyiUI9,"['fiscal', 'taxes', 'inclusive', 'progressive', 'inequality', 'bangladesh', 'economic', 'policies', 'tax', 'growth', 'wealth', 'income']",

What does this resilient infrastructure look like? It could be digging deeper foundations, using alternative materials, building flood protection, strengthening electrical poles and cell towers, improving road design, and building stronger water treatment plants.

But it is also necessary to look beyond each individual asset and build more resilient systems and networks. Building redundancy in networks, that is by increasing the number of connections that serve a community, for instance, can be a gamechanger. A city that is accessible through multiple roads and powered through multiple transmission lines is less likely to find itself isolated or without power when a devastating storm strike.

At the same time, not all disruptions can be prevented, so ensuring that households and businesses plan for and manage them – for instance, by ensuring that each home has emergency supplies, or that communities have robust and adaptable supply chains – will also be essential.

Spending Better



However, it’s not only about spending more, it’s also about spending better. Investing in regulations and planning, in the early stages of project design, and in maintenance can significantly outweigh the costs of repairs or reconstruction after a disaster strikes. These kinds of early investments may be difficult to fund in low-income countries. They can therefore be considered as priorities for the international community and development aid.

This report lays out how to unlock this $4.2 trillion opportunity with a range of clear and concrete recommendations:





Get basics right. Tackling poor management and governance of infrastructure systems is key. For instance, a poorly-maintained infrastructure asset cannot be resilient. Build institutions for resilience. Wider political economy challenges also need to be addressed, and critical infrastructure assets and systems need to be identified so that resources can be directed toward them. Include resilience in regulations and incentives. Financial incentives can be used to ensure that the full social costs of infrastructure disruptions are accounted for, encouraging service providers to go beyond just meeting mandatory standards. Improve decision making. Access to better data, tools, and skills is needed to build resilience: for instance, digital elevation models for urban areas are not expensive and are critical to inform hundreds of billions of dollars in investments per year. Provide financing. The right kind of financing at the right time is key. For example, the amounts of resources needed to support regulators and consider natural risks at the early stages of infrastructure design are small compared to the billions needed to repair and recover in the aftermath of a disaster.

There is no time to waste. With a rapidly changing climate and large investments in infrastructure taking place in many countries, business as usual over the next decade would cost us $1 trillion more. By getting it right, however, we can provide the critical infrastructure services – lifelines – for better development for those who need it the most.

With the technical and financial assistance from Japan, the government will also set up six body scanners -- four at HSIA, one each at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chattogram, and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet -- for the screening outbound passengers.

The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) yesterday approved about Tk 60 crore for “The Project for Security Improvement of International Airport”. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina presided over the meeting at the NEC conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital.

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will bear 90 percent of the cost.

The project is scheduled for completion by June next year.

According to the planning ministry proposal, JICA has already surveyed the airports to identify necessary requirements.

The PM asked the authorities to keep dog squads at the airports to improve security, Planning Minister MA Mannan told journalists after the meeting.

On March 8, 2016, the UK government imposed a temporary ban on Dhaka-London direct air cargo after UK experts found serious security lapses and risks at the Dhaka airport during its inspections.

Following the ban, the government appointed an UK firm to ensure security and train staffers of the airport.

In 2016, the Ecnec had approved a Tk 89.55 crore project for purchasing security equipment for all the three international airports.

An official of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh yesterday said under that project, explosive detection systems, liquid explosive detection systems, dual view x-ray scanning machines, and under-vehicle scanning machines had been installed.

Following the steps, the UK government fully withdrew the ban in February 2018.

Mostly apparel items, vegetables, and agricultural products go to London.

Yesterday, the Ecnec approved 11 projects, including the improvement of airport security, involving around Tk 8,053 crore.

While okaying the projects, Hasina gave several directives to the ministries concerned. She asked for formulation of a master plan to set up service centres/restaurants along highways across the country for transport workers.

A planning ministry official said if the plan was implemented, passengers and transport workers could rest there. This would help reduce occurrence of accidents, he added.

Hasina also asked the Local Government Division to formulate a master plan so that waste management system was implemented even at union levels.

The Ecnec approved another project to move chemical warehouses of Old Dhaka to Kathaldia in Gazipur’s Tongi temporarily, as the long-time plan to set up a permanent hub would take time.

The project involves Tk 91.74 crore.

According to the ministry proposal, licensed chemical traders would be able to keep imported chemical products at the makeshift warehouses.

The project’s design has already been completed and it is scheduled to be finished by June next year.

The government, following a blaze in Old Dhaka’s Nimtoli in 2010, in which 124 died, decided to move chemical warehouses from residential areas to industrial zones in Keraniganj or Kamrangir Char. After this year’s Chawkbazar fire that claimed 70 lives, relocation of the chemical factories and warehouses became a hot topic again.

A Tk 201.80 crore project to be implemented on 50 acres of land in Keraniganj is scheduled to be completed in June 2021. The Ecnec approved the project last year.

Nearly six years -- from June 2011 to 2017 -- were spent on forming committees, holding meetings, selecting project site, deciding its size and reaching an agreement with industry owners, according to the project documents.

The Ecnec yesterday also approved a revised project on constructing a 330MW power plant in Khulna, increasing the cost by 20.45 percent to Tk 3,919 crore.

The deadline of the project was extended by three years. Earlier, the deadline was 2019.","Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/shahjalal-airport.jpg?itok=MHm01Zlp,"['tk', 'international', 'approved', 'intl', 'airport', 'security', 'airports', 'project', 'plan', 'chemical', 'scanners', 'ecnec', 'uk']", 
40,40,FL-2019-000079-BGD,The budget could take a 'huge hit' from climate change - Federal Times,https://www.federaltimes.com/federal-oversight/watchdogs/2019/06/14/the-budget-could-take-a-huge-hit-from-climate-change/,"The federal government must invest in resilience and make governmentwide plans to manage climate change risks in order to prevent billions of dollars in future disaster aid costs, according to a report released by the Government Accountability Office June 11.

The government has spent $450 billion in disaster aid since 2005, and vulnerability to climate change will further impact federal disaster aid, federal flood and crop insurance programs and federal property and land – posing a huge hit to the federal budget.

The problem, however, is that the government does not have important “information needed by policymakers to help understand the budgetary impacts” of climate change necessary for them to anticipate changes and make informed spending decisions, said the report.

The government “had no comprehensive strategic approach for identifying, prioritizing, and implementing investments for disaster resilience,” according to the report, and the lack of strategic governmentwide planning is “partly because of the inherently complicated and crosscutting nature of the issue.”

For example, “the federal budget does not generally account for disaster assistance by Congress or long-term impacts of climate change on existing federal infrastructure and programs.”

Also, the federal crop and flood insurance programs “were not designed to generate sufficient funds to fully cover all losses and expenses,” and the programs need budget authority from Congress to operate. As of April, the National Flood Insurance Program is $21 billion in debt.

The federal government also owns and operates hundreds of thousands of facilities and millions of acres of land that could be affected by climate change. Just last year, two military installations — Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida — were both damaged by hurricanes, which cost billions of dollars in repairs.

The federal government does include some “individual agency efforts that could help build resilience within existing programs or projects,” according to the report. For example, “the U.S. military integrates climate risks into its analysis, plans and programs, with particular attention paid to climate effects on force readiness, military bases, and training ranges.”

Also, “elevating homes and strengthened building codes in Texas and Florida prevented greater damages during the 2017 hurricane season.”

Congress also passed the Disaster Recovery Reform Act in 2018, “which could improve state and local resilience to disasters.” However, “it is too early to tell what impact the implementation [DRRA] will have on state and local resilience.”

According to the report, the government must develop a strategic and cohesive plan to “manage risks across the entire range of related federal activities.”

As of December 2018, 25 of GAO’s 62 recommendations to reduce federal fiscal risk remain open. Recommendations included providing policymakers with the best possible information and providing “best-available forward-looking climate information to organizations that develop design standards and building codes to enhance infrastructure resilience.”

The House Budget Committee held a hearing the same day the report was released where they discussed the risk of climate change on federal finances and the U.S. economy.

“Climate change is an environmental issue. It’s a public health issue. It’s a national security issue. And, as we’ll talk about today, it’s increasingly an economic and fiscal issue,” Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., said in his opening statement.

“The only people who fail to understand the seriousness of climate change are the Trump administration and some of our Republican colleagues,” Yarmuth said. “If they are not moved by environmental, health and security consequences, I hope the economic costs and the impact on the federal budget will get their attention — because we cannot afford to wait for them to catch up.”

“The effects of climate change have already and will continue to pose risks that can create fiscal exposure across the federal government and this exposure will continue to increase,” J. Alfredo Gómez, a director in GAO’s Natural Resources and Environment team, said in his testimony.

Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, criticized the Democrats for not passing a budget and asked Chairman Yarmuth “how can we have a discussion serious discussion about climate change on this committee without addressing the primary plank of the platform that you and your colleagues have offered — the Green New Deal — to resolve climate change?”

Yarmuth noted that “there are 11 committees that have jurisdiction over [Green New Deal] legislation and we’re not one of them” and that the Green New Deal does not have the support of a majority of Democrats.","Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/PAaDj64051zaNZRnOMCKIa5l3Zk=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VCKONPKTKVD7LENAGBDRFPDGN4.jpg,"['programs', 'huge', 'climate', 'budget', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'change', 'report', 'issue', 'federal', 'risks', 'hit']",

42,42,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Local Government in Laos Again Falls Behind on Living Allowances for Dam Collapse Survivors - Radio Free Asia (RFA),https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/laos-living-allowance-unpaid-06122019155013.html,"The government in Laos’ Attapeu province has once again fallen behind on living allowance payments it promised to survivors of the country’s worst flooding in decades.

Many survivors lost their homes and land, and even family members in a disaster that occurred last July when a saddle dam at the Xe Pian Xe Namnoy (PNPC) hydropower project collapsed following heavy rains, inundating 12 villages and killing at least 40 people in Laos’ southern Champassak and Attapeu provinces, and leaving many more missing.

Each survivor is entitled to $12 per month for food and other living expenses, but some have not received any cash from the government for almost three months, sources say.

According to an RFA report from November 2018, the province at that time hadn’t paid out allowances for two months. Now they are falling behind again.

The head of one of one family that lost everything in the disaster told RFA’s Lao Service on Tuesday that the government has given them some essentials but has not fulfilled its obligations in full.

“No food allowance,” said the source.

“We’ve received only rice, but not money for food. The authorities haven’t’ paid us for more than two months, almost three months now,” the source said.

The source added that the government cleared land for them, but even that was unhelpful.

“My family received 2 hectares of land that has been cleared, but it’s not good for growing anything. We were told to plant cassava and then sell it to a company, but so far nobody has [been able to grow] anything yet,” the source said.

The source said that following the government’s directives would actually cost the family more than doing nothing.

“It’s not worth doing because we’ll be growing cassava for a company that will withhold some of our income for clearing land and for capital,” referring to the money spent by the company to help clear the land and help them to grow the root.

“The company is also providing technical expertise, seeds, marketing and farming equipment. We the victims are meant to contribute labor and land from the government,” said the source.

Another survivor, from Tamayor Village in Attapeu province’s Sanamxay district, told RFA last month, “We haven’t received allowances for April and May. Instead of our allowance, they gave each family a fishing net and told us to fish for our needs.”

Attapeu Provincial Governor Leth Xayaphone last month said the province was “having a problem with the funding. We are not able to payout [allowances] right now. But the provincial government is trying to get more funding from the [central] government and other sources.”

An official of Attapeu province’s agriculture and forestry department confirmed to RFA late last month that authorities had allocated a piece of land of about 460 hectares to a Chinese-Vietnamese company for a banana plantation in Sanamxay District.

Banana ban

The revelation that bananas are being grown on land set aside for flood victims came just two weeks after the Lao government vowed to enforce a ban on the granting of land for new banana plantations and punish local officials who violate it, amid a controversy over the illegal overuse of pesticides that residents say are causing pollution and destroying their livelihoods.

Concerns over chemical run-off from heavily polluting Chinese-owned banana plantations led in January 2017 to government orders forbidding new banana concessions, though many farms still operate under contracts valid for several more years.

But local officials have granted a number of firms land for new banana plantations in recent months, despite the government ban, in provinces that include Xayabury, Oudomxay, Borikhamxay, and Savannakhet, while other companies are negotiating for new farms elsewhere in the country, such as Vientiane province, sources told RFA.

An earlier report by RFA found that the 460 hectare concession was part of a 2,000 hectare plot that had been promised to relocated survivors. In that report, the governor had said that the intent was to allow the company to help the survivors with jobs and a share of the profits.

But RFA’s Lao Service now reports that the parts of the 2,000 hectare plot that are not being used for bananas are now intended for survivors to plant cassava.

43,43,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Bad loans soar - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/bangladesh-bank-reports-defaulted-loans-soar-1755172,"Defaulted loans soared to Tk 110,874 crore as of March this year, the highest ever in the country.

The record was broken as the first quarter figures for this calendar year, released by the Bangladesh Bank yesterday, revealed that Tk 16,962 crore of classified loans were added to the tally, which was another record.

Now defaulted loans account for 11.87 percent of total outstanding loans, up from 10.30 percent in December 2018. In March 2018, the percentage was 10.78, according to the central bank.

“The government and the central bank must take full responsibility for this desperate situation,” said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute.

At the turn of the year, defaulted loans totalled Tk 93,911 crore. But as rumours started spreading that the central bank plans to extend a host of facilities to loan defaulters, many stopped paying instalments hoping to avail the benefits.

The rumours were confirmed on May 16 when Bangladesh Bank unveiled a set of extraordinary facilities for the defaulters.

As per the new policy, defaulters would be allowed to reschedule their classified loans by providing only 2 percent down payment, instead of the existing 10-50 percent.

A maximum of 9 percent interest rate would be levied on the rescheduled loans, lower than the existing 12-16 percent. The time for repayment was also generously set to 10 years with a grace period of another year.

The policy said the accrued interest on the defaulted loan could be waived, based on the bank’s relationship with the client, and the defaulter could only pay the principle amount and the new 9 percent interest rate.

The move came hot on the heels of Bangladesh Bank’s attempt to ease the loan classification rules, including giving borrowers more time to pay off their instalments and relaxing the loan write-off policy.

These were allegedly done to have a lower default-loan figure but the latest data suggests it backfired.

Even though the High Court stayed until June 23 the implementation of the new loan rescheduling policy, defaulters still believe that they would be able to enjoy the benefits, Mansur of PRI said.

“There is no ray of hope of arresting this upward trend of defaulted loans.”

This means the government would have its hands tied while financing the budget for 2019-20, due to be unveiled on Thursday.

“It will be unable to borrow much from banks to manage the deficit financing,” said Mansur, also a former economist of the International Monetary Fund.

Of late, the government has been borrowing heavily through high-cost savings instruments instead of low-cost bank loans.

In the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the government did not borrow from banks and repaid them. But from May 1, it started borrowing, sending the cash-strapped banks into a state of panic, sources said.

Due to the high amount of defaulted loans, the liquidity crisis at banks continues to worsen. This has also limited their capacity to extend funds to the government, they said.

“In the banking sector, political influence should be immediately stopped,” Mansur said urging the central bank to crack down on large corporate groups who have piled up defaulted loans.

He said the actions taken by the government should be revised at the earliest to recover the loans.

The Bangladesh Bank data shows that more than 52 percent of the defaulted loans were with eight state-run banks. As of this March, the eight banks had Tk 58,667 crore defaulted loans, up by 9.69 percent from the previous three months. Forty private banks had defaulted loans of Tk 49,950 crore, up by 31 percent from the previous quarter.

Banks are now forced to disburse loans to some quarters due to political influence, said AB Mirza Azizul Islam, a former adviser to a caretaker government.

“This has played a major role in escalating the loan-default situation.”

Besides, private bank directors often sanction loans due to nepotism or personal relationships with clients.

“The central bank must put an end to such culture,” Azizul added.

Arfan Ali, managing director of Bank Asia, said many businesspeople were unwilling to repay loans believing that they would not get fresh credit in the near future as banks were in liquidity crisis.

Salehuddin Ahmed, former governor of Bangladesh Bank, said the latest figure of defaulted loans would create chaos for the government’s plans to be unveiled on Thursday.

The escalating defaulted loans would choke private investment, an important component for economic growth, and limit the government’s capacity to subsidise various sectors, he said.

Bangladesh Bank should move away from giving special facilities to defaulters on an ad-hoc basis as the practice encouraged them to perpetrate financial crimes, he added.

Md Serajul Islam, spokesperson and an executive director of Bangladesh Bank, said some banks have failed to recover loans after rescheduling defaulted loans in recent months. This had an adverse effect.

Lenders have also adopted a cautious policy in disbursing fresh loans, due to which the percentage of defaulted loans look bigger, he claimed.","Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/bad_loans_soar.jpg?itok=iiIZr7dK,"['tk', 'banks', 'bangladesh', 'crore', 'central', 'soar', 'bank', 'bad', 'loan', 'loans', 'defaulted', 'policy']",

45,45,FL-2019-000079-BGD,"Agriculture sector to get Tk 14,053 crore - United News of Bangladesh",https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/agriculture-sector-to-get-tk-14053-crore/20041,"Dhaka, June 23 (UNB) - Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal on Thursday proposed to allocate Tk 14,053 crore for the development of agricultural sector , up by 139 crore from last year’s allocation.

The minister came up with the proposal while unveiling the national budget for the 2019-20 fiscal year in parliament.

Mustafa Kamal said activities for the innovation of crop varieties tolerant to flood, drought, salinity and high temperature by conducting applied research will get priority in the next fiscal year in order to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.

He said mechanisation of harvesting and the follow-up activities will be encouraged and subsidies will be provided to farmers to buy machinery for this purpose.

“As many as 15 new varieties of different crops and 10 climate resilient technology have been innovated in the current fiscal year. A total of 329 high-yielding variety of different crops tolerant to salinity and water submergence have been innovated since 2009,” he said.

Besides, 47 extension of crop diversification, popularising organic pest management activities and mechanization of farming will be reinforced, said the minister.

He also announced that the government will continue successful interventions, such as agricultural subsidies, other agricultural input incentives and support cards, including those for fertilizers and seeds, support for agricultural rehabilitation, agriculture credit at easy terms, etc.

A total of Tk. 5,201 crore was spent on this sector in FY2017- 18. The present government has kept the sales price of fertilisers unchanged in the domestic market with a view to proteting farmers' interests even though the import price of major chemical fertilisers increased at times, which has indirectly assisted in checking consumer price inflation.

The sales price for chemical fertilisers will be kept unchanged in the next fiscal year irrespective of their import costs, and incentives for the agriculture sector will continue, said the Minister.","Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://unb.com.bd/watermark/category/Bangladesh/english/20041/agriculture-sector-to-get-tk-14053-crore,"['activities', 'tk', 'minister', 'sector', 'fiscal', 'price', 'crore', 'agricultural', 'agriculture', 'varieties', '14053', 'unchanged', 'fertilisers']",

Cyclone Vayu is expected to make landfall in Gujarat state, on India’s western coast on the afternoon of 13 June.

As the tropical storm hits, it’s expected to bring with it potentially damaging winds gusts of up to 112mph, and sea surges of up to 6½ feet that could flood low-lying coastal areas.

The cyclone, named after the Hindi word for wind, was then forecast to skirt around India’s coast as it travelled west towards Pakistan, retaining its strength for up to 12 hours.

The severe weather follows just over a month on from when the devastating Cyclone Fani hit India’s eastern coast on the Bay of Bengal, killing 34 in India and 15 in neighbouring Bangladesh.

The scale of the possible damage from the latest cyclone wasn’t clear, but meteorologists predicted it had the potential to damage thatched homes, flood key routes, damage crops, uproot trees, contaminate drinking water supplies and disrupt communication and power.

Local authorities were on high alert on Wednesday as they prepared for the storm which was building in the Arabian Sea.

Home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with government and military officials, as the air force airlifted 40 National Disaster Response Force rescue and relief teams to the western coast in preparation for the cyclone hitting.

By midday on Wednesday rescue teams had begun evacuating more than a quarter of a million people in towns and villages likely to bear the brunt of the storm.

In the ancient city of Dwarka, where many Hindu pilgrims travel every year to pray at a temple considered the centre of Lord Krishna’s kingdom, rescue workers from India’s National Disaster Response Force warned children to leave the beach.

Meanwhile, Vijay Rupani, Gujarat’s chief minister, requested tourists leave coastal areas by Wednesday afternoon.

And Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, said on Twitter that he had “been constantly in touch with state governments” and that he was “praying for the safety and wellbeing” of all those affected.

49,49,FL-2019-000079-BGD,It's time for action on climate-driven displacement - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/its-time-for-action-on-climate-driven-displacement/,"According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, in 2017 more than 18.8 million people were displaced by disasters, 95 per cent of them by weather-related disasters.

Storms and floods were responsible for almost 90 per cent of those displacements, continuing a trend seen over the last decade.

Since 2008, disasters have replaced conflict as the predominant trigger for internal displacement. And we see more and more new records emerge that are fueled by global heating. The rapid escalation of the climate emergency has caused significant displacement in recent years.

Behind all of these numbers and facts, there are people.

The village of Mutua in Mozambique has become the site of a large displacement camp, following cyclones that hit the nation. Three months later, more than 300 people, most of them women and girls, still call the camp home. These families are struggling to rebuild their lives, and many are afraid to return to the villages where their houses were engulfed by water.

A mother of three has been living in the camp since Mutua was destroyed by flood waters over two months ago.

“I was in the field when a strong storm and heavy rains started. It was moving the houses, trees and crops. I was worried about my children. When I arrived home, my house was flooded and all my belongings, including cooking utensils, were washed away. I went with my children to a school nearby our home,” explains Vitorina.

“I am 32 years old but I had never seen such a huge amount of water,” she added. Stories like hers are becoming the new normal, particularly in poorer nations. These stories must drive urgent and ambitious climate action so that a stable home is no longer a dream but a reality.

Climate change is directly driving displacement, such as through extreme weather events that are destroying homes and flooding communities, as well as indirectly by exacerbating other drivers, such as increasing water stress or food insecurity.

In many regions that are already subject to extreme displacement, such as the Sahel and the Mediterranean, the climate crisis will make things worse, in particular if global temperature rise exceeds 1.5°C.

Last year, a World Bank report concluded that, under a scenario of 3°C increase or more in global average temperature—where the world is currently headed—the number of internally displaced people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America by 2050—140 million—could be up to three times the number compared to a 1.5°C scenario.

A lot of things need to be done to tackle the climate crisis: but this emergency is still a battle we can win. Here’s how:

Undertaking all efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels would be a major contribution to limit displacement as it would keep more parts of the planet inhabitable.

“ Under a scenario of 3°C increase or more in global average temperature the number of internally displaced people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America by 2050 could be up to three times the number compared to a 1.5°C scenario.

But it is clear that, as of now, the world is not on track to meet this goal, and efforts to sustainably develop with low to zero CO2 emissions need to be massively scaled-up. Countries need to respond to the call of the UN Secretary General to develop concrete plans to cut emissions.

But they also need to find ways to integrate tactics to address climate change and displacement into other national plans and policies. An expert group under the UNFCCC’s loss and damage mechanism already developed useful advice to governments on how to do that.

Good measures to build resilience that focus on women in particular, for example through climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction, can help reduce the displacement drivers of climate change through improvements in people’s livelihoods and resilience.

But rising to the challenge requires much higher investments in local-level adaptation and disaster risk reduction, particularly in the most vulnerable areas.

As resources are scarce, particularly in areas that have hardly contributed least to the climate crisis, scaled-up finance from developed countries is vital, but this must also be complemented by new and additional finance from innovative sources, such as those for example discussed for the Green Climate Fund. Otherwise scarce development aid resources will be further strained.

Where displacement cannot be avoided, it is essential that governments ensure that institutions respect, fulfil, promote and protect all human rights for persons crossing borders in the context of the climate crisis. It is the people and communities who are forced to migrate who suffer most.

Urgently increasing action commensurate to the climate emergency also means helping those displaced to achieve a safer, dignified and more resilient future.

Siddique made a criminal breach of trust and made the public exchequer incur a loss of Tk40.69 lakh

A Bogra court has sent former textiles and jute minister Abdul Latif Siddique to jail over graft charges.

Judge Naresh Chandra Sarkar of Bogra Special Judge Court after a hearing on Thursday rejected Latif’s bail petition in the case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) over the misuse of power in leasing a piece of state-owned land.

ACC’s Public Prosecutor (PP) Abul Kalam Azad confirmed it to Dhaka Tribune saying: “Arrest warrants were issued against Latif Siddique and one Begum Jahanara Rashid.""

Earlier, Latif Siddique appeared before the court with a bail petition, but the court sent him to jail after rejecting the plea.

Advocate Al Mahmud stood for the defence while Abul Kalam Azad stood for the prosecution.

According to the prosecution, Latif Siddique had misused the power vested upon him as the jute and textiles minister and sold 2.38 acres of land at Ranirnagar Bazar in Adamdighi upazila to one Jahanara in 2011 — flouting the rule of selling government land after floating tenders.

By selling the land at Tk23.94 lakh instead of the original market price of at least Tk64.63 lakh, Siddique made a criminal breach of trust made the public exchequer incur a loss of Tk40.69 lakh.

Although the bank had reported thefts in two of their ATM booths, investigators later found that around Tk 16 lakh was stolen from a total of nine of the bank’s ATMs in different areas of the capital.

Investigators suspect that the hackers might have stolen money from ATMs of other private banks as well.

Abul Kashem Md Shirin, managing director of DBBL, could not be reached for comments over phone despite several attempts till the filing of this report at 11:40pm.

Meanwhile, after scrutinising CCTV footages, the investigators now suspect that around 12 to 15 Ukrainians -- who are believed to be members of an international hacker group -- were involved with the heist.

Molla Nazrul Islam, special superintendent of CID’s organised crime unit, said the criminals were members of a North Korean hacker group named “Hidden Cobra”.

He said they had links to the “Lazarus Group”, the infamous gang involved in the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist.

Nazrul added that they had warned bank authorities recently after getting a tip-off from an international intelligence agency about such a hacker group.

The CID official said three types of crimes happened during the ATM theft: cyber-attack, money heist and money laundering.

According to investigators, the gang chose the Eid period for their heist as bank transactions reach a maximum during this period. After the theft, the gang was supposed to go to India on June 6.

Detective Branch (DB), Cybercrime unit of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) and CID of police are now jointly investigating the incident.

DB sources said the hacked ATMs of Dutch Bangla Bank include two in Khilgaon, one in Kakrail, one in Radisson Hotel, one in DIT road in Rampura and two in Nikunja areas.

The investigators are also looking into the involvement of local criminals in this connection.

The investigators have also sought information from the special branch of police on all Ukrainian nationals who had arrived in and left Bangladesh between May 15 and May 30.

Earlier, cloned cards were used to steal money from ATMs, but the suspects used a new method this time which law enforcers had not seen before, said police.

In the new method, a card was inserted in the ATM and the machine’s connection with the bank’s server got severed, after which the suspects just took money out. The method also left no record of the transaction in the bank’s server.

DB sources, quoting an IT expert, said although such kind of heist was new to Bangladesh, it has been seen in other countries where criminals used Tyupkin, a strain of malware, to empty ATMs.

Tyupkin malware was first discovered in 2014.

For it to work, one needed to gain physical access to an ATM and infect it with the Tyupkin malware. Once the machine was infected, it disabled all network connections and even if the administrators detected any suspicious activity, it could not be interrupted.

Police said forensic experts were now working on the latest thefts.

The cybercriminals came to attention after police arrested six Ukrainian nationals on June 2. They were all placed on three-day remands on June 3.

One of their alleged cohorts is still on the run and immigration police at airports have been alerted about the matter, police said.

According to investigators, the seven suspects landed in Dhaka together on May 30 and stole money from an ATM booth in middle Badda the very next day.

In the latest case, it was mentioned that Tk 4.5 lakh was stolen from the Badda ATM booth on May 31.

On June 1, they stole money from the other booths. During the series of thefts, one of the hackers was detained while he was trying to steal money from the bank’s ATM in Taltola of Khilgaon.

During the attempted theft, two of the foreigners went to the booth wearing masks and caps. The security guard became suspicious and called locals for help, who were able to catch one of them and hand him over to police.

Police raided a hotel in Panthapath based on information provided by the detainee and arrested the six alleged hackers. One member of the gang is still on the run, said the official.

Dutch Bangla Bank Ltd authorities filed a case against the seven Ukrainians and other unnamed people with Khilgaon Police Station under the digital security act on June 2.

Shahidur Rahman Ripon, additional deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s detective branch (East), said they were yet to interrogate the arrestees as they were now analysing their profiles.

“Hopefully, we will start interrogating them from tomorrow,” he said.","Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/offenders.jpg?itok=-Tq9bl5d,"['investigators', 'banks', 'case', 'gang', 'intl', 'hacker', 'theft', 'victims', 'atms', 'bank', 'atm', 'fraud', 'dbbl', 'money']",

They reached the 322-run target -- equaling their highest-ever successful chase in ODIs and also accomplishing the second-highest successful chase in World Cup history, with 8.3 overs to spare. Ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan will rightfully be touted as the hero of the match after his back-to-back ton but even though Liton Das may not quite be the unsung hero, the right-hander’s contribution to the cause will leave a mark, and indeed something any supporting batsman can learn from.

Much is expected of the seniors in the side and after Soumya Sarkar’s fiery knock at the top, Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan provided the perfect foundation for Tigers to pull off an epic feat against the formidable Windies pace attack. However, after Tamim fell unfortunately and Mushfiqur Rahim followed suit soon after, the chase indeed appeared a mountain too high to surmount.

Many times, Bangladesh have stuttered from such positions and the pressure was beginning to tell, but how Liton organised his batting effort to support Shakib after the loss of two key wickets was telling.

The most spectacular facet of his innings was how unspectacularly he resorted to normalcy. Liton’s presence during the front end of that 189-run unbroken partnership was inconspicuous to say the least. It was exactly what was needed too as Shakib kept firing on all cylinders.

Liton did not waste his time trying to get in and play big shots, he dealt in singles while allowing his natural flair to take over on loose deliveries. It worked immensely well from the beginning. If Shakib had looked a bit unsettled after the loss of Tamim and Mushfiqur, the all-rounder gradually settled into a more match-winning groove, playing some immense shots to take the game away from the West Indies.

As is often the case, when a set batsman has to look to persevere during a key chase, another one has to take on the mantle of run-making responsibilities. Liton had struck just one boundary during his first 23 off 28 deliveries but he launched into the Windies bowlers when Shakib edged closer to his ton.

A magnificent slashed six over third man off Sheldon Cottrell took the partnership past 100. Having brought up his fifty and with Tigers past 250-mark, he then came into his own. He sent Shannon Gabriel thrice over the fence in consecutive deliveries to signal his and Shakib’s dominance.

He missed out on a ton, remaining unbeaten on 94 off just 69 deliveries as Bangladesh pulled off victory but, in many ways, how he paced his innings and supported Shakib was more crucial to the Tigers than just the runs he scored.","Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/liton_38.jpg?itok=HF3nvVN8,"['litons', 'tigers', 'west', 'liton', 'fiddle', 'victory', 'tamim', 'second', 'deliveries', 'chase', 'shakib', 'perfect', 'world', 'windies']", 
53,53,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Climate Change and the Reinsurance Implications - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/13/529201.htm,"Climate change presents “high exposure risk” to insurers and their policyholders on many fronts:

General liability claims for third-party bodily injury and property damage, directors and officers claims for a company’s failure to properly disclose climate-related or failure to align its business model with a low-carbon future and first-party loss, including business interruption.

To date, there have been minimal coverage actions relating to climate change, but expect that to change given the increasing number of underlying lawsuits and related activity, “coupled with the staggering liability that is at stake.

That’s all according to a white paper, Climate Change and the (RE)Insurance Implications, released on Wednesday.

The paper, coauthored by Traub Lieberman Straus & Shrewsberry LLP and Aspen Re, examines the insurance issues surrounding climate change, including the science, data, litigation, cost and examples of international and national action and insurance implications.

Visit Insurance Journal’s Research & Trends Section to read the full report.

The litigation landscape has been changing, which in turn has implications for the reinsurance industry, especially those transacting commercial general liability, D&O and property business. And reinsurers as investors must appraise their investment strategy, including fossil fuel and renewable energy companies, to help mitigate the projected impact of climate change, according to the paper.

The paper notes that 2017 was the costliest year on record for natural catastrophe events, with $344 billion in global economic loss, of which 97 percent was due to weather-related events, while insured loss estimates from natural catastrophes totaled $140 billion in 2017.

A 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that global economic damages by 2100 would reach $54 trillion with a 1.5-degrees Celsius of warming of the planet, $69 trillion with 2 degrees Celsius of warming and $551 trillion with 3.7 degrees Celsius of warming.

Some bullet points from the report include:

Climate litigation is increasing and reflects advancements in science and economic modelling, discovery of corporations climate knowledge, public involvement and a more collaborative approach of cities, experts and the legal community. There has been a dearth of coverage actions and decisional law relating to insurance for climate change liability is virtually non-existent – but that will likely change soon, given the rising prominence of the issue, the substantial costs involved and the increased litigation activity by municipalities and private parties against fossil fuel companies and other target defendants.

The world’s leading insurance companies have made some progress in setting climate strategy, targets and risk management in place, although those in the U.S. are lagging those in Europe and Japan. Both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet are vulnerable and insurers have played a part in divestment from the fossil fuel industry and this is expected to continue.

Climate change implications include potential credit rating downgrades for coastal municipalities given sea level projections and possible rapid escalation of flood insurance premiums, given the current indebtedness of National Flood Insurance Program and the strong push for significant legislative reform, including accounting for specific flood risks associated with the location and structural characteristics of the property, rather than much more general underwriting criteria currently in use.

Financial Regulator

A top regulator recently compared the financial risks from climate change to the devastation of the mortgage meltdown that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.

Rostin Behnam, who sits on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, aired his concerns about climate change in a New York Times story on Tuesday.

“If climate change causes more volatile frequent and extreme weather events, you’re going to have a scenario where these large providers of financial products — mortgages, home insurance, pensions — cannot shift risk away from their portfolios,” he said in the NY Times article. “It’s abundantly clear that climate change poses financial risk to the stability of the financial system.”

Behnam is a Democrat who was appointed by President Trump.

The commission consists of five commissioners appointed by the President for five-year terms. No more than three commissioners at a time may be from the same political party.

Behnam’s stance is definitely not the stance of Trump, who has the U.S. prepared to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

Behnam told the NY Times that his interest in climate change’s impact on the financial world stems from six years working for Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, on the Senate Agriculture Committee.

Behnam plans to eventually form a panel of experts at the commission who will produce a report on how global warming could affect the financial sector, potentially impacting food costs, insurance markets, the mortgage industry and other economic pillars, according to the article.

Violent Conflicts

Climate change will intensify violent conflicts, according to a Stanford University study published on Wednesday in the Journal Nature.

Estimates in the study show climate has influenced between 3 percent and 20 percent of armed conflict risk over the last century – and things could get worse.

“Intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict,” the study states.

Climate change’s influence on conflicts would more than double (a 13 percent chance) with 2 degrees Celsius of warming, while its influence on conflicts would increase to 26 percent chance with 4 degrees of warming, according to the study.

How so?

Extreme weather driven by climate change, along with related disasters, can hurt economies, and impact farming and livestock production – thereby intensifying social inequality – and all of this can lead to an increased risk of violence, according to the study.

The researchers acknowledged they don’t fully understand how and under what conditions climate affects conflict, and that “other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climate-conflict linkages remain a key uncertainty.”

Rain, Rain

“Record Rain Is Drowning Fields in the Midwest — Is It Climate Change?”

That’s the question posed in a blog in Discover posted this week, which notes the past 12 months in the U.S. have been the wettest on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration measurements dating back to 1895.

“If things don’t dry out soon, some farmers may miss their planting window entirely and will have to wait until next year to plant a crop,” the story states, adding that it’s too soon to say if this year’s crop and flood damages can be attributed to climate change, but “predictions for a warmer future have these areas slated for more of these extreme rainfall events.”

The rain has kept farm equipment out of the fields, and had made it difficult to plant seeds.

By the time June rolls around, 96 percent of the U.S. corn crop has typically been planted. As of this week, 83 percent of those crops were planted, putting farmers far behind schedule, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

“A soggy start to the corn season could mean less corn later this year,” the article states. “Consumers won’t see much of an increase when it comes to corn at the supermarket, but meat and dairy farms are likely to feel the pinch as feed prices rise. It takes a lot more corn to make a hamburger than it does to make a box of corn flakes, so prices will rise accordingly.”

In Maharashtra – the epicentre of the drought gripping the country – farmers are abandoning dying crops and people are struggling to find enough water to survive

On June 5, it drizzled for about ten minutes over most of Marathwada in India’s western state of Maharashtra. That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.

Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”

A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada – a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities – ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats – a mountain chain along the coast – and has always been a low rainfall area.

However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean – the two staple crops of the region in recent decades – bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well. But apart from 2016, no one has any recent memory of a good rainfall year in this region with a population of about 18.7 million people, most of whom are farmers.

Impending crisis

Residents say this year’s drought is the worst since 1972, a contention supported by rainfall data. Not only was the 2018 monsoon scanty, it has not rained at all during winter, when farmers do expect a few showers for their Rabi (winter) crops.

The Maharashtra government has calculated that the state’s winter foodgrain output has fallen by 63% compared to the previous winter, output of cereals has fallen by 68%, pulses by 51%, oilseeds 70%, wheat 61%, maize 75% and sesame 92%.

That is not a surprise, says Vijay Anna Borade, head of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agricultural Science Centre) at Jalna and one of India’s most respected experts in dryland farming. “There has been hardly any sowing, so how do you expect any output?”

Since this has become the new normal, does Borade see any future for dryland farming in Marathwada and Vidharbha in Maharashtra, or in Telangana or northern Karnataka – the vast region in the centre of India where agrarian distress is at its worst?

“I cannot make a prediction,” the scientist responds, “because it depends not only on the amount of rainfall during a monsoon season, but also on the distribution of that rainfall…It does not help the farmer if all that rainfall comes down in a few heavy bursts rather than being evenly spaced out over four months. In fact, such heavy spells of rain harm the plants a lot.”

Climate change

The global collective of climate scientists, the IPCC, has been saying this is exactly one of the main impacts of climate change – fewer rainy days, but heavier rainfall on those days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is well aware of the need to predict rainfall distribution more accurately and over smaller areas – it does have a service called Agrimet that provides a five-day rainfall forecast and cropping advisories. But the scientists are also aware that they need more weather stations for higher accuracy, and money is always a problem.

Borade is confident that if the monsoon rainfall in Marathwada is even 80-90% of the long-period average, dryland crops are hardy enough to flourish, as long as the rainfall is evenly spread. Right now, he is doing what every dryland farmer in India is doing, looking at the monsoon forecasts and praying for rain. The 2019 summer monsoon has reached the Indian mainland; but the winds have then stalled, partly due to the formation of a cyclone in the Arabian Sea. IMD has forecast that this year’s monsoon rainfall will be around 96% of the long-period average over India as a whole.

Search for water

Like Sakharam Langde, hundreds of thousands of farmers in Marathwada and Vidharbha are ploughing their fields in the hope of a good monsoon. That takes up a couple of hours a day. The rest of the time is spent looking for enough water so that the family and the domestic animals can survive.

The main drinking water well in Umarkheda has gone dry, as in every village in the region. Every alternate day, the district administration sends a tractor towing a 50,000-litre water tanker. That water is poured into the well, and residents scramble to pull it out. Every household has two or three 20-litre vessels attached with ropes, and residents – mostly women and girls – jostle at the lip of the well pulling out the water. The faster you are, the stronger in pushing your neighbours away, the more water you have.

“Within 20 minutes, that well goes totally dry again,” says resident Yashwant Langde.

“I cannot do this,” says Jyoti Bai, a frail woman in her early seventies. “I have to depend on my two granddaughters. They are only eight and ten years old. There is so much pushing and shoving that I’m always afraid they will fall into the well. I’ve heard of such accidents in other villages.” The Maharashtra government has banned this practice of pouring water into wells. But the ban is flouted by its own employees, who say there is no other place where they can pour the water.”

“We get so little water that we can have a bath only about once a week,” says Jyoti Bai, “although you can see how hot it is. It is leading to skin diseases. Look at my granddaughters.” The stick-thin girls are all matted hair and scaly skin.

“What is to be done,” asks their mother. “There has been no production in the farm. There is no money at home. So their father has gone to Pune to work as a labourer. There is no man in the house. And we don’t get enough water from the well for our two cows. So every day these girls walk over two kilometres around noon to a water point near the road, where they queue up for over an hour. Sometimes they get two vessels of water, sometimes they don’t. When they get it, they have to carry that on their heads in the afternoon heat. When they don’t get it, the cows go thirsty.”

Residents estimate that around 20% of working-age men in each village have migrated. The farmers who have stayed back, like Gajanan Langde, use their bullock carts to fetch water. “Every day, I go two-three kilometres from the village in every direction, to see which water point has any water. Sometimes, the whole day is gone by the time I fill up the vessels in the cart and come home.”

Urban malaise

The story is the same in every village, and no better in the towns. Basavraj Kore, who used to teach Marathi at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad, is proud of the kitchen garden in his Jalna home. Most of the plants survive, due to watering twice a day. “We have had to dig a very deep well and pump up the water. I know it is bad for the water table, but there’s no option. You can’t depend on the municipality – they supply water once in three weeks.”

People in all the towns of Marathwada are in the same predicament. Those living in slums are worse off. In Aurangabad – the big city of the region – 50-60 slum children chased a water tanker sprinkling a freshly laid road with buckets to catch the water as it fell, according to local media reports. Hardly a drop reached the road.

Sanjay Malani, journalist at the Marathi newspaper Prajapatra, thinks people have become inured to drought. “The droughts have gone on for so long that they have stopped expecting anything better. They have stopped expecting a decent life. They try to survive on whatever money they made from the last crop they managed to grow. When that runs out, the men migrate to the cities to work as labourers – this is a poor area and migration has always been high. Most of the high-rise buildings of Mumbai (the state capital and India’s financial capital) have been built by labourers from Marathwada. The women and children left behind spend all their time looking for water.”

W(h)ither farm insurance

With a 24-acre farm, Bhushan Rathore of Umarkheda is a big farmer by local standards. In the 2018 summer cropping season, he only got back just over half of the INR 170,000 (USD 2,448) he spent on inputs for his cotton and soybean crops, as his crops were affected by the drought. So he claimed insurance last October. He is still waiting.

So are thousands of other Marathwada farmers, as they sit around their village squares and debate whether they should pay this year’s farm insurance premium, due in July for most of them. Opinion is evenly divided – half say it will be a waste of money they don’t have, because less than 5% of the claims have been paid. The other half says not paying the premium will scupper their only chance of getting any compensation anytime.

Farm insurance premiums are paid personally by each farmer, but crop loss claims are handled collectively for a block or a district. Insurance companies go by government estimates of rainfall and crop loss, and the rainfall is considered for the entire monsoon period, without any consideration of its distribution over time. Unsurprisingly, crop loss estimates of farmers and insurers are far apart.

Yuvraj Bayal of Pangri BK village in Jalna district says he paid a premium of INR 2,500 [USD 36] plus a fee of INR 200 [USD 3] last year, and has got a compensation of INR 3,350 [USD 48]. He sees it as a bitter joke. Dhondi Sonaji Bayal of the same village paid a premium of INR 3,000, and got a claim of INR 3,000. All this is leading to a trust deficit that places the entire scheme in jeopardy.

Fodder stations

In some ways, cattle are faring better than humans in this drought. In Marathwada, the state government has set up fodder stations everywhere. The sugarcane that has been grown in low-lying areas over the last year does not have enough sugar content for the mills to buy them. So they are being sold for fodder, and you can see wagonloads being transported on all the roads all the time.

At the large fodder stations off Nagar Road on the outskirts of district headquarters town Beed, Gholab Mawli and his family have effectively set up camp since the beginning of March, together with their 12 buffaloes. The class 11 student says their 30-litre water tank is filled by the district authorities every day, and they get enough fodder for their buffaloes. It’s all free of cost, and the family of dairy farmers is happy their buffaloes are still producing enough milk for them to sell in town every day.

The cattle are under makeshift shelters built by each family, and each shelter is being guarded by at least one member of the family. In some cases, as with Gholab Mawli, the entire family has virtually moved into the shelter, commuting most days from their home two kilometres away.

Gholab Mawli’s elder brother has two large jerrycans on each side of his motorcycle, and is setting out in search of water for themselves. “The buffaloes are getting water, but we are not. I have to find water somewhere.”","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Marathwada1.jpg,"['inr', 'monsoon', 'water', 'struggle', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'day', 'farmers', 'village', 'survive', 'indias', 'region', 'marathwada', 'family']", 
56,56,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Farmers need more support - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/farmers-need-more-support-1760140,"Expressing concern over inadequate help for farmers, leading agricultural economists yesterday suggested formation of a special fund from where the growers would receive price support during harvesting period.

“Although there were emotions and voices raised on different platforms and in newspapers, they [farmers] did not get fair prices. But it [the issue] was not mentioned in the budget speech,” Prof Emeritus Abdus Sattar Mondol, former vice chancellor of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, said at a seminar in the capital.

“During the harvesting period every year, farmers don’t even get the production costs in return. Yet there has been no special allocation in this regard in the budget, which should not have been the case,” he said.

Prof Sattar said the government should provide loan facilities and special budgetary allocations to farmers so that they get fair prices in the next harvesting season.

Yesterday’s seminar titled “Agriculture Sector in Fiscal 2019-20 Budget” was organised by the Agricultural Economist Association at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (Barc). The speakers included Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque and Planning Minister MA Mannan.

At the programme, noted agricultural economists said the government, apart from the price support, has to give each farmer a support of Tk 2,000 against an acre of land as their income have come down.

Prof Mondol also said the size of the proposed budget was big and it was needed for the country’s development goals.

He, however, said they did not get any visions in the budget speech to transform traditional agriculture into a commercial one, a promise mentioned in the Awami League’s election manifesto.

Question also remains whether the real farmers would reap benefits of the various incentives in the sector, he said, adding that the government will have to take steps to ensure that the real farmers get the benefits.

Prof Fakir Azmal Huda of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, who presented the keynote speech at the seminar, said surplus paddy of small and medium farmers was a big problem and facing it was a big challenge. But the budget speech did not mention anything about the matter, he said.

Government subsidies which are given at different inputs of agriculture are not sufficient, he said.

In recent budgets, the government kept allocations of Tk 9,000 crore as subsidy in the agriculture sector, but it did not spend more than Tk 5,201 crore, he said.

Mentioning the government decision to have allocations “only for threshing machines for making the sector mechanised”, Prof Azmal said had there been allocation for all agricultural machines, the production cost would have been down.

Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque said the government had taken several steps for ensuring fair prices to farmers. He, however, admitted that there were some limitations in some cases.

“I am assuring you that we will take more steps so that farmers get their deserving price,” he said, adding, “The government is trying to commercialise the sector and make it profitable … you will get results shortly.”

He said they would provide Tk 2000 crore to Tk 3000 core in subsidies on agriculture equipment. It would come from the Tk 9,000 crore allocation as agriculture subsidy in the proposed budget.

Razzaque said a scheme regarding the subsidy was underway. It was not mentioned in the budget speech as the project was not ready then, he said.

Asked about the production cost, he said farmers spent most of their money in planting and harvesting crops as labourers are not available in most cases.

57,57,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Acceleration of ice loss across the Himalayas over the past 40 years - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaav7266,"Himalayan glaciers supply meltwater to densely populated catchments in South Asia, and regional observations of glacier change over multiple decades are needed to understand climate drivers and assess resulting impacts on glacier-fed rivers. Here, we quantify changes in ice thickness during the intervals 1975–2000 and 2000–2016 across the Himalayas, using a set of digital elevation models derived from cold war–era spy satellite film and modern stereo satellite imagery. We observe consistent ice loss along the entire 2000-km transect for both intervals and find a doubling of the average loss rate during 2000–2016 [−0.43 ± 0.14 m w.e. year −1 (meters of water equivalent per year)] compared to 1975–2000 (−0.22 ± 0.13 m w.e. year −1 ). The similar magnitude and acceleration of ice loss across the Himalayas suggests a regionally coherent climate forcing, consistent with atmospheric warming and associated energy fluxes as the dominant drivers of glacier change.

Here, we provide an internally consistent dataset of glacier mass change across the Himalayan range over approximately the past 40 years. We use recent advances in digital elevation model (DEM) extraction methods from declassified KH-9 Hexagon film ( 27 ) and ASTER stereo imagery to quantify ice loss trends for 650 of the largest glaciers during 1975–2000 and 2000–2016. All aspects of the analysis presented here only use glaciers with data available during both time intervals unless specified otherwise. We investigate glaciers along a 2000-km transect from Spiti Lahaul to Bhutan (75°E to 93°E), which includes glaciers that accumulate snow primarily during winter (western Himalayas) and during the summer monsoon (eastern Himalayas), but excludes complications of surging glaciers in the Karakoram and Kunlun regions where many glaciers appear to be anomalously stable or advancing ( 2 ). Our compilation includes glaciers comprising approximately 34% of the total glacierized area in the region, which represents roughly 55% of the total ice volume based on recent ice thickness estimates ( 15 , 28 ). This diverse dataset adequately captures the statistical distribution of large (>3 km 2 ) glaciers, thus providing the first spatially robust analysis of glacier change spanning four decades in the Himalayas. We extract DEMs from declassified KH-9 Hexagon images for the 650 glaciers, compile a corresponding set of modern ASTER DEMs, fit a robust linear regression through every 30-m pixel of the time series of elevations, sum the resulting elevation changes for each glacier, divide by the corresponding areas, and translate the volume changes to mass using a density conversion factor of 850 ± 60 kg m −3 (see Materials and Methods).

Model projections of future Himalayan ice loss and resulting impacts require robust observations of glacier response to past and ongoing climate change. Recent satellite remote sensing studies have made substantial advances with improved spatial coverage and resolution to quantify ice mass changes during 2000–2016 ( 12 , 17 , 18 ), and former records extending back to the 1970s have been presented for several areas using declassified spy satellite imagery ( 13 , 19 – 22 ). These long-term records are especially critical for extracting robust mass balance signals from the noise of interannual variability ( 6 ). Many studies also report the highly heterogeneous behavior of glaciers in localized regions, with some glaciers exhibiting faster rates of ice loss during the 21st century ( 20 , 22 ). Independent analyses document simultaneously increasing atmospheric temperatures at high-elevation stations in HMA ( 23 – 26 ). To robustly quantify the regional sensitivity of these glaciers to climate change, a reliable Himalaya-wide record of ice loss extending back several decades is needed.

Mountain glaciers are known to respond dynamically to a variety of drivers on different time scales, with faster response times than the large ice sheets ( 5 , 6 ). In the Himalayas, in situ studies document significant interannual variability of mass balances ( 7 – 9 ) and relatively slower melt rates on debris-covered glacier tongues over interannual time scales ( 10 , 11 ). Yet, the overall effects of surface debris cover are uncertain, as many satellite observations suggest similar ice losses relative to clean-ice glaciers over similar or longer periods ( 12 , 13 ). Because of the complex monsoon climate in the Himalayas, dominant causes of recent glacier changes remain controversial, although atmospheric warming, the albedo effect due to deposition of anthropogenic black carbon (BC) on snow and ice, and precipitation changes have been suggested as important drivers ( 14 – 16 ).

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report estimates that mass loss from glaciers contributed more to sea-level rise than the ice sheets during 1993–2010 (0.86 mm year −1 versus 0.60 mm year −1 , respectively), yet uncertainties for the glacier contribution are three times greater ( 1 ). Glaciers also contribute locally to water resources in many regions and serve as hydrological buffers vital for ecology, agriculture, and hydropower, particularly in High Mountain Asia (HMA), which includes all mountain ranges surrounding the Tibetan Plateau ( 2 , 3 ). Shrinking Himalayan glaciers pose challenges to societies and policy-makers regarding issues such as changing glacier melt contributions to seasonal runoff, especially in climatically drier western regions ( 3 ), and increasing risk of outburst floods due to expansion of unstable proglacial lakes ( 4 ). Yet, substantial gaps in knowledge persist regarding rates of ice loss, hydrological responses, and associated climate drivers in HMA ( 2 ).

( A ) Regional temperature anomalies, relative to the 1980–2009 mean temperatures for each record. The yellow trend ( 23 ) from the quality-controlled and homogenized climate datasets LSAT-V1.1 and CGP1.0 recently developed by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), using approximately 94 meteorological stations located throughout the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The orange trend ( 44 ) is from a similar CMA dataset derived from 81 stations more concentrated on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The blue trend ( 24 ) is from three decades of temperature data from 13 mountain stations located on the southern slopes of the central Himalayas. The black trend is the 5-year moving mean. ( B ) Temperature anomalies from high-elevation stations at the Chhota Shigri glacier terminus ( 25 ); Dingri station in the Everest region ( 26 ); average from the Kanzalwan, Drass, and Patseo stations ( 45 ); and average of 16 stations above 4000 m elevation on the Tibetan Plateau and eastern Himalayas ( 46 ). Here, temperature anomalies are relative to the mean of each record. The gray trend line is the 5-year moving mean. ( C ) Difference in mean temperature (°C) between the two intervals, i.e., the mean of the 2000–2016 interval relative to the mean of the 1975–2000 interval.

As a first approximation of the consistency between observed glacier mass balances and available temperature records, we estimate the energy required to melt the observed ice losses and conservatively estimate the atmospheric temperature change that would supply this energy via longwave radiation to the glaciers, using a simple energy balance approach (Materials and Methods). We propagate significant uncertainties associated with input from global climate reanalysis data, scaling of temperatures from coarse reanalysis grids to specific glacier elevations, and averaging of climate data over the glacierized region. Results suggest that the observed acceleration of ice loss can be explained by an average temperature ranging from 0.4° to 1.4°C warmer during 2000–2016, relative to the 1975–2000 average. This approximately agrees with the magnitude of warming observed by meteorological stations located throughout HMA, which have recorded air temperatures around 1°C warmer on average during 2000–2016, relative to 1975–2000 ( Fig. 5 ). More comprehensive climate observations and models will be essential for further investigation, but these simple energy constraints suggest that the acceleration of mass loss in the Himalayas is consistent with warming temperatures recorded by meteorological stations in the region.

Glaciers are separated by time interval (top) and category (<33% versus ≥33% debris-covered area) (bottom). ( A ) Altitudinal distributions of ice thickness change for clean-ice glaciers during 1975–2000 and 2000–2016. The y axes are normalized elevation as in Fig. 2 . ( B ) Same as (A), but for debris-covered glaciers. ( C ) Altitudinal distributions of ice thickness change during 1975–2000 for clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers. ( D ) Same as (C), but for 2000–2016. ( E ) Altitudinal distributions of glacierized area for both glacier categories. Elevational extent of debris cover varies widely between individual glaciers, but is mostly concentrated in lower ablation zones. The clean-ice category includes 478 glaciers and the debris-covered category includes 124 glaciers.

We study mass changes for different glacier types by separating glaciers into clean-ice (<33% area covered by debris), debris-covered (≥33% area covered by debris), and lake-terminating categories based on a Landsat band ratio threshold and manual delineation of proglacial lakes (see Materials and Methods). All three categories have undergone a similar acceleration of ice loss ( Table 1 ), and debris-covered glaciers exhibit similar and often more negative geodetic mass balances compared to clean-ice glaciers over the past 40 years ( Fig. 3 ). Altitudinal distributions indicate slower thinning for lower-elevation regions of debris-covered glaciers (glacier tongues where debris is most concentrated) relative to clean-ice glaciers, but comparatively faster thinning in mid- to upper elevations ( Fig. 4 ). Lake-terminating glaciers concentrated in the eastern Himalayas exhibit the most negative mass balances due to thermal undercutting and calving ( 31 ), though they only comprise around 5 to 6% of the estimated total Himalaya-wide mass loss during both intervals.

We multiply geodetic mass balances by the full glacierized area in the Himalayas between 75° and 93° longitude to estimate region-wide ice mass changes of −7.5 ± 2.3 Gt year −1 during 2000–2016, compared to −3.9 ± 2.2 Gt year −1 during 1975–2000 (−5.2 ± 2.2 Gt year −1 during the full 1975–2016 interval). Recent models using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data for ice thickness inversion estimate the total glacial ice mass in our region of study to be approximately 700 Gt in the year 2000 (see Materials and Methods) ( 15 , 28 ). If this estimate is accurate, our observed annual mass losses suggest that of the total ice mass present in 1975, about 87% remained in 2000 and 72% remained in 2016.

( A ) Histograms of individual glacier geodetic mass balances (m w.e. year −1 ) during 1975–2000 (mean = −0.21, SD = 0.15) and 2000–2016 (mean = −0.41, SD = 0.24). Shaded regions behind the histograms are fitted normal distributions. ( B ) Result of dividing the modern (2000–2016) mass balances by the historical (1975–2000) mass balances for each glacier, showing the resulting distribution of the mass balance change (ratio) between the two intervals (mean = 2.01, SD = 1.36). In this case, the shaded region is a fitted kernel distribution. ( C ) Altitudinal distributions of ice thickness change (m year −1 ) separated into 50-m elevation bins during the two intervals. ( D ) Normalized altitudinal distributions of ice thickness change. Normalized elevations are defined as (z − z 2.5 )/(z 97.5 − z 2.5 ), where z is elevation and subscripts indicate elevation percentiles. This scales all glaciers by their elevation range (i.e., after scaling, glacier termini = 0 and headwalls = 1), allowing for more consistent comparison of ice thickness changes across glaciers with different elevation ranges. Note the abrupt inflection point in the 2000–2016 profile at ~0.1; this is likely due to retreating glacier termini. Shaded regions in the altitudinal distributions indicate the SEM estimated as σ z / n z , where σ z is the SD of the thinning rate for each 50-m elevation bin and n z is the number of independent measurements when accounting for spatial autocorrelation (see Materials and Methods).

Contrasting distributions of glacier mass balances are evident when comparing between time intervals. The 1975–2000 distribution has a negative tail extending to −0.6 m w.e. year −1 , while the 2000–2016 distribution is more negative, extending to −1.1 m w.e. year −1 ( Fig. 2A ). During the more recent interval, glaciers are losing ice twice as fast on average ( Fig. 2B ), though this varies somewhat between subregions. For example, we find that the average rate of ice loss has increased by a factor of 3 in the Spiti Lahaul region, and by a factor of 1.4 in West Nepal. We also compile altitudinal distributions of ice thickness change for the glaciers and create a Himalaya-wide average thickness change profile versus elevation ( Fig. 2, C and D ). These distributed thinning profiles are a function of both thinning by mass loss and of dynamic thinning due to ice flow. We find that the 2000–2016 thinning rate (m year −1 ) profile is considerably steeper, which is likely caused by a combination of faster mass loss and widespread slowing of ice velocities during the 21st century ( 2 , 30 ).

Our results indicate that glaciers across the Himalayas experienced significant ice loss over the past 40 years, with the average rate of ice loss twice as rapid in the 21st century compared to the end of the 20th century ( Fig. 1 ). We calculate a regional average geodetic mass balance of −0.43 ± 0.14 m w.e. year −1 (meters of water equivalent per year) during 2000–2016, compared to −0.22 ± 0.13 m w.e. year −1 during 1975–2000 (−0.31 ± 0.13 m w.e. year −1 for the full 1975–2016 interval) (see Materials and Methods). A 30-glacier moving average shows a quasi-consistent trend across the 2000-km longitudinal transect during both time intervals ( Fig. 1 ), and subregions have similar means and distributions of glacier mass balance. Some central catchments deviate somewhat from the Himalaya-wide mean during 2000–2016 (by approximately 0.1 to 0.2 m w.e. year −1 ) in the Uttarakhand (~79.0° to 80.0°E), the Gandaki catchment (~83.5° to 84.5°E), and the Karnali catchment (~81° to 83°E), which has fewer larger glaciers and relatively incomplete data coverage. Similar to previous in situ and satellite-based studies ( 18 , 29 ), we observe considerable variation among individual glacier mass balances, with area-weighted SDs of 0.1 and 0.2 m w.e. year −1 during each respective interval for the 650 glaciers. This variability most likely reflects different glacier characteristics such as sizes of accumulation zones relative to ablation zones, topographic shading, and amounts of debris cover. Yet, we find that, in our survey (using a rough average of 60 glaciers per 7000-km 2 subregion), local variations tend to average out and mean values are similar across most catchments.

Our analysis robustly quantifies four decades of ice loss for 650 of the largest glaciers across a 2000-km transect in the Himalayas. We find similar mass loss rates across subregions and a doubling of the average rate of loss during 2000–2016 relative to the 1975–2000 interval. This is consistent with the available multidecade weather station records scattered throughout HMA, which indicate quasi-steady mean annual air temperatures through the 1960s to the 1980s with a prominent warming trend beginning in the mid-1990s and continuing into the 21st century ( 23 – 26 ). We suggest that degree-day and energy balance models focused on accurately quantifying glacier responses to air temperature changes (including energy fluxes and associated feedbacks) will provide the most robust estimates of glacier response to future climate scenarios in the Himalayas.

To gain perspective on mass losses from these low-latitude glaciers in the monsoonal Himalayas, we compare our results with benchmark mid-latitude glaciers in the European Alps, as well as with a global average mass balance trend (fig. S1) ( 37 ). The Alps contain the most detailed long-term glaciological and high-elevation meteorological records on Earth, and the climatic sensitivity and behavior of these European glaciers are well understood compared to glaciers in HMA. Air temperatures in the Alps show an abrupt warming trend beginning in the mid-1980s, and Alpine mass balance records display a concurrent acceleration of ice loss, with a continual strongly negative mass balance after that time. Himalayan weather station data indicate a more gradual warming trend, with the strongest warming beginning in the mid-1990s (fig. S1, A and B). We find that mass balance in the Himalayas is less negative compared to the Alps and the global average, despite close proximity to a known hot spot of increasing BC emissions with rapid growth and accompanying combustion of fossil fuels and biomass in South Asia ( 38 ). The concurrent acceleration of ice loss observed in both the Himalayas and Europe over the past 40 years coincides with a distinct warming trend beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, followed by the consistently warmest temperatures through the 21st century in both regions.

To compare our results with previous remote sensing studies that derive mass changes from various sensors (including Hexagon, SRTM, SPOT5, ICESat, and ASTER), we restrict our results to the approximate geographical regions covered by each corresponding study ( 12 , 13 , 17 – 22 ) and then compute area-weighted average geodetic mass balances. In addition, we compare individual glacier mass balances for the Everest and Langtang Himal regions, where mass changes were previously estimated using declassified Corona and Hexagon imagery ( 13 , 19 , 20 ). Despite factors such as variable spatial resolutions, distinct void-filling methods, heterogeneous spatial and temporal coverages, and different definitions of glacier boundaries, we find that our average mass balances generally agree with previous analyses and overlap within uncertainties (table S1). However, because of the significant variability of individual glacier mass changes within subregions, our results also highlight the importance of sampling a large number of glaciers to obtain a robust average trend for any given area.

Similar thinning rates of debris-covered (thermally insulated) glaciers relative to clean-ice glaciers have been observed by previous studies and have been not only ascribed to surface melt ponds and associated ice cliffs acting as localized hot spots to concentrate melting but also attributed to declining ice flux causing dynamic thinning and stagnation of debris-covered glacier tongues ( 2 ). While we cannot yet directly deconvolve relative contributions from these processes, we find that average thinning rates for debris-covered glaciers are slower than clean-ice glaciers at low elevations (glacier tongues where debris is most concentrated), which agrees with reduced melt rates from field studies. In turn, debris-covered glaciers tend to have comparatively faster thinning at mid-range elevations, where debris cover is sparser and also where the majority of total glacierized area resides ( Fig. 4 ). Models of debris-covered glacier processes suggest that this pattern of thinning may cause a reduction in down-glacier surface gradient, which, in turn, reduces driving stress and ice flux and explains why debris-covered ablation zones become stagnant ( 35 ). We also find that clean-ice glaciers exhibit a much more pronounced steepening of the thinning profile over time, compared to debris-covered glaciers. It may be that both glacier types experience a uniform thinning phase followed by a changing terminus flux and retreat phase, but the clean-ice glaciers are in a later phase of response to recent climate change ( 36 ).

Some studies have suggested a weakening of the summer monsoon and reduced precipitation as primary reasons for negative glacier mass balances, particularly in the Everest region ( 16 ). While decreasing accumulation rates may account for a significant portion of the mass balance signal for some glaciers, an extreme Himalaya-wide decrease in precipitation would be required to explain the extensive ice losses we observe, especially given that monsoon-dominated glaciers with high accumulation rates are known to be much more sensitive to temperature than accumulation changes ( 5 , 32 ). Regional studies of precipitation trends in the Himalayas do not suggest a widespread decrease in precipitation over the past four decades (Supplementary Materials). A uniform BC albedo forcing across the Himalayas is another possible explanation, although BC concentrations measured in snow and ice in the Himalayas have been found to be spatially heterogeneous ( 14 , 33 ), and high-resolution atmospheric models also show large spatial variability of deposited BC originating from localized emissions in regions of complex terrain ( 14 , 34 ). Future analyses focused on quantifying the spatial patterns of BC deposition will reveal further insights, yet given the rather homogeneous pattern of mass loss we observe across the 2000-km Himalayan transect, a strong, spatially heterogeneous mechanism seems improbable as a dominant driver of glacier ice loss in the region.

The parsing of Himalayan glacier energy budgets is not a straightforward task owing to the scarcity of meteorological data, in combination with the complex climate and topography of the region ( 2 ). Furthermore, the Himalayas border hot spots of high anthropogenic BC emissions, which may affect glaciers by direct heating of the atmosphere and decreasing albedo of ice and snow after deposition ( 14 ). While improved analyses combining observations and high-resolution atmospheric and glacier energy balance models will be required to quantify these effects, the pattern of ice loss we observe has important implications regarding dominant climate influences on Himalayan glacier mass balances. Our results suggest that any drivers of glacier change must explain the region-wide consistency, the doubling of the average rate of ice loss in the 21st century compared to 1975–2000, and the observation that clean-ice, debris-covered, and lake-terminating glaciers have all experienced a similar acceleration of mass loss.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Hexagon U.S. intelligence agencies used KH-9 Hexagon military satellites for reconnaissance from 1973 to 1980. A telescopic camera system acquired thousands of photographs worldwide, after which film recovery capsules were ejected from the satellites and parachuted back to Earth over the Pacific Ocean. With a ground resolution ranging from 6 to 9 m, single scenes from the mapping camera cover an area of approximately 30,000 km2 with overlap of 55 to 70%, allowing for stereo photogrammetric processing of large regions. Images were scanned by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at a resolution of 7 μm and downloaded via the Earth Explorer user interface (earthexplorer.usgs.gov). Digital elevation models were extracted using the Hexagon Imagery Automated Pipeline methodology, which is coded in MATLAB and uses the OpenCV library for Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature matching, uncalibrated stereo rectification, and semiglobal block matching algorithms (27). The majority of the KH-9 images here were acquired within a 3-year interval (1973–1976), and we processed a total of 42 images to provide sufficient spatial coverage (fig. S2).

ASTER The ASTER instrument was launched as part of a cooperative effort between NASA and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 1999. Its nadir and backward-viewing telescopes provide stereoscopic capability at 15-m ground resolution, and a single DEM covers approximately 3600 km2. Approximately 26,000 ASTER DEMs were downloaded via the METI AIST Data Archive System (MADAS) satellite data retrieval system (gbank.gsj.jp/madas), a portal maintained by the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and the Geological Survey of Japan. To use all cloud-free pixels (including images with a high percentage of cloud cover), no cloud selection criteria were applied when downloading the images. We used the Data1.l3a.demzs geotiff product, which has a spatial resolution of 30 m. After downloading, the DEMs were subjected to a cleanup process: For a given scene, any saturated pixels (i.e., equal to 0 or 255) in the nadir band 3 (0.76 to 0.86 μm) image were masked in the DEM. Next, the SRTM dataset was used to remove any DEM values with an absolute elevation difference larger than 150 m (relative to SRTM), which effectively eliminated the majority of errors caused by clouds. While more sophisticated cloud masking procedures are possible, the ASTER shortwave infrared detectors failed in April 2008, making cloud detection after this time impossible using standard methods. We examined existing cloud masks derived using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images as another option (tonolab.cis.ibaraki.ac.jp/ASTER/cloud/). However, these are not optimized for snow-covered regions and often misclassify glacier pixels as clouds. Instead, our large collection of multitemporal ASTER scenes, the SRTM difference threshold, and our robust linear trend fitting algorithm [see description of Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) in the “Trend fitting of multitemporal DEM stacks” section] effectively excluded any remaining erroneous cloud elevations after the initial threshold. As a final step, all ASTER DEMs were coregistered to the SRTM using a standard elevation–aspect optimization procedure (39). We did not apply fifth-order polynomial correction procedures to the ASTER DEMs for satellite “jitter” effects and curvature bias as done in some previous studies (18). We found that while these types of corrections may reduce the overall average elevation error in a scene, the polynomial fitting can be unwieldy and may introduce unwanted localized biases. By stacking many ASTER DEMs (with 20.5 being the average number of observations per pixel stack during the ASTER trend fitting, see fig. S3E) and using a robust fitting procedure, we found that biases do not correlate across overlapping scenes, and thus tend to cancel out one another. Furthermore, the elevation change results from this portion of our study overlap within uncertainties with Brun et al. (18) (Supplementary Materials) who did perform polynomial corrections. This suggests that for a large-scale regional study using a high number of overlapping ASTER scenes, the satellite jitter and curvature bias corrections have a relatively minimal impact on the final results.

Glacier polygons To delineate glaciers during all portions of the analysis, we used manually refined versions of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 5.0) (40). Starting with the original RGI dataset, we edited the glacier polygons to reflect glacier areas during 1975, 2000, and 2016. For the 1975 edit, we used a combination of Hexagon imagery, the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat Multispectral Scanner mosaic (GLS1975), and glacier thickness change maps derived from differencing the Hexagon and modern ASTER DEMs, which are particularly useful for debris-covered glacier termini that often have spectral characteristics indistinguishable from surrounding terrain. Debris-covered areas for each glacier were delineated using a Landsat DN TM4/TM5 band ratio with a threshold of 2.0, and glaciers with ≥33% debris cover were assigned to the debris-covered category. For the 2000 edit, we used the GLS2000 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus mosaic, along with glacier thickness change maps derived from differencing ASTER DEMs. For the 2016 edit, we used a custom mosaic of Landsat 8 imagery with acquisition dates spanning 2014–2016. The individually edited glacier polygons were used for all ice volume change and geodetic mass balance computations. The polygons were also used during alignment of the DEMs, where the shapefiles were converted to raster masks with a dilation (morphological operation) of 250 m on the binary rasters. This effectively excluded unstable terrain surrounding the glaciers during the DEM alignment process, such as steep avalanching slopes and unstable moraines.

Trend fitting of multitemporal DEM stacks Glacier polygons were processed individually—all DEMs from a given time interval (1975–2000 or 2000–2016) that overlap a polygon were selected and resampled to the same 30-m resolution using linear interpolation. The overlapping DEMs were sampled with a 25% extension around each glacier to include nearby stable terrain for alignment and uncertainty analysis (fig. S4). After ensuring that there is no vertical bias, the aligned DEMs were sorted in temporal order as a three-dimensional matrix, and linear trends were fit to every pixel “stack” (i.e., along the third dimension of the matrix) using the RANSAC method. During each RANSAC iteration, a random set of two elevation pixels per stack were selected. A linear trend was fit to these two values, and then all remaining elevation pixels were compared to the trend. Any elevation pixels within 15 m of the trend line were marked as inliers. This process was repeated for 100 iterations, and the iteration with the greatest number of inliers was selected. A final linear fit was performed using all inliers from the best iteration, and this trend was used for each pixel stack’s thickness change estimate. The thickness change maps were subjected to outlier removal using thresholds for maximum slope, maximum thickness change, minimum count per pixel stack, minimum timespan per pixel stack, maximum SD of inlier elevations per pixel stack, and maximum gradient of the thickness change map (fig. S3). In addition, the thickness change pixels were separated into 50-m elevation bins, and pixels falling outside the 2 to 98% quantile range were excluded. Any bins with less than 100 pixels were removed and then interpolated using the two adjacent bins. Before computing ice volume change for the glaciers, the final thickness change maps were visually inspected, any remaining erroneous pixels (which occurred almost exclusively in low-contrast, snow-covered accumulation zones) were manually masked, and a 5 × 5 pixel median filter was applied. We did not attempt to perform seasonality corrections, as no seasonal snowfall records are available and because nearly all the Hexagon DEMs were acquired during winter, thus minimizing any seasonality offsets between regions. For the 1975–2000 interval, we used the Hexagon DEMs and sampled ASTER thickness change trends at the start of the year 2000. For regions with multiple overlapping Hexagon DEMs, we used the same RANSAC method. During the 1975–2000 interval, only two DEMs were available for most glaciers. In these cases, the RANSAC iterations were unnecessary, and we simply differenced the two available DEMs. We did not use SRTM for any thickness change estimates; thus, no correction for radar penetration was necessary.

Mass changes To compute (mean annual) ice volume changes for individual glaciers, all thickness change pixels falling within a glacier polygon were transformed to an appropriate projected WGS84 UTM coordinate system (zones 43 to 46, depending on longitude of the glacier). Pixel values (m year−1) were then multiplied by their corresponding areas (pixel width × pixel height) and summed together. The resulting ice volume change was then divided by the average glacier area to obtain a glacier thickness change. We used the average of the initial and final glacier areas for a given time interval and excluded slopes greater than 45° to remove any cliffs and nunataks. Last, the glacier thickness change was multiplied by an average ice-firn density (41) of 850 kg m−3 and then divided by the density of water (1000 kg m−3) to compute glacier geodetic mass balance in m w.e. year−1. Because of cloud cover, shadows, and low radiometric contrast, some glacier accumulation zones had gaps in the DEMs and resulting thickness change maps. This is particularly evident in the Hexagon DEMs for the Spiti Lahaul region owing to extensive cloud cover. To fill these gaps, we tested two different void-filling methods for comparison. In the first method, we defined a circular search area with a radius of 50 km around the center of a given glacier. All thickness change pixels from glaciers in this surrounding area were binned (into 50-m elevation bins, and following the same outlier-removal procedure given in the preceding section), and any missing data in the glacier were set to this “regional bin” mean value at the corresponding elevation. In the second method, we filled data gaps using an interpolation procedure, where voids in an individual glacier were linearly interpolated using bin values at upper and lower elevations relative to the missing data (those belonging to the same glacier), and assumed zero change at the highest elevation bin (headwall). Both methods yielded similar results (table S1). In addition, no obvious trends were apparent when geodetic mass balance was plotted versus percent data coverage or glacier size (fig. S5). While smaller glaciers exhibited more scatter, the average mass balance was similar for all glacier sizes. These observations indicate that our representative sample of glaciers, while biased toward larger glaciers, adequately captures the statistical distribution of glacier mass balances in the Himalayas. To calculate regional geodetic mass balances, we separated glaciers into four subregions (Spiti Lahaul, West Nepal, East Nepal, and Bhutan) as defined by Brun et al. (18). We then calculated the average mass balance for each of these four subregions, weighted by individual glacier areas. Last, we calculated a final average mass balance for the Himalayas, weighted by the total glacierized area (from the RGI 5.0 database) in each of the four subregions, between 75° to 93° longitude. Because of the relatively homogeneous mass balance distribution, we found that this approach resulted in similar values (well within the uncertainties) compared to simply calculating the area-weighted average mass balance of the 650 measured glaciers. To obtain the total mass changes in Gt year−1, we multiplied each subregion mass balance by its total glacierized area and then summed the results from all subregions to get Himalaya-wide totals of −3.9 Gt year−1 for 1975–2000 and −7.5 Gt year−1 for 2000–2016. To calculate contributions to sea-level rise, we used a global ocean surface area of 361.9 × 106 km2 (fig. S4G). To estimate the total ice mass present in our region of study, we used ice thickness estimates from Kraaijenbrink et al. (15), who used the Glacier bed Topography version 2 model to invert for ice thickness (28) with input from the SRTM DEM (acquired in February of 2000). The ice thickness estimates from (15) did not include glaciers smaller than 0.4 km2, and to estimate the additional mass contribution from these smallest glaciers (along with any other glaciers that are missing thickness estimates), we fit a second-order polynomial to the logarithm of glacier volumes versus the logarithm of glacier areas and evaluated this fit equation for any glaciers without volume data (fig. S6). We then converted glacier volume to mass using a density value of 850 kg m−3. Over our region of study, the ice volumes from the thickness data amounted to 649 Gt, with an additional contribution of 35 Gt from the fitting procedure, for a total of 684 Gt.

Uncertainty assessment We quantified statistical uncertainty for individual glaciers using an iterative random sampling approach. For a given glacier, the SD of elevation changes from the surrounding stable terrain (σ z ) was first calculated. For any missing thickness change pixels within the glacier polygon, we also included an extrapolation uncertainty σ e . This accounts for additional error in regions with incomplete data, i.e., those glacier regions filled by extrapolating thickness changes from surrounding glaciers, or linear interpolation assuming zero change at the headwall, as described in the previous section. We found that in the Himalaya-wide altitudinal distributions, the maximum SD of thickness change in any 50-m elevation bin above 5000 m is 0.56 m year−1. Nearly all regions with incomplete data coverage are above this elevation, resulting from poor radiometric contrast for snow-covered glacier accumulation zones. We thus conservatively set σ e equal to 0.6 m year−1. We then combined both sources of error to get σ p for every individual thickness change pixel σ p = σ z 2 + σ e 2 (1) To account for spatial autocorrelation, we started with a normally distributed random error field (with a mean of 0 and an SD of 1) the same size as the thickness change map and then filtered it using an n-by-n moving window average to add spatial correlation, where n is defined as the spatial correlation range divided by the spatial resolution of the thickness change map. We used 500 m for the spatial correlation range, which is a conservative value based on semivariogram analysis in mountainous regions from previous studies (18, 21, 42). The resulting artificial error field E n (now with spatial correlation) is scaled by the σ p values and added to the thickness change map ΔH as follows, where (x, y) are pixel coordinates Δ H E ( x , y ) = Δ H ( x , y ) + E n ( x , y ) ⋅ σ p ( x , y ) σ n (2) If thickness change data exist at a given pixel location (x, y) on the glacier, σ n is the SD of the set of all E n values where data exist (i.e., where σ e is equal to zero). Conversely, if thickness change data do not exist at a given pixel location (x, y) on the glacier, σ n is the SD of the set of all E n values where data do not exist (i.e., where σ e is equal to 0.6 m year−1). In this way, the second term of Eq. 2 assigns larger uncertainties to regions with incomplete data. Last, all glacier thickness change pixels in ΔH E were summed together to compute a volume change with the introduced error. This procedure was repeated for 100 iterations, and the volume change uncertainty σ ΔV was computed as the SD of the resulting distribution (fig. S4). For region-wide volume change estimates, we conservatively assumed total correlation between glaciers and computed region-wide uncertainty as follows, where g is the total number of glaciers (~17,400) σ Δ V region = ∑ 1 g σ Δ V (3) For glaciers where thickness change data are not available, a measure of uncertainty is still required to factor into the final regional uncertainty estimate. For these glaciers, we estimated σ ΔV as (42) σ Δ V = σ z region 2 ⋅ A cor 5 ⋅ A (4) A cor = π ⋅ L 2 (5) In this case, σ z region is the region-wide SD of elevation change over stable terrain (0.42 m year−1) (fig. S7), A cor is the correlation area, L is the correlation range (500 m), and A is the glacier area. Last, all σ ΔV and σ ΔV regjon estimates were combined with an area uncertainty (43) of 10% and a density uncertainty (41) of 60 kg m−3 using standard uncorrelated error propagation.","Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaav7266/F1.large.jpg,"['glaciers', 'elevation', 'mass', 'past', 'm', '40', 'loss', 'change', 'ice', 'average', 'glacier', 'thickness', 'himalayas', 'acceleration']",

YANGON—Over 750 civilians from rural parts of Chin State’s Paletwa Township have fled to urban areas of the township for fear of being trapped by the fighting between the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, and the Arakan Army (AA).

“They have been arriving from June 8 through June 11, and there are a total of 752 people from 150 households,” said U Kyaw Aung, secretary of a local humanitarian group based in the township.

They fled three villages in the Pein Ne Tabin village tract, and are taking shelter at three camps and the houses of their relatives, he said.

Camps have been opened at a Christian church, the office of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the office of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).

They fled in fear after hearing gunshots in the vicinity of their villages.

“They fled for fear that they would be in trouble and something would happen to them,” said U Kyaw Aung.

The Chin State government has provided 500 bags of rice for them, and individual donors are also providing relief supplies.

Before this latest flood of displacement, over 2,600 locals had been forced to move to safer areas. The total number now stands at over 3,000.

Hundreds of displaced villagers fled to the Myanmar-Bangladesh border when fighting intensified in February, but with Bangladeshi authorities refusing to accept them, approximately 200 are now taking shelter in areas controlled by the AA near the border.

Chin communities have claimed that over 50 ethnic Chin people are in the 200-member group, and accused the AA of abducting them.

The AA has however denied accusations of abduction, saying they are in fact providing shelter and food for them.

According to AA’s information officer Khaing Thukha, the last bout of fighting between the Tatmadaw and the AA took place on June 7. The AA has said the two sides have clashed more than 100 times since January.

On calculations made from media reports of civilian casualties, at least 40 civilians are feared to have died in shootings, mine explosions, artillery shell explosions and torture in detention in the five months of war.

According to local humanitarian groups, more than 40,000 people have been displaced by the clashes in Kyauktaw, Buthidaung, Minbya, Rathedaung, Mrauk-U and Ponnagyun townships in northern Rakhine State.

Lamia Akter, a fifth grader at Dakkhin Gazipur Government Primary School, wrote the letter on June 18 and posted it through the local post office.

She wrote, around 130 students attend classes at the school under risk. “Every day, we have to clean our classrooms as dust falls from damaged walls and ceilings.”

The Daily Star has obtained a copy of the letter.

Md Selim Talukder, head teacher of the school, told our local correspondent that the existing school building is in a sorry state and is very risky for students.

“Now it has become impossible to conduct classes inside the school building,” assistant teacher of the school Mahmuda Akter told The Daily Star.

Head teacher Talukder says, the school was established in 1975 and a new building was built in 1994. But now, the building is damaged and metal rods poke out from several points.

“This school is a flood or cyclone shelter. It is the only school in the village,” he said. “We have informed authorities of the school’s sorry state. But no steps have been taken.”

Md Ruhul Amin, Sadar Upazila Education Officer, told The Daily Star that he is aware of the problem and has informed his higher authority about it.

60,60,FL-2019-000079-BGD,South Korean companies shift production out of China - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/South-Korean-companies-shift-production-out-of-China,"SEOUL -- South Korean corporate giants Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and LG Electronics are moving production out of China, in an effort to reduce an overdependence that has left them vulnerable to a combination of local competition, geopolitical friction and economic headwinds hitting even the largest players hard.

""It's like they held out this long to avoid giving the Chinese government a bad impression, but now they can't take it anymore,"" said a source at a major Japanese financial institution that frequently deals with South Korean companies.

Samsung kicked off the trend. With Chinese sales of its smartphones slumping in recent years -- Samsung held less than 1% of the market by shipment volume in 2018 -- it was seen as only a matter of time until the company halted production at a major factory in Tianjin.

Samsung did what it could to keep the operations going, as shutting them down would be sure to bring pressure on multiple fronts from a government keen to protect jobs. But the manufacturer ultimately gave in and decided late last year to end smartphone production at the plant.

This touched off a flood of similar moves by other South Korean businesses. ""When Samsung takes the lead, the psychological burden on us is lower,"" an employee at a Korean company said.

Hyundai Motor in May temporarily suspended operations at a plant in Beijing capable of churning out 300,000 vehicles a year. Affiliate Kia will end production of Kia-branded autos at a Jiangsu Province factory late this month. Appliance maker LG Electronics recently moved all production of U.S.-bound refrigerators at a facility in Zhejiang Province to South Korea.

Meanwhile, Samsung is looking at deeper cuts, offering voluntary retirement packages to employees at its other Chinese smartphone factory in Guangdong Province.

South Korean companies' overexposure to China, and the concomitant risks, are not news. But the strong performance there of such businesses as Samsung and Hyundai masked these concerns for some time.

Samsung led the Chinese smartphone market back in 2012 with handsets coveted by Chinese consumers, while Hyundai ranked third in auto sales as recently as 2016, behind only Volkswagen and General Motors, thanks to its wildly popular sport utility vehicles.

But the rise of Chinese players in chips and cars -- among South Korea's biggest strengths -- has brought them down to earth. Samsung has dropped out of the top 10, while Hyundai has resigned itself to languishing in the second tier of automakers, around sixth or seventh place.

The problem was exacerbated by a row over Seoul's 2017 deployment of a U.S. missile-defense system that Beijing objected to on national security grounds. That move spurred boycotts of South Korean companies, which forced the Lotte group to pull out of the supermarket business in China.

Businesses continued to feel the aftereffects for more than a year, and just as they started to get back on their feet, the U.S.-China trade war erupted. South Korean shipments to China -- its largest trading partner, accounting for about 26% of its exports -- plunged 20% on the year in May.

U.S. sanctions against China's Huawei Technologies look likely to make matters worse. If the measures remain in place, Huawei's massive planned orders of chips from South Korean companies would need to be canceled, leading to the market being flooded with excess inventory. This would likely drag down prices, squeezing profits in Samsung's bread-and-butter semiconductor business.

Chips are the most important industry to the South Korean economy, making up 20% of its exports. Market conditions are bad enough as is -- with a decline in prices since last fall contributing to a 31% year-on-year drop in semiconductor shipments by value last month -- without the Huawei issue making the difficult situation even more so.

Furthermore, the next threatened round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, which could be imposed as early as this month, covers products such as smartphones and personal computers that are South Korean specialties. The duties would directly hit South Korean businesses that import large quantities of intermediate goods such as parts into China for processing and assembly before exporting the finished goods to the U.S.

The decisions by two of South Korea's big three mobile carriers not to work with Huawei on fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks have rubbed Beijing the wrong way as well.","Sat, 22 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F2%252F1%252F4%252F21374129-1-eng-GB%252Fgalaxy%2520black.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['south', 'smartphone', 'market', 'shift', 'samsung', 'month', 'chinese', 'hyundai', 'companies', 'korean', 'china', 'production']",

“With him not being there, it does feel a bit different you have to adjust and do your own thing.

“It felt a bit different, because me and Moeen [Ali] have been paying together on the same team for the past two years,” said Rashid.

But while that leaves Rashid in the firing line, the leg-spinner insists that could play right into his hands.

Moeen Ali was benched for last Saturday’s clash against Bangladesh as Eoin Morgan opted to flood his attack with 90mph men and could do so again against West Indies on Friday.

“But it’s a thing that the batsmen think maybe we’ve got to target the spinner here so it can work in favour of the [one] spinner. They can come hard at the spinner as result you get a wicket some days and you get a five-for.

“It’s nice to have that pace knowing we can rough teams up and then for me to come in and hopefully someone comes after you and the wickets come for me that way.”

England have favoured a twin-spin attack in all but the first of six ODIs at Southampton played since the last World Cup.

But they may decide to stick with a winning formula after the comprehensive win over Bangladesh got their World Cup campaign back on track.

Moeen, who has taken four wickets in two games compared to Rashid's two in three, travelled home to be with his wife who is expecting their second child imminently after being left out in Cardiff.

Eight years on, the rumbling continues. The ground beneath remains unstable.

In Wellington and Christchurch, modern buildings constructed to the highest official standards and earthquake ratings lie empty; some will be repaired at great cost while others are set for demolition and replacement.

Apartment owners in the capital face insurance hikes and earthquake-strengthening costs that threaten not only their life savings and sanity but also the very idea of inner-city living.

Beyond those faultlines smaller communities are struggling as well, retail centres emptied by the inexorable rise in premiums, strengthening costs and regulation.

And even our biggest city, seemingly neither shaken nor stirred by the tremors so far south of the Bombay Hills, cannot relax: experts predict Auckland is just as vulnerable as any other centre. It's just a matter of time.

The financial infrastructure that supports it all is wobbling too; spooked insurance companies are significantly increasing the cost of cover or threatening to withhold it altogether, their sector chief lamenting a loss of confidence in building resilience.

Kevin Stent Wellington's Statistics House was one of many modern buildings badly damaged during the 2016 Kaikōura quake. It was demolished last year.

He's warning anyone who will listen about the ""canary in the coal mine"": a house of cards built of unrealistic expectations of earthquake protection, uninsurable properties built to save lives but not last, and a financial ecosystem struggling to hold it all together.

This uncertainty hasn't gone unnoticed overseas.

John Shewan is a director of the Australasian arm of Munich Re, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies.

Robert Charles Munich Re executive John Shewan says the German reinsurance giant is ""pretty grumpy"" about the poor resilience of New Zealand's buildings.

In a recent presentation to the Wellington Rotary Club he said the 2011 and 2012 quakes in Christchurch ""unsettled"" the global insurance industry because they ""changed the whole modelling parameters for earthquakes ... produced a number of highly unusual events, including liquefaction"".

The damage in Christchurch and the impact, particularly on modern buildings, after the 2016 Kaikōura quake made the ""Germans pretty grumpy"", not only about the continuation of nearly two decades of losses in natural disaster cover but also the lack of building resilience in a country rated by Lloyd's of London as the second most risky in the world, behind flood-prone Bangladesh.

""Is there a risk that global insurers won't want to be in New Zealand – why bother?""

Shewan doubts they'd walk away, but they are clearly considering it.

""The construction industry in this country needs a shake-up.""

Tim Grafton agrees.

The chief executive of the Insurance Council NZ represents an industry under pressure over those rising premiums and threats to cover.

SUPPLIED Insurance Council chief executive Tim Grafton says the lack of resilience in our buildings is the ""canary in the mine"".

Grafton is the one who senses the flutter of small wings in the depths of the mine.

The problem is not with the insurance companies, he says, but building codes and practices that ensure lives are saved but buildings are essentially lost, written off. Just as a car is designed to save its occupants in an accident, but is unusable afterwards.

That life safety requirement is enshrined in the New Building Standards (NBS). Anyone looking to buy an apartment or house in Wellington and elsewhere will know it well: a property's NBS rating is often the first question asked of a real estate agent.

Anything 33 per cent and below is likely to need costly strengthening and less likely to attract the support of an insurer; many banks will raise the bar on borrowing for properties rated less than 67 per cent.

The public and even many property developers believe the rating defines a building's capacity to withstand an earthquake and remain functional.

That unrealistic expectation is the shaky ground upon which the country's property-centric economy is based.

""The NBS rating is primarily a life safety rating that has limited relevance to a building's seismic resilience,"" says Grafton. ""New Zealand needs a better rating system.""

But that's just one of the warning notes from Grafton's canary.

He and others are worried about the way our buildings are designed and built as well.

John Hare has been ""donkey deep"" in earthquake recovery work around the country during the past eight years.

Dean Kozanic John Hare, of Holmes Group Ltd, says we are building the wrong buildings if we want them to withstand earthquakes.

The chief executive of Christchurch-based engineering consultancy Holmes Group Ltd says people might have been shocked at the damage to modern buildings, but they did what they were designed and rated to do – save lives.

Both Hare and Grafton acknowledge that's a good thing, but now it's time to take the next step.

The Christchurch and Kaikōura quakes were devastating, tragic events, but they were also opportunities for scientists, engineers and even legislators to learn a great deal about the ability of our infrastructure to withstand quakes and our communities to prepare for the next big one.

That has led to one conclusion.

""We are designing the wrong kinds of buildings if we want low damage,"" says Hare.

It's what he has been advocating for some time; it's what he told the Pacific Conference on Earthquake Engineering in April.

It's the faltering heart of Grafton's canary.

""The seismic design of new building construction needs to improve,"" says Grafton. ""Even the small details in a building such as the non-structural elements that restrain ceilings and services are important. This work has not been done well.""

Other jurisdictions have incorporated low-damage design for some time. California and Japan are both at great risk of earthquakes; they may not have the level of insurance we have in New Zealand but they have balanced that with better, more resilient design.

WSP Opus The Christchurch office of Trimble Navigation was severely damaged in the quakes that devastated the city. Its replacement was designed by WSP Opus and employed low-damage design technology, including post-tensioned Laminated Veneer Lumber frames and walls, and energy-dispersing technology devices mounted to the exterior of the building to create a more resilient structure.

Developers back here considering the bottom line of construction costs might be a little nervous.

Hare says they needn't be.

""If you're comparing the same building and asking how much it would cost, the answer is quite a lot more,"" he says, ""so you design differently.

""If you think of the way a building's cost splits up, normally the structure of a building is 20-25 per cent of the value of the building. Of that, probably a third to a half might be the seismic structure, and of that you wouldn't necessarily increase all of it.

""So even if you double the cost of the seismic structure you are adding maybe 5 per cent to the cost, so not a hell of an imposition, but it could be a massive difference to the outcome.""

He concedes it might mean a change to the look of the building. Architects might want to turn away at this point.

""It's not necessarily about building the grandest, most expensive buildings with all the technology; there might be some very simple solutions that we can develop.

""In Christchurch, a little bit distorted because of the liquefaction, there was a certain irony in that many of the houses that were more damaged were those architecturally designed houses, as opposed to the basic, regular, archetypal state house of our youth, which are bullet-proof.""

Grafton suggests that means changes to the rating system, the building codes, the Earthquake Prone Building (EPB) regime and the Building Act that houses it all.

Hare sees more of a market-led solution.

""You could look at it and say maybe the Building Act doesn't need to change,"" he says.

""If we had some kind of standardisation around how low-damage outcomes could be achieved, then it could be a voluntary standard.

""Rather than wait for a code to be fully built up ... it might be driven in part by [rising costs of] insurance.""

That's something Shewan would agree with.

""If you're building a new building,"" he says, ""the only way to reduce the insurance premium is to reduce risk.""

There's some good news for the regions too. The risk of a significant quake, maybe even a moderate one that lasts longer than 30 seconds, is shared by everyone in New Zealand, even Auckland. But Hare doesn't believe the burden of recovery and legislation need be.

""If you've got a building in a small town, from the overall approach of NZ Inc, if that small town gets heavily damaged the country can pull together and fix it up relatively easily.

""However, as we saw from Christchurch, that would have been a major dent in the country's fortunes had we not had so much insurance money flowing in. We are far better off looking at the resilience of our major cities in particular, and acknowledging we need to have different considerations of risk in those cities.""

It appears the Government may be thinking that way too.

Building and Construction Minister Jenny Salesa is going to Cabinet next month with an amendment to EPB regulations and the way they affect regional communities.

CHRIS SKELTON/STUFF Minister Jenny Salesa says the Government is looking at low-damage design.

She declined to offer detail but did say the changes were a result of discussions with provincial mayors over ""their concerns about the new EPB regime and how they might be resolved"".

Regarding any possible changes to building codes and ratings, Salesa says the country is only two years into the EPB regime, a ""35-year programme of work [that] came into force on July 1, 2017"".

""Any changes that we would consider need to be based on actual evidence, weighing up all of the considerations involved, and put through the appropriate legislative process.""

But the Government is looking at possible changes to building design and construction.

""Separately to the EPB regime, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [MBIE] is helping to facilitate thinking around low-damage design,"" says Salesa.

""Officials are working with Engineering NZ and the Structural Engineering Society to develop information on low-damage building design. Once this is ready, MBIE plans on releasing it publicly.""

That is likely to be music to the ears of Grafton, Hare and others, and life-giving oxygen to one struggling canary.

66,66,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Japan Customs ill-equipped to handle surge in cruise passengers - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Japan-Customs-ill-equipped-to-handle-surge-in-cruise-passengers,"TOKYO -- With more cruise ships calling at the nation's ports, the influx of passengers has highlighted Japan Customs' acute manpower shortage.

Last year, the number of cruise passengers coming ashore in Japan was 14 times more than in 2013. Over the same five years, the number of customs agents increased 7%. One customs source said the agency's ability to handle cruise passengers is nearing its limits.

The problem could grow worse as the government tries to attract more cruise passengers to Japan as part of its growth strategy.

Its goal is for 5 million foreign cruise passengers to come ashore in 2020. Each passenger spends 40,000 yen a day when in a port city, according to many estimates. And since many ports of call are far-flung -- away from Japan's major metropolises -- there is hope that these big boats and the big spenders they carry can help revitalize regional economies.

So customs agents will have to deal with the influx, like they did on April 27. That day, four cruise ships entered Yokohama Port at the same time, bringing a 8,000 passengers to Osanbashi Yokohama International Passenger Terminal and two other customs, immigration and quarantine areas. It was the most people Yokohama customs agents had ever had to deal with at one time.

For the day, Yokohama agents handled 20,000 people, including crew members, disembarking cruise ships. ""At this rate,"" a Yokohama Customs official said, ""our inspection capacity will soon go beyond its limit.""

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism estimates that Japan welcomed 2.34 million cruise passengers in fiscal 2018 and that they accounted for less than 10% of the total 31.63 million foreign visitors who arrived during the 12 months.

Arrivals from China, where the middle class is rapidly expanding, are way up. Last year, about 80% of cruise arrivals, or 2.02 million, were from China.

The Japanese government, however, has been slow to ensure customs can handle the swell of tourists arriving by sea. The number of agents for fiscal 2019, which began in April, was padded by 2% from a year earlier, to 9,617. This represents about a 9% hike from five years ago.

Customs is among a few government branches that have been allowed to increase staffing levels. Nevertheless, it has not hired nearly enough agents to keep up with the surge in foreign arrivals.

Customs procedures at seaports have their own set of problems. Cruise ships do not have specified spots to anchor at. And unlike at airports, there is no fixed customs inspection hall.

Each time a cruise ship docks, customs officers scurry to a building that passengers will pass through, toting their own inspection benches, luggage X-ray equipment, metal detectors and other devices. After processing all of the arrivals, inspectors then have to remove the equipment.

If immigration procedures for cruise passengers are perceived to be lax, smugglers could try to exploit the situation. In 2017, agents caught cruise passengers attempting to smuggle about 27 kg of gold bullion worth roughly 120 million yen ($1.1 million), and 7 kg worth of stimulant drugs.

The government is considering new countermeasures. It could make agents' jobs easier by securing passenger information in advance. The airline industry uses a passenger name record (PNR) system that contains more than 30 pieces of information on passengers, like names and the dates on which flights were booked, primarily for security purposes.

The cruise industry has no such system.

The Ministry of Finance has proposed that the World Customs Organization, which is in charge of establishing international rules for customs procedures, set up a PNR-like system for cruise ships. In March, WCO member countries broadly agreed to the proposal. More than 180 countries and regions belong to the WCO, so if the proposal becomes a reality, a global information network on cruise passengers will be established.

The Japanese government, which would like something set up ahead of next summer's Tokyo Olympics, is also mulling its own system to acquire passenger information from cruise lines. It also plans to install passport-scanning devices body X-ray scanners at ports.","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F3%252F4%252F2%252F4%252F21254243-1-eng-GB%252F%25E3%2582%25AF%25E3%2583%25AB%25E3%2583%25BC%25E3%2582%25BA%25E8%2588%25B9%25E6%2580%25A5%25E5%25A2%2597%25E3%2581%25AE%25E4%25BB%2595%25E6%258E%259B%25E3%2581%2591%25E5%2586%2599%25E7%259C%259F20190614111124873_Data.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['japan', 'cruise', 'million', 'passenger', 'yokohama', 'customs', 'agents', 'passengers', 'ships', 'information', 'surge', 'illequipped', 'handle']", 
67,67,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Could Canada be a safe haven for climate refugees? - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/canada-climate-refugees-1.5165029,"This story is part of a CBC News series entitled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.

Lying in the central Pacific Ocean, the islands of Kiribati look like a tropical paradise. Surrounded by crystal-clear water and coral reefs, with coconut palm and pandanus trees lining the islands, it's straight out of a holiday brochure. On any given day, the temperature hovers around 30 C and rarely drops below 25 C.

But looks can be deceiving.

In 2015, Ioane Teitiota, a resident of Kiribati, sought (and was denied) refugee status in New Zealand. His reason for seeking haven? It's estimated that by 2100, the Kiribati islands — as well as others in the Pacific — will have disappeared entirely, succumbing to rising sea levels, displacing potentially hundreds of thousands of people.

The question remains: Where will all these people go?

Canada, land of plenty

No country in the world will escape the consequences of climate change. Some will see increased drought, more frequent storms or rising temperatures.

Canada will likely see it all.

In the Atlantic, eroding coastlines can likely be expected; in central Quebec and southern Ontario, rising temperatures, with more frequent heat waves and long-lasting storms; the Prairies may face long periods of drought; Alberta and British Columbia could see increasing forest fires. And there have already been dramatic changes in the Arctic, with disappearing sea ice and thawing permafrost.

Each effect comes with its own consequences.

But with the changing climate, there will be areas in the country, previously considered unlivable, that may become more temperate. Some suggest this puts Canada in the unique position of being able to accept those who have been pushed out of their home due to climate change-related conditions: Climate refugees.

A 2010 report by the federal government, entitled Climate Change and Forced Migration: Canada's Role, concluded that ""best estimates suggest that hundreds of millions of people could be on the move in the coming decades due to the impacts of climate change. Canada has an opportunity now to plan an orderly and effective response to the coming crisis.""

But there doesn't yet seem to be a solid plan in place, and that's largely due to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention.

When a refugee isn't a refugee

According to the UN Refugee Agency, roughly 68.5 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes, 25.4 million of whom are refugees.

While the UN Refugee Agency keeps track of forced displacement, it doesn't specifically monitor the number of people being uprooted due to climate change. In large part, that's because its 1951 Refugee Convention doesn't recognize climate threats as something from which a person may be fleeing.

""At present, climate factors themselves are not seen in the refugee convention as grounds for refugee status,"" said Adrian Edwards, global spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). ""The refugee convention typically covers conflict: wars and persecution.""

But as with increasing extreme weather events, climate change may be playing a role in conflict.

""Increasingly, we are seeing climate factors playing into situations that cause conflict, that cause the very things that produce refugees and internal displacement,"" said Edwards.

The situation in Syria is of note, he said, as some believe the drought that occurred between 2006 and 2010 was in part a catalyst to the ongoing war that began in 2011.

Climate change is more than rising thermometers, wildfires, droughts and storms; it even has a hand in altering whale songs, flowering plants and civil war. (Dusan Vranic/Associated Press)

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Ahmed Hussen declined several interview requests from CBC News. However, a statement sent by his office said: ""Generally speaking, in order to be considered for resettlement to Canada, individuals must be a Convention refugee as defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.""

This Canadian act largely abides by the Convention.

But the statement added that ""with respect to individuals potentially impacted by climate change, decisions on actions the Government of Canada may take in the event of natural disasters are taken on a case by case basis.""

In late 2018, Canada was one of 167 countries that signed the UN's Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which sets out that participating countries need to ""identify, develop and strengthen solutions for migrants compelled to leave their countries of origin due to slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change.""

The pact, however, isn't legally binding.

There isn't any provision specific to climate change migrants in the Immigration Refugee Protection Act, said Jamie Chai Yun Liew, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in immigration, refugee and citizenship law.

""However, having said that, we do see government responses to, for example, the earthquake in Haiti,"" she said. ""You could argue that those people were migrants as a result of an environmental disaster. So we do see governments responding when there is a disaster.""

While a disappearing island may be a clear sign of losing your home to climate change, Liew said that not all change would be as easy to identify.

Although Canadian governments have been quick to respond to extreme environmental disasters, she said, the same response isn't typically extended to ""something more gradual, or something that is a little bit unseen or invisible.""

""I think there has to be a conversation about what is it that we want to respond to in terms of helping people,"" Liew said.

Internal displacement

Not everyone experiencing the effects of climate change will need to leave their country.

""The vast majority of people who need to move for climate-related reasons will probably relocate within their home country,"" said Robert McLeman, an associate professor of geography and environmental studies at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont.

Oftentimes, he said, it's farmers suffering drought who move to a city. That puts added strain on resources and infrastructure, which can lead to pollution and overcrowding in cities, ultimately encouraging residents to leave the country.

But does that constitute migration due to climate change? It's a fuzzy issue.

""Most of these cities cannot cope with the influx of people during these weather and climate disasters,"" McLeman said. ""It sort of generates a negative spiral in that you get climate and weather-related events driving people into cities and the quality of life goes down.""

McLeman said we may see internal migration within the U.S., particularly from places facing eroding coastlines, like southern Texas, Florida and Louisiana. And perhaps those people will consider moving across the border.

It's unlikely Canada will see a sudden, rapid influx of climate refugees, said Luisa Veronis, an associate professor of geography, environment and geomatics at the University of Ottawa. But an influx could build over time, she said, so it's important that our governments begin to plan for it, particularly when it comes to infrastructure.

""Preparing and preventing down the road will save a lot of the cost,"" Veronis said, pointing to the damaging floods in eastern Ontario and southern Quebec this spring.

Looking forward

It's likely that the climate migrants Canada will see will come from nations who already have a history of migrating here, such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, India and China — all of which are some of the most vulnerable to climate change, either due to poverty, population pressure, or geography that is particularly susceptible to rising sea levels and extreme weather events.

As for the people of Kiribati, it's unknown where they will end up, or if they will leave at all.

Former Kiribati president Anote Tong believes there could be plans to recreate the tiny nation as a floating island — something that sounds straight out of science fiction, but is an idea some engineering firms are already trying to design.

And just in case, Tong has also bought an island in Fiji for the country's more than 100,000 residents.

Today, Tong travels the world, speaking about the changing climate and calling governments to task on their inaction.

But he doesn't see those who may face the harsh fact that their homes are no longer habitable as refugees. Instead, he believes in ""migration with dignity,"" arming migrants with education and skills so they can migrate voluntarily.

In the meantime, people who have little to do with driving up greenhouse gases are the ones who will likely face the harshest consequences of a changing world.

""I think [climate change] will fall on the people who it affects the most, and they are the ones who will find resilient solutions to their own particular plight,"" Liew said. ""Unless there's some vested interest for a state to tackle this issue, I'm not really sure the international community will step up and do anything about it.""","Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5165551.1559853393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kiribati-climate.JPG,"['safe', 'weather', 'canada', 'climate', 'haven', 'migrants', 'rising', 'migration', 'kiribati', 'change', 'refugee', 'refugees']",

Up to 26 storms forecast for rainy season, five or six to overflow Mekong

A Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology spokesman said on Tuesday that there will be up to 26 storms this rainy season, but of those, only five or six will cause the Mekong river to overflow or result in general flooding.

Chan Yutha said storms mostly originate in the Pacific Ocean before proceeding to the South China Sea, and then potentially on to Cambodia and the Mekong basin region.

“Generally, the storms that take place in the South China Sea mostly occur from mid-August to mid-October. According to weather forecasts, from August to October Cambodia could face flooding due to rainfall or Mekong river flooding due to the influence of five to six storms that could happen in China’s south gulf,” he said.

However, Yutha said now that the El Nino effect has decreased substantially, the southwest monsoon low-pressure system has resulted in rainfall all over the country, which is favourable for farmers’ crops.

But according to the ministry’s weather forecast announcement for this year’s rainy season, dated Monday, a short dry spell could also take place between late-July and early-August, posing problems for growing and maintaining crops.

Yutha said the ministry, in conjunction with relevant provincial departments, is ready to intervene to help farmers experiencing a water shortage in certain areas of the country.

“A small dry spell could occur for 10 to 15 days, but the wind will not be as hot as it was earlier in the year. In the early days of the rainy season there was a lot of rainfall, which means some basins or reservoirs, such as creeks, lakes, canals and rivers, still have a lot of water,” he said.

Yutha said that according to the forecast, rainfall will continue to take place until mid-July.","Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/a_ministry_of_water_resources_and_meteorology_spokesman_said_on_tuesday_that_there_will_be_up_to_26_storms_this_rainy_season._facebook.jpg,"['water', 'south', 'rainfall', 'season', 'ministry', 'mekong', 'storms', 'rainy', 'forecast', '26', 'overflow', 'place']", 
69,69,FL-2019-000079-BGD,External Debt: Repayment to hit record high - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/external-debt-repayment-hit-record-high-1755166,"Bangladesh is going for a record amount in external debt repayment this fiscal year, putting pressure on the almost stagnant foreign currency reserves and tightening market conditions.

The Economic Relations Division data shows that the government has paid $1.34 billion to external lenders in the first 10 months till April of the outgoing fiscal year, up by 14.4 percent than what was paid over the corresponding period a year ago.

Bangladesh repaid $1.2 billion to its external lenders in fiscal 2017-18, according to the latest report on “Flow of External Resources into Bangladesh” compiled by the ERD.

Since independence, the country’s foreign borrowing has been $51.83 billion till June 30, 2018. The government repaid $21.98 billion and the outstanding debt stood at $39.58 billion till April this year.

The government set a target to bring in $7.2 billion in foreign loan in the ongoing fiscal year. During the last nine months, it borrowed $4.52 billion whereas the amount was $3.42 billion in the corresponding period last year.

Analysts said still Bangladesh was in the comfort zone but the situation would turn critical after five years when repayment of big and supplier credits begin.

Economists assume that the loan repayment allocation would significantly be hiked in the budget.

A senior ERD official told The Daily Star that there was no possibility of falling in a debt trap within the next 10 years as per their calculations despite the fact that the government would have to make big repayments in the next five years as large loans mature.

According to Zahid, loan repayment would not be a big problem for the government as it would be ensuring proper utilisation of foreign loans.

“Foreign loan repayment is not a burden for Bangladesh at this moment. It may put pressure on the economy after five to six years when repayment of big and supplier credit loans will start,” said Zahid Hussain, lead economist at World Bank Dhaka office.

However, he said, if the government uses it properly in a way to contribute to the economy and continue the present economic growth, it would not create any pressure.

According to him, the government is implementing some infrastructure projects which would not be economically viable as their cost overruns and implementation delays would put the economy at risk.

“Implementation delays of infrastructure projects will not bring expected returns,” he said.

Zahid Hussain sees unnecessary expenditure in the implementation of big projects and the government taking up expensive loans irrespective of where it has been mobilised from.

He said loans from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency were still concessional but the others were really expensive and of short terms compared to those of multilateral lenders.

He further said the percentage of expensive credit was still not at a risky level and was still manageable, but in future it would create pressure on the economy due to cost overruns and project implementation delays.

If the returns are lower than the implementation costs, it will definitely create pressure on the economy and the government will have to reduce allocation for education and health and social welfare to make loan repayments, he noted.

Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of Policy Research Institute, said Bangladesh will face a debt burden after five to six years when repayment of expensive loan starts.

The government should be careful in the selection of projects and only those with good returns should be implemented, he said.

“I think expensive projects like the Padma rail link, Karnaphuli tunnel and Dohazari to Cox’s Bazar rail line will not be economically viable as there will be no good returns,” he said.

“The government will have to make repayments higher than returns.” he said.

According to Mansur, if the export volume and remittance did not increase alongside the GDP growth, the government would have to impose taxes which would have to be borne by the citizens.","Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/erd.jpg?itok=CRjw75lj,"['high', 'returns', 'debt', 'pressure', 'bangladesh', 'expensive', 'economy', 'big', 'loan', 'external', 'record', 'projects', 'billion', 'hit', 'repayment']",

The win has placed Australia in a comfortable position and the defending champions look all set to qualify for the semis.

Australia posted a mammoth 381/5 in 50 overs after choosing to bat first, their second highest score in World Cup history.

Warner, who crushed 166 off 147 balls, equalled Virat Kohli as he turned out to be just the second batsman to complete 16 ODI hundreds in 110 innings. This is the Aussie southpaw’s sixth 150 plus score and his second century of the ongoing World Cup.

Pursuing the massive total, Bangladesh gave a splendid record of themselves as Mushfiqur Rahim stayed unbeaten on 102 off 97 balls, his brilliant innings bound with nine fours and a six while Mahmadullah and Tamim Iqbal gave him good support from the other end.

Bangladesh finished with 333/8 in 50 overs.

Mushfiqur and Mahmadullah shared a 127-run stand for the fifth wicket after Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim held hands for a 79-run second wicket partnership. However, eventually it turned out to be a total too tall for the men in green to chase it down.

Australia presently have eight points from five outings and are at the third spot while Bangladesh stay fifth with five points in same number of matches. The day totally belonged to Warner’s phenomenal display of batting heroics.

Other than Warner, captain Aaron Finch proceeded with his great form with the bat to score 53 off 51 balls while Usman Khawaja additionally contributed with a splendid 89 off 72 balls, hitting ten fours.

Marcus Stoinis (2/54), Mitchell Starc (2/55) and Nathan Coulter Nile were the pick of the bowlers for Australia picking six wickets between them.

Soumya Sarkar had dismissed three Aussie batsmen in the first innings.

71,71,FL-2019-000079-BGD,New ‘Prepare Florida’ Initiative Offers Hurricane Preparedness Resources - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2019/06/12/528954.htm,"Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jimmy Patronis has launched an initiative designed to encourage Floridians to prepare now before a hurricane makes landfall. According to a statement from the Florida Department of Financial Services, the new Prepare Florida initiative will focus on helping Floridians take steps to prepare their home and finances for a disaster.

“While Floridians know all too well the devastation hurricanes can have on their lives, it’s easy to not take the threat seriously,” Patronis said. “An active hurricane season is predicted, with the possibility of up to four major hurricanes. As we saw with Hurricane Michael, hurricanes can form and strengthen quickly, leaving little time to prepare and evacuate.”

The PrepareFL.com website serves as a one-stop-shop for disaster preparedness information and resources to help Floridians ensure they are prepared to weather the next storm, including:

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that as many as 8 hurricanes may form in the Atlantic in 2019, a “near normal” season following two years of storms that have left a trail of death and destruction in the Caribbean and U.S. coast.

Nine to 15 named storms are forecast during the six-month season that starts June 1, NOAA said, which has been largely correct with its predictions in recent years. Of those, 4 to 8 will become hurricanes and 2 to 4 will be major systems with winds of 111 miles (179 kilometers) per hour or more.

In 2018, storms Michael and Florence struck the U.S. South, causing widespread damage that’s still lingering as residents struggle to rebuild. Florence ripped into North Carolina in September, bringing record storm surge and rain that flooded homes and businesses before causing additional destruction across South Carolina. It’s blamed for 52 deaths, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The following month, Hurricane Michael leveled homes in Florida’s panhandle when it came ashore near Mexico Beach. The storm killed at least 16 and caused $25 billion in damage, the National Hurricane Center said. It was the third most intense storm in terms of central pressure and brought the fourth strongest winds of any to hit the contiguous U.S. on record.

“The time is now to prepare and protect your home and business,” Patronis said.

""I would like to request you all who are in our schools, colleges, offices and courts to plant some saplings in your respective workplaces and houses. Also our children will have to be taught it (tree plantation). You'll also have to nurture trees alongside plantation of saplings,"" she said.



The prime minister said this while inaugurating the programmes of the World Environment Day and Environment Fair-2019 and the National Tree Plantation Campaign and Fair-2019 at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre (BICC) in the capital.



She also urged everybody to plant at least three saplings - a fruit-producing tree, a timber-producing and a herbal-contributing one.



Noting that creating green belts is very essential for the sake of the environment, Hasina said her government's target is to bring 20 percent land of the country under forestation. The government also continues various activities to accomplish the target, she added.



The prime minister asked to keep tree plantation programme and consider the protection system of water bodies while undertaking any development project.



Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin presided over the function, while Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the ministry Saber Hossain Chowdhury spoke on the occasion.



Deputy Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Habibun Nahar attended the programmes. Environment, Forest and Climate Change Secretary Abdullah Al MohsinChowdhury delivered the welcome speech.



The theme of this year's World Environment Day is 'Air Pollution' with the slogan- Beat Air Pollution.



At the function, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina handed over the National Environmental Award-2019 to three individuals and two organisations under two categories for their contributions to the environment.



Chairman of Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, noted Water and Climate Changes expert Prof Ainun Nishat and Scientific Adviser of Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation Dr Mubarak Ahmad Khan received the environmental awards under the individual category.



Bangladesh Forest Research Institute (BFRI) and Envoy Textiles Limited received the environmental awards under the organisation category.



The Prime Minister also handed over Bangabandhu Award for Wildlife Conservation-2019 and Prime Minister's National Award for Tree Plantation-2018 at the event.



Besides, she handed over cheques among the beneficiaries for the profit earned from social forestation.



Hasina inaugurated Sheikh Kamal Wildlife Centre in Gazipur and the 12-storey Poribesh Bhaban in the city.



The prime minister opened the National Tree Plantation Campaign by planting a tamarind sapling on the BICC premise.

Bookmark this page to stay up to date

By Megan Darby and Isabelle Gerretsen

To end dangerous overheating of the planet, humans need to stop putting more greenhouse gases into the air than we take out.

The 2015 Paris Agreement set a global goal (couched in legalese) to reach net zero emissions in the second half of the century.

An increasing number of governments are translating that into national strategy, setting out visions of a carbon-free future. Is it enough? Of course not. But it is becoming the benchmark for leadership on the world stage.

More than a hundred countries have joined an alliance aiming for net zero emissions by 2050. This is aspirational and not always backed by domestic action.

To make Climate Home’s list, the target must be included in a winning political manifesto, government statement, policy paper, climate law, submission to the UN or other nationally determined document.

Here is a handy guide to who is promising what.

This article was last updated on 13 May 2021. If we have missed something, let us know by emailing [email protected] For more on the origins of the net zero target, read our deep dive

Argentina

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: Argentina raised its climate ambition in an updated plan to the UN in December 2020, pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and cap its 2030 emissions unconditionally at 359 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), 26% lower than the previous cap of 483 Mt, presented in 2016.

Austria

Target date: 2040

Status: Policy position

Notes: A coalition government sworn in January 2020 promised to pursue climate neutrality by 2040 and 100% clean electricity by 2030, underpinned by binding carbon targets. The right wing People’s Party agreed to the goals in partnership with the Green Party.

Brazil

Target date: 2060

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Brazil set an “indicative” goal of carbon neutrality by 2060 in its updated pledge to the Paris Agreement submitted December 2020. However it was not matched by an increase in ambition before 2030 and came as deforestation reached a 12-year high.

Bhutan

Target date: Currently carbon negative and aiming for carbon neutrality as it develops

Status: Pledged towards the Paris Agreement

Notes: With a population of less than a million, on low incomes, surrounded by forests and hydropower resources, Bhutan has an easier task balancing the carbon accounts than most. It has some green policies, but economic growth and rising demand for cars is putting upward pressure on emissions.

Canada

Target date: 2050

Status: Draft law

Notes: Justin Trudeau narrowly scraped a second term as prime minister in October 2019, on a platform that centred climate action. He presented a draft law in November 2020 that would require successive governments to create carbon targets and a plan to meet them every five years from 2030-2050. His Liberal Party falling short of a majority in parliament, Trudeau will need to broker deals with smaller parties to pass that law. Trudeau walked a tightrope on climate and energy policy in his first term, pushing through a carbon tax while defending controversial oil pipelines. He continues to face pressure from leftist and green parties to block the pipelines and from oil-producing provinces to water down climate policy.

Chile

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: President Sebastian Piñera announced the country’s intention to go carbon neutral in June 2019. Santiago was due to host UN climate talks later that year, but cancelled at the last minute due to civil unrest. In April 2020 the government reiterated its long term goal as it submitted a strengthened medium term pledge to the UN. For starters, the country will close eight of its 28 coal power plants by 2024 and phase out the fuel by 2040.

China

Target date: 2060

Status: Statement of intent

Notes: President Xi Jinping announced to the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2020 that China would strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The country would adopt “more vigorous policies and measures” to peak emissions before 2030, he added. Beijing has prioritised clean energy in its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, but many provinces are building new coal power plants to boost economic growth.

Colombia

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: By 2030 Colombia will cut its emissions by 51% compared to business as usual, the country pledged in its submission to the UN in December 2020. The new target is a huge jump from the previous pledge which was a 20% of emissions reduction compared with business as usual by 2030. By 2050 the country aims to be carbon neutral.

Costa Rica

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Previous administrations said Costa Rica would be carbon neutral by 2021, which is… not happening. In February 2019, president Carlos Alvarado Quesada set out a climate policy package. A long term strategy submitted to the UN in December confirmed net zero emissions as the 2050 goal. The country is routinely celebrated for getting nearly all its electricity from renewables – primarily hydropower – but citizens still rely on petrol and diesel to get around. An e-mobility decree adopted in 2018 aims to change that.

Denmark

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: The government set out plans in 2018 to build a “climate-neutral society” by 2050. Its package included a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and support for electric vehicles. Climate change was a major theme in June 2019 parliamentary elections and the victorious “red bloc” parties enshrined tougher emissions targets in legislation passed six months later.

European Union

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: The European Commission is working towards a bloc-wide 2050 net zero emissions target, under a “Green Deal” published in December 2019. It was endorsed by the European Council of national leaders the same month, with Poland the only dissenting voice, refusing to commit to its implementation. The long term strategy was presented to the UN in March 2020.

Fiji

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: As president of Cop23, the UN climate summit in 2017, Fiji made an extra effort to show leadership. In 2018, the Pacific island state submitted a plan to the UN with the goal of net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy. Its “very high ambition” scenario even goes carbon negative, but this is contingent on new technologies and international support. In December 2020, Fiji said it aims to slash emissions 30% by 2030, compared to 2013.

Finland

Target date: 2035

Status: Coalition agreement

Notes: Five political parties agreed in June 2019 to strengthen the country’s climate law, as part of negotiations to form a government. The target is expected to require curbs on industrial logging and a phaseout of peat burning for power generation.

France

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: French lawmakers voted a net zero target into law on 27 June 2019, the same day as the UK. Other parts of the government’s proposed climate and energy package remained to be agreed. Controversially, it proposed postponing nuclear power plant closures. In its first report in June, the newly established High Council for the Climate advised France must triple the pace of emissions reductions to meet the carbon neutrality goal.

Germany

Target date: 2045

Status: Draft climate law

Notes: Germany raised its climate ambition to target net zero emissions by 2045 following a landmark court ruling in May 2021. The cabinet adopted a 65% emissions reduction by 2030, 85-90% by 2040 and net zero emissions by 2045, all compared to 1990 levels. The previous targets were 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve the goals, analysts say Germany must phase out coal by 2030, speed up the transition to electric mobility and increase the carbon price on transport and heating fuel.

Grenada

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: The small island nation has committed to reducing its emissions by 40% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, and net zero by 2050.

Hungary

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Hungary committed to climate neutrality by 2050 in a 3-page climate law passed in June 2020. That was not backed up by a strengthened 2030 emissions-cutting target, however, putting off the heavy lifting to next decade. The country is set to close its last coal power plant by 2025 and build new nuclear capacity, with Russia’s help.

Iceland

Target date: 2040

Status: Policy position

Notes: The strategy unveiled in 2018 focuses on phasing fossil fuels out of the transport sector, tree-planting and restoring wetlands. Iceland already has virtually carbon-free electricity and heating from geothermal and hydroelectric sources.

Ireland

Target date: 2050

Status: Draft law

Notes: Ireland’s coalition government approved a climate bill in March 2021 that enshrines emissions reduction targets in law and puts the country on a path to carbon neutrality by 2050. The government agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by an average 7% per year and 51% between 2018 and 2030, in line with Paris Agreement commitments. Sectors such as transport and agriculture will require significant reform if they are to halve their emissions by 2030.

Japan

Target date: 2050

Status: Statement of intent

Notes: In October 2020, Japan announced its 2050 net zero target. Japan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter and relies on coal for a third of its electricity generation. The net zero target requires significant investment in renewables and a complete overhaul of the country’s existing climate strategy which focuses heavily on coal power.

Maldives

Target date: 2030

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: The Maldives is aiming for net zero emissions by 2030, but this ambitious target is only attainable with significant financial support. The small, low-lying island state is already suffering severe climate impacts such as storm surges and coastal erosion.

Laos

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In its submission to the UN in May 2021, Laos said it is aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and reduce emissions by 60% from business as usual by 2030 – around 62Mt CO2. Agriculture is the biggest driver of emissions in the southeast Asian nation. Mitigation measures include expanding forest cover to 70% of land area by 2030 and rapidly ramping up renewables.

Marshall Islands

Target date: 2050

Status: Pledged towards the Paris Agreement

Notes: The low-lying island nation is acutely vulnerable to sea level rise and keen to set an example on decarbonisation. Its updated submission to the UN in September 2018 set out an aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050, albeit without concrete policies to get all the way. Depending on the availability of international support, the plan identified measures to cut emissions 56-87% from 2010 levels.

Nepal

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In December 2020, Nepal said in its national submission to the UN that it aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, by investing more in renewables, electric transport and reforestation. Nepal’s carbon emissions per capita are among the lowest in the world, but the country is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Himalayan glaciers in Nepal have been losing almost half a metre of ice each year since the start of the century and floods and landslides are common.

New Zealand

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: Unusually for a developed country, New Zealand’s biggest source of emissions is farming. A law passed in November 2019 sets a net zero goal for all greenhouse gases except biogenic methane (mostly from sheep and cattle), which is to be cut 24-47% from 2017 levels by 2050. It remains contentious with the meat lobby, which argues New Zealand will lose market share to countries with less stringent sustainability standards.

Norway

Target date: 2030/2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: Norway was among the first parliaments in the world to discuss climate neutrality, with lawmakers agreeing to aim for 2050 domestically and 2030 with international offsets. This was a signal of intent, not a binding climate law. The country benefits from abundant hydropower resources and has aggressive policies to electrify road transport, yet the government continues to back controversial Arctic oil drilling.

Panama

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: Panama has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050. Panama plans to restore 50,000 hectares of national forests, which will contribute to absorbing around 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions by 2050, according to the NDC partnership.

Portugal

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: Portugal launched a roadmap in December 2018 for getting to net zero, outlining strategies for energy, transport, waste, farming and forests. It is one of the member states calling for the EU to adopt a 2050 net zero target.

Singapore

Target date: “As soon as viable in the second half of the century”

Status: Submission to UN

Notes: Like Japan, Singapore has avoided committing to a firm date for decarbonisation, but cited it as the ultimate goal of a long term strategy submitted to the UN in March 2020. Internal combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out by 2040, in favour of electric vehicles, but the island state said its clean energy potential was limited by a lack of space for solar panels.

Slovakia

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: One of the first EU member states to formally submit a long term strategy to the UN, Slovakia said it was aiming for “climate neutrality” in 2050. However the document focused on policies out to 2030 and noted further measures would need to be developed to meet the target.

South Africa

Target date: 2050

Status: Policy position

Notes: The government unveiled its Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) in September 2020, outlining its aim of becoming a net zero economy by 2050. However, the energy plan cited in the strategy still sees South Africa burning coal on this date. Currently over 90% of the country’s electricity is generated from coal and the country is building coal plants as well as supporting investment in renewables.

South Korea

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: South Korean president Moon Jae-in formally committed to a 2050 net zero target in October 2020, turning an election promise into a policy pledge. This was later confirmed in a submission to the UN. After his Democratic Party won a landslide victory in April 2020, Moon declared that he would push ahead with his manifesto promise of a Green New Deal to decarbonise the economy by 2050 and end coal financing. It is a big deal for the 7th highest national CO2 emitter. South Korea gets over 40% of its electricity from coal and has been a major financier of overseas coal projects.

Spain

Target date: 2050

Status: Draft law

Notes: The government presented its draft climate framework bill to parliament in May 2020, as the country started to loosen restrictions on movement to halt the spread of coronavirus. Originally intended to create a long term framework for cutting emissions, the law doubles as a blueprint for economic recovery from Covid-19, said vice president Teresa Ribera. It sets interim targets for 2030, establishes a commission to monitor progress and bans new coal, oil and gas exploration licences with immediate effect.

Sweden

Target date: 2045

Status: In law

Notes: Sweden legislated its net zero target in 2017, bringing forward its timeline for carbon neutrality by five years in response to the Paris Agreement. It got extra attention in contrast with Donald Trump’s move to withdraw the US from the pact. At least 85% of the emissions cuts are to be achieved through domestic policies, leaving the door open for international credits to make up the rest.

Switzerland

Target date: 2050

Status: Submission to the UN

Notes: In its national submission to the UN in December 2020, Switzerland announced its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050, deepening its target under the Paris Agreement of a 70-85% emission reduction. In 2015, the small land-locked country was the first in the world to submit its formal emissions reduction plan for 2030 to the UN. The country’s climate strategy includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the air – the mountainous country hosts some of the most advanced projects in this field – and investing in renewables.

Ukraine

Target date: 2060

Status: Policy position

Notes: In Ukraine’s 2030 economic strategy in March 2021, the country outlined its plans to achieve carbon neutrality “no later than 2060.” Under current plans, Ukraine is only on track to reach net zero emissions by 2070, according to Climate Action Tracker. The country will need to accelerate its deployment of renewable energy and bring forward its 2050 coal phase-out date if it is to meet its 2060 target.

United Kingdom

Target date: 2050

Status: In law

Notes: The UK already passed a framework law for cutting emissions in 2008, so setting a net zero target is as simple as replacing 80% with 100%. Parliament passed the amendment on 27 June 2019. Meeting the goal is tougher and the independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has emphasised more policies will be needed across sectors to give it life.

Scotland’s devolved parliament is working on a bill to reach net zero in 2045, based on its strong renewable energy resources and capacity to store CO2 in depleted North Sea oilfields. It is expected to pass into law by autumn 2019.

The CCC advised Wales would have a harder job and 95% emissions cuts by 2050 was feasible. The Welsh government accepted the recommendation and expressed an ambition to go further to net zero.

United States of America

Target date: 2050

Status: Statement of intent

Notes: Joe Biden was elected president of the US in November 2020 on a climate platform to aim for net zero emissions by 2050. His victory followed four years of erosion of climate protections under Donald Trump. Biden promised a $2 trillion “clean energy revolution” and 100% clean electricity by 2035, but a weak result for his Democratic Party in the Senate will limit his ability to deliver. The Sunrise Movement and other grassroots activists are mobilising to hold the incoming administration to its climate ambition.

Uruguay

Target date: 2030

Status: Contribution to the Paris Agreement

Notes: This is more of a forecast than a commitment, based on Uruguay’s anomalous trend of increasing forest cover. Combined with policies to reduce emissions from beef farming, waste and energy, this is expected to make the country a net carbon sink by 2030, according to its national submission to the UN pact.","Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2019/05/zero-2032509_1280-e1558089768498.jpg,"['submission', 'climate', '2030', 'countries', 'carbon', 'net', 'zero', '2050status', '2050', 'emissions', 'date', 'goal']", 
76,76,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Low-Income Neighbourhoods Are More Vulnerable to Heatwave Spells - The Wire,https://thewire.in/environment/heatwave-india-urban-cities-neighbourhoods,"As India stares at one of the longest heatwaves in three decades, which so far has claimed over 200 lives, experts warn that the spell will impact people in poor urban neighbourhoods for weeks after the scorcher is over.

In a study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment in April 2019, researchers mapped and compared exposure to heat between low-income and other neighbourhoods in Delhi (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Faisalabad (Pakistan).

While high and low-income neighbourhoods both have heat going up during the day, one’s ability to afford air conditioning (AC), avoid strenuous activities outdoors and presence of shade make a difference in coping with the heat exposure, said co-author Christian Siderius of the Wageningen University and Research (WUR).

But people in densely built, low-income neighbourhoods, with no open green spaces, remain unsheltered from heat even at night. Because, at night, these neighbourhoods, tend to trap the heat of the day and stay warmer.

“And due to a combination of factors when the heatwave is over, poor people will be exposed to extremely high night-time temperatures for many more weeks or even months,” said Siderius, adding that this creates an ongoing health risk.

Instead of just tracking urban heat island or air temperature, researchers assessed the exposure to heat in outdoor microclimatic conditions in terms of thermal indices. They advocated that heat action plans (HAP) be based on thermal indices so as to include factors such as humidity, not just temperature thresholds.

Heat is more than just high temperature and it is influenced by several other factors such as humidity, wind, direct or indirect radiation from the sun and indices take into account these factors and give an idea of how hot one really feels.

“Cities are hotter than rural areas around them (we see differences of up to eight degrees Celsius), especially at night. In dense urban areas where the poor live it is even more so. Then they don’t have AC or well-insulated houses so they can’t escape the heat,” said Siderius, also associated with London School of Economics (at the Grantham Research Institute).

“And finally, while temperatures go down a bit with the onset of the monsoon, humidity increases which means heat indices generally stay high. So it’s not so much an emergency situation, but more of an ongoing health risk,” he said.

Hem Dholakia of Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), who was not associated with the study, agreed about the increased impact of heat in poorer urban areas.

“Let us say that a poor person living in a tin shed, with little or no ventilation, experiences, on an average, a temperature that is two degrees higher indoors, than the outside temperatures. On a heatwave day, when the outside temperature is 41 degrees Celsius, this person is exposed to a temperature of nearly 43 degrees Celsius,” Dholakia elaborated.

“Once the outside temperature drops to 38 degrees (i.e. the heat wave has passed) the person may still experience 40 degrees indoors. Thus, the exposure for the poor may be prolonged based on housing characteristics. This will drive health impacts,” Dholakia told Mongabay-India.

Additionally, differences in heat exposure mostly depended on where in the city, slums or low-income neighbourhoods are situated.

For example, in Delhi, which recorded its highest ever June temperature, 48 degree Celsius, and where urban parts cover roughly half the total city area of 1500 square kilometres, poor neighbourhoods tend to be found all over the city and also close to the centre of the city.

“Here the influence of all the surrounding concrete, which cools down slowly during the night, is highest. In Pakistan’s third largest city of Faisalabad, poor neighbourhoods are now developing on the outskirts of the city, close to agricultural fields which cool down quicker at night which influences the outdoor temperature to some extent,” Siderius said. In Dhaka, in some slum areas close to water, which – if it flows – can cool down temperatures a bit.

Heatwave spells are increasing in India

According to the India Meteorological Department, a heat wave is declared if the maximum temperature at a recording station reaches at least 40 degree Celsius or more for plains, 37 degree Celsius or more for coastal stations and at least 30 degree Celsius or more for hilly regions.

As per the IMD, the frequency of severe heat waves has increased sharply in the past 15 years due to factors like climate change and urban heat island, a phenomenon where a city experiences a higher temperature than its surrounding rural areas.

The National Disaster Management Authority’s 2016 guidelines on preparation of heat action plan (HAP) states if the maximum temperature of any place continues to be more than 45 degrees Celsius consecutively for two days, it is called a heat wave condition.

This year in Churu in the state of Rajasthan, the maximum temperature hovered near 51 degree Celsius for three days. States such as Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha are also under the heatwave’s grip. Meanwhile in Bihar, over 150 people this year have succumbed to the heatwave, including 90 in four days alone (June 15-18, 2019).

Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, who is the secretary of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, told Mongabay-India that the present episode is one of the worst heatwave spells and stressed that heatwave spells are increasing over India.

Mahesh Palawat, who is the chief meteorologist with the private weather forecaster Skymet Weather dubbed it as one of the longest heatwave spells in the past few decades. “Due to continuous dry weather and absence of any pre-monsoon activity, the temperatures increased,” said Palawat.

“65.39% of the population (nearly two thirds) was exposed to high temperatures of over 40 degree Celsius in the country on June 10, 2019. 37% was exposed to the temperature for more than 10 hours in a day. With many weather stations recording their highest ever temperature in June, this could be one of the worst heatwaves the country has ever faced. The failure of the northeast monsoon, the pre-monsoon showers, cyclone Vayu, and the delayed onset (and progress) of monsoon have been the primary reasons behind the excessive heat during June,” Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, who is senior project associate at WRI India Sustainable Cities, told Mongabay-India.

“The massive crop fire incidents during the month of May made the situation worse as people were left exposed to higher temperatures. Satellite data indicate that around 57% of the population was exposed to higher temperatures between May 25 and June 6. Such massive exposures to extreme heat conditions could be having an immense effect on the health of the population, particularly among the weaker sections of the society,” said Palanichamy.

If the record of the past few years is to be considered, the rise in global temperature is not slowing any time soon. As per independent analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), earth’s global surface temperature in 2018 was the fourth warmest since 1880 and the past five years are, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.

According to a CEEW study, a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperatures (above pre-industrial level) will lead to non-linear increases in mortality risks across Indian cities.

Heat indices for heat action

Extreme heat can lead to dangerous, even deadly, health consequences, including heat stress and heatstroke. From 1992 to 2015, heatwaves have resulted in 22,562 deaths across India.

The western Indian city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat became the first south Asian city to prepare a heat wave action plan (HAP) in 2013 following the 2010 heat wave that claimed 1,344 lives.

Since its rollout, the plan has prevented about 1,100 deaths each year in Ahmedabad. The plan has been adopted by at least a dozen cities in the country. To activate the plan, colour coded heat alerts are issued based on temperature thresholds determined by the city’s civic body.

But experts argue that temperature thresholds are not enough because the observed health impacts from heat exposure are due to the combination temperature as well as humidity.

Dholakia said studies, like this one, from 2010, which compared heat indices to evaluate public health risk, for New York City, found that the heat index is more reliable in predicting deaths related heat as compared to a single variable such as minimum, average or maximum temperature.

While so far efforts have been directed on developing heat action plans in cities where temperatures reach the high forties (such as Ahmedabad and Nagpur), coastal cities should also have their own HAPs.

“Using the heat index approach, we find people living in cities within India with high humidity ( coastal cities like Mumbai, Chennai) and temperatures that typically reach the high thirties may also be vulnerable to heat health impacts,” Dholakia said.

In fact, as per NDMA guidelines on managing heat exposure, a mix of low temperature with high humidity and high temperature with low humidity can trigger similar levels of heat stress. So 43 degrees Celsius and 40% humidity or 33 degrees and 95% humidity can trigger similar levels of heat stress.

Suresh Rathi of Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad said the city of Surat in Gujarat, which has a considerable migrant population living in informal settlements, has come out with its HAP incorporating heat index.

“Our research on Surat has shown that there is an increase in night-time temperatures (by 3.7 degree Celsius in 30 years and the humidity levels throughout the year does not go below 60%,” Rathi said, stressing that heat index is more important than temperature threshold for Surat city.

“For Surat when we calculate heat-associated deaths then the number of deaths goes up by six per day if we take into account the heat index (when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature) in contrast to just considering temperature,” Rathi told Mongabay-India.

Further, the combination of high relative humidity and temperature also creates a favourable condition for mosquitoes to flourish. “This is more dangerous for slums where water is stored for longer periods of time,” Rathi said, adding the IMD is also discussing heat index.

Rohit Magotra, Deputy Director of Integrated Research for Action and Development (IRADe) that is working with three Indian cities (Delhi, Rajkot and Bhubaneshwar) to develop Climate Adaptive Heat Stress Action Plans (HSAPs), said the plans take into account the variation of temperature within cities themselves to chalk out thermal hotspots.

“Using satellite imageries we generated brightness maps (indicating reflectivity of surfaces) to highlight thermal hotspots. Using thermal hotspot maps, survey (of households) hotspots were delineated in each city, marking the slums and squatter settlements. Surveys captured the exposure, vulnerability and impact of heat stress on specific occupations such as street hawkers or vendors, construction workers, traffic police and others,” Magotra told Mongabay-India.

The plans are also gender-sensitive as they take into account specific concerns voiced by women which would help in better communication, said Magotra.

Underlining the study finding that heat stress thresholds are exceeded for months on end in Delhi, Dhaka, and Faisalabad, paper co-author Tanya Singh said one needs to plan in advance for heat exposure because people are also more vulnerable at the start of the heat season or heatwave as they are not acclimatised to it.

“Especially, when it starts getting warmer suddenly after winter. Also, it’s not only on a heatwave day, particularly, that people die, but it’s also on moderately hot days as well. You have more moderate hot days compared to extremely hot days so the population affected is higher on those days. But the focus is so much more on heatwaves,” Singh, associated with WUR and student at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Mongabay-India.

A window of opportunity for climate-smart cities

The authors suggest that climate-smart city design can help alleviate the burden of a rise in temperature due to climate change.

“Neighbourhoods, and not only the rich ones, should be designed such that they provide shading during the day, but also be intersected or embedded in open green spaces to provide cooling during the night,” they write in the study.

Siderius and colleagues argue that development challenges provide a window of opportunity in the region, as much of South Asia’s infrastructure of the future still needs to be built. There is a choice, to build it, climate-smart. Though Indian summers have always been hot and there have always been poor that coped, one needs to consider that climate has already warmed over the past decennia, and in the past cities weren’t this big and so urbanised.

“Another aspect which we have not touched upon – and which has changed a lot over the past decades – is the combination of air pollution and heat. Being (too) hot and breathing polluted air is a health risk, especially for vulnerable groups,” he said.

Rejeet Mathews, who is the head of urban development at World Resources Institute, India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, pointed out that urbanisation is not moving in a sustainable way.

“Urbanisation in terms of the construction of buildings, roads and pavements is increasing rapidly in India’s cities. This pace of growth does not spare environmentally sensitive areas such as flood plains, shallow lake beds, tree clusters and results in the overall loss of green cover. Concretisation and the increasing amounts of dry, impervious surfaces exacerbate the urban heat island effect, where temperatures are typically a few degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas,” Mathews told Mongabay-India.

For instance, in Bengaluru, about 85% of the floodplains of the city, is built on. This pattern of urbanisation is definitely causing a hotter microclimate, pointed out Mathews.

Mathews also stressed on the importance of considering traditional knowledge in modern constructions as cities lose green cover.

“Considering India will continue to face the brunt of such heat waves and related health and death toll, the microclimate needs to be made more livable and thermally comfortable by using traditional techniques, principles of climatic design and other extreme heat adaptation measures. This applies to both buildings as well as external living spaces and is critical to the more vulnerable lower income groups who do not have the capacity to go out and buy air conditioners and coolers,” she emphasised.

Mathews suggested that tree-lined streets and public parks, rainwater harvesting, water holding ponds, and public drinking water points are some of the measures that need to be adopted in external living spaces.

“Buildings should be oriented in ways that living spaces receive the least amount of heat loads from solar radiation avoiding west and southwest directions where non-habitable rooms such as staircases, storerooms etc. could be placed. Further, building envelopes need to be better designed to ensure mutual shading, buffer verandas, extended shading of openings among other techniques, many of which are forgotten traditional practices,” she added.

77,77,FL-2019-000079-BGD,China should lead on air pollution - The ASEAN Post,https://theaseanpost.com/article/china-should-lead-air-pollution,"The United Nations (UN) expects 68 percent of the world’s population to live in urban areas by 2050. As governments scramble to manage this flood of urban migration, they must address not only basic needs such as housing and employment but also issues impacting liveability and public health – including air pollution.

Nowhere is this challenge more urgent than in Asia. In recent months, cities like Bangkok, Seoul, Kathmandu, and Dhaka have faced major pollution events. But even at their usual levels, 99 percent of cities in south Asia and 89 percent in east Asia exceed World Health Organization (WHO) exposure guidelines. In 2018, Asia was home to all of the world’s 30 most polluted cities: 22 in India, five in China, two in Pakistan, and one in Bangladesh.

According to the WHO, polluted air is responsible for seven million premature deaths each year, roughly one-third of which occur in the Asia-Pacific region. In China alone, air pollution causes over one million premature deaths annually, according to a 2018 study conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

In less-developed areas of the region, severe indoor pollution caused by outdated heating and cooking systems poses a particularly severe threat. WHO data indicate that the highest number of deaths per capita from indoor pollution in the Asia-Pacific are in Lao, the Philippines, China, and Cambodia.

But polluted air is only one by-product of industrialisation. Pollution, absorbed into soil and groundwater, and eventually pumped through household taps, is seeping into the food chain. Rising levels of industrial discharge and agricultural runoff, together with over-exploitation of already-depleted aquifers, are especially alarming in water-stressed regions like northern China.

Urbanisation cannot be stopped, but this does not excuse governments for failing to address air pollution. With considerable resources and capacity for nationwide policy coordination, China should be leading the way in developing a sustainable approach to urbanisation that can serve as a regional and even global example.

China has already shown initiative on pollution reduction which President Xi Jinping has declared one of his signature policy priorities. The authorities regulate car ownership and have earned global praise for electrification of urban bus systems. After a multiyear campaign to reduce the coal industry’s emissions, China recently imposed stricter emissions targets on the steel industry. In May 2019, the government deployed almost 1,000 inspectors to 25 cities, targeting rules violations on issues such as water quality and waste management.

Despite evident progress, however, serious challenges persist. Last year, 33 of 39 northern Chinese cities prone to smog missed their government-imposed pollution-abatement targets for the winter. Measurements of PM2.5 (particulate matter) in those cities rose by 13 percent, on average, over a five-month period beginning in late 2018. Tackling China’s persistent pollution problem will require stronger action on three fronts: policy, innovation, and awareness.

From a policy perspective, China has a significant advantage: its central government can quickly enact and enforce policies and regulations. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) is reportedly leveraging that advantage to pursue a range of actions such as restricting imports of high-polluting vehicles, encouraging supply-chain restructuring based on lower-emission modes of transport, and boosting pollution-monitoring capacity through satellite technology.

But implementing such policies poses challenges and raises the risk of unintended consequences. For example, while relocating high-polluting industrial facilities has helped to reduce pollution in major urban centres, it has increased pollution in new host locations. More fundamentally, most policies support only pollution abatement, without confronting the urgent need for structural transformation in energy systems and demand patterns.

Such transformation requires decisive action from business. Yet, according to the MEE, schemes to hide regulatory infractions by high-polluting firms are endemic in China and often entail collusion with local governments. By adding environmental protection to the list of factors considered in promoting local and provincial leadership – a worthwhile initiative – China’s government may have inadvertently strengthened the incentive to evade monitoring systems.

Beyond establishing the right policies, China’s government needs to enforce them more effectively. Among other things, this means closer monitoring of regulatory compliance and ensuring prosecution of violations. This will be costly and politically challenging, but anything less amounts to prioritising profits over human health.

Innovation can also drive pollution abatement. For example, Shenzhen’s urban air mobility (UAM) project, which provides on-demand helicopter transport, leverages the city’s well-known innovative capacities while addressing congestion. Initiatives that advance pollution abatement goals while providing fair access to services among residents should be subsidised by central government.

Awareness is the third pillar of a strategy to tackle air pollution. This does not necessarily mean inundating people with news stories about global environmental devastation; on the contrary, that approach can lead to desensitisation. Instead, awareness means ensuring that people understand the consequences of air pollution for their health and that of their families. Armed with a new awareness of the risks they face; people can take advantage of online resources like the World Air Quality Index and the State of Global Air to monitor conditions in their cities.

According to the WHO, a staggering 91 percent of the world’s population is exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. With traditional global powers like the United States (US) and Australia now largely scoffing at environmental concerns, alternative global leadership is badly needed. If China aims to fill this role, it must not only mobilise its formidable resources and innovative capacity but also strengthen its commitment to enforcing the rule of law.

78,78,FL-2019-000079-BGD,"Senator Calls for Facebook, YouTube, Twitter to Lose Immunity If Politically Biased - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/20/529926.htm,"Technology platforms such as Facebook Inc. and Google’s YouTube could face a flood of lawsuits unless they can demonstrate their treatment of users’ content is politically neutral, under a measure that U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s office said he would offer Wednesday.

The proposal by the Missouri Republican reflects allegations by others in his party, including President Donald Trump, that the platforms are biased against conservative opinion. His bill would strip large tech companies of legal immunity for user-generated content unless the platforms can show their content-moderation practices have no political tilt.

“This legislation simply states that if the tech giants want to keep their government-granted immunity, they must bring transparency and accountability to their editorial processes and prove that they don’t discriminate,” Hawley said in a news release.

The tech companies treasure the immunity exemption, part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, because it saves them from reviewing every piece of content before it goes online and then shields them from lawsuits if content turns out to be problematic. The exemption also allows online companies to remove content that may be covered by the First Amendment’s free-speech protection but that may also promote extreme views or violence.

Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Twitter Inc. have said charges of bias are unsupported. When conservatives have been kicked off platforms, the companies have said, it was often for violating rules against hate speech and harassment.

“This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism,” said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, which represents Google, Facebook and Twitter. “That shouldn’t be a tradeoff.”

Lawmakers in both parties have grown increasingly frustrated by the way social media spreads misinformation or hate-filled posts and videos. In a June 13 House Intelligence Committee hearing, for example, Democratic and Republican representatives discussed limiting the liability shield before the 2020 election, but there was no consensus over whether and how to do that.

Congress already moved in 2018 to curtail the immunity protection for online content involving sex trafficking.

“Everyone agrees a federal speech policy would be a terrible idea,” Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said during a Monday conference on free speech at the Washington Post. He nonetheless floated changes to the exemption to deal with what he conceded were anecdotal charges of bias against conservative opinions.

“If they’re going to be partisan gatekeepers, there’s no reason that the big tech media companies should have a special immunity from liability” that no one else has, Cruz said.

Large Sites

The Hawley measure would apply to sites that have more than 30 million monthly active users in the U.S., 50 million monthly active users worldwide or $500 million in global annual revenue.

Under the bill, the companies every two years would have to convince the Federal Trade Commission “by clear and convincing evidence” that they do not “negatively affect a political party, political candidate, or political viewpoint” in their treatment of messages, shared news stories, videos and other content. The companies would also have to convince four of the five commissioners.

Hawley, first elected to the Senate last November, has quickly become one of the tech industry’s biggest antagonists on Capitol Hill. He has proposed bills that would stop websites from collecting unnecessary data and broaden a childrens’ online privacy law. He has also called for the FTC to impose “sweeping changes” on Facebook.

The bill, which Hawley’s office said has no cosponsors, faces an uphill battle in a gridlocked Congress that hasn’t yet unified on an approach to the issue.

79,79,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Bhutan throws up pay wall amid surge of Indian tourists - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bhutan-throws-up-pay-wall-amid-surge-of-indian-tourists/article27951192.ece,"Flood of ‘unregulated’ tourists has prompted measures from pristine Himalayan destination

For centuries, parents of newborn children in the Thimphu valley have visited the Changangkha Lhakhang (temple) that rises above the Bhutanese capital, bringing their babies as young as four or five days old to be blessed by its deity.

But a surge of tourist inflows into Bhutan this year has left parents and pilgrims jostling for space in the temple’s small inner sanctum.

The crowds have sparked a major debate across the country that could mean tougher regulations for tourists from the region, especially India.

“It was suffocating for the mothers who were trying to get blessings for their children,” explains a guard outside the temple, “They could barely say their prayers and they were very upset,” he added.

On June 7, the Tourism Council announced it was shutting the temple to all tourists for the three months, or peak season. The notice, printed on a board outside the temple, says the closure was in the “interest of the safety of the tourists”, and was done so as to allow “important religious events” to be conducted inside.

Entrance fees

When the doors of Changangkha Lhakhang re-open to tourists, they will be charged 300 Ngultrums (₹300) as entrance fees, the government has decided.

Other monasteries and temples in the country, known for its deep Buddhist religiosity, are quickly following suit.

The measures are part of an entire list being compiled by the Tourism Council of Bhutan (TCB) in response to the large numbers of “unregulated” tourists now making a beeline for the Himalayan Kingdom, once called the “Last Shangri-La” for its remoteness and pristine environment.

For decades, Bhutan’s government promoted an exclusive brand of “high value, low volume/ impact” tourism, that brought in only a few tourists willing to pay well for luxury hotel brands, rather than ‘backpackers’ and tourists looking for a cheap holiday.

Bhutan charges a $250 (₹17,500) mandatory cover-charge per day for all tourists except those from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives. Indians, especially those driving in directly from West Bengal through the border town of Phuentsholing, don’t need visas to Bhutan and account for most of the “unregulated” tourists. In 2017, these tourists made up more than 2,00,000 of the approximately 2,70,000 tourist arrivals, a surge that the government says the country is unprepared for.

“Indian visitors are very welcome in Bhutan, but if our infrastructure is not able to cater to them, or if our tourism industry is unable to entertain the guests well, then that is not good for them either. We wouldn’t want such a situation to impinge upon the Indo-Bhutan relationship,” Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering told The Hindu.

“The increasing numbers of tourist arrivals are to our advantage economically, but our biggest worry is that there should be no friction between our visitors and our Bhutanese people,” Dr. Tshering said during an interview at his office in Thimphu.

Making the crisis more acute is the fact that more than a 100 new hotels that cater to budget tourists are coming up in the main tourist towns of Paro, Thimphu and Bumthang, and most are being built with loans from banks that won’t be repaid unless the number of tourists steadily increases.

According to Garab Dorji, the Chairman of the Guides Association of Bhutan, a tour guide himself, this is leading to many hotels undercutting each other in a bid to raise occupancy levels, dropping rates to as low as ₹1,000 a night.

Officials say the hotel construction boom could also cause a housing crunch for residents and add to water shortages.

“The tourists they attract unfortunately, are not interested in preserving Bhutan’s culture or environment,” says Mr. Dorji, who describes arguments with tourists who refuse to follow Bhutan’s strict dress code in Dzongs (forts) and Lakhangs, play loud music, and leave litter in public areas.

According to Mr. Dorji and other tourism industry insiders, the problems with the regional tourists are now driving away the dollar-paying high-end European, Japanese and even Indian tourist groups, who seek a less crowded experience.

“I know at least one very famous international travel agency that has announced it will not bring tours to Bhutan after 2020 because of the mass tourism,” he said.

As a result, the government is looking at a series of measures to balance the increasing numbers of tourists with regulations to control their behaviour.

Tourists from India (and Bangladesh and the Maldives) could be asked to pay a “Sustainable Development Fee” of ₹500 on arrival, more tourists sites will charge entrance fees, while the Tourism Council of Bhutan, that has so far only regulated three-star hotels and above, make get oversight of all hotels in the country.

Contrary to many other countries seeking to attract more and more tourists, the TCB is also scaling down its targets from a plan for 5,00,000 tourists in 2023, to less than 4,00,000, reported local paper The Bhutanese, as part of efforts to tackle Bhutan’s problem of plenty.","Sat, 15 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/14f87p/article27951191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16BHUTAN,"['indian', 'tourism', 'unregulated', 'measures', 'wall', 'pay', 'bhutans', 'tourists', 'throws', 'surge', 'bhutan', 'temple', 'hotels', 'numbers', 'amid', 'tourist']",

While the term allows an ownership of environmentalism by China, thus suggesting that it is not just a “Western agenda” as many in developing countries put it, as a state-led enterprise it has the unfortunate capacity of allowing the state to ignore people in pursuit of environmental goals, promoting yet another form of “development from above” that sets locals in conflict with the state over lands where they live. – eds

Love Story in Swan City is set against the backdrop of Sanmenxia dam, the first concrete hydropower project to be built on the Yellow River, in the late 1950s. First broadcast on China Central Television in 2013, it brought attention to the dam and its reservoir, named after the nearby city of Sanmenxia in Henan province.

When Suyun, a female journalist from Beijing, encounters local farmers hunting swans she tries to stop them. The farmers ignore Suyun’s demands and argue they are only trying to sustain themselves. Siyuan, the male protagonist who has signed up to contribute to the dam’s construction, intervenes. He tells the farmers that the swans originally came from Siberia and so killing them would undermine the Sino-Soviet friendship. Intimidated by this accusation, the farmers quietly leave.

Neither the political rhetoric nor the love story resonated deeply with me. Instead, I found it hard to corroborate the massive presence of swans in Sanmenxia back in the 1950s. I soon discovered that the film’s main sponsor was the Sanmenxia municipal government. It was not so much an historical drama centred around the construction of the dam as a tourism ad. The government was trying to promote the presence of swans in the area.

The human element

In 1955, the People’s Republic of China commenced construction of Sanmenxia dam, with assistance from the Soviet Union. While thousands of workers, engineers and government officials migrated to Sanmenxia, more than 200,000 people living in the reservoir area were displaced across Henan, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces.

Yet as the Yellow River carries vast amounts of silt on its journey to its delta, siltation problems in the reservoir meant the dam had to be remodelled multiple times. The reservoir never reached its intended water level. Large areas of farmland cleared for inundation in the 1950s remained above water. So many displaced Henan farmers fled their state-designated resettlement sites and returned to the farmland they had lost.

It was not until 1973, after years of experimentation, that the Sanmenxia engineers finally found a sustainable way to operate the reservoir. They retained water in the dry season and kept the water gates wide open in the flood season. When the water in the reservoir receded in late spring and early summer local farmers rushed to reclaim the fertile lands to supplement their household incomes.

In 1995, 40 years after the start of the Sanmenxia project and with growing awareness around environmental protection in China, the Chinese government established the Sanmenxia Natural Wetland Reserve to conserve the ecology of the Yellow River. But as with many of the fledging nature reserves in China in the 1990s, lack of funding and the negligence of local officials meant the local government did not put effective conservation measures into practice. So local farmers continued to farm and fish, following the ebb and flow of the reservoir.





Constrictive conservation

In 2002, the construction of a new dam on the Yellow River, the Xiaolangdi dam, also in Henan, began aggravating the degradation of the wetland in the delta. Compounding the problem, rapid urbanisation and growing water demand has dramatically shrunk surface water in north China. Engineers have nonetheless been able to maintain water levels in the Sanmenxia reservoir. While just 100 whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) migrated from Siberia to the Sanmenxia reservoir for winter in the 1990s, the number has grown steadily to almost 10,000 today. The mass arrival of birds has inspired local officials to develop swan-based tourism.

The local government started to see farmers’ economic activities in the reserve as a threat to the swans’ winter habitat. In 2013, it implemented new regulations to prohibit hunting, fishing, land reclamation and other economic activities from October until March, when the whooper swans come from the to the lake for winter. Local people were still allowed to engage in productive activities from April to September, so that farmers could cultivate crops with a short growing cycle. But the harvests were not guaranteed because the dam authorities could start impounding water in the reservoir whenever heavy rainfall put the lower reaches of the Yellow River at risk of flooding.

In recent years, however, the Sanmenxia government has expanded the economic restrictions to cover the whole year, cracking down on any “illegal” activities in the reserve, especially boat restaurants, fishing and farming.

Locals lose out

The establishment of the nature reserve and the promulgation of wetland protection laws have in effect criminalised hunting and other activities practised by local residents. Local farmers feel they have suffered a double loss. The government deprived them of their farmland along the Yellow River in the 1950s and gave them inadequate compensation. In the decades since, they have struggled to feed themselves and their families. Losing access to their lost farmland when water recedes is another blow to their economic subsistence.

From the perspective of resettled residents, prohibiting any productive activities in the supposedly “natural” wetland reserve created by the Sanmenxia dam and reservoir is unjustified. Unfortunately for them, the dominant official narrative of “natural preservation” ignores the contribution humans have made to the creation of the wetlands.

Around the globe, environmentalists criticise large concrete dams because of the ecological destruction they cause rivers. Surprisingly, the massive Sanmenxia dam has created an ideal winter habitat for thousands of whooper swans and other migrating birds from the north. Meanwhile, those birds serve as an ecological and monetary windfall for the Sanmenxia government.

In recent years, thanks to the local government’s propaganda efforts, Sanmenxia city has successfully shifted its public image from “the Pearl on the Yellow River,” a metaphor for the Sanmenxia dam, to “Swan City,” a nickname designed to reflect its harmonious relationship with nature. Local urban residents are proud that their hometown has become a winter haven for beautiful birds and tourists who come to see them.

There is no doubt that those precious birds deserve our protection but to build a sustainable relationship between the swans and local communities, we ought to recognise the sacrifice local farmers have made. This is a prerequisite for making more justified environmental policy in the future.

In that context, ""RCEP is key to increasing trade volume"", Thai government spokesman Werachon Sukhondhapatipak told reporters.

""The faster it (RCEP) gets implemented the better,"" Martin M. Andanar, Philippines Communications Secretary, told reporters.

""Free trade is definitely what we need here in this region,"" he said, adding that the US-China trade row has resulted in ""the entire world catching a cold"".

Progress on the deal has stuttered in recent months with India digging in over fears cheap Chinese goods could flood its massive consumer market.

Australia and New Zealand have also raised concerns over a lack of labour and environmental safeguards.

Rohingya talks

ASEAN is frequently criticised as a soft forum where diplomatic niceties often outweigh concrete action on pressing problems.

Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad on Friday raised the prospect of a joust with Myanmar over the Rohingya, the Muslim minority driven in massive numbers into Bangladesh by waves of concussive violence.

""We hope something can be done to stop the oppression,"" he said.

Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi is in Bangkok for the weekend meeting.

ASEAN foreign ministers discussed the repatriation of more than 740,000 Rohingya refugees that have fled into Bangladesh, according to Thai foreign minister Don Pramudwinai.

The bloc has come under fire for suggesting the refugees should go back to Myanmar within two years, according to a leaked report seen by AFP -- though virtually none have volunteered to go back so far, citing safety concerns.

""It (repatriation) will be quick, Myanmar knows this process is being watched by everyone,"" Don told reporters.

The bloc is also poised to agree on a declaration to ""prevent and significantly reduce"" marine debris -- including plastic -- across the region, according to a draft text seen by AFP.

Though the statement is the first of its kind for the region, which dumps millions of tonnes of plastic waste into the ocean every year, activists fear it doesn't go far enough in curbing single-plastic use.

Regional leaders are also set to tackle thorny South China Sea issues at the weekend meet, with a draft Code of Conduct agreement up for review, though observers doubt any major progress will me made to inch the deal closer to completion.

Discussions around the resource-rich waterway that Beijing claims most of were overshadowed by a recent dust-up in the sea between a Chinese ship that rammed a Filipino fishing boat and caused it to sink.

Manila said a joint investigation into the incident has been launched, adding that the run-in would not derail Code of Conduct talks.","Sat, 22 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/06/22/99572-untitled-design-3.jpg,"['asian', 'trade', 'south', 'throw', 'deal', 'told', 'pact', 'leaders', 'southeast', 'asean', 'sea', 'chinaled', 'seen', 'worlds', 'weight', 'china', 'rohingya']",

84,84,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Monsoonal control on a delayed response of sedimentation to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaav7110,"Abstract Infrequent extreme events such as large earthquakes pose hazards and have lasting impacts on landscapes and biogeochemical cycles. Sediments provide valuable records of past events, but unambiguously identifying event deposits is challenging because of nonlinear sediment transport processes and poor age control. Here, we have been able to directly track the propagation of a tectonic signal into stratigraphy using reservoir sediments from before and after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Cycles in magnetic susceptibility allow us to define a precise annual chronology and identify the timing and nature of the earthquake’s sedimentary record. The grain size and Rb/Sr ratio of the sediments responded immediately to the earthquake. However, the changes were muted until 2 years after the event, when intense monsoonal runoff drove accumulation of coarser grains and lower Rb/Sr sediments. The delayed response provides insight into how climatic and tectonic agents interact to control sediment transfer and depositional processes.

INTRODUCTION Sedimentary archives contain valuable information about past climatic, tectonic, and human activities (1–6). Abrupt changes in sediment type, volume, and structure, as well as physical, paleontological, geochemical, and mineralogical records, have been used to identify extreme events in the past and to assess how often they occur (3–11). Sediment pulses that result from earthquake-triggered landslides have been used to reconstruct past events from lake deposits (12, 13), helping to constrain predictive tectonic models and evaluate the long-term effects of large earthquakes (14–16). However, inferences from sedimentary records are often based on the coincidence of sedimentary changes with indications (e.g., biological or geochemical) of an extreme event. The infrequency of these events means that direct observations are scarce, and the challenges in developing a precise sedimentary chronology at an annual time scale typically preclude direct age assignments for specific event layers (6, 10, 11, 14). These obstacles have inhibited full understanding of the depositional processes associated with sediment inputs triggered by extreme events and, particularly, how the event record might be modulated by climate. These interactions as manifest following individual events are also important for understanding the roles of climate and tectonics in controlling erosion, sediment transfer, and landscape evolution (1, 17–19). A unique opportunity to document the link between a large earthquake and its sedimentary signature is provided by continuously deposited and annually resolved sediments from the Zipingpu reservoir in Sichuan Province, China. The reservoir, behind a 156-m-high dam completed in September 2004, is fed by the Min Jiang River (with a drainage area of 22,664 km2) and is located downstream of the area affected by the 2008 moment magnitude (M w ) 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake (Fig. 1). This devastating earthquake occurred along the steep Longmen Shan mountain front at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and triggered more than 56,000 landslides in a region with limited landslide activity before the earthquake (20, 21). The total volume of earthquake-triggered landslides was estimated at ~2.8 km3 (21), with a mass (~7.4 Gt) up to four to seven times the total annual sediment export from the Himalayas (1 to 2 Gt) (22), using a density of landslide material of 2.65 g/cm3. The co- and postseismic landslides associated with the Wenchuan earthquake caused substantial changes to the rates of erosion and fluvial sediment transfer (23–25), as well as to geochemical fluxes (26) from the Longmen Shan. The Zipingpu reservoir is ideally located to record the delivery of earthquake-triggered landslide material and document the propagation of the signal from a major earthquake into a sedimentary archive.

Zipingpu reservoir core In October 2016, a 10.89-m-long sediment core was retrieved from the central area of the Zipingpu reservoir with 100% recovery. The core reached the prereservoir riverbed, characterized by brown coarse sands and gravels. The reservoir sediments mainly consist of horizontally laminated grayish brown silt and clay. The cores were scanned for both magnetic susceptibility (MS) and elemental intensity using an Avaatech x-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner. Grain size and magnetic mineralogy were measured on sediment samples using a Malvern 2000 particle size analyzer and an MFK1-FA Kappabridge and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively (see Materials and Methods). We interpret the results from the analysis of this core in the context of extensive hydrometeorological data for the region and particularly the well-characterized discharge record of the Min Jiang River. The climate of the region is dominated by the Asian and Indian summer monsoons (23), with 82% of annual precipitation occurring from May to October (392 to 1968 mm/year from 2006 to 2016 based on data from six meteorological stations). The annual water discharge of the Min Jiang River (recorded at the Weizhou hydrological station, ~55 km upstream of the reservoir; Fig. 1) averaged 9.47 × 109 m3/year from 2006 to 2016, with notable interannual variability.

RESULTS High-resolution chronology from cycles in MS Cycles in MS are distinct in the Zipingpu core (Fig. 2). Magnetic minerals throughout the core are dominated by magnetite and hematite, whose concentrations determine MS variation (figs. S1 and S2). At the time of the coring (October 2016), MS of the surface sediments was relatively low, corresponding to a high water level (an elevation of ~870 m above sea level) in the reservoir at that time. We attribute low MS values (i.e., low concentrations of magnetic minerals) to an increased distance at high water levels between the coring site and the location of sediment input to the reservoir at the river mouth, compared with that at low water levels (fig. S3). This distance would reduce the accumulation rate of dense magnetic minerals (relative to less dense silicate and carbonate phases) at the coring site at times of high water levels in the reservoir and vice versa. Supporting our interpretation of transport distance as a control on MS, we observe systematically higher MS of surface sediments in the reservoir close to the river mouth compared to the coring site further downstream (fig. S4). Fig. 2 Chronology of the Zipingpu reservoir sediment core based on the correlation between reservoir water level and sedimentary MS. The red line marks the boundary of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (EQ) in the core; two blue arrows show the dates of river interception (23 November 2002) and water impoundment in the reservoir (30 September 2004). The blue-shaded bars indicate annual high water levels (note inverted scale) that are associated with low MS values. Large variation in MS observed before reservoir impoundment is likely due to water discharge (Q w ) changes determining the transport and deposition of heavy magnetic minerals. The role of Q w appears to have become highly muted from 2005 onward, with MS instead controlled by reservoir water level. We use this as the basis for our chronology while acknowledging that Q w may still have had minor effects, for example, influencing secondary features in the MS record and potentially introducing some uncertainties especially at seasonal time scales. Each year, there are two high water level intervals in the reservoir, resulting from flow regulation at the dam. These high levels consistently correspond to the accumulation of low-MS sediments at the coring site (Fig. 2). On the basis of this inference, we developed an age model for the upper 8.70 m of the core based on the correlation between MS and reservoir water level (Fig. 2). This age model, invoking two peaks in MS each year, exactly retrieves the timing of reservoir impoundment in September 2004. The boundary associated with the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake is then assigned to the core depth of 6.20 m, which corresponds to an abrupt change in the color of the sediments (Fig. 2). Because the reservoir water level is regulated artificially, the adopted age model is independent of the earthquake timing and of variations in water discharge (Q w ). The sedimentary signature of the Wenchuan earthquake Because the distinct cycles of MS and the high sedimentation rate (~74 cm/year) in the core allow precise and independent assignment of the earthquake timing within the sediment, we can directly document the depositional signature of the earthquake. Grain size of fluvially derived sediments is a sensitive indicator of changes in sediment transfer processes (3, 12, 27–30). The median grain size (D 50 ) in the Zipingpu core was relatively low before the earthquake (D 50 = 9.2 ± 0.6 μm, January 2006 to May 2008), although Q w was moderately high in 2006 and 2007 (Fig. 3). Grain size shows an immediate change following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, with D 50 coarsening from 9.2 to 11.4 μm (fig. S5). It is known that earthquake-triggered landslides mobilized regolith, loosed surficial material, and bedrock (31, 32), supplying coarser material to river channels (16, 33) where it was subsequently transported downstream (23, 34, 35). We thus attribute the increase in grain size at the earthquake boundary in the Zipingpu core to the delivery of this landslide material by the Min Jiang River. We also observe a drop in sedimentary Rb/Sr ratios, which likely results from a relative increase in Sr inputs (fig. S6) from fresh minerals (i.e., carbonates) by bedrock landslides (26). This immediate response is consistent with observations of changes in active fluvial sediment transport following coseismic landsliding (23, 34–36), here documented in the sediments deposited downstream. Grain size and elemental ratios do not show cycles linked to MS, indicating that the management of water level does not affect these sedimentary characteristics in the reservoir. Fig. 3 Core sedimentary data from the Zipingpu reservoir and water discharge (Q w ) in the Min Jiang River before and after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Daily mean river Q w (blue), median grain size D 50 (black), and Rb/Sr ratios (green). Red line marks the time of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake based on independent chronology (Fig. 2). Q w data are from the main stem of the Min Jiang at the Weizhou hydrological station (Fig. 1) that accounts for more than 70% of the discharge flux to the Zipingpu reservoir. Both Rb/Sr ratio and D 50 show remarkable changes after the earthquake, with the most pronounced shifts in 2010 associated with very high Q w . A slight offset in the timing of changes in sediment properties in 2010 appears to precede the rise in Q w , potentially because of uncertainties in the chronology related to seasonally varying sedimentation rates; the chronology defined by linear interpolation between the low-MS tie points is likely to introduce some uncertainties within a year (Fig. 2) and thus accurately captures the timing of changes at the annual but not at the seasonal scales. CPS, counts per second. Delayed response of the sedimentary signal from the earthquake Although we see a distinct sedimentary signal immediately after the Wenchuan earthquake, the most pronounced response in both grain size and Rb/Sr ratio appeared in 2010, 2 years after the earthquake (Fig. 3). In 2010, the D 50 sharply increased to a maximum of 24.2 μm, while Rb/Sr ratios dropped to their lowest values in the entire core of ~0.35. This delayed response likely reflects the discharge dynamics of the Min Jiang River; 2008 and 2009 had relatively lower peak Q w and thus lower fluvial transport capacity than other years (Fig. 3), inhibiting the transfer of earthquake-triggered landslide sediment to the reservoir. The peak Q w in 2010 was much higher, with intense rainstorms that caused extensive debris flows (37), flooded Yingxiu town upstream of the reservoir, and resulted in >8000 resident evacuations (32). Both grain size and Rb/Sr ratios remained peaks but variable during 2010 and 2011. The delay of the sedimentary response in the reservoir highlights the importance of hydrological controls on sediment evacuation and downstream delivery following an earthquake, consistent with studies of suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes in rivers draining earthquake-affected regions (23, 34, 35). Notably, annual reservoir sediment thickness has a statistically significant correlation (r2 = 0.62) with total annual Q w (Fig. 4A), further supporting the control of monsoonal precipitation on sediment transfer in this setting. The sedimentation rate at the core site did not change systematically after the earthquake, despite changes in total fluvial sediment fluxes (fig. S7). These observations suggest that sedimentation rate at the core site, which is located at a relatively distal position within the reservoir, has been largely controlled by hydrodynamic conditions rather than upstream sediment supply. Observed changes in grain size and Rb/Sr provenance signatures, but not in sedimentation rate, suggest that sediment grain size and geochemistry may better record events than sediment thickness, at least for conditions similar to the core site studied here. Fig. 4 Sedimentological versus hydrological parameters before and after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Relationships between (A) annual water discharge and annual depositional thickness and (B) the proportion of total runoff of >3 mm/day and the percentage of coarse grains (>32 μm). Black lines show the best-fit relationship from linear least-squares regression, and the yellow-shaded regions show 95% confidence intervals, excluding the data from 2012 in (A). The outlier from 2012 may result from high Q w dominated by heavy rainfall in the upstream portions of the Min Jiang River catchment with limited earthquake-triggered landslides (fig. S9). In (B), the relationship may reflect a shift from a supply-limited regime (gray-shaded region) to a transport-limited regime (yellow-shaded region) after the Wenchuan earthquake. The relationship between intense runoff in the Min Jiang River and the fraction of coarse grains (>32 μm) in the reservoir sediment was altered by the earthquake (Fig. 4B). The coarse grain fraction increased with intense runoff (r2 = 0.71) after the earthquake and was consistently higher than limited measurements made before the earthquake (Fig. 4B). This shift in particle size following the earthquake may indicate a change in sediment transfer regime for the >32-μm grains in the Min Jiang River, from “supply-limited” to “transport-limited” regimes (Fig. 4B) (38). Under the transport-limited regime, low Q w in 2009 resulted in limited transfer of coarse grains, whereas in 2010, high Q w facilitated enhanced sediment transport. The peak in transport capacity in 2010, reflected in the coarse grains in the reservoir core, is further supported by an eightfold increase in sediment yield in a Min Jiang tributary near the earthquake epicenter during that year (fig. S7). After 2011, both grain size and Rb/Sr ratio returned gradually to pre-earthquake values over a time scale of ~5 to 6 years. However, much of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake-triggered landslide debris remains visible on hillslopes and in river channels 10 years later (fig. S8). If runoff intensity reaches or exceeds 2010 levels in the future (Fig. 3), then this may create an additional sedimentary response in the reservoir. Quantifying the precise record that is left by time-varying runoff would provide important information for understanding longer-term sedimentary signatures at this location and other tectonically active mountain ranges, such as those observed in the several packages of coarser sediments that have accumulated over decades following earthquake events in New Zealand lake records (12).

DISCUSSION Field data and modeling studies have revealed how sedimentation is regulated by climatic (1, 2, 18, 28) and tectonic forcings (5, 6, 12, 30, 39), but the interplay of these factors in creating the sedimentary signatures of an earthquake is typically difficult to observe and quantify directly (11, 12). Our well-dated sediment core with very high sedimentation rates, together with independent hydrometeorological data, enables us to identify the role of hydroclimatic forcing in the creation of a seismic record. The combination of these data in the observational record allows us to decode detailed annual depositional processes associated with a single large earthquake event and, crucially, to assess the role of climate in sediment accumulation under postseismic conditions. Our results also provide modern context for other studies of event deposits, which typically lack the annual chronologic resolution (6, 10–12, 14) needed to resolve the dynamics and evolution of a single event. The Zipingpu core shows that the sedimentary signal of widespread inputs of landslide debris after an earthquake is likely regulated by runoff associated with the monsoonal climate. Even when a major earthquake has greatly perturbed the system and provided large amounts of landslide material to rivers (21, 31, 34, 35), the downstream signal recorded even in fairly proximal sedimentary deposits (such as the mountain-front reservoir studied here) may be muted if fluvial transport capacity is insufficient. This interplay of tectonic and climatic factors may have particular relevance for interpretation and correlation of event deposits between different locations (6, 10–14, 18, 19). For example, a major earthquake followed by a multiyear period of aridity and low fluvial transport capacity may be difficult to identify in sedimentary deposits and any record will be somewhat lagged, while an earthquake followed by intense rainfall in following years such as after the 1999 M w 7.9 Chi-Chi earthquake (34, 35) could leave a more distinct and immediate signature. Our results also show how the hydroclimatic control on sediment transport following an earthquake could generate the appearance of multiple “peaks” in a sedimentary record; for example, the muted change in grain size at the time of the Wenchuan earthquake is followed by a much more prominent peak a few years later, driven by intense rainfall (Fig. 3). In a paleo-archive, these multiple peaks might be mistakenly interpreted as reflecting two different earthquakes (such as a main shock/aftershock sequence or a sequence of earthquakes on adjacent fault segments), emphasizing the need to tease apart the hydroclimatic role in these records for robust interpretation. Although hydrological filtering of an earthquake event is likely to affect sedimentary records (16, 19, 28, 29), it is notable that the seismic signal of the Wenchuan earthquake is propagated quickly and clearly in the sediment grain size and bulk elemental chemistry when evaluated in terms of the typical precision of available geochronological tools (Fig. 3). Efficient transfer of the earthquake signal into reservoir sediments is emphasized by the similar trends shown by suspended sediment yields in the Min Jiang (fig. S7) and the grain-size and geochemical records in the reservoir (Fig. 3). The identifiable fingerprint of the Wenchuan earthquake in fairly proximal mountain-front reservoir sediments shows that fine-grained sedimentary deposits are less susceptible to environmental signal shredding by the nonlinear filters imposed by sediment transport, when compared to rates of bed load transport (16, 19, 28, 29, 40), which supports views from lacustrine records of landscape responses to large earthquakes (12). The hydrological imprint of a large earthquake on the sedimentary record may also provide information on the sediment-related hazards that can persist for many years after the event, controlled largely by hydroclimatic conditions. Extensive storm-triggered debris flows and landslides had devastating effects in the years following the Wenchuan earthquake, particularly in 2010 (32, 37), and we find that their signature is (perhaps expectedly) recorded in the Zipingpu reservoir. If a characteristic fingerprint of these postseismic sediment pulses could be constrained from sedimentary archives, then this might shed new light on how long the associated hazards can persist (i.e., years, decades, or longer). Our unique, well-dated sediment core in a man-made reservoir provides greater understanding of how erosion and sedimentation processes respond to an extreme event. Our results emphasize the importance of the interplay between a major earthquake and the prevailing monsoonal climate, highlighting the central role of runoff as an erosional agent in removing earthquake-triggered landslide material and in creating a depositional signal of the earthquake. The high-resolution Zipingpu record provides rare direct evidence that can inform the interpretation of paleorecords and helps to illuminate the ways in which sedimentary archives reflect the complex interaction of tectonics and climate in controlling sediment transfer in tectonically active mountain ranges.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Zipingpu reservoir and sediment core drilling The Zipingpu reservoir is located at the Min Jiang River at the Longmen Shan mountain front, upstream of the Sichuan Basin (Fig. 1), with a water depth of 110 m at the highest water level and 57 m at the lowest water level in 2016. The entrance of the reservoir at the highest water level is ~2 km downstream from the epicenter of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (fig. S3). The reservoir forms an elongated “L” shape, with a maximum length of ~19 km and a width of ~2.1 km at its highest water level. The location of the reservoir means that it captures a significant portion of the landslide material associated with the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. According to the records from the Zipingpu Reservoir Company, the Min Jiang River channel was intercepted on 23 November 2002 when dam construction began. The reservoir started to impound water with a maximum water depth of 23 m (an elevation of 775 m) on 30 September 2004, and operations fully began 1 year later, when water level increased abruptly to an elevation of 821 m (a water depth of 69 m near the dam) (Fig. 2). The daily water level has been monitored by the Zipingpu Reservoir Company since 2004. With a view to dam safety and requirements for irrigation during dry seasons, the water level of the reservoir is regulated artificially. There are two periods with high water level each year: The first is during monsoonal rainy season (June and July), although the reservoir is discharged at this time to release the large volume of water received; and the second is during the dry season, when the highest level (an elevation of ~877 m) is achieved from late September to January to ensure adequate agricultural irrigation and drinking water for the following spring (Fig. 2). In middle October 2016, a 10.89-m-long sediment core ZPP-A (31°02′8.20″N, 103°33′48.20″E, 870 m above sea level) was retrieved using an Austrian UWITEC piston coring platform from the deepest part of the Zipingpu reservoir (Fig. 1) at a water depth of 102.9 m. The core achieved 100% recovery. This core was recovered to the depth of the old river bed where coarse sands and bedrock fragments were observed at the core bottom. The core sediments mainly consisted of horizontally laminated grayish brown silt and clay. The lower 2.19 m was characterized by silt and brown sand layers, with dispersed fine gravel at the bottom (1 to 4 cm in diameter). This interval was considered to have been rapidly deposited before water was impounded in the reservoir and was excluded from our discussion. In addition, a 60-cm-short core (ZPP-B; 31°1′6.30″N, 103°32′28.50″E) was retrieved using a gravity corer at the location of core B, 2.85 km upstream of the core A (Fig. 1 and fig. S3). Core sediment scanning and analyses After the cores were split lengthwise, the sediment stratigraphy was photographed and described. The cores were scanned lengthwise along the center of the split core surface using an Avaatech III XRF core scanner for intensities of both chemical elements and MS at the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems at Lanzhou University. The element scanning conditions at a resolution of 5 mm were as follows: settings of 30 kV and 2 mA with an x-ray tube, a step size of 5 mm, and an exposure time of 20 s for elements. The signal intensity of each element is expressed as counts per second. MS was scanned every 2 cm with an analytical precision of 0.1 SI using a Bartington Instruments MS2E magnetic susceptibility meter at a frequency of 2 kHz. Sixteen typical samples were chosen for magnetic mineralogy identification using an MFK1-FA Kappabridge and VSM at the Environmental Magnetism Laboratory in the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IEECAS) (figs. S1 and S2). For grain size analyses, a total of 648 samples were collected at 2-cm core intervals. The samples were pretreated by adding 10% H 2 O 2 and 10% HCl to remove organic matter, carbonate, and iron oxides and were dispersed with (NaPO 3 ) 6 in an ultrasonic bath before grain size measurement. The grain size distribution was measured by a Malvern 2000 laser diffraction instrument with 100 bins ranging from 0.02 to 2000 μm in the IEECAS. The analytical error of median grain size is better than ~2%, based on repeated measurements of samples.

Catholic bishops in Myanmar have jointly called for the complete shutdown of the China-backed Myitsone Dam.

In a statement released June 8, the bishops pleaded for all dam stakeholders “to review the Myitsone Dam project in Kachin State and stop it permanently” for the sake of the country’s people.

“[The] River Irrawaddy runs through the heart of our nation nourishing millions of our people, flora and fauna with water for livelihood and life,” the statement said. “To the people of Myanmar, the history of [the] River Irrawaddy is intertwined with our joys and our sorrows.”

The bishops said the resumption of the mega dam would further displace thousands of people.

“It is like inviting a human tragedy,” they said, adding that scientists have warned the building of the dam increases the risk of disasters and humanitarian tragedies.

“The promised economic benefits that are thought to come from the dam are no match for the social and ecological disturbances that will certainly come,” the bishops said.

Cardinal Charles Maung Bo of Yangon and 18 bishops from 16 dioceses signed the statement after a biannual meeting held in Yangon on June 4-7.

The US$3.8 billion project on the Irrawaddy, Myanmar's premier waterway, was being built to provide hydroelectricity that would be used almost exclusively in neighboring China.

The dam's construction resulted in some 3,000 people being relocated from their homes to newly built villages.

The military-backed government of then president Thein Sein suspended construction in September 2011, but China has vigorously called for work to resume on the project.

Bishop Raymond Sumlut Gam of Banmaw in Kachin State said the joint statement from the bishop’s “reflects the Church’s stance on the dam’s impact on both the environment and on the people.”

The Kachin bishop added that Myitkyina, Banmaw and Lashio dioceses of Myanmar have already discussed the dam’s effect regionally.

In April, Cardinal Bo sent letters calling for a permanent end to the dam to Myanmar’s President Win Myint, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and military chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.

Cardinal Bo also sent one, written in the Chinese language, to China’s President Xi Jinping.","Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2019/06/5cfe2bef806fd_600.png,"['myitsone', 'bishops', 'irrawaddy', 'state', 'kachin', 'project', 'president', 'statement', 'shutdown', 'dam', 'myanmar']", 
86,86,FL-2019-000079-BGD,Foreign insurers bring disruption in untapped Myanmar market - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Foreign-insurers-bring-disruption-in-untapped-Myanmar-market,"YANGON -- Myanmar's insurance market will soon face a sea change led by technologies and expertise brought in by foreign companies.

A total of 14 foreign insurers will enter the Southeast Asian country's market by the end of this year through either wholly owned subsidiaries or joint venture companies with local peers, the Nikkei Asian Review has learned.

A greater variety of insurance products is expected to appear as Myanmar's government plans to open its insurance market to foreign companies and ease regulations simultaneously, making it possible to use information obtained through the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence and satellites.

""I don't have any insurance. I have been living for 38 years without insurance and I don't think I need it,"" said Nyi Nyi, a 38-year-old man working at a company in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city. For many locals, it has been standard practice to cope with risks without insurance.

If they fall ill, they make do with painkillers and traditional medicines available at pharmacies. If they cause a traffic accident, they settle out of court by paying compensation within their ability to do so.

Myanmar has an estimated population of 54 million. The insurance penetration rate -- the ratio of premium income to gross domestic product -- is extremely low there, compared with its neighbors in Southeast Asia.

The rate in Myanmar stood at 0.24% in 2018 -- 0.19% for general insurance and 0.05% for life insurance -- much lower than 0.79% in Cambodia, whose per capita GDP is at the same level as Myanmar and which opened its insurance market to foreign competition earlier.

This is the biggest reason Myanmar's insurance market is considered promising. The foreign insurers could open the curtain on a new era.

In January, the Myanmar government launched the process to open up its market to foreign insurers. In April, five foreign life insurers, including AIA, Manulife and Prudential, were allowed to enter the market through wholly owned subsidiaries.

Anil Wadhwani, president and CEO of Manulife Asia, welcomed the government's decision to embrace foreign insurers in the market.

""The move to open up Myanmar's insurance market is a step in the right direction,"" he said, adding that it will be ""instrumental in spurring the country's ongoing development, boosting competition and driving greater insurance penetration.""

The government will also permit the establishment of joint ventures with local companies, limiting the foreign ownership to below 35%. The Nikkei Asian Review has confirmed that four foreign life insurers and five foreign general insurers have applied to the government to establish joint ventures with local companies.

The authorities are currently screening the applications and the results will be announced by the end of July, one applicant said. His application as well as other insurers' will be accepted by the end of July, unless something unexpected happens, he said.

Foreign insurers have waited for the market to open up for nearly five years. In 2013, the country lifted a ban on private insurers as part of economic reforms associated with the transition to civilian rule. A year later, the government allowed three Japanese insurers to do business in the Thilawa special economic zone, near Yangon, without local partners, hinting at a future full-scale opening of the market.

The entry of foreign insurers brings capital investment, new technology and operational know-how to Myanmar's insurance market. They are likely to include efficient delivery of insurance services to many customers, as well as innovative insurance products that apply data gathered through latest technologies.

""We will deploy digital tools and services on the front end, supported by automated processes and systems at the back end,"" Nic Nicandrou, chief executive of Prudential Corporation Asia, told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""We intend to embrace a digital-led, customer-centric strategy in Myanmar to broaden access to life insurance and provide a seamless end-to-end experience to customers.""

The British insurer has life insurance operations in 12 markets in Asia and holds the top three positions in eight of them, including Laos and Cambodia, where the company established its operations in 2016 and 2013. Similar to these emerging markets, Prudential ""will start off by offering simple-to-understand and affordable protection and savings products, targeting the masses,"" Nicandrou said. ""Technology is a key focus for us.""

As an example, Nicandrou revealed a plan to bring in AI technology to customers in the region. ""We will soon be launching our new all-in-one mobile application in Asia, beginning with Malaysia this year. It will be the first app of its kind to offer AI-powered health information to millions of people in the region including Myanmar, empowering them to take control of their health and well-being anytime, anywhere,"" he said.

Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance aims to sell to Myanmar farmers a product that covers income shortfalls due to droughts and floods, using satellite imagery to determine the extent of damage. The company has applied to the government for a license to establish a joint venture with AYA Myanmar Insurance, affiliated with Myanmar's second largest bank.

The weather index insurance product the Japanese company aims to introduce uses precipitation data based on imagery taken by remote sensing satellites, in determining insurance payments. By paying a low premium for the policy, farmers stand to receive insurance money if they are judged to have suffered from a drought or flood, so they could receive compensation for their income shortfalls. Satellite data will be prepared in a way that allows the insurers to set objective judgment criteria in a country like Myanmar, where ground-level precipitation data is not readily available.

In a joint effort with state-run Myanma Insurance and Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, Sompo Japan is currently running a pilot project to test the weather index insurance in two rural location of the country. Keiji Okada, chief representative of Sompo Japan's Yangon office, said the Myanmar government appears ready to allow insurance companies to use banks and microfinance providers as sales channels for the product.

""The use of insurance is going to spread to farmers and small businesses vulnerable to abnormal weather conditions,"" Okada said. ""Financial services will become more inclusive.""

Digital technology plays an important role in the joint endeavor, as ""it increases flexibility in terms of distribution channels,"" according to AYA Myanmar Managing Director Myo Min Thu.

""If the government allows us to distribute insurance through bank branches, microfinance institutions or mobile digital channels, it will be easier to distribute small-ticket size insurance to the masses at the lower end,"" Myo Min Thu said.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F1%252F2%252F7%252F21177215-1-eng-GB%252FIMG_3100%2520%25E3%2581%25AE%25E3%2582%25B3%25E3%2583%2594%25E3%2583%25BC.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['untapped', 'disruption', 'yangon', 'open', 'market', 'myanmars', 'insurers', 'foreign', 'insurance', 'joint', 'bring', 'end', 'myanmar']",

You dance the rain dance (visualise Aamir Khan). The skies get cloudy, but there is no rain. You are forced to play a cricket match over two days and the skies open up immediately after the match. The timing is perfect. The rains promise a good crop and because you won the match, you don’t have to pay the taxes. You thank the rain gods because the match wasn’t a wash out (remember the condition was Aamir Khan’s team had to win to get a tax exemption). You had asked for everything, you got it all. That’s not possible, is it?

Well, ICC CEO Dave Richardson asked for everything (except the rain) when at The Oval on May 27, he promised the world ‘the greatest celebration of cricket ever’ at the 2019 World Cup. Whatever else he may have got, he got rain anyway. Buckets of it. So much so that there is actually a flood alert in some parts of south and southeast England at the moment. And now, as things stand, it’s not Jofra Archer, not Jasprit Bumrah, not Buttler or Bairstow or Warner or Kohli, but dark clouds that loom over every match as the X-Factor.

To chase or not to chase

Keeping rain threats, curtailed overs and revised targets in mind, captains could be forced to field first, even though teams batting first have won eight (57.1%) of the 14 completed matches so far. Pakistan chose to field against Australia on Wednesday because there was a forecast of rain and fielding first helps a team keep pace with the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) sheet.

The rain stayed away. Pakistan went on to lose, mainly because they fielded poorly, but also because they handed over the advantage of batting first at Taunton, in the smallest ground used in this World Cup, to Australia. When the wicket is fresh the ball comes nicely onto the bat and scoring is easier; using those conditions, Australia put over 300 runs on the board.

All captains prefer batting second in rain-threatened matches, because the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method is easier to follow for the chasing team.

Even if there is a fair bit of scepticism around the DLS method (because the algorithm is kept a secret), at least before the start of a run chase both teams know what they need to do. The DLS sheet handed to the teams gives a par score for every ball, taking into consideration the first innings total and wickets in hand during the chase. But even then mistakes happen. South Africa skipper Shaun Pollock messed it up in the 2003 World Cup against Sri Lanka when he thought the DL par score was the target. South Africa celebrated when they got to that score, only to realise that the match had actually ended in a tie. Exit, South Africa.

The great equaliser

Again, when Richardson said 2019 was going to be ‘one of the most competitive tournaments ever’, he may not have imagined the rain gods would take it upon themselves to make his words come true.

With 18 of the 48 matches played—including three where players did not take the field and one where they could bat and bowl for just 7.3 overs—the points table is any organiser’s delight. Eight of the 10 teams are within four points of each other. There is a pacesetter in New Zealand perched atop on seven points from four. Defending champions Australia are a point adrift, with favourites India a point further back having played a match less.

And then there is a surprise package in Sri Lanka quietly creeping up a rain-soaked ladder. Quietly, because people haven’t got much of a chance to cheer for them. They lost miserably to New Zealand in the opener. They had to scrape the bottom of their resources and experience barrel to overcome ‘also rans’ Afghanistan. And then by the grace of rain managed to steal a point each against Pakistan and Bangladesh after washouts. On both occasions their opponents felt the pinch of a crucial point lost—because Pakistan, having beaten England, and Bangladesh having beaten South Africa, possibly lost the advantage they gained from beating fancies teams by losing a point against a weaker team. Both are now faced with the task of causing another major upset to squeeze into the last four.

But the worse isn’t over. With predictions of a record rainfall in June this year, more matches could see teams sharing the spoils. If that happens, the table could close down further. With prediction of rain throughout next week, England could see their relatively easy matches against Afghanistan on Tuesday and then against Sri Lanka the following Friday, get washed out. This would mean that instead of a potential four points from those matches, they get only two. Every match from then on becomes a do or die battle for the tournament favourites.

Here’s a bit of a number crunching. Without a single game washed out in this World Cup, there was an 80% chance that a team with 10 points in their nine league matches would have finished among the top four. Of that, there was a 60% chance that the last qualifier would have gone through with 10 points following a tie-breaker (NRR or head to head etc), and a 20% chance of a team with 10 points making it to the last-four stage straightaway.

But if we assume 5% of matches are washed out, the probability of 10 points being enough for a semi-final stage comes down to 60%. There’s a small chance of getting through with fewer, but now a cutoff at 11 points becomes a realistic probability (see graphic).

With Thursday’s India-New Zealand match washed out, 22.2% of matches played so far have failed to produce a result. The more the percentage of washed out games increases, the narrower the gap becomes in the points table. In other words, the possibility of qualifying with nine points progressively catches up with the possibility of qualifying with 10 points. Everything gets trickier. A lower cutoff means the chances of more teams clustering for tie-breakers increases. Don’t be surprised if at the end of the league, we have three or even four teams fighting a tie-breaker for the fourth semi-final spot.

And then what?

The focus shifts from being a battle between two teams on the field to one where you need charts and calculators. In tie-breakers, number of wins gets the highest weightage, followed by NRR, head-to-head results, and finally, pre-tournament seeding. The semis and the final have reserve days and a Super Over option, a first in 50-over cricket. In case even a Super Over is not possible over two days in the semis, then the team which finished higher in the league stage goes through to the final. If a Super Over is not possible in the final, the World Cup will be shared.

For a tournament that comes every four years and is the biggest showcase event the ICC has thus far, deciding winners off the field or on past performance becomes a damp squib. As the match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh last week got washed out without a ball bowled, a fan tweeted with a picture of a flooded Bristol ground: ‘Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to swim’.","Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/06/13/Pictures/britain-cwc-cricket_82bb7aaa-8e00-11e9-a1b4-540227be794e.jpg,"['washouts', 'south', 'semifinal', 'team', 'lineup', 'cup', '2019', 'rain', 'teams', 'points', 'sri', 'match', 'washed', 'icc', 'matches', 'world', 'affect']",

The `Highway` actor along with UK-based international humanitarian relief organization Khalsa Aid visited the drought-hit village in Vele to provide them with drinking water.

The 42-year-old actor posted a small video clip on Instagram where he can be seen talking about the drought- village and urging the government to strongly step forward and look out for some permanent solutions to the problems.""There is a major shortage of water all over the country.. in Maharashtra near Nashik village Vele with Khalsa Aid India volunteers trying to do our bit Every Drop Counts be as prudent as you can,"" he captioned the video.

In the video, viewers can watch a long queue of villagers standing with their huge containers and how the volunteers are filling those vessels with fresh drinking water.

This was not the first time that the actor has worked with the organisation. He has been part of many Khalsa Aid missions including the cleaning of Juhu beach and serving food to flood victims in Kerala last year.

Maharastra currently is facing severe drought conditions with just 7 per cent of water left for consumption and has affected the lives of the people residing in the state.

Apart from the state, several other parts of the country like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Rajasthan are also witnessing similar kind of problems.

On the work front, Randeep recently wrapped up the shooting of Imtiaz Ali`s next upcoming film.

Holding the companies responsible for Rajib’s death, High Court gives them two months to pay the compensation

The High Court has ordered the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and Sajan Paribahan to pay Tk50 lakh in compensation to the family of Rajib Hossain, who died after losing his hand in a road accident involving buses of these companies last year.

The bench of Justice JBM Hassan and Justice Md Khairul Alam issued the ruling on Thursday, after finding both companies responsible for Rajib’s death.

The lawyers of BRTC and Sajan Paribahan said they would appeal against the court order.

Rajib, a 20-year-old student of Government Titumir College, had lost a hand after getting caught between two speeding buses of these companies at Dhaka’s Karwan Bazar intersection on April 3.

He died from his injuries after spending two weeks in a coma at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 17.

On May 8, the court had ordered the bus companies to pay Tk1 crore to Rajib's family as compensation, which both BRTC and Sajan Paribahan challenged later.

The court on May 19 had fixed June 20 to deliver the verdict.

On Thursday, Rajib’s family members, including his brothers Mehedi Hasan Happy and Abdullah Hridoy and two aunts, were also present when the court issued the order.

Rajib's aunt Zahanara Begun said they only hoped the court’s order will be followed and implemented soon.","Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2019/06/rajib-hossain-collected-1561019286074.jpg,"['high', 'court', 'dhaka', 'died', 'pay', 'sajan', 'tk50', 'rajibs', 'ordered', 'paribahan', 'lakh', 'brtc', 'companies', 'family']",

Buddhist monks straying from their religious vocation in Myanmar have been given a wrap over the knuckles by the country’s Ministry of Religions and Culture.

The ministry said those who do not keep the morals of the clergy and who break religious rules are undeserving of the term sayadaw (senior monk) and do not belong to the monkhood.

“Those [monks] involved in affairs not related to religion are causing confusion and tarnishing the image of Buddhism,” said the ministry’s statement released June 15.

It also criticized monks involved in the country’s political and social affairs and who stir up the trouble. Such acts, the ministry said, undermine the country’s stability while tarnishing the image of Theravada Buddhism.

The ministry urged the State Sangha Council and the public to collaborate with the government to work together towards resolving the issue of wayward monks.

The ministry announcement didn’t mention the name of ultranationalist monk Ashin Wirathu, who is currently a fugitive, but observers say he is the main reason why the statement has been released.

Three weeks ago, Wirathu was accused of sedition for his speeches that attacked Myanmar's State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi. A local court subsequently issued a warrant for his arrest. A court will reportedly move forward the case in absentia for sedition charges this week.

Known for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, Wirathu was the leader of the now defunct ultranationalist Buddhist group Ma Ba Tha.

Wirathu’s speeches have been accused of fueling communal riots that erupted across the country from 2013 to 2014.

He was barred from giving sermons for one year in March 2017 due to his hate speech and he was banned from Facebook in January 2018 because of his incendiary posts.

Ashin Ariya Wun Tha Bhiwun Sa, a Buddhist monk from Mandalay, said Wirathu does not obey the rules of the monkhood and his actions are not representative of the monastic community.

He does not deserve to be called ""Sayadaw"" or ""U"" and should just be called ""Wirathu"" instead, said Ashin Bhiwan Sa.

“The move by the religion ministry is a warning to Wirathu and other nationalist monks and it is saying he doesn’t belong to the monkhood,” he said.

The monk said the State Sangha Council should have acted against Wirathu when he began inciting anti-Muslim speech.

Kyaw Nyein, a Yangon-based lawyer, said the government has approached the issue carefully as it is related to religion, which is a sensitive issue in Myanmar

“But now it’s time to take an action with the rules of the Sangha or by laws,” he said. “It raises question about the executive and judiciary as U Wirathu is yet to be arrested while several activists who criticize the military and the government are quickly detained.”

The HC rule also asked why the authority should not be instructed to formulate guidelines to ensure that women, girls and children are safe and not prone to sexual abuse in any public vehicles and places.

The rules came following a writ petition filed by the Children’s Charity Bangladesh Foundation.

In the petition, the child rights organisation said punishment of those guilty was not the only step in providing justice to rape victims who suffer irreparable loss -- both psychological and physical. In many cases, rape leads to death or life-long disabilities.

It also sought Tk 50 lakh compensation for the families of two gang-rape victims.

Barrister Md Abdul Halim, who filed the petition on behalf of the rights organisation, said an alarming number of rape victims were children. “They face social stigma in every phase of their lives as they grow up…”

Explaining interim compensation, he said the victims should be compensated during the trial period.

The government should ensure that victims get social and financial support to help them overcome trauma and all other barriers, he added.

There are systemic or other failures for crimes remaining unpunished, the petitioner said, adding that when the state fails to identify the accused or collect and present acceptable evidence against the criminals, the duty to compensate remains.

Referring to what the Indian Supreme Court said in several cases, the petitioner said the state’s responsibility does not end merely by registering a case, conducting investigation and initiating prosecution.

“The responsibility for rehabilitation of the victim remains and hence, the right to compensation remains for the victim.”

The HC also issued a rule asking the government to explain in four weeks why it should not be directed to give Tk 50 lakh each to the families of Shahinoor Akhter Tania and Sumaiya Akhter, who had been gang-raped in Kishoreganj and Rajshahi.

Shahinoor Akther Tania, who worked at Ibne Sina Hospital’s Kalyanpur branch in the capital, was raped and murdered in a passenger bus on her way home in Kishoreganj’s Katiadi upazila.

Sumaiya Akhter, 14, of Mohanpur upazila in Rajshahi, died by suicide after she was gang-raped on April 17, according to the writ petition.

The respondents to the rule were secretaries to the ministries of home, children and women, health and family planning, road transport and bridges, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, chairman and director of National Legal Aid Services Organization, inspector general of police, superintendents of police of Kishoreganj and Rajshahi, officers-in-charge of Bajitpur Police Station in Kishoreganj and Mohanpur Police Station in Rajshahi.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/court4_26.jpg?itok=hmkG9YV9,"['akhter', 'writ', 'petition', 'compensation', 'victims', 'rajshahi', 'kishoreganj', 'rape', 'children', 'shouldnt', 'rule']",

On World Refugee Day, a handful of Rohingya Muslims, now settled in camps across Delhi and Haryana, had set up a food exhibition in one corner of the co-working space. Besides the food, the seven visitors, all men, themselves attracted the attention of curious onlookers.

“What is Rohingya? Is it an area? Where is it?” a passerby asked one of the refugees standing by the food stall. “It’s a community from Burma (Myanmar). We were compelled to leave our county as the military escalated violence against us. We are here to share our traditional food with all of you,” the person was told.

Gradually, more people started hovering around the stall as a heady mix of food scents waft through the air. The offerings included Bawla Firda, a summer sweet dish; Mohinga, popularly recognized as one of Myanmar’s national dishes; Shutki, another sweet dish; Bini Bhat, a glutinous rice specialty; Kara Gusso, a chicken curry; Lurdi Farda, Rohingya traditional rice roti, and Bhat Fica, a rice delicacy wrapped in Banana leaves.

Mohammad Sajjad, a Rohingya who had reached India on December 26, 2016, after undertaking an arduous journey from Myanmar via the Bangladesh border and is now a resident of Hamid Colony in Nuh, was among those who had prepared the feast on offer. The shy 21-year-old, whose family used to run a chain of restaurants and hotels back home, proudly scooped Shutki for visitors.

“My grandfather used to run food outlets and everyone in the family followed in the footsteps. I often cook Rohingya food here on my friends’ request,” he said, adding that while he was a refugee in India, it was the taste of Rohingya food that gave him refuge on days he missed his family.

“Food brings back a flood of memories from home. I miss the taste of my mother’s food. In Burma (Myanmar), my mother would wait to serve me food, no matter how late it was. I am reminded of her when I serve people food here,” he said.

Cooking Rohingya food in India came with its own set of challenges. Many ingredients are not available locally, and had to be sources from the rare Burmese food shops scattered across Delhi.

“Cooking Mohinga can take 2-3 hours. There are many ingredients, including a special kind of noodle which is not readily available in India, except in Burmese shops. We had to make do with chow mien here,” Sajjad said.

The hard work put in by the group did not go in vain as visitors seemed to relish the food and were seen asking for multiple servings.

Aamir Khan, who had came all the way from Delhi’s New Friends Colony for the food exhibition, said, “I know the Rohingyas have suffered a lot in Myanmar. I came today to share their food, and extend solidarity.”

Sabber Kyaw Min, founder of Rohingya Human Rights Initiative which put together the food exhibition, said the idea was to introduce Indians to Rohingya food and start a conversation about the strife.

“For the Rohingya, food is now also a way of staying connected with their homeland. We want to share our culture and food with Indians. It reminds us of our homeland and we want to give others a chance to know our country better,” he said.","Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/06/21/Pictures/_5b2c7b90-93a2-11e9-9207-029e3937e15a.jpg,"['memories', 'rice', 'india', 'share', 'serving', 'lost', 'came', 'visitors', 'food', 'way', 'exhibition', 'myanmar', 'rohingya']",

As part of routine road maintenance work of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) the 21 km road is repaired every year. But locals blamed low quality materials used in the repair work for the road’s present condition.

Hundreds of people in Kalmakanda upazila use the road to reach Netrakona and Mymensingh, but the dilapidated condition of the road makes their journey extremely painful.

Especially critical patients are the worst sufferers due to the bad condition of the road.

AKM Hadisuzzaman Hadi, chairman of Borokhapon Union Parishad (UP), said the carpeting of many parts of the road wore off, resulting in several potholes.

Despite the condition, people of the area are using the road as they have no alternative to reach Netrakona town, he said.

In emergency cases, people of Kalmakanda use Durgapur-Jaria road as an alternative way to go to Mymensingh and due to this, they have to spend more time which made their journey very painful, said the chairman.

Suruj Ali Fakir, former chairman of Roypur UP, said as the road lies in a low-lying area, it gets flooded by the onrush of hill waters from across the border.

Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Zakir Hossain said the road needs immediate repair to ease people’s sufferings and he has already informed the authorities concerned about the matter.

Netrakona RHD Executive Engineer Md Didarul Alam said different parts of the road were washed away by flood in 2017.

BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir alleges that the current government has no accountability to people, and it is working in a free style.

""Bangladesh has now turned into a failed state where there is no accountability. The government is acting as per its whims,"" he said while addressing a meeting of Ruhia thana unit BNP in Sadar upazila yesterday.

He said the current parliament is illegal as it was not formed with people's vote.

""This is unfortunate that we could not protect the people's voting rights.""
