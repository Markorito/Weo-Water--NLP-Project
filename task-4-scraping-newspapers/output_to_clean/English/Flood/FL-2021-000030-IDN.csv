More than 50 people were killed after flash floods and landslides swept through East Nusa Tenggara and neighbouring Timor Leste on Sunday, authorities said, warning the toll could rise further.

Floods sparked by torrential rain wreaked havoc and destruction on islands stretching from Flores Island to Timor Leste, a small nation east of the Indonesian archipelago.

The deluge and subsequent landslides caused dams to overflow, submerging thousands of houses and leaving rescue workers struggling to reach survivors trapped in the aftermath.

""Four sub-districts and 7 villages have been impacted. After verifying the data with our team in the field, we found that there are 41 people dead,"" the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson (BNPB) Raditya Jati told journalists, revising down earlier figures.

""27 people are still missing and nine people are injured,"" he added.

Mud inundated homes, bridges and roads in the East Flores municipality, where rescuers struggled to reach a remote and badly-hit area because of rains and strong waves.

In neighbouring Timor Leste, 11 were killed by floods in the capital Dili, authorities said.

""We are still searching for the areas impacted by the natural disasters,"" Secretary of State for Civil Protection for Timor Joaquim Jose Gusmao dos Reis Martins told journalists.

The death toll and the number of injured victims could still rise, authorities warned.

'Many people died'

East Flores deputy regent Agustinus Payong Boli estimated there were 60 casualties in his municipality.

""The majority of them, 55, are in Lemanele village. Many people died here because the village was hit by both landslides and flash floods,"" he told AFP, providing numbers not yet confirmed by national authorities.

Images from Lemanele showed engulfed houses, debris covering entire roads, fallen trees and damaged power lines.

In Lembata, an island halfway between Flores and Timor, parts of affected villages were displaced down a mountain slope and near the coastline, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.

Road access has been cut off and local officials were forced to deploy heavy equipment to reopen the roads.

Injured victims have been evacuated to neighbouring villages that were unaffected by the flash floods, as well as local hospital and health facilities.

Images from Lembata showed barefoot locals wading through mud evacuating victims on makeshift stretchers surrounded by collapsed houses.

Dams overflow

Separately on Sunday, two people were killed in major floods in Bima city in the neighbouring province of West Nusa Tenggara, according to the disaster agency.

Dams in four sub-districts also overflowed, submerging nearly 10,000 houses in Bima following a nine-hour downpour, said Jati.

Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season.

January saw flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.

And last September, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo.

The country's disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians -- nearly half of the country's population -- live in areas at risk of landslides

The disasters are often caused by deforestation, according to environmentalists.","Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/04/05/2021_04_05_112022_1617587962._large.jpg,"['flash', '50', 'victims', 'timor', 'flores', 'villages', 'neighbouring', 'floods', 'dead', 'leste', 'told', 'killed', 'landslides']",

Almost 2,000 homes in the country’s East Nusa Tenggara Province have been destroyed by floods, and 72 people have been reported missing.[1] Rescue efforts have been hampered by blocked roads, power cuts and continued landslides. Electricity and internet networks have collapsed in five districts, and more than 1 million people are living without lights. Electricity is not expected to be back to normal until May.

Children across Indonesia were due to take exams at home this week as schools remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Around 100,000 children in East Nusa Tenggara such as Kupang City, Kupang and Malaka districts have now had their exams disrupted by the chaos, according to Save the Children.

Schools in Indonesia have now been closed for over a year, with lessons and exams being held online. Save the Children is concerned about the further impact of this latest disaster on children’s education.

Miguel, a 13-year-old student in Kupang City, said: “This morning I was ready for my exam, but then there was no signal or electricity. I didn’t get any information from my school. I feel so sad and anxious”.

Selina Patta Sumbung, CEO of Save the Children Indonesia, said:

“This is a disaster upon a disaster for these children. They are still reeling from the loss, anxiety and the disruption to their education caused the pandemic, and now, on top of losing their homes, their hopes of getting an education face yet another blow.”

“Since January we’ve had more than 1000 emergencies in Indonesia caused by floods, strong winds and landslides, and it is children who are often the most vulnerable.”

Further extreme weather and tropical cyclones are predicted in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara Province this week, according to Indonesia Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency.

Save the Children is providing immediate help to families in the form of emergency shelters, blankets and hygiene kits. It is also providing mental health support for children affected by the crisis.

2,2,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"Plan Indonesia Distributes Aid for Flash Flood Survivors in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara - Indonesia - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/plan-indonesia-distributes-aid-flash-flood-survivors-lembata-east-nusa-tenggara,"Lewoleba, 6 April 2021 – A series of disasters, which include flash flood, landslide, as well as tropical cyclone has been sweeping the East Nusa Tenggara Province (NTT) since last Saturday (3/4). The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) shared that an amount of two tropical cyclone seeds in the Indonesian region could also result in extreme weather until the next Friday (9/4), with risks of flash floods announced for the Kupang Regency, Kupang city, Timor Tengah Utara, and Timor Tengah Selatan.

Yayasan Plan International Indonesia (Plan Indonesia), a humanitarian organization that has been working in the Lembata Regency, NTT, since 2006, noted that at least 2,227 out of approximately 10 thousand of its sponsored children (1,186 girls and 1,041 boys) and their families in the area are affected by this set of disasters.

In response to this, Plan Indonesia has been moving swiftly to conduct a three-day rapid need assessment, to map the needs of the survivors from Monday (5/4) to Wednesday (7/4). Dini Widiastuti, the Executive Director of Plan Indonesia stated that rapid need assessment and initial aid distribution, is crucially needed to fulfill the needs of survivors in the temporary shelters.

“The child survivors particularly from marginalised families are at most vulnerable when a disaster occurs. In coordination with the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management and relevant agencies, we will be mapping the needs of the survivors particularly marginalised children and their family, then distribute aid to them to ensure they have access to basic needs amid this disaster,” Dini mentioned on Tuesday (6/4).

The current situation in East Nusa Tenggara, which include blackout, communication loss, as well as roadblocks has made it more difficult to distribute aid to the survivors. Local citizens are also still on alert as Mt.Ili Lewotolok—which has just erupted months ago—is still rendered active at level III of Siaga (Alert) situation and the Lembata Regency itself is considered as an orange zone, which indicates the medium-high level of COVID-19 transmission in the area.

Ervin (11-year-old), one of Plan Indonesia Sponsored Children living in Lembata, has expressed the type of logistics needed in the shelter.

“We are in dire need of clothes, blankets, and sleeping mats. When the night comes, we are shivering from the cold as we have to sleep on the bare floor,” Ervin said to the Plan Indonesia emergency response team in Lembata, Monday (5/4).

Aside from conducting the rapid need assessment, the Plan Indonesia emergency response team has also been distributing initial aid to the survivors. An amount of 105 emergency shelter tool kits consisting of mat and blankets, as well as 30 menstrual hygiene management kits, were distributed to the Lembata citizens on Sunday (4/4). Plan Indonesia adhered to the COVID-19 health protocols in its aid distribution, to ensure the health of the citizens and the humanitarian workers.

In parallel to the aid distribution, Plan Indonesia has also been carrying out a fundraising effort through a local platform, kitabisa.com, to increase the amount of aid for the survivors. The fundraised money will be distributed in the form of logistics needed by the flash flood survivors in East Nusa Tenggara, based on the rapid need assessment result.

Days of heavy rain due to the tropical cyclone Seroja tropical, have affected 12 cities and districts in the province on Easter Sunday, killing at least 138 people, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said on Thursday. About 61 people are reportedly missing, while 271 homes and 99 public facilities were damaged. More than 8,000 people were evacuated to shelters including ones belonging to the Catholic Church.

Indonesian bishops' appeal

“On behalf of the Indonesian Bishops’ Conference, I call on you to show compassion to our brothers and sisters who are suffering in East Nusa Tenggara province and some parts of West Nusa Tenggara province,” said Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo of Jakarta, president of the Bishops’ Conference of Indonesia (KWI). In a video message posted on Wednesday on the YouTube channel of the bishops’ Commission for Social Communications, he explained that compassion that makes our faith concrete becomes a blessing to our brothers and sisters in need.

The 70-year-old cardinal urged donations through the charitable bodies of the Bishops’ Conference, such as Caritas Indonesia, the Commission for Socio-Economic Development, the diocesan Commissions for Social Communications and Jakarta Archdiocese’s Lembaga Daya Dharma.

Caritas

The chairman of Caritas Indonesia, locally known as Karina, also spoke in the video message, encouraging concrete acts of compassion. “The Catholic Church in Indonesia will not stay silent. Our care for all those who are suffering is truly a concrete form of our faith,” said Archbishop Aloysius Sudarso of Palembang. “As a matter of fact, we just celebrated Easter, proof of the involvement of God, through Jesus, in human life,” the Dehonian archbishop said.



Father Fredy Rante Taruk, executive director of Karina, told UCA News that they have so far received donations amounting to more than 1 billion rupiah (US$71,400). He said that Caritas would continue to collect donations for a month which would be utilized also for rehabilitation programmes. Caritas is also working with the Commissions for Socio-Economic Development in several dioceses in distributing aid packages to victims. Father Taruk urged dioceses to particularly focus on the needs of babies, pregnant mothers and the elderly.

Maria Gorethy Bria, whose house in Naimana village of Malaka district was damaged, told UCA News that she and her family have taken refuge in a Catholic Church shelter since April 5. “We feel so sad. And we still have fears. But we are thankful that some people donate money to help us, the victims. They have pure hearts,” she said. (Source: UCA News)

Homeless, injured, and with his daughter dead, Sugeng stares blankly as he comes to grips with the devastation left by floods and landslides on East Nusa Tenggara's Adonara island.

The 60-year-old was asleep with his family on Sunday night as torrential rain battered the community at the eastern end of the vast archipelago nation.

In seconds, their lives changed forever.

""Suddenly we heard people scream 'flood!'"" said Sugeng.

He and his wife fled their home, but their 20-year-old daughter Indri did not make it out alive and her body was later found on a beach.

""She was trying to hold on to a cupboard but the current was so strong that she lost her grip,"" Sugeng said.

""We buried my daughter yesterday... I'm devastated.""

Adonara island, home to about 125,000 people, was among the areas hardest hit by the floods and landslides that killed more than 150 in Indonesia and neighbouring Timor Leste.

The disaster was triggered by heavy rain and wind from one of the region's most destructive cyclones in years, which ripped across a cluster of islands in the neighbouring Southeast Asian nations.

Far-flung Adonara, dotted with beaches and a volcano, is accessible only by boat. It has no local hospital.

More than 50 residents were killed and a dozen were still missing on Wednesday.

'Thundering noise'

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said it is trying to airlift the injured in helicopters to a city and provide shelter for those left homeless.

Among the evacuees was Elisabet Lena Huki, 61, who took refuge at a local government office with her husband, elderly parents, children and grandchildren.

She was coming back from an Easter mass on the predominantly Catholic island when tragedy struck.

""We had rushed home from church because my elderly parents were there,"" she said.

""Suddenly I heard a thundering noise... and I screamed to my sleeping husband that there was a flood.""

Her neighbours sobbed in fear as chaos struck, while Huki's family searched frantically around their waterlogged home for her nephew Yeremias.

""He's still missing,"" she sobbed, remembering the 33-year-old she thinks of as a son.

""I want him to be found, even if it's just his body... so we can lay him to rest and visit his grave. That's my only hope now.""

With just the clothes on their backs, Huki and her extended family also have to think about their own survival in the weeks ahead.

""I need diapers for my elderly parents but the stores are closed,"" she said.

""We're all exhausted and weary. I'm not thinking about wealth and possessions right now -- I just want my family to have shelter.""","Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/04/07/2021_04_07_112112_1617772355._large.jpg,"['floods', 'island', 'heard', 'parents', 'east', 'elderly', 'adonara', 'family', 'horror', 'left', 'neighbouring', 'suddenly', 'daughter', 'scream', 'flood', 'landslides']",

The recent widespread flooding from heavy rainfall which hit the provinces of South and East Kalimantan have caused concern among many, with some environmentalists attributing the disaster to the expansion of oil palm plantations.

What is the actual root of the problem? Is it possible for oil palm growers to participate in environmental conservation to reduce potential flood risks? If so, how?

While acknowledging the devastating consequences of the flooding disaster on communities in the two provinces, as well as other areas across Indonesia, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) says that large-scale land use conversion is one factor that contributes to increasing severity of floods.

“This may include deforestation, destruction of floodplains, and construction of flood dams and drainage channels,” says Tiur Rumondang, RSPO Assurance Director.

Research by the World Resource Institute (WRI) Indonesia has found that the factors most commonly responsible for flooding in Indonesia are tree cover loss, excessive rainfall and topographical conditions.

A separate report by the emergency response team of the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) indicates excessive rainfall as the major cause of flooding disasters. It also adds that land use conversion in the past decade could be a contributing factor, noting a decline in primary and secondary forests, rice fields and shrub groves in 2010-2020.

“Palm oil produced in an unsustainable way can lead to the widespread destruction of tropical forests,” Tiur asserts, adding that excessive rainfall can affect oil palm production.

“Oil palm trees are capable of withstanding temporary flooding, but waterlogged conditions can damage plantations,” she says.

Tiur explains that the RSPO’s sustainability principles, which all members must adhere to in operating their oil palm plantations, can protect the environment and can also contribute to reducing flood risk.

As enshrined in the 2018 RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C), multistakeholder non-profit emphasises the importance of “Ecosystem Preservation as a Pillar to establish Co-existence between Palm Oil and Environment”.

The preservation of ecosystems and their essential services is a core tenet of the RSPO P&C 2018 standards, says Tiur.

“These are organised into three impact areas, Prosperity, People, Planet, each with their own set of principles.

“Under Planet, Principle 7 sets out the commitment to protect, conserve and enhance ecosystems and the environment. This means our members are responsible for protecting the environment, conserving biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources,” she explains.

She further elaborates: “It includes criteria around preventing the degradation of soil, using topographic information to guide the planning of drainage and irrigation systems, and ensuring that land clearing does not cause deforestation. All of which are important in mitigating flood risk.”

Since the first P&C was adopted in November 2007, the standards have been reviewed every five years and the latest iteration was adopted in 2018.

Tiur says that RSPO can help to reduce flood risk by addressing the first factor: tree cover loss.

“Under the RSPO P&C 2018, all our members [certified or not] have committed to a total ban on deforestation,” she says. “This prohibits the conversion of tropical rainforests for oil palm plantations and ensures that land clearing doesn’t cause deforestation. This is why we take our responsibility to monitor members’ commitment to the P&C 2018 very seriously.”

The RSPO has worked continuously over the past 10 years to develop a set of standards that ensure the sustainable production of palm oil, she underlines.

According to Tiur, the P&C 2018 includes a total ban on deforestation and requires oil palm growers to protect and conserve High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and rare, threatened or endangered (RTE) species.

“To ensure the responsible development of new land for oil palm cultivation, we introduced the New Planting Procedure in 2009. This framework was further updated in 2015 to include a set of assessments and verification activities to be conducted by growers and certification bodies before any new oil palm development commences.

“These are designed to ensure that oil palm plantings do not negatively affect primary forests, HCV areas, HCS areas, fragile and marginal soil, or people’s land,” she says.

Strict verification process

Meanwhile, RSPO Indonesia Assurance Manager, Djaka Riksanto explains that palm oil producers members of the RSPO are certified through a strict verification process by accredited certification bodies. Further, he says that “this certification can be withdrawn at any time in case of infringement of the rules and standards”.

According to Djaka, grower members are assessed annually for continued compliance.

“To ensure the credibility of the sustainability claim at the end of the supply chain, all organisations that take legal ownership and physically handle RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil products need to be supply chain certified,” he says.

“For our smallholder members, we have designed the RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard to support [them] towards certification. This seeks to increase the inclusion of smallholders into the RSPO system through a mechanism which takes into consideration the diversity in challenges and situations faced by smallholders,” Djaka adds.

According to Tiur, the RSPO will continue to address the environmental challenges associated with unsustainable palm oil production that require urgent collective action, like flooding.

“Every stakeholder in the palm oil supply chain – from growers to investors to manufacturers to consumers – has a shared responsibility to ensure that palm oil production does not harm our environment or local communities,” she says. “In this respect, RSPO continues to strengthen its commitment to transparency and accountability.”

Djaka adds that since 2013, all RSPO grower members, certified or not, have been required to submit concession maps. However, to respect the decision by the Government of Indonesia that considers such information as Government own legal documents and not to make it public by foreign organisation such as RSPO, we exclude this information from our map platform GeoRSPO. The Government of Indonesia also stated that they are in a process to create a data protocol to allow future transparency and we are still waiting for such further actions.","Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/03/26/2021_03_26_111750_1616764778._large.jpg,"['reduce', 'pc', 'indonesia', 'ensure', 'palm', 'plantations', 'members', 'rspo', 'oil', 'land', 'flooding', 'flood', 'risk']",

The 60-year-old was asleep with his family on Sunday night as torrential rain battered the community at the eastern end of the vast archipelago nation.

In seconds, their lives changed forever.

""Suddenly we heard people scream 'flood!'"" said Sugeng, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

He and his wife fled their home, but their 20-year-old daughter Indri did not make it out alive and her body was later found on a beach.

""She was trying to hold on to a cupboard but the current was so strong that she lost her grip,"" Sugeng said.

""We buried my daughter yesterday... I'm devastated.""

Adonara island, home to about 125,000 people, was among the areas hardest hit by the floods and landslides that killed more than 150 in Indonesia and neighbouring East Timor.

The disaster was triggered by heavy rain and wind from one of the region's most destructive cyclones in years, which ripped across a cluster of islands in the neighbouring Southeast Asian nations.

Far-flung Adonara, dotted with beaches and a volcano, is accessible only by boat. It has no local hospital.

More than 50 residents were killed and a dozen were still missing on Wednesday.

- 'Thundering noise' -

Indonesia's disaster agency said it is trying to airlift the injured in helicopters to a city and provide shelter for those left homeless.

Among the evacuees was Elisabet Lena Huki, 61, who took refuge at a local government office with her husband, elderly parents, children and grandchildren.

She was coming back from an Easter mass on the predominantly Catholic island when tragedy struck.

""We had rushed home from church because my elderly parents were there,"" she said.

""Suddenly I heard a thundering noise... and I screamed to my sleeping husband that there was a flood.""

Her neighbours sobbed in fear as chaos struck, while Huki's family searched frantically around their waterlogged home for her nephew Yeremias.

""He's still missing,"" she sobbed, remembering the 33-year-old she thinks of as a son.

""I want him to be found, even if it's just his body... so we can lay him to rest and visit his grave. That's my only hope now.""

With just the clothes on their backs, Huki and her extended family also have to think about their own survival in the weeks ahead.

""I need diapers for my elderly parents but the stores are closed,"" she said.

""We're all exhausted and weary. I'm not thinking about wealth and possessions right now -- I just want my family to have shelter.""

WIDESPREAD: Floods killed an additional two people in the province of West Nusa Tenggara, while overflowing dams engulfed nearly 10,000 residences

AFP, JAKARTA





At least 44 people were killed after flash floods and landslides swept an island in Indonesia’s easternmost province yesterday morning, rescue officials said, adding that they expected the toll to rise.

“There are 44 people dead, with nine injured” in East Flores Regency and “many ... are still under the mud,” Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati told reporters.

Hours before people woke to celebrate Easter Sunday, torrential rain unleashed flash floods in the Catholic-majority Flores Island.

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed.

Rescuers were struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores because of rains and strong waves.

The death toll rose from 23 earlier announced by authorities.

The number of injured is also expected to increase as the agency is still receiving reports from locals, Jati said.

“We are still documenting the total number of people injured,” the spokesperson said, adding that extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week.

Separately yesterday, major floods also killed two people in Bima city in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, the disaster agency said.

Dams in four subdistricts also overflowed, submerging nearly 10,000 houses in Bima following a nine-hour downpour, Jati said.

Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season.

In January, flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.

In September last year, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo, while a few months earlier dozens died in a similar disaster in Sulawesi.

Deforestation is often a cause of the landslides, environmentalists have said.

The country’s disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians — nearly half of the country’s population — live in areas at risk of landslides.","Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2021/04/05/P01-210405-321.jpg,"['expected', 'flash', 'kill', 'disaster', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'west', 'yesterday', 'landslides', '44', 'toll', 'floods', 'agency', 'killed', 'grow']",

Severe damage has also been reported to critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges and medical centres, while communication networks and electricity are said to be disrupted in some of the worst affected areas.

Roy Trivedy, UN Resident Coordinator in Timor-Leste said that UN agencies and partners are supporting the national response, adding that “as an emergency response measure, [we] extend full support to the people and Government of Timor-Leste in this hour of need.”

“We are deeply concerned about the communities, especially women and children, who are often most affected by natural disasters. We will work with the authorities to mobilize all possible resources to support the response”, Mr. Trivedy added.

There are concerns that the disaster could hit COVID-19 prevention and response efforts, as the national medical storage facility was heavily flooded and many medical supplies damaged or washed away. A COVID-19 isolation facility had to be temporarily evacuated and the national laboratory also affected by the floods.

There are fears that the situation could deteriorate further, if the rains do not let up.

Evacuating families

According to Dageng Liu, UN World Food Programme (WFP) Country Director in Timor-Leste, “the priority right now is to continue evacuating and relocating of families most affected”.

He added that food and cooking facilities are also needed in evacuation centres, as are vehicles to transport people there. As of Monday, about 3,000 people are sheltering in some 11 evacuation centres in Dili.

“WFP has provided transport support to other UN agencies to move their supplies and we are fully committed to doing our part once we know more about the extent of the damages”, Mr. Liu added.

UN agencies have also delivered food, safe drinking water, temporary bedding material, personal protection equipment (PPE) and hand sanitizers, and set up mobile toilets at four of the evacuation centres.

Similarly, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has dispatched dignity kits, which include hygiene and sanitary items, such as sanitary napkins, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, for women and girls displaced by the floods. The agency also supported the transport of midwives from health centres to evacuation centres to provide essential services to pregnant women and expectant mothers.

The agencies are currently using existing resources to respond to the flood emergency and will mobilize additional resources if required, once the needs become clearer.

Indonesia also affected

Damage has also been reported across the border, in Indonesia, where more than 75 people are reported to have died.

According to initial reports, over 25,000 people have been affected in West Nusa Tenggara province. Flooding has also been reported in East Nusa Tenggara province and roads and power lines damaged at many places due to landslides. National, provincial and local authorities, as well as humanitarian organizations are providing assistance and assisting with evacuations.

UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said that the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) continues to monitor the situation and so far, international assistance has not been requested.","Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/05-04-2021-NICA-468508-Timor-Leste.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['thousands', 'national', 'affected', 'centres', 'evacuation', 'reported', 'timorleste', 'steps', 'women', 'response', 'floods', 'agencies', 'support', 'impacted']",

“Now I have no place to live. I am staying temporarily at my brother’s house,” he said.

Batista is one of thousands who have been left homeless in Timor-Leste and neighbouring Indonesia after a tropical cyclone battered the south-east Asian nations over the weekend.

At least 157 people were killed – 130 in Indonesia and 27 in Timor-Leste, including 13 in Dili. Dozens more are missing.

On Tuesday, even as flood waters were receding across Dili, Kanisius Elo’s home was still inundated with about five meters of dirty water.

“When I woke up, the house was full of water,” Kanisius recalled of Saturday night. He is worried that if the water level does not drop soon his home will be lost.

“If this water is dry in the next few days I will return to my house but if it doesn’t dry up for a month or two, then my house will also be destroyed.”

Neither Kanisius nor Batista had received humanitarian assistance from the government and are hoping the government will visit their homes so that they can see the reality of what is happening.

“I don’t blame anyone, but I hope the authorities will hopefully try to reduce this water in the future,” said Kanisius. “The big problem now is the provision of clean water and food.”

He also asked the government to repair the existing sewers in Dili, especially in the Tasitolu terminal section so that they would not make it difficult for the community in the rainy season.

“If the sewers at the terminal are good then it will be good here too.”

Around 8,000 people have lost their homes and have taken refuge in several places in Dili, said government spokesman Fidelis Leite Magalhaes at a press conference on Monday.

Fidelis said the government would work to repair several public roads that have been cut off due to the heavy flooding.

Almost all the offices in Dili were flooded. Normal work has been suspended across the city as civil servants focus on cleaning up the mud in their workplaces.

April 4 (UPI) -- Flash floods and landslides caused by torrential rains in eastern Indonesia have killed more than 40 people with dozens missing, officials said.

Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency reported early Monday that 44 people had died and 24 were still missing following flash floods that were reported from the Flores Island to neighboring East Timor.

More than 250 residents of the East Flores Regency in southern Indonesia also sought refuge at local village halls while those injured in the incident have received medical attention, the BNPB said.

Officials said a total of nine villages across four districts were impacted, with floods causing 17 houses to be washed away, 60 to be submerged in mud and five bridges to be damaged.

Rescue efforts have been impeded by the weather as rain, wind and waves threaten boats that attempt to reach the affected areas as sea crossings are the main access routes, BNPB said.

""On the other hand, the evacuation of victims buried in mud is still constrained by heavy equipment,"" the agency said.

The flash floods were caused by torrents of rain that began to fall early Sunday but the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warns more extreme weather may batter the region until Friday.

""The province of East Nusa Tenggara has the potential to experience heavy rain, which can be accompanied by lightning and strong winds,"" it said.

At least 49 families were hit on Flores, in the east of Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago, Raditya Jati, a BNPB spokesman said in a statement on Sunday.

“Dozens of houses were buried in mud in Lamanele village... residents’ houses washed away by the flood,” Raditya said, referring to the eastern part of Flores.

“Heavy rains and overflowing water have drowned people’s homes and have also claimed the lives of several victims,” East Timor deputy prime minister Jose Reis said in a statement.

“There are roads that have collapsed, trees have fallen, and made it difficult to access some areas,” he said, calling the incident the worst in East Timor in 40 years.

Power supplies were cut and the presidential palace was flooded as heavy rain and strong winds have lashed Dili since late on Saturday.

Gregorius Hide, a 70-year-old farmer in the eastern Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara, said the only warning he had of an approaching swirl of muddy water that engulfed his district this week was a smell of wet earth shortly before it hit.

Tropical cyclone Seroja, one of the most powerful cyclones ever to hit Indonesia, struck on Sunday killing 163 people, mostly on the islands of Lembata, Alor and Adonara, among the poorest and least developed parts of Indonesia.

The sprawling archipelago, which is made up of more than 17,000 islands, is used to dealing with disasters ranging from earthquakes to volcanic eruptions. But cyclones of this power have been rare, leaving many areas poorly prepared.

""There were no government warnings in the village,"" said Gregorius, recounting how he managed to flee with his family before returning to help treat injured neighbours and assist those who had lost everything.

Authorities will need to learn fast from the disaster since Indonesia's weather agency (BMKG) has warned once-rare tropical cyclones are happening more often, with another potentially damaging cyclone due to hit this week. read more

Activists and researchers point to a slow response to Seroja, with little early warning infrastructure in place.

""We should've evacuated faster, like predicting when it would happen, who to evacuate,"" said Dominikus Karangora of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI), a non-governmental group, in East Nusa Tenggara.

Some residents used traditional means to warn people, with reports of mosques using loudspeakers and church bells to warn of imminent danger.

Indonesia's weather agency feeds warnings to local disaster mitigation agencies and also provides warnings on its website.

Isyak Nuka, head of the disaster mitigation agency in East Nusa Tenggara, said such measures were usually effective, but the scale of flash floods and landslides was ""unprecedented"".

Isyak pledged to use this disaster as a lesson to strengthen the system.

Erma Yulihastin, a climatologist at the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, said Seroja was an anomaly in its destructive force since such cyclones do not usually gain traction in a country straddling the equator.

""Tropical cyclones don't happen that much, but when they happen the damage is extraordinary,"" she said.

Agie Wandala Putra, a researcher at BMKG, said Indonesia's preparedness was currently skewed towards guarding against disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis and needed to put more attention on events like flooding, cyclones and droughts.

“What needs to be emphasized is not just early warning, but also our response capacity,” he said.

Linda, who lives together with her husband, 79-year-old mother-in-law and only child in Sikumana, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia, was shocked by a strong wind and heavy rain. The electricity suddenly went off.

“I prayed and prayed in the dark,” she said. The wind eventually stopped on Monday morning. She walked out of the house and found the roof gone from the back part of the house. “Electricity cables, tin roofs, and trees lie on the street in front of our house,” she said.

The rooftop of her neighbour, Yetti Lekeama, was also gone. “I didn’t know what to do and where to go. It’s completely dark. But I could hear the sound of the rooftop flying over my house, and breaking wood.”

Linda and Yetti preferred to stay at home while many Kupang citizens sought evacuation, their residences flattened by Tropical Cyclone Seroja, which hit the island of Timor and damaged thousands of houses. Many village roads were blocked by mud and fallen trees, preventing rescuers and volunteers from getting in.

Indonesia’s disaster agency, the BNPB, said 138 people were killed, with dozens more missing and thousands evacuated.

The Indonesian Forum for Environment, known as Walhi, said that while the province was prone to storms and high rainfall, environmental problems exacerbated the damage as land clearing, sugarcane plantations, mining, and illegal logging expanded.

“Landslides cut many roads,” said Dicky Senda, a food activist based in Mollo, the northern part of the province. He travelled from his village to central Kupang a day after the disaster. “I saw houses without a rooftop, dead cow carcasses lying on the street, and the rice field flooded.”

01:32 Evacuations underway after floods kill dozens in Indonesia and Timor-Leste – video

Arriving in Kupang city, Dicky described the situation: “A huge queue in the automatic teller machine, gasoline stop, and government office – they were looking to charge their phone.”

In Kupang the cyclone forced residents, most of them women, children, and elders, to stay in dire condition in 19 evacuation camps, half of them located in churches.

Priestess Linda Angga Kisek from the Protestant church in Oebufu, Kupang, said the community set up a camp for hundreds of citizens. “About 38 householders who lived in the nearby Liliba river lost their home, the house completely flattened by the flood. We are trying to relocate them to a new location or find them a boarding house.”

Affected residents have called for the local government to help them rebuild. President Joko Widodo, who visited the province on Friday, promised aid for affected residents to repair their homes. With food running short and crops damaged, Tata Yunita, a volunteer said there was panic-buying in the shops.

The disaster agency said 15 tonnes of aid had arrived in Kupang for distribution. However, Linda and Yetti, who survived by eating instant noodles and harvesting vegetables from their garden, said they were yet to receive any aid. Residents’ electricity and internet were cut by the cyclone, leaving them unable to contact family.

The state electricity company said the cyclone had damaged utility poles and network cables, and restoring the province’s electricity could take a month. As a result, candles and electricity generators were sold out.

While residents worry about food and electricity shortages, they face another problem: burglaries. “While women and children stay at the churches, men decide to return to save their house from burglars,” said Yunita.

Linda said that she would survive but worried that many of her neighbours would need more help. “I hope that the government will collect the data correctly. That could be a good strategy. So those people who have no decent income or job, widows, widowers, people who live alone, can get the assistance immediately.”","Sat, 10 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aad7140fbba492b9f3255ab81343e25b7f657d9/0_0_5420_3254/master/5420.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb370cd9937a0db3504213494589fdbf,"['prayed', 'cyclone', 'dark', 'kupang', 'house', 'province', 'residents', 'rooftop', 'seroja', 'stay', 'aftermath', 'electricity', 'yetti', 'linda']",

Heavy groundwater extraction, compounded by worsening floods as the climate warms, raises the prospect of lost land and forced relocation

Last month the Indonesian city of Pekalongan trended in the global media when severe river flooding caused a leak from a textile factory, turning the water a surreal blood red.

Bizarre scenes followed as children and people on motorbikes waded through the crimson waters, like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie.

Had it not been for the arresting images, this would have been ‘just another’ under-reported local flooding event. But for the people in the area the reality is much starker, more chilling and potentially devastating.

This is because Pekalongan City and Regency, home to 1.2 million people, is sinking; just like the much larger metropolis to the west, Jakarta the capital of Indonesia.

As a result, the Indonesian government is faced with tough choices and in the case of Jakarta has plans to move the capital to the less populated island of Borneo at the cost of tens of billions.

Sinking cities, relocating millions of people and essential infrastructure. These are drastic measures, and at Mercy Corps we’re concerned with what’s causing them to sink.

In Pekalongan at least, excessive ground water extraction has led to rapid land subsidence. We know from our own research that land subsidence is occurring due to poor coastal management planning. The lack of clean water services is driving over-extraction of groundwater by communities and businesses.

The rapid and significant rate of subsidence has led to some areas of the Northern Java coast becoming water basins, with the land below sea level. In turn this has led to chronic and sometimes irreversible impacts of flooding, such as land permanently swamped with water.

Combine this with more intense weather-related hazards like flooding fuelled by the climate emergency and the prospect is permanently lost land as well as ruined lives and livelihoods.

In fact, since 2011, nearly 700 hectares of land in Pekalongan City and Regency previously used for farming and aquaculture is now permanently inundated. And as we reveal, by 2035, 90% of the city will be covered by water.

As land is lost, demand for fresh drinking water and food will increase, not least because the local population is growing by about 1% a year.

Villages in Pekalongan Regency have already been partially lost, too.

In one village called Semut, a total of 15 hectares is water-covered due to tidal flooding. The villagers wrestle daily with tidal floods and during peak season the water reaches 5 metres above sea level, forcing people to evacuate.

As you’d expect, this makes life for these people unbearable. It causes economic and non-economic losses, for example biodiversity, assets, cultural heritage, and health.

STARK CHOICES

Something must be done and we’re acting.

Through the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance program, Mercy Corps Indonesia works with the Pekalongan City and Regency governments to promote evidence-based policy making and program development.

Together we provide insight into how poorly planned development activities, like groundwater dependence for water supply in downstream areas, exacerbates flood impacts.

We also shed light on how current development practices in the downstream and coastal areas intensify the impact of city flooding.

All of this has serious implications for people’s lives and livelihoods. We expect to see a 100-fold increase in residential areas flooded in Pekalongan City and Regency in the next 15 years.

These alarming predictions leave the Pekalongan governments with some stark choices on how to deal with the loss of productive land and assets.

At a minimum they need a water resource strategy to reduce the rate of land subsidence; as well as plans to limit the impact of destructive water force in downstream and coastal areas and adapt to irreversible losses.

In addition, an environmental health strategy is needed to improve the quality of city-wide sanitation; not to mention social and economic blueprints to coastal communities and the fisheries sector. What’s also needed is a plan to promote better water and disaster management.

The severe flooding and loss of valuable land in Pekalongan should alarm the authorities of other coastal cities globally. They face uncertain and unpredictable futures due to climate change, too.

Assessments like our climate risk and impact analysis can provide evidence for decision-makers to better understand current and future risks. It can enable evidence-based policy and program development that sees climate financing (which is massively under-funded and not invested where it’s needed most, our research revealed) as an investment for sustainable solutions.

Communities face a difficult decision – to transform their livelihoods to continue living in flooded areas, or to relocate. Moving away from homelands with deep cultural and socio-economic ties is not a preferred decision for many. Decisions on who will be relocated, when and how will require evidence, cooperation, and transparency in decision-making and planning.

For communities to adapt to the environment, local officials and national-level governments need to make hard choices about how and where to invest in technology and nature-based solutions to protect people and the environment from more intense and severe flood events.

Will we rise to this challenge before rising sea-levels swallow coastal cities? Only time will tell.

The agency's spokesman Raditya Jati said the floods are still inundating houses in Pasuruan district.



""The water level now is around 20 to 50 centimeters high. Yesterday it reached 80 centimeters high,"" Jati noted.



He said it rained heavily on Friday, causing the Wrati, Patuk, and Kedung Larangan rivers to overflow.



As of Friday 11,880 people had been displaced, and some have returned homes now.



On Saturday (April 3), the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said that there were two tropical cyclones namely 90S in the Indian Ocean southwest of Sumatra Island and 99S in the Savu Sea, East Nusa Tenggara.

Much of the Timor-Leste capital of Dili has been heavily flooded with rivers bursting their banks after three days of heavy rain over the Easter weekend, say disaster relief officials.

The floodwaters in some parts of the city have reached many metres deep with houses on the banks of the Comoro River being dragged into the raging waters, reports Lusa news agency.

The Civil Protection agency told Lusa that it was difficult to take full stock of the situation and determine the full numbers of casualties because ′′the whole city is a disaster zone”.

However, some reports say at least 11 people have died. The floods have come on top of a city already reeling from a serious covid-19 pandemic crisis.

Part of the oceanside Avenue de Portugal, where some embassies are located, has been seriously flooded with the waters entering the homes, including the Lusa office.

Several residents, including Portuguese citizens, have already been forced to leave their homes in spite of the difficulties of moving around Dili because of the floodwaters.

The high tide overnight and large volume of river water has raised the levels across almost the city, with civil protection teams, firefighters and government emergency services desperately spread around the city trying to help people.

Throughout the early morning residents in several parts of the city sent photos and videos to Lusa attesting to the fury of the floodwaters in some places.

An unknown number of families have lost their homes, with several areas – including the Presidential Palace compound – being flooded.

There is also concern about two places used to isolate patients suffering from covid-19 – the Vera Cruz Centre in Dili and the Tasitolu area.

Over the past few days, weather services have warned of the risk of heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, prominently on the north coast, due to the effects of a low pressure system, located on the Indonesian western part of the island of Timor.

Heavy rains had already caused problems in several municipalities in the country in recent days, with reports of destroyed homes and other infrastructure affected, including roads and bridges.

Some residents say the rainfall and situation in Dili today was significantly more serious than last year on 13 March 2020 when flooding affected tens of thousands of people in the capital.

Older residents have told Lusa they do not remember heavy flooding like this in Dili since the 1970s.","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://asiapacificreport.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dilki-floods-2-Lusa-680wide.png,"['severe', 'disaster', 'easter', 'dili', 'city', 'lusa', 'timorleste', 'capital', 'residents', 'homes', 'say', 'parts', 'reports', 'heavy', 'hit', 'floods', 'including']",

More than 40 other people were missing.

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills onto dozens of homes in Lamenele village shortly after midnight on Adonara Island in East Nusa Tenggara province. Rescuers recovered 38 bodies and at least five people were injured, said Lenny Ola, who heads the local disaster agency.

Flash flooding killed at least 17 people elsewhere and at least 42 are missing, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Relief efforts were hampered by power cuts, blocked roads covered in thick mud and debris as well as the remoteness of the area on an island surrounded by choppy seas and high waves, said the agency’s spokesman, Raditya Jati.

The bodies of three people were recovered after being swept away by floods in Oyang Bayang village, where 40 houses were also destroyed, Ola said. Hundreds of people fled submerged homes, some of which were carried off by the floodwaters.

In another village, Waiburak, three people were killed and seven missing after overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks, sending muddy water into large areas of East Flores district, Ola said. Four injured people were being treated at a local health clinic.

The death toll reached 55 by Monday morning after the rains caused cold lava to tumble down the slopes of Ili Lewotolok volcano and hit several villages, Jati said.

That disaster on Lembata Island killed at least 11, while at least 16 others were still buried under tons of cold lava, Jati said. The lava was left after the volcano had erupted in November.

Hundreds of people were still involved in the rescue efforts as of late Sunday, Jati told a news conference. At least six villages have been affected by flash floods and a landslide that cut five bridges on the island, he said.

Photos released by the agency showed rescuers and police and military personnel taking residents to shelters.

Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas, Jati said. Severe flooding also has been reported in Bima, a town in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, forcing nearly 10,000 people to flee.

Indonesia floods: Death toll climbs to 117



Jakarta: The death toll from floods and landslides triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja in Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara rose to 117, the National Disaster Management Agency said on Tuesday.

“The number of bodies that have been found is 117, while 76 people are still missing,” the agency’s head Doni Monardo told a virtual press conference.

The deaths were reported in East Flores district (60), Lembata district (28), Alor district (21), Malaka district (3), Ende district (1), Sabu Raijua district (2), Kupang district (1), and Kupang city (1), the Xinhua news agency reported.

The disasters also left 146 people injured and 8,424 others displaced, and damaged 45 public facilities.

Meanwhile, 343 houses were heavily devastated, 133 were moderately destroyed and 110 were slightly damaged.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency said that extreme weather such as heavy rains, strong winds, and high sea waves of up to six meters occurred after Seroja hit the Savu Sea, south of East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s wind speed will pick up to 130 km per hour on Wednesday from 110 km per hour on Tuesday.

“The wind speed is indeed increasing, but the impact on Indonesia is getting weaker because it is moving away,” the agency’s head Dwikorita Karnawati said.

53,53,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Climate Change in the Developing World: The Drowning of Jakarta - The McGill International Review,https://www.mironline.ca/climate-change-in-the-developing-world-the-drowning-of-jakarta/,"Often called the world’s fastest sinking city, Jakarta — Indonesia’s capital and most populated urban area — sinks 10cm deeper into the earth each year. A variety of human-induced processes created this problem, but one in particular is pushing it to the brink of disaster: global warming. For this article, I interviewed some Indonesian relatives for their perspectives on the drowning of Jakarta, hoping to look into how climate change is most hurting the places least equipped to deal with its consequences.

I had the chance to visit Jakarta in the summer of 2019. The ground I was standing on when I took a picture of the city’s shoreline, shown below, has now sunk thirty to forty centimetres since my visit, relative to sea level. It does not sound like a lot — that is only the length of a ruler — but minor tweaks to the order of the natural world can translate into major disorder in the human one.

A city of 11 million people, 40 per cent of Jakarta currently sits below sea level — a number that grows each year. The fastest sinking rates occur in the coastal sector, North Jakarta, where the ground drops as much as 25cm annually. Life at negative altitudes is marked by vulnerability to extreme weather and flooding. In fact, parts of North Jakarta are already flooded for good. By 2050, at present rates, that entire quarter of the city — containing the same number of residents as Montreal — will be permanently swallowed by the Java Sea. According to one Jakartan relative I spoke with, floods have come to feel like “an annual event to us,” wreaking the most havoc from January to March — the monsoon season. In 2020, a new year’s day storm produced a flood that claimed the lives of 66 people and left a further 36,000 displaced.

Another Indonesian man I spoke with recalled floods damaging furniture and electronic devices in his sister’s Jakarta home. “Now whenever a flood is threatening, they raise the items off the floor and hang them from the ceiling.”

There are two main forces pushing Jakarta underwater. Both are man-made; both could be reversible. First, the majority of Jakartans rely on the extraction of groundwater for their daily water consumption. This is because the city’s water pipe infrastructure is outdated and can only sustain 40 per cent of residents’ demand. Hence, rather than looking to unreliable public agencies to supply tap water, most people resort to private ground pumps or wells, which extract water from deposits found dozens of metres below ground. Groundwater extraction is a common form of water subsistence — one-third of Canadians get water to their taps through this method. But when millions depend on groundwater extraction each and every day — a process which often goes unregulated in Indonesia — the earth under the city starts to deflate, and in turn Jakarta starts to sink.

According to hydrologists, Indonesian officials must commit to a full revamp of the city’s water supply infrastructure, constructing a new system that funnels rain and river water into man-made reservoirs connected to the city’s water pipes. In the late 1960s, groundwater extraction in Tokyo created a similar sinking crisis. Fortunately, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government implemented a combination of regulatory laws and infrastructure reform, stopping the sinking by the turn of the century.

Yet, a more daunting problem looms over Jakarta and the rest of the world. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels continue to intensify the planet’s greenhouse effect. The result — global warming — induces thermal expansion of the water that makes up Earth’s oceans and the melting of the ice that makes up Earth’s poles. For this reason, sea levels have been rising for over a century across the world. But especially in developing areas like Jakarta, marked by outdated infrastructure and less capital to invest in costly alternatives, rising sea levels blend with pre-existing problems like excessive groundwater extraction, and the result is that the intensity of the climate crisis is felt at a two-fold rate.

Local groundwater extraction is behind Jakarta’s sinking and must be slowed, but global warming is where the long-term humanitarian crises are contained. Indonesian President Joko Widodo invested in the construction of a giant seawall and 17 artificial islands in the Jakarta Bay to protect the city from storms and flooding as it continues to sink. Yet, rising sea levels mean that the Java Sea is slowly climbing on these blockades, rendering them increasingly ineffective at preventing disaster. Asking not to be referenced by name, the same man who told me about his sister’s flooding problems said, “Yes, right now a sea wall stops the seawater from inundating the city, [but] seawater could breach the wall at any time.” He believes that underfunding often results in half-baked infrastructural solutions to many of Indonesia’s safety concerns; a critique authorities do not always react well to when you remind them.

President Widodo’s 2019 decision to move the nation’s capital from Jakarta to the neighbouring island of Borneo foreshadows the long-term displacement, health, and economic predicaments that fester where underdevelopment meets climate change.

In 2007, a particularly strong storm left half of Jakarta flooded; 80 people lost their lives, 600,000 lost their homes, and taxpayers lost over $500 million USD to the recovery, taking away from development projects. Despite this devastation, the people I spoke with had no special memory of this incident; “many floods occur every year in Jakarta, it is numbing.”

In 30 years, when North Jakarta is submerged, what will have happened to the millions who live and work there today? “They will have to move to higher ground,” said one relative, plainly. An increased intensity of meteorological events puts mass displacement in the forecast. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America will generate 143 million climate migrants. While some will seek refuge internationally, most displacement will happen internally because, as UN researcher Arno Tanner highlights, “people whose livelihoods are most sensitive to environmental changes also tend to be those who do not have the means to move very far.” Ultimately then, the heaviest burden will be borne by the same countries experiencing the worst of the climate crisis in the first place.

The melting of polar ice is causing Jakarta to drown, but other developing nations are experiencing the polar opposite effect: drought. In Botswana, for instance, global warming has reduced total rainfall, leading to a drop in agricultural production and increasing food insecurity. In recent years, delegates at the UN General Assembly have warned that climate change is inhibiting countries from attaining their Sustainable Development Goals. The permanent flooding of North Jakarta would compromise $220 billion in assets, and would hinder productivity and economic growth, according to Indonesia’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Ultimately, the burning of fossil fuels is one of the global economy’s greatest market failures.

Today, a rather topical concern is also raised by climbing ocean levels: the spread of disease. The World Health Organization warns that when rapid flooding uproots sewage systems and carries their contents through the streets, there is a heightened risk of infectious disease spread. “Six common diseases to watch out for during floods,” read the front page of the Jakarta Post at the beginning of 2020.

As predicted, climate change is beginning to disproportionately impact the corners of the globe least equipped to face and finance its consequences. The drowning of Jakarta is ‘exhibit A’ to this process. And yet, the countries that bear the most responsibility for the creation of this crisis, in per capita terms, will likely bear the least of the burden. The carbon footprint of the average Canadian is about seven times greater than the average Jakartan’s, and yet some models predict that Canada could be one of few nations to actually benefit from global warming (as cultivable land and natural resource deposits thaw). Nonetheless, in a globalized world, mass displacement, economic stagnation, and the spread of disease — as we have seen first-hand — are threats which all nations have a shared interest in preventing. The worst of the climate crisis can be avoided if countries legitimately commit to their ‘long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies’ mandated by the 2016 Paris Agreement.

At least 70 deaths were reported in several islands in Indonesia's West and East Nusa Tenggara provinces, while 70 others were missing, after the cyclone brought flash floods, landslides and strong winds amid heavy rain over the weekend, disaster agency BNPB said.

In East Timor, which shares the Timor island with Indonesia, at least 27 people were killed by landslides, flash floods and a falling tree, while 7000 were displaced, its government said.

On Lembata island, authorities feared bodies had been washed away.

""We are using rubber boats to find bodies at sea. In several villages, flash floods hit while people were sleeping,"" Thomas Ola Langoday, deputy head of Lembata district government, told Reuters by phone.

About 30,000 people have been impacted by floods in Indonesia, some already taking shelter in evacuation centres, but rescue operations have been made difficult after five bridges collapsed and falling trees blocked some roads, BNPB spokesman Raditya Jati said.

A continuing storm had also halted evacuations in some places, local authorities said.

Hundreds of houses and other facilities such as a solar power plant were damaged, BNPB said. Ships and motor boats sank as the cyclone set off waves as high as 6 metres.

Powerful currents continued to flow through villages in the Malaka district on Timor island on Monday, even though the rain had stopped.

Some residents there hauled themselves to their roofs to escape flood water rising to 3-4 metres.

""We had to dismantle the zinc roof. We went out through the back door and pulled ourselves out with a rope,"" Agustina Luruk, 36, told Reuters as she and her three daughters waited to be evacuated by the side of a muddy road.

President Joko Widodo offered his condolences and ordered speedy disaster relief efforts.

The Seroja cyclone hit the Savu sea southwest of Timor island in the early hours of Monday, Indonesia's weather agency said.

Within 24 hours, the cyclone's intensity could strengthen, bringing yet more rain, waves and winds, although it was moving away from Indonesia, the agency said.","Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_675,q_auto,w_1200/arz384xxrv6dvobmwqx9","['cyclone', 'flash', 'bnpb', '97', 'island', 'indonesia', 'timor', 'east', 'rain', 'kills', 'floods', 'landslides']",

JAKARTA, Apr 7 2021 (IPS) - Residents of Ngadirejo village in Sukaharjo regency, Central Java province, had often found themselves helpless when their wells dried up or water flooded through their homes. But thanks to a national campaign called Program Kampung Iklim, known by its acronym ProKlim, they now have solutions to this flooding that generally occurs because of a lack of adequate water catchments.

“We started planting biopore holes and erecting infiltration wells in early 2016 to harvest rainwater and wastewater. The results have been almost instantaneous – our wells have never run out of water and floods never visited us again since 2017,” Serono Arief Wijaya told IPS from Ngadirejo, which lies around one-hour flight east of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.

As climate change hits home, Indonesia has frequently experienced drought and heavy rainfall, with reports of water scarcity, floods, landslides, and crop failures becoming common. In 2012, the government introduced Program Kampung Iklim, which literally means Climate Village Programme, to raise public awareness towards global warming and to assist people at grassroots level to draw up adaptation and mitigation plans.

While attending a seminar organised by the local office of Environment and Forestry Department in December 2015, leaders of Ngadirejo, according to Wijaya, heard the word global warming and ProKlim for the first time. The following year community leaders decided to plant biopore holes along Ngadirejo’s drainage network and build infiltration wells throughout the neighbourhood in adaptation and mitigation efforts.

“We now have around 600 biopore holes, each measuring one meter deep and eight centimetres wide, and 50 infiltration wells measuring one meter deep and three meters wide each,” said Wijaya, who heads Ngadirejo’s ProKlim campaign.

“Many residents who had access to piped water previously now harvest groundwater instead for their daily needs,” he added.

Up until 2016, only between 10 to 15 percent of Ngadirejo residents had access to piped water, with the remainder reliant on artesian wells only. According to 2020 figures, the village has some 3,000 families – slightly over 10,000 people.

Aside from harvesting rainwater, Ngadirejo residents have also been converting their organic waste into compost and are selling this to private companies. They are also planting vegetables in their backyards and on unused land as part of the community’s urban farming activity.

They also use LED light bulbs and automatic sensors to switch lights on or off when needed and have planted trees with the slogan “one-house-one-big-tree”.

“We have also designated a section of our village as a tourist destination and training centre where we explain our ProKlim actions to visitors or conduct training on how to make biopore holes, infiltration wells, fertiliser, or anything related to adaptation and mitigation actions,” Wijaya said.

Hardi Buhairat, a 50-year-old resident of Poleonro in Bone regency, South Sulawesi province — a three hour flight east of Jakarta — expressed a similar sentiment when talking about the ProKlim programme being implemented in his village.

“ProKlim has brought the Lita River back to life and we are very happy about that. The river is our only source of water for household consumption and farming but there were times it could no longer irrigate our field. Its water debit has returned and is stable throughout the year,” Buhairat, who is head of Poleonro’s ProKlim programme, told IPS.

The village started implementing ProKlim solutions in 2015, kicking it off with series of meetings with residents where they discussed climate change and the actions community members could take to avert its adverse impacts.

“The first things we did was issuing a village ordinance banning the residents from cutting trees and harvesting woods in and around Lita River’s spring. Soon after that, we planted thousands of trees in deforested areas around the spring,” said Buhairat, who is also Poleonro’s chief.

Poleonro’s village leaders also issued two other ordinances; one banning residents from burning rice straw and farms after harvest.

The 2019 Pollution and Health Metrics: Global, Regional and Country Analysis report from the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP) ranks Indonesia as 4th in the world in terms of annual premature pollution-related deaths, after the populous nations of India, China and Nigeria.

The second ordinance requires residents to replace any tree they cut down in customary forests.

“The latter ordinance allows them to harvest trees in their customary forests but also orders them to plant new trees to replace the ones they cut. To ensure that they comply the rule, we inspect their forests regularly,” Buhairat said.

The residents also planted biopore holes to store rainwater underground, built wells to filter household wastewater before it goes into the river, and treated waste, converting organic waste into compost.

“Since 2015, we encouraged the residents to have indoor toilets. We are glad all households now have their own toilets indoors,” Buhairat said.

Buhairat said Poleonro villagers have also begun to diversify their food crops as part of their food security action.

“Our farmers planted organic red rice for the first time in 2018. We are now looking for buyers before going on a large-scale production. We want organic red rice to be our specialty commodity,” he said.

Since ProKlim’s launch in 2012, over 2,700 villages in 33 provinces have been registered as climate villages, according to Sri Tantri Arundhati, Director of Climate Change Adaptation of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. In 2020, six of those villages, including Ngadirejo and Poleonro, received the ProKlim Lestari Trophy, the highest accolade for a climate village programme, from the ministry.

Arundhati said the government now aims to establish 20,000 climate villages, which constitute roughly 25 percent of the country’s 83,000 villages, by 2024.

“We will cooperate with other stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations and the private sector, and improve coordination with local governments and related departments. We will also work to improve the capacity of local governments and people at the grassroots level,” she told IPS.

Arundhati said her ministry has also asked registered climate villages to promote ProKlim and help other communities design their adaptation and mitigation actions.

Wijaya confirmed Ngadirejo village has been encouraged to help other communities implement ProKlim.

“We are now helping 44 villages in Central Java where we explain about global warming and help residents there identify adaptation and mitigation actions they could take to deal with climate change-related problems in their community,” Wijaya said.

Buhairat said Poleonro is now guiding 15 villages in South Sulawesi to become climate villages.

Rizaldi Boer of the state-owned Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) said ProKlim could help the government achieve the country’s nationally determined contribution (NDCs) agreed according to the Paris Agreement.

“The programme can help a lot in dealing with climate change as it encourages active participation of people at grassroots level,” said Boer, who is also director of the Centre for Climate Risk and Opportunity Management in Southeast Asia and Pacific.

“However, the government should establish a standardised report mechanism on ProKlim actions, particularly how to calculate its contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction,” Boer told IPS.

Under the country’s NDCs, Indonesia has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent with its own initiatives and 41 percent with external financial and technical assistance by 2030.

Boer also praised the government’s ambitious target of establishing 20,000 climate villages by 2024.

“It’s a tall order but it is not impossible. However, it requires participation of governments at all levels and all stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations and the private sector,” he said.","Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2021/04/Ngadirejo-residents-plant-their-backyards-and-iddle-lands-with-vegetables-as-part-of-their-food-security-actions-under-the-governments-ProKlim-program.-Courtesy-Serono-Arief-Wijaya-ProKlim-Ngadirejo-2.jpg,"['wells', 'ngadirejo', 'change', 'indonesias', 'mitigate', 'climate', 'villages', 'water', 'residents', 'adaptation', 'work', 'village', 'proklim', 'wijaya', 'communities']",

Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency has confirmed at least 67 people died in Sunday's incident.

Waowala village in Ile Ape sub-district was one of the affected villages where three people were found dead and 23 people missing.

Local resident Laurensius Lewo Purab said on Tuesday that the flash flood had been very sudden and had hit with a thundering sound.

""When I opened the door, lots of wood and stones hit my wife and me,"" said Purab.

More than 100, mostly women and children from Wainatan village, who were isolated due to flash floods, were evacuated to a temporary shelter in Napasabok village.

Based on reports from villagers, three people were killed and 24 people are still missing in Wainatan village.

Landslides and flooding from heavy rains from a tropical cyclone have killed at least 128 people across several islands in Indonesia and 27 people in East Timor.

Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced in the disasters, which could continue to worsen as the storm is expected to continue affecting the region for several days as it moves south toward Australia.

Huawei Tech Investment, also known as Huawei Indonesia, a local arm of the Chinese tech giant, has launched a series of campaigns to give back to the Indonesian community, recognizing a need to create shared value and support economic, social, and environmental progress.

Huawei had launched the “I Do” campaigns last year to tackle many issues, Jacky Chen, Huawei Indonesia's chief executive officer (CEO), said on Thursday.

“We have been rooted in this beautiful land for more than 20 years, and we’ve grown together with Indonesia and Indonesian people. At this new point, we want to give more in return than take,"" Chen said.

“Through “I Do Contribute,” we strive to find ways out through the latest technologies to accelerate Indonesian economic recovery in the post-pandemic scenario. We also launched a program to cultivate 100,000 Indonesian digital talents for 5 years to build a solid foundation for future-ready human capital,” he said.

A team of Huawei technicians took on the task to restore Jakarta's communication network early last year when the capital experienced the worst flooding in more than 154 years that saw 50 deaths and 170,000 displaced from their homes.

The initiative was under Huawei's ""I Do Care"" campaign that also provides relief aid for the flood victims.

“We shared our happiness to the needy during Ramadan by paying visits and donations to 30 orphanages in 15 cities across the archipelago,” Jacky said.

Under “I Do Collaborate,” Huawei worked with the government, business communities, and key stakeholders to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.

During the pandemic, Huawei's “I Do Create” campaign enhanced government institutions', enterprises', and hospitals' operation with the implementation of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and cloud computing platform.

The company had also given more than 1,000 cloud accounts for free to 500 universities across Indonesia to support the “Never Stop Learning” initiative in distant learning and digital transformation, Chen said.","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2021/04/1617248239.jpg,"['huawei', 'digital', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'tech', 'launched', 'shared', 'transformation', 'support', 'chen']",

East Flores district on Adonara island suffered the highest losses with 67 bodies recovered so far and six missing. Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills early on Sunday, catching people at sleep. Some were swept away by flash floods after overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks.

On nearby Lembata island, the downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja sent solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November to crash down on more than a dozen villages, killing at least 32 and leaving 35 unaccounted for, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.

Hundreds of police, soldiers and residents dug through the debris with their bare hands, shovels and hoes searching for those buried. Relatives wailed Wednesday as they watched rescuers pull out a mud-caked body, place it on a bamboo stretcher and take it away for burial.

“Please find my father and mother who are still buried … whatever their condition,” Suzanna Tasoin cried to rescuers struggling to dig up tons of volcanic materials and rocks with farm tools at Waimatan village on Lembata island, “We want to bury them with the respect they deserve.”

In all, landslides and flooding have killed at least 140 across several islands in Indonesia as well as 27 people in neighboring East Timor. Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced by the weather, which is expected to continue until at least Friday as the storm moves south toward Australia.

Rescue efforts were being hampered by the rains and the remoteness of the area, where roads and bridges were damaged in many places.

Rescue personnel with excavators and tons of food and medicine were being deployed from Makassar city on Sulawesi island, but were hindered by bad weather and extremely high waves.

Five helicopters were helping to reach isolated areas of the islands, National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo told reporters late Wednesday.

He said evacuees were in dire need of basic necessities such as blankets, mats, tents, baby food and medical services.

The government provided tens of thousands of anti-coronavirus masks, and Monardo said authorities would set up health posts at refugee camps to test people for the virus.

He said six navy ships, including a hospital ship, carrying more goods were expected to arrive on Friday to relieve overwhelmed hospitals and clinics in East Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia’s poorest provinces.","Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.claimsjournal.com/app/uploads/2015/12/cropped-claimsjournal-32x32.png,"['rains', 'thousands', 'national', '140', 'volcanic', 'tons', 'missing', 'indonesia', 'rises', 'island', 'weather', 'death', 'dozens', 'toll', 'lembata', 'rescuers', 'landslides']",

Helicopters have been deployed to help the search while ships carrying food, water, blankets and medicine have reached ports previously blocked by high waves whipped up by tropical cyclone Seroja, which brought heavy rain and triggered deadly floods and landslides on Sunday. Indonesia's disaster agency BNPB revised the death toll upwards in the East Nusa Tenggara islands, after earlier saying 86 had died. A total of 76 people were still missing. ""The rescue team is moving on the ground. The weather is good,"" BNPB spokesman Raditya Jati told a news briefing. Search and rescue personnel, however, had trouble transporting heavy equipment for use in the search. ""Search for victims is constrained, the existing heavy equipment cannot be sent to their destination, especially in Adonara and Alor,"" the head of BNPB, Doni Monardo, said. The Adonara and Alor islands were among the islands worst hit by the cyclone, with 62 and 21 people dead respectively. Aerial images from Adonara on Tuesday showed brown mud and flood water covering a vast area, burying houses, roads and trees. The military and volunteers arrived on the islands on Tuesday and were setting up public kitchens, while medical workers were brought in. Video taken by a local official in Tanjung Batu village on Lembata, home to the Ile Lewotolok volcano, showed felled trees and large rocks of cold lava that had crushed homes after being dislodged by the cyclone. Thousands of people have been displaced, nearly 2000 buildings including a hospital were impacted, and more than 100 homes heavily damaged by the cyclone. Two people died in nearby West Nusa Tenggara province. There were also concerns about possible COVID-19 infections in crowded evacuation centres. In neighbouring East Timor, at least 33 were killed in floods and landslides and by falling trees. Civil defence authorities were using heavy equipment to search for survivors. ""The number of victims could still increase because many victims have not been found,"" the main director of civil protection, Ismael da Costa Babo, told Reuters. ""They were buried by landslides and carried away by floods."" Some residents of Lembata island may have also been washed away by mud into the sea. A volcano that erupted on Lembata last month wiped out vegetation atop the mountain, which allowed hardened lava to slide towards 300 houses when the cyclone struck, a senior district official said, hoping help was on the way. ""We were only able to search on the seashore, not in the deeper area, because of lack of equipment yesterday,"" Thomas Ola Langoday told Reuters by phone. He feared many bodies were still buried under large rocks. President Joko Widodo urged his cabinet to speed up evacuation and relief efforts and to restore power. Weather agency head Dwikorita Karnawati said once-rare tropical cyclones were happening more often in Indonesia and climate change could be to blame. ""Seroja is the first time we're seeing tremendous impact because it hit the land. It's not common,"" she said. Australian Associated Press

A former school teacher, Samsudin has now dedicated his life to conservation and uses puppetry and storytelling to spread his message to the young about the importance of protecting mangroves in an area suffering massive coastal erosion.

""To keep tides from hitting us, we plant mangroves, forests for animals and oxygen for us to live. I weave everything into my stories,"" said Samsudin, 50, as he mused how some people in the area saw mangroves as a ""nuisance"" and would pull them out.

Indonesia is home to more than a fifth of the world's mangrove forests, which naturally help keep out high tidal waters. But for years, coastal communities have chopped down trees to clear the way for fish and shrimp farms, and for rice paddies.

Samsudin teaches local children aged 11 to 15 three times a week about how to look after the environment, sometimes illustrating it with puppets of monkeys and orangutans.

Samsudin, who uses one name, reckons he has helped plant 700 hectares in the area.

While his efforts are locally focused, the issue has reached national attention and Indonesia recently embarked on one of the world's biggest campaigns to restore mangroves, targeting 150,000 hectares annually across nine provinces up to 2024.

Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, has about 3.3 million hectares of mangrove, with more than 600,000 hectares in critical condition, Hartono, the chief of the mangrove restoration body, told Reuters.

Data from Indonesia's forestry ministry from 2017 estimates more than 1.8 million hectares of mangroves are damaged.

Hartono, who goes by one name like many Indonesians, said the main causes of the degradation in Indonesia were illegal logging and land conversion.

Cukup Rudiyanto, another activist in Indramayu who plants mangroves, also blames a lack of sedimentation in this coastal area east of the capital Jakarta for harming mangroves.

For Samsudin, teaching about the issue is a labour of love, even though he admits some in his own family question why he devotes so much time to it.

But for 12-year-old Muhammad Jefri, one of Samsudin's students, the lessons resonate.

""There will be no Mudik in 2021,"" Culture Minister Muhadjir Effendy says. Many head to hometowns in time, known as Mudik, for celebrations at the end of Islam's holy fasting month.

Muslim majority Indonesia has banned an annual exodus that sees millions travel across the vast nation to mark the end of Ramadan over fears of a surge in Covid-19 infections.

""There will be no Mudik in 2021,"" Culture Minister Muhadjir Effendy said in a statement on Friday, citing fears of spreading the virus and inoculation efforts.

But he added that some may get exemptions for ""urgent travel,"" without elaborating.

Travellers pack into airports, train stations, and ports across the nearly 5,000-km long archipelago in a mass migration, known as Mudik, that is similar to China's Lunar New Year holiday or Christmas.

One of the worst-hit nations in Asia

Many head to hometowns in time for celebrations at the end of Islam's holy fasting month, a festival known as Eid al Fitr.

Ramadan ends in mid-May this year.

The government said it was banning the exodus as Indonesia, one of the worst-hit nations in Asia, rolls out a massive inoculation campaign.

The country earlier announced an ambitious target to vaccinate more than 181 million of its nearly 270 million people within a year.

Loopholes in rules

Fearing a public health disaster, the government last year slapped a ban on domestic sea and air travel and set up roadblocks to stop the cross-country movement.

But many took advantage of loopholes in the rules, as well as relying on people smugglers and bogus travel documents, to get around the ban.

Indonesia has officially reported nearly 1.5 million infections and more than 40,000 deaths.

But low testing rates mean the crisis is believed to be much more severe than those figures suggest.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A news conference was held in Jacksonville Thursday to announce an update in a lawsuit against Publix that involves its reported use of off-duty uniformed police to work in its stores.

Attorney Ben Crump and co-counsels Steve Combs and Jamie Holland hosted the event on behalf of Tawanda Crowell.

The legal team alleges that Publix hires off-duty uniformed police to work in its stores but doesn't provide any training specific to working in a retail environment.

The legal team said that Crowell, a black woman, went into a Publix store and bought dinner for her goddaughter that she was raising, as well as her nieces.

When she returned to her car she was reportedly accosted by one of these armed police officers.

JSO identified the officer as Officer K. Munger.

Crowell reportedly told the officer that he lacked probable cause to ask for her grocery receipt and she did not give it to him. She was shocked with a Taser and knocked to the ground in front of her young goddaughter and nieces, the lawsuit alleges.

Crump says that although the arresting officer found the receipt verifying her purchase of the food, she was still arrested and was jailed for 24 hours.

The legal team announced that it will be investigating Publix’s use of armed police officers, allegations that the grocer doesn't provide additional training to off-duty officers.

Publix's communications director for Florida writes to First Coast News in an email: ""We do not comment on pending litigation.""

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office responded with this statement:

This incident and actions by the officer were investigated by the Internal Affairs Unit by way of a formal complaint. Officer K. Munger’s actions were cleared by way of the body-worn camera video.

The divers found the monk at 10.30am on Wednesday (April 7) in the Tham Phra Sai Ngam cave in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park. He was missing since April 2.

The monk is said to be safe and has only low fever.

The rescue team plans to get him to dive out of the flooded cave if “he is strong” enough for the task. However, if he is too weak, the rescuers will attempt to pump water out of the cave before bringing him out.

The incident brings to mind the case of the “Wild Boars” football team consisting of 12 boys and their coach, who were trapped in the flooded Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai for 17 days from June 23 to July 10,2018.

The 13 were later fitted out in full-face breathing masks and sedated before being pulled to safety through a hazardous underwater labyrinth.

Police said he was believed to have been electrocuted on Sunday.

Kota Kinabalu Acting OCPD Supt George Rakman said the body of the unidentified man was found amid wire cables, holding on to live wires.

“According to witnesses, they heard shouts from behind the factory at about 3am but did not go to check, ” he said.

He said factory workers only saw the body in the drain later, which prompted them to inform their supervisor.

Supt George said an inspection at the site found many wires hidden in the ground and in the drains, believed to have been used by squatters from the nearby Kg Lembaga Padi settlement.

“We are investigating the cause of death and awaiting the forensic report, ” he said.

Meanwhile, Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) appealed to the public to inform them of illegal power connection activities due to continuous power thefts despite various efforts to counter it.

SESB senior general manager (asset management) Norhizami Abu Hasan said SESB has been conducting scheduled checks for power thefts and integrated crackdowns at high-risk areas and places where such activities were known to be rampant.

“But we still get reports of power thefts, ” he said in response to the electrocution incident.

Norhizami said such acts did not only affect SESB but also disrupted power supply to thousands of customers.

“We will continue our operations against power thefts but we are also appealing for more public assistance, so that we can better combat this crime, ” he added.

He said the public could file complaints or provide tip-offs to SESB’s toll-free number at 15454.

Norhizami said power theft was not only confined to squatter colonies but also done by factory operators, hotels and individuals.

“There are also houseowners ‘supplying and selling’ electricity illegally through their own power supply, ” he added.

He said SESB would continue to have more awareness programmes on the issue through corporate social programmes via the print and electronic media and other means.

He reminded the public that power theft was an offence under the law and offenders could be jailed or fined upon conviction.","Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['activities', 'power', 'programmes', 'thief', 'public', 'suspected', 'theft', 'thefts', 'sesb', 'factory', 'body', 'supply', 'dead', 'electricity']",

A wastewater reservoir near Tampa is at great risk of collapsing and flooding the area with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic water.

In response, residents near the reservoir have been ordered to evacuate as crews work to pump water out and avoid a deluge.

So far, 316 homes have been evacuated and state authorities have closed a number of roads.

“What we are looking at now is trying to prevent and respond to, if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday.

However, the mood is more hopeful than previous days.

“Looking at the water that has been removed and the somewhat stability of the current breach, I think the team is much more comfortable today than we were yesterday,” Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said.

“We are not out of the critical area yet,” he added.

Earlier Sunday, crews feared that as much as 340 million gallons could gush out, but that number has fallen below 300 million and is expected to continue dropping as the risk of a flood decreases.

Currently about 22,000 gallons of water are being discharged per minute, and Hopes said he expects the risk of collapse to decrease by Tuesday.

State officials said no sources of drinking water were at risk.

78,78,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Seriously ugly: here's how Australia will look if the world heats by 3°C this century - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/seriously-ugly-heres-how-australia-will-look-if-the-world-heats-by-3-c-this-century-157875,"Imagine, for a moment, a different kind of Australia. One where bushfires on the catastrophic scale of Black Summer happen almost every year. One where 50℃ days in Sydney and Melbourne are common. Where storms and flooding have violently reshaped our coastlines, and unique ecosystems have been damaged beyond recognition – including the Great Barrier Reef, which no longer exists.

Frighteningly, this is not an imaginary future dystopia. It’s a scientific projection of Australia under 3℃ of global warming – a future we must both strenuously try to avoid, but also prepare for.

The sum of current commitments under the Paris climate accord puts Earth on track for 3℃ of warming this century. Research released today by the Australian Academy of Science explores this scenario in detail.

The report, which we co-authored with colleagues, lays out the potential damage to Australia. Unless the world changes course and dramatically curbs greenhouse gas emissions, this is how bad it could get.

A spotlight on the damage

Nations signed up to the Paris Agreement collectively aim to limit global warming to well below 2℃ this century and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5℃. But on current emissions-reduction pledges, global temperatures are expected to far exceed these goals, reaching 2.9℃ by 2100.

Australia is the driest inhabited continent, and already has a highly variable climate of “droughts and flooding rains”. This is why of all developed nations, Australia has been identified as one of the most vulnerable to climate change.

The damage is already evident. Since records began in 1910, Australia’s average surface temperature has warmed by 1.4℃, and its open ocean areas have warmed by 1℃. Extreme events – such as storms, droughts, bushfires, heatwaves and floods – are becoming more frequent and severe.

Today’s report brings together multiple lines of evidence such as computer modelling, observed changes and historical paleoclimate studies. It gives a picture of the damage that’s already occurred, and what Australia should expect next. It shines a spotlight on four sectors: ecosystems, food production, cities and towns, and health and well-being.

In all these areas, we found the impacts of climate change are profound and accelerating rapidly.

1. Ecosystems

Australia’s natural resources are directly linked to our well-being, culture and economic prosperity. Warming and changes in climate have already eroded the services ecosystems provide, and affected thousands of species.

The problems extend to the ocean, which is steadily warming. Heat stress is bleaching and killing corals, and severely damaging crucial habitats such as kelp forests and seagrass meadows. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere, seawater is reaching record acidity levels, harming marine food webs, fisheries and aquaculture.

At 3℃ of global warming by 2100, oceans are projected to absorb five times more heat than the observed amount accumulated since 1970. Being far more acidic than today, ocean oxygen levels will decline at ever-shallower depths, affecting the distribution and abundance of marine life everywhere. At 1.5-2℃ warming, the complete loss of coral reefs is very likely.

Under 3℃ warming, global sea levels are projected to rise 40-80 centimetres, and by many more metres over coming centuries. Rising sea levels are already inundating low-lying coastal areas, and saltwater is intruding into freshwater wetlands. This leads to coastal erosion that amplifies storm impacts and affects both ecosystems and people.

Land and freshwater environments have been damaged by drought, fire, extreme heatwaves, invasive species and disease. An estimated 3 billion vertebrate animals were killed or displaced in the Black Summer bushfires. Some 24 million hectares burned, including 80% of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and 50% of Gondwana rainforests. At 3℃ of warming, the number of extreme fire days could double.

Some species are shifting to cooler latitudes or higher elevations. But most will struggle to keep up with the unprecedented rate of warming. Critical thresholds in many natural systems are likely to be exceeded as global warming reaches 1.5℃. At 2℃ and beyond, we’re likely to see the complete loss of coral reefs, and inundation of iconic ecosystems such as the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park.

At 3℃ of global warming, Australia’s present-day ecological systems would be unrecognisable. The first documented climate-related global extinction of a mammal, the Bramble Cay melomys from the Torres Strait, is highly unlikely to be the last. Climate change is predicted to increase extinction rates by several orders of magnitude.

Degradation of Australia’s unique ecosystems will harm the tourism and recreation industries, as well as our food security, health and culture.

There are ways to reduce the climate risk for ecosystems – many of which also benefit humans. For example, preserving and restoring mangroves protects our coasts from storms, increases carbon storage and retains fisheries habitat.

2. Food production

Australian agriculture and food security already face significant risks from droughts, heatwaves, fires, floods and invasive species. At 2℃ or more of global warming, rainfall will decline and droughts in areas such as southeastern and southwestern Australia will intensify. This will reduce water availability for irrigated agriculture and increase water prices.

Heat stress affects livestock welfare, reproduction and production. Projected temperature and humidity changes suggest livestock will experience many more heat stress days each year. More frequent storms and heavy rainfall are likely to worsen erosion on grazing land and may lead to livestock loss from flooding.

Heat stress and reduced water availability will also make farms less profitable. A 3℃ global temperature increase would reduce yields of key crops by between 5% and 50%. Significant reductions are expected in oil seeds (35%), wheat (18%) and fruits and vegetables (14%).

Climate change also threatens forestry in hotter, drier regions such as southwestern Australia. There, the industry faces increased fire risks, changed rainfall patterns and growing pest populations. In cooler regions such as Tasmania and Gippsland, forestry production may increase as the climate warms. Existing plantations would change substantially under 3℃ warming.

As ocean waters warm, distributions and stock levels of commercial fish species are continuing to change. This will curb profitability. Many aquaculture fisheries may fundamentally change, relocate or cease to exist.

These changes may cause fisheries workers to suffer unemployment, mental health issues (potentially leading to suicides) and other problems. Strategic planning to create new business opportunities in these regions may reduce these risks.

3. Cities and towns

Almost 90% of Australians live in cities and towns and will experience climate change in urban environments.

Under a sea level rise of 1 metre by the end of the century – a level considered plausible by federal officials – between 160,000 and 250,000 Australian properties and infrastructure are at risk of coastal flooding.

Strategies to manage the risk include less construction in high-risk areas, and protecting coastal land with sea walls, sand dunes and mangroves. But some coastal areas may have to be abandoned.

Extreme heat, bushfires and storms put strain on power stations and infrastructure. At the same time, more energy is needed for increased air conditioning use. Much of Australia’s electricity generation relies on ageing and unreliable coal-fired power stations. Extreme weather can also disrupt and damage the oil and gas industries. Diversifying energy sources and improving infrastructure will be important to ensure reliable energy supplies.

The insurance and financial sector is becoming increasingly aware of climate risk and exposure. Insurance firms face increased claims due to climate-related disasters including floods, cyclones and mega-fires. Under some scenarios, one in every 19 property owners face unaffordable insurance premiums by 2030. A 3℃ world would render many more properties and businesses uninsurable.

Cities and towns, however, can be part of the climate solution. High-density urban living leads to a lower per capita greenhouse gas emission “footprint”. Also, innovative solutions are easier to implement in urban environments.

Passive cooling techniques, such as incorporating more plants and street trees during planning, can reduce city temperatures. But these strategies may require changes to stormwater management and can take time to work.

4. Human health and well-being

A 3℃ world threatens human health, livelihoods and communities. The elderly, young, unwell, and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are at most risk.

Heatwaves on land and sea are becoming longer, more frequent and severe. For example, at 3℃ of global warming, heatwaves in Queensland would happen as often as seven times a year, lasting 16 days on average. These cause physiological heat stress and worsen existing medical conditions.

Bushfire-related health impacts are increasing, causing deaths and exacerbating pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung disease. Tragically, we saw this unfold during Black Summer. These extreme conditions will increase at 2℃ and further at 3℃, causing direct and indirect physical and mental health issues.

Under 3℃ warming, climate damage to businesses will likely to lead to increased unemployment and possibly higher suicide rates, mental health issues and health issues relating to heat stress.

At 3°C global warming, many locations in Australia would be very difficult to inhabit due to projected water shortages.

As weather patterns change, transmission of some infectious diseases, such as Ross River virus, will become more intense. “Tropical” diseases may spread to more temperate areas across Australia.

Strategies exist to help mitigate these effects. They include improving early warning systems for extreme weather events and boosting the climate resilience of health services. Nature-based solutions, such as increasing green spaces in urban areas, will also help.

How to avoid catastrophe

The report acknowledges that limiting global temperatures to 1.5℃ this century is now extremely difficult. Achieving net-zero global emissions by 2050 is the absolute minimum required to to avoid the worst climate impacts.

Australia is well positioned to contribute to this global challenge. We have a well-developed industrial base, skilled workforce and vast sources of renewable energy.

But Australia must also pursue far more substantial emissions reduction. Under the Paris deal, we’ve pledged to reduce emissions by 26-28% between 2005 and 2030. Given the multiple and accelerating climate threats Australia faces, we must scale up this pledge. We must also display the international leadership and collaboration required to set Earth on a safer climate trajectory.

Our report recommends Australia immediately do the following:

join global leaders in increasing actions to urgently tackle and solve climate change develop strategies to meet the challenges of extreme events that are increasing in intensity, frequency and scale improve our understanding of climate impacts, including tipping points and the compounding effects of multiple stressors at global warming of 2℃ or more systematically explore how food production and supply systems should prepare for climate change better understand the impacts and risks of climate change for the health of Australians introduce policies to deliver deep and rapid cuts in emissions across the economy scale up the development and implementation of low- to zero-emissions technologies review Australia’s capacity and flexibility to take up innovations and technology breakthroughs for transitioning to a low-emissions future develop a better understanding of climate solutions through dialogue with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples – particularly strategies that helped people manage Australian ecosystems for tens of thousands of years continue to build adaptation strategies and greater commitment for meeting the challenges of change already in the climate system.

We don’t have much time to avert catastrophe. This decade must be transformational, and one where we choose a safer future.

TAIPEI: Taiwanese rescuers were trying on Monday to retrieve the last body of a passenger from wreckage of a deadly train crash last week.

Fifty people have been confirmed dead after a packed express train carrying almost 500 passengers and crew slammed into a truck near the eastern city of Hualien on Friday, causing it to derail and the front end to crumple. It was the island's worst rail accident in seven decades.

The truck had slid down a sloping road from a building site onto the tracks just outside a tunnel. Officials suspect the truck's brakes were not properly applied and are investigating the manager of the site.

Hualien's fire department said that the remaining body was trapped under a 15-tonne train bogie. It did not provide details on the identity of the passenger.

""The rescue is difficult, and we are currently discussing how to overcome these difficulties, so the time it takes may be delayed,"" the department said.

Transport Minister Lin Chia-lung said late on Sunday that he took responsibility for the accident and would step down once initial rescue and recovery work was complete.

The victims include two Americans and one French national.

Taiwan's government has promised compensation and said it would do everything it could to help survivors and their relatives, including coordinating public donations.

The damaged section of the track is not expected to reopen until April 20 at the earliest, though rail traffic continues on a parallel track that runs through another tunnel and was not affected by the accident.

The crash occurred at the start of a long weekend for the traditional Tomb Sweeping Day, when people return home to tend to family graves.

Taiwan has no domestic travel curbs, as the COVID-19 pandemic is well under control, with only 40 active cases in hospitals.

Taiwan's worst train crash was in 1948, when 64 people are estimated to have died in a fire.

Migrants are processed at the intake area of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, the main detention center for unaccompanied children in the Rio Grande Valley, in Donna, Texas, Tuesday, March 30, 2021. (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills, Pool) Credit: The Associated Press

DONNA, Texas (AP) — The Biden administration for the first time Tuesday allowed journalists inside its main border detention facility for migrant children, revealing a severely overcrowded tent structure where more than 4,000 people, including children and families, were crammed into a space intended for 250 and the youngest were kept in a large play pen with mats on the floor for sleeping.

With thousands of children and families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent weeks and packing facilities, President Joe Biden has been under pressure to bring more transparency to the process. U.S. Customs and Border Protection allowed two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS to tour the facility in Donna, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, the nation's busiest corridor for illegal crossings.

More than 4,100 people were being housed on the property Tuesday. Most were unaccompanied children processed in tents before being taken to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor.

The children were being housed by the hundreds in eight ""pods"" formed by plastic dividers, each about 3,200 square feet (297 square meters) in size. Many of the pods had more than 500 children in them.

Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the U.S. Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley, said 250 to 300 kids enter daily and far fewer leave.

The youngest children — among them, 3-year-old girl being cared for by her 11-year-old brother and a newborn with a 17-year-old mother — are kept out of the pods and sleep in a playpen area.

On Tuesday, journalists watched children being processed. They went into a small room for lice inspection and a health check. Their hair was hosed down and towels were tossed in a black bin marked “Lice.” The kids — many of whom have made long journeys to get to the border, including stretches on foot — were also checked for scabies, fever and other ailments. No COVID-19 test was administered unless a child showed symptoms.

Nurse practitioners also gave psychological tests, asking children if they had suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces were removed to avoid harm to anyone.

The children were then led down a green turf hall to a large intake room. Those 14 and older are fingerprinted and have their photo taken; younger children did not.

They went to a second intake room where they got notices to appear for immigration court. Border Patrol agents asked them if they had a contact in the U.S. and allowed the child to call that person.

Children were given bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered and medical conditions.

Outside the facility, the roar of construction equipment could be heard along with air conditioning units.

The Biden administration has continued expelling adults who try to cross the border under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S.

Biden has declined to resume the Trump-era practice of expelling unaccompanied immigrant children. Several hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. In some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually.

The Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than Health and Human Services is placing with U.S. sponsors, leading to a severe backlog in the system. The Border Patrol generally is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but Health and Human Services lacks space.

More than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days.

HHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere.

Biden has been sharply criticized by Republicans seeking to defend Trump's immigration record, which includes the separation of thousands of immigrant families under a “zero tolerance"" policy.","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 19:23:15 GMT",https://cdn.s3-media.wbal.com/Media/2021/03/30/21248b8d-f133-4272-aa30-8d58c403483e/thumb-400.jpg,"['biden', 'crowded', '4000', 'border', 'health', 'migrants', 'patrol', 'families', 'kids', 'facility', 'texas', 'children', 'valley']",

Both young cattle and breeding cattle numbers were significantly reduced.

The widespread recent rain across many key cattle producing regions has seen a consolidation in demand for light and young cattle at historically high levels, as available supplies plummeted. Rainfall through central and southern Queensland, with extensive flooding in NSW, has created significant supply and logistics issues, which is likely to be maintained for some weeks, impacting the ability to move stock off farm.

With the sharp contraction in supplies, prices were up across some steer categories, but mixed for young heifers and the assessed joined females.

Across the three mid-weight steer categories, supplies contracted 57pc for 200-280kg steers, 50pc for 280-330kg steers and 27pc for the 330-400kg lines, with the clearance rates very high, at between 88pc and 94pc. Despite the large contraction in supplies and high clearance rates, prices were only marginally higher, compared to last week’s larger gains, averaging between 14c and 18c/kg higher in these three categories. In the lightest (less than 200kg) and heaviest (+400kg) steer categories, prices fell, by 10c/kg and 20c/kg on average, respectively.

The constrained increase or decline in prices, compared to the sharp decline in offerings, possibly indicates that buyers have reached their upper limit for the lighter lines.

For a very limited supply of young heifers, c/kg prices were mixed, with the lighter lines (less than 200kg and 200-280kg) lifting 45c and 9c/kg respectively, while medium weights (280-330kg and 330-400kg) both fell, by 6c and 31c/kg. For the two largest categories, 200-280kg and 280-330kg, numbers offered this week were back 59pc and 26pc, respectively.

Among young cattle highlights, 108 Angus weaned steers 8-9 months averaging 312 kg from the Shea family, Barfold Beef, Barfold VIC made 606c/kg or $1890. Other lines from the same vendor also sold well, including 27 lighter Angus weaned steers 245 kg, making 659c; 79 Angus weaned heifers, 8-9 months averaging 290kg selling for 531.4c/kg; and 27 lighter heifers 234 kg making 584.6c.

Among specialised young cattle lines sold this week, 106 Wagyu x Angus F1 mixed sex weaners 6-7 months 257kg from Derrinallum VIC made 804.2c/kg live, or $2070 a head.

A very thin breeding market saw only significant numbers offered for PTIC heifers (1859 head), PTIC cows (938 head) and NSM cows with CAF (697 head). The 33pc decline in the PTIC heifer numbers for the week contributed to a $180 increase in price, to average $2418, at an 85pc clearance rate.

Prices as at 2pm, Friday 26 March.

The regular AuctionsPlus Commercial Cattle sale next week will be held a day early due to Easter on Thursday. The catalogue closes at 9am Wednesday, 31 March.

Young cattle price more than doubles at weaner sale

Despite high rainfall across a number of key production areas pushing down the number of stock offered, fierce demand for young cattle, particularly females, ensured high prices at feature regional sales covered by StockLive online bidding over the last week.

The annual Central Tablelands Livestock Exchange Blue Ribbon Weaner Sale held on Friday, mirrored the national trend experienced at January weaner and calf sales of the heifer price inching closer, or surpassing, the rate paid for steers.

A pen of Angus heifers, which will be sent back to the paddock as future breeders for the buyers, was the sale topper, reaching $2050/head for vendor Clowes Duncan.

On average, the heifer category, which attracted the bulk of online bidding from 33 buyers and 245 viewers, made $1725/head, to be more than double last year’s result of $764/head.

For steers, this year’s sale average of $1800/head was up from $960 in 2020.

Cattle from the Eastern areas which were unable to be transported due to wet weather will now be offered at the CTLX Autumn Classic on the 9 April where StockLive will again be active.

Also last Friday, the Tamworth Regional Livestock Exchange held the Virbac Weaner Challenge and Feature Cattle Sale where the yarding was also impacted by widespread rainfall.

In total, 32 buyers and 129 viewers were logged in via Stocklive, with the bulk of online traffic targeting lighter heifers.

Further south, at the South-West Victoria Livestock Exchange in Warrnambool, StockLive delivered robust competition for a quality yarding of 1753 head at the sale on 26 March.

StockLive buyers participated across more than 20 percent of the yarding, and there was a flurry of competition coming out of the NSW production areas that have received decent rainfall.

In keeping with the trends seen at other selling centres, Stocklive buyers were extremely active in the heifer market, and delivered strong competition for the steers on offer.

Overall, 21 Stocklive buyers bid across 51 lots with lines secured online by NSW and Victorian producers.

A volume buyer purchased 132 head, including 30 steers and 102 heifers.

Strong results at bull sales

Meanwhile, there have been early indicators online selling platforms will continue to drive clearance rates in the seedstock sector, and will represent a meaningful amount of the buyer competition this bull sale season.

Elite Livestock Auctions (ELA) simulcast a total of six sales during the week, including the sale of 32 lots at the Raff Angus Autumn Bull Sale.

Across the auction, 62pc of the overall buying pool was made up of ELA buyers who secured 16 lots of the 20 which attracted online bidding. Highlights included volume buyers Michael and Maggie Caskey, Mitchell, purchasing seven bulls, while the highest price paid online was $13,000 paid by Rob and Carly Johnstone, Banana, for Raff Knightrider.

ELA also simulcast Trail West – Australia’s Classic Texas Longhorn Sale in Roma on Saturday where 46 of 50 lots were bid on online. In total, 22 lots were knocked down to buyers bidding remotely from the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales.

Strong results on Farmgate online auctions

Meanwhile Farmgate online auctions reports strong trading results during March, with a number of diversified quality offerings presented throughout the month.

Clearance rates have been positive, at up to 95pc and prices consistent with the current competitive market.

Buyers across all sectors remain watchful of the offerings on FarmGate Auctions and it was at the most recent store feeder sale that the private buying sector led the charge ahead of traditional stock agent buyers.

Overall the highlight of the month was an offering from reputable South Australian commercial and stud Angus breeder, Illa-Langi. It was the second year in a row the bull sale was conducted by FarmGate Auctions. The online sale achieved a sale average of $5875 for eight bulls sold to online buyers, for a top price of $12,000.

Cecilio Rios-Quiñones, 38, and his brother, 23-year-old Ricardo Rios-Quiñones, received 5 1/2 years each in U.S. District Court in San Diego.

They pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and other charges.

Prosecutors said the men, who are from Chihuahua, led the women across the border on Feb. 10, 2020, and were in a rugged area near Mount Laguna, about a dozen miles north of the border, when a snowstorm struck. The woman, from Oaxaca, died from hypothermia.

The women, who came from poor rural areas and were seeking better lives, lacked proper clothing or supplies for a journey of several days through rain and snow, authorities said.

Defense attorneys argued that the brothers were only paid to be guides and hadn’t expected such severe weather. They huddled with the women, trying to keep them warm, and one finally hiked down the mountain to find a spot for cellphone reception to call 911, attorneys said.

A U.S. Border Patrol search and rescue unit found Margarita Santos Arce, 32; and Paula Santos Arce, 29, dead. Juana Santos Arce, 35, died later.

“It is tragic that someone wants to come here to work and dies, but it is more tragic that there are people who benefit from this, who treat them like cargo,” U.S. District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo said at the sentencing.

Cecilio Rios-Quiñones is regretful and “will forever live with the guilt of having been part of a criminal act that killed three women,” his attorney, Michelle Betancourt, wrote in a sentencing memo, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

“I am a man of faith and I am very remorseful for what I did,” Ricardo Rios-Quiñones wrote in a letter to the judge. “We weren’t prepared for the storm and I would have never participated in this if I would have known someone would end up hurt or dead.”","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2021/04/border-patrol-vehicle-along-a-border-wall-e1617573085795.jpg,"['wrote', 'border', 'mountain', 'ricardo', 'women', 'left', 'arce', 'smugglers', 'sentenced', 'sisters', 'riosquiñones', 'san', 'dead', 'tragic', 'santos', 'journey']",

Basketball legend Magic Johnson receives the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in Los Angeles on March 24, 2021: the company is now seeking FDA approval for the vaccine's use in 12-15 years olds

WASHINGTON - Pfizer-BioNTech asked for authorization Friday to use their Covid-19 vaccine on 12-15 year olds in the United States.

The companies said in a statement that they plan to make similar requests of other regulatory authorities worldwide in coming days.

Their request to the Food and Drug Administration in the US comes after Phase 3 clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 12-15 year olds were 100 pc effective in warding off the disease, according to the companies.

In late March they published the results of trials carried out with 2,260 adolescents in the US who the companies said showed ""robust anti-body responses.""

The vaccine was ""well tolerated with side effects generally consistent with those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age,"" the companies said Friday.

For now the vaccine has emergency authorization for use in people 16 and older.

Children are less likely to develop severe Covid so vaccinating them has been less of a priority than getting older people inoculated.

The BioNTech/Pfizer shot is based on novel mRNA technology and was the first Covid-19 vaccine to be approved in the West late last year.","Sat, 10 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20210410/c1_3944071_700.jpg,"['pfizer', 'trials', 'vaccine', '1215', 'seeks', 'authorization', 'companies', 'late', 'olds', 'covid19', 'covid']",

Monday afternoon local time, as tugboat horns blared in celebration for having freed the grounded ship, the Ever Given was seen slowly making its way in the canal. Marinetraffic.com showed the vessel pointed north for the first time since last Tuesday, when in high winds and low visibility it became cross-ways in the canal and ran aground, shutting down all ship traffic in the vital waterway.

""She's free,"" an official involved in the salvage operation said, according to Reuters.

""We pulled it off!"" Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired through SMIT Salvage to rescue the Ever Given and get commerce moving through the waterway again, said in a statement.

""I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given on 29 March at 15:05 hrs local time (9:05 a.m. ET), thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again,"" he said.

By early afternoon ET, Ever Given was making about 10 knots (11.5 mph) as it headed into Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal where the ship is to be inspected to make sure it didn't sustain any serious damage either at the time of the initial grounding or during attempts to free it.

The Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned container ship, which is operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine, was originally destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands. However, it could be diverted to another port for repairs, if necessary.

The Ever Given is among the largest container ships currently in operation — at roughly twice as long as the canal is wide. Aided by a high tide, a flotilla of tugboats wrenched the ship's massive bow from the canal's bank, where it became lodged on March 23.

Announcing the news on Facebook, Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said: ""Today, Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis of the delinquent ship on the Suez Canal despite the massive technical complexity surrounding this process on every side. Returning things to normal course, in Egyptian hands, reassures the whole world of the path of its goods and needs passed by this axial artery.""

Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, announced early Monday that the stern of the Ever Given container ship had been moved about 335 feet from shore; it had been only a few yards from land.

In two separate failed attempts over the weekend, tugboats and dredgers tried to refloat the vessel, stacked high with containers, according to shipping authorities.

Evergreen Marine said Sunday that dredging efforts had removed more than 20,000 tons of sand and mud, which loosened the ship's bow, and that the ship's stern had ""been cleared from the sand bank.""

The successful effort to free the ship means at least 369 vessels backed up waiting to transit the canal, including dozens of container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vessels, can now move, Rabie said, according to Reuters.

He told Egyptian television earlier that the Canal Authority would ""not waste one second"" in moving the delayed ships through the waterway. Rabie said it could take up to three days to clear the backlog of ships.

Maersk, the world's largest container line, said the knock-on disruptions to global shipping could take weeks or months to unravel.

Freeing the ship from its spot on the Suez Canal will allow billions of dollars worth of cargo to resume transit and obviate the need for vessels to take a long and expensive detour around the tip of Africa to travel between Asia and Western ports.

A prolonged delay could have increased the cost of shipping, complicated manufacturing and ultimately driven up prices of goods, logistics experts previously told NPR.

The Hon. Amanda Vanstone AO and Mr Joe Martin-Jard will co-chair the six-person Senior Advisory Group whose members have been chosen for their experience and expertise in governance and Indigenous affairs.

The announcement follows meetings between Minister Ley and Traditional Owners Kakadu National Park last year, which saw a number of structural changes within Parks Australia. These changes have seen the appointment of two Park Managers, including at least one Traditional Owner, and a key senior executive position relocated from Canberra to Darwin.

“These are sites of enormous cultural significance and of rich environmental biodiversity,” Minister Ley said.

“The Group will help identify the best ways to protect these values and ensure that the Traditional Owners have control over the way the land is managed.

“In some cases, current management arrangements have been in place for over 40 years, and it is time we looked at them through the lens of today and the nation’s recognition of Traditional Ownership and title.”

“Each member of the Senior Advisory Group brings a wealth of experience across Indigenous and government affairs and I am confident their contribution will help shape future joint management arrangements between Parks Australia and Traditional Owners.

The Senior Advisory Group will provide their recommendations in the second half of 2021.

OTTAWA - More than two million doses of vaccines are set to arrive in Canada this week as the country scrambles to contain the wildfire spread of more contagious variants of the COVID-19 virus.

That includes the first batch of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines — 316,800 doses — to be sent to Canada from the global vaccine-sharing initiative known as the COVAX Facility.

In addition to the COVAX supply, Canada is to receive 1,019,070 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 855,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine over the next seven days.

The country is on track to receive a total of 44 million doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines by Canada Day.

The federal government is promising that every Canadian who wants to be inoculated against COVID-19 will be fully vaccinated by the end of September.

Canada passed a grim milestone Saturday, recording more than one million cases of COVID-19 since the virus hit the country in January last year.

As of midday Sunday, 23,043 Canadians had died from the disease.

OTTAWA - An internal Defence Department report says an errant test on one of Canada’s four beleaguered submarines last year caused permanent damage to the vessel that will continue to pose a risk over the long term.

Obtained by The Canadian Press through Access to Information, the report says one of HMCS Corner Brook’s main ballast tanks ruptured last spring when a contractor tried to drain it faster by applying air pressure after a test.

The report written in August underscores the importance of the main ballast tanks, noting that a malfunction could keep the submarine from being able to dive or surface quickly in an emergency.

But while the report says fully repairing the damage would both be impractical and expensive, the partial repairs being planned could still leave a degree of risk that the Navy will need to monitor.

Canada’s top military procurement official says the ballast tank has been repaired and passed testing since the report was written, and that the Corner Brook is expected back in the water this summer.

Troy Crosby adds that the Navy will not sail the sub if it believes there's an undue risk, but he won't say what limitations the vessel will have as a result of the damage.

RED DEER, Alta - The fate of an Alberta man on death row in Montana could become more tenuous, as the state is close to removing obstacles that prevent it from resuming executions.

Ronald Smith, who is originally from Red Deer, Alberta., has been on death row since 1983.

He and an accomplice shot and killed two young Indigenous men, while high on L-S-D and alcohol, near East Glacier, Montana in 1982.

All executions have been stayed in Montana since 2015, because the state requires the use of a ultra-fast-acting barbiturate, which is no longer available.

But the Montana house of representatives has passed a bill amending the protocol to any substance in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death.

It is to be voted on by the senate later this week.

Opponents are trying to convince members of the senate to vote down the bill.

Smith's daughter, Carmen Blackburn, says having her father wait for nearly four decades amounts to torture.

She says she wants him to allowed to serve a life sentence at home in Canada.

WASHINGTON — Corporations have given more than $50 million in recent years to state lawmakers who have seized on Donald Trump’s lies about a stolen 2020 election to push for new restrictions on the right to vote.

That's according to a new report by the government watchdog non-profit Public Citizen.

Telecom-giant AT&T was the most prolific giver, donating over $800,000 since 2015 to authors of proposed restrictions, cosponsors of such measures, or those who voted in favour of the bills.

Other top givers during the same period include cable provider Comcast, tobacco company Philip Morris, insurance giant United Health, Walmart, Verizon, General Motors and drugmaker Pfizer.

MINNEAPOLIS — The trial of a former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death is expected to turn today toward the fired officer’s training after a first week dominated by emotional testimony from eyewitnesses and devastating video of his arrest.

Derek Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd.

Chauvin, who is white, is accused of pinning his knee on the 46-year-old Black man’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as Floyd lay face-down in handcuffs outside a corner market.

Police Chief Medaria Arradondo is expected to testify as early as today.

Arradondo, the city’s first Black chief, fired Chauvin and three other officers the day after Floyd’s death, and in June called it “murder.”

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared in court for the resumption of his corruption trial.

The evidentiary phase of the trial began today as Israel’s political parties met with the president to weigh in on who should form the next government following last month’s inconclusive elections.

The March 23 vote was largely a referendum on Netanyahu but produced no clear verdict.

Israel’s longest-serving prime minister faces charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption cases.

He has dismissed the allegations as a “witch hunt” by hostile media and law enforcement.

And this ...

LEMBATA, Indonesia — Rescuers were being hampered by damaged bridges and roads and a lack of heavy equipment after torrential rains caused multiple disasters on remote eastern Indonesian islands.

At least 55 people have died and more than 40 are missing in Indonesia.

The tropical cyclone causing the damage is expected to continue affecting Indonesia and East Timor for days and later Australia.

Rescuers recovered 38 bodies after a landslide tumbled down onto a village on Adonara island.

Flash flooding killed at least 17 people elsewhere.

At least 11 people died when cold lava tumbled into villages on Lembata island.

Tropical Cyclone Seroja has produced high waves, strong winds and heavy rains for the past three days.

ICYMI ...

The stars of ""Schitt's Creek"" are getting recognition from their peers, taking home two Screen Actor Guild Awards on Sunday night.

The cast of the Canadian sitcom won the award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series.

Catherine O'Hara also nabbed the award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a comedy series for her portrayal of Moira Rose.

Father-son co-creators Eugene Levy and Dan Levy were both nominated for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series, but were beat out by Jason Sudeikis for his role in ""Ted Lasso.""

""Schitt's Creek"" wrapped up its six-season run last year, when it swept the Emmy's, winning all seven major comedy awards.

The show also took home best comedy series at the Golden Globes earlier this year, where O'Hara also won best actress in a comedy series.

Australia saw the lowest number of influenza cases on record in 2020, and there have been few cases recorded over the past six months, following a record-high number in 2019.

So how will things play out in 2021?

“That’s the $64 million question,” Ian Barr, from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, told AAP.

“It will remain low but when things free up, when international borders reopen, there is a much greater chance for circulation.

“While we might not see flu in the normal season it might be delayed and come back strongly,” he said.

Australia’s normal flu season runs from June until September or October.

The global circulation of the flu is well down for 2021 so far, but there have been outbreaks in East Timor, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Laos, India and Vietnam.

Chris Moy from the Australian Medical Association says high immunisation rates, as well as mask-wearing and physical distancing due to COVID-19, helped stop the spread of flu last year.

“The same things that reduce COVID reduce the flu as well,” he told AAP.

It’s estimated these measures prevented about 2800 influenza deaths.

But Dr Moy said a year with very little flu can often mean a reduced immunity in the population, resulting in a big flu season the following year.

Doctors are “scrambling” to administer regular flu shots at around the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, he said.

The two vaccines should be administered 14 days apart, so that any adverse reactions can be attributed to the correct medication and treated accordingly.

“If you had both of them you wouldn’t know whether you were Arthur or Martha,” Dr Moy said.

Professor Barr said people who already have a date to receive a COVID vaccine should plan their flu jab around that date.

There are two types of flu shots available this season, the standard shot and a high dose for people over 65, available only through GP clinics.

Since 2009, with the release of the G1, the brand has been iterating on its own distinctive take on what an electric bicycle can look like. Today, Gocycle announced its G4 lineup of e-bikes, bringing a couple of notable enhancements to a design that's now more than a decade old.

Those enhancements start with a new ""G4drive"" electric motor that outputs more power and torque. Taking a page from bikes like the Cannondale Topstone Lefty, the entire G4 lineup features a single-sided carbon fork. According to Gocycle, the design increases vertical compliance, which is a technical way of saying the carbon is better at absorbing bumps on the road, leading to a more comfortable ride. On the handlebar, Gocycle has added a USB port you can use to charge your phone when the G4's battery isn't powering the e-bike.

Gocycle G4

Attached to the fork you'll find a wider tire that features a new tread pattern that Gocycle has reinforced with a silica compound for better grip. The fact it's wider, allowing it to hold more air, should once again help create a more comfortable ride. As with the GXi, you can fold the bike down in about 10 seconds. A newly added titanium pin keeps the folding joint aligned.

Elsewhere, the company has managed to make the e-bike lighter by tweaking components like the disc rotors. The result is that G4i+, the lightest (and most expensive) of the new G4 models, weighs just 36 pounds — though that's still heavier than the 24-pound Hummingbird.

The entire Gocycle G4 lineup is available to preorder today in the US, Canada, UK and EU, with the G4 coming in at $4,000, while the G4i and G4i+ cost $5,000 and $6,000, respectively. Other than more premium components in the latter two models, the most significant difference between the G4i and G4i+ and the G4 is that they feature a battery with a 50-mile range. The G4 is limited to 40 miles on a single charge. That said, all three versions of the e-bike come with the company's 4A 36V charger, which can get the higher capacity battery on the G4i and G4i+ to full in about three-and-a-half hours.","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f7885ed0-90d7-11eb-b793-7f3696be5c82,"['tires', 'come', 'gocycle', 'ebikes', 'lineup', 'motors', 'battery', 'thats', 'g4i', 'g4', 'powerful', 'today', 'wider', 'ride', 'ebike', 'gocycles']",

According to a press release by SFA on Tuesday (Apr. 6), the agency said it would be suspending the licence of the outlet — which is located at Oasis Terraces (681 Punggol Drive) — for selling food that was unclean or that contained foreign matter two times.

Accumulated 12 demerit points in one year

In a 12-month period, the KFC outlet had accumulated 12 demerit points and was fined a total of S$800, said SFA.

On two separate occasions, it was issued demerit points for selling food which was unclean or which contained foreign matter.

On Oct. 31, 2020, a customer posted on Facebook about finding a screw in her porridge that she had ordered on foodpanda from the KFC at Oasis Terraces.

In a reply to her post, KFC Singapore relayed their ""deepest apologies"" and emphasised that the fast food eatery takes for safety and hygiene matters ""very seriously"".

They said that they followed up with the couple on the matter and would be conducting further investigations.

Food handlers must re-attend and pass food safety course

According to SFA, any licensee that accumulates 12 or more demerit points within a 12-month period may have their licence suspended for either two or four weeks, or cancelled.

All food handlers working in the suspended premises are also required to re-attend and pass the Food Safety Course Level 1 before they can resume work as food handlers.

SFA also encouraged members of the public who come across poor hygiene practices in F&B premises not to patronise such outlets, and to provide feedback via the online feedback form or to call the SFA Contact Centre at 68052871 with details for their follow-up investigations.

98,98,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"'I am no fool. Leave now,' Lorenzana tells Chinese vessels at West PH Sea - CNN Philippines",http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/3/chinese-vessels-julian-felipe-reef-lorenzana.html,"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, April 3) — Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he won't be fooled by China's excuse of bad weather for the presence of its vessels at Julian Felipe Reef in the West Philippine Sea.

In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Lorenzana told Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian he ""has a lot of explaining to do"" about the 44 Chinese vessels still moored at Julian Felipe Reef almost two weeks after the government demanded that they leave.

Also known as Whitsun Reef, Julian Felipe is a shallow coral reef close to Bataraza in Palawan, well within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

The National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea on March 20 reported the presence of more than 200 Chinese vessels in the area. The Chinese government said they were only seeking shelter due to ""rough sea conditions,"" but aerial and maritime patrols this week showed 44 ships are still there, and over 200 others are in different reefs in the Kalayaan Island Group, which the Philippines considers part of Palawan province.

""I am no fool,"" Lorenzana said. ""The weather has been good so far, so they have no other reason to stay there.""

""These vessels should be on their way out,"" he added. ""Umalis na kayo diyan (Leave that place now).""

In response, the Chinese Embassy in Manila called the Secretary's statement ""perplexing"" and reiterated its claim that the reef is part of China's Nansha Islands. The Embassy added it was ""completely normal"" for Chinese fishing vessels to fish near the reef.

""The waters around Niu'e Jiao (Julian Felipe Reef) has been a traditional fishing ground for Chinese fishermen for many years,"" said a statement attributed to the embassy's spokesperson. ""Nobody has the right to make wanton remarks on such activities.""

The Department of Foreign Affairs on March 21 filed a diplomatic protest and demanded that China ""promptly withdraw"" its ships. Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago ""Chito"" Sta. Romana said last week Beijing gave its assurance that its vessels are only temporarily staying at Julian Felipe Reef.

Meanwhile, the Palace said President Rodrigo Duterte had raised the issue in a meeting with the Chinese envoy and reaffirmed the country’s arbitral win in the South China Sea dispute. China claims most of the global waterway, including parts of the West Philippine Sea.

An arbitral tribunal in 2016 invalidated Beijing's sweeping claims and recognized the Philippines' sovereign rights to parts of its EEZ, which the East Asian giant contests. It also ruled that China's island-building activities on several reefs in the Kalayaan Island Group constitute violations to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS and ""have caused devastating and long-lasting damage to the marine environment."" China refuses to recognize the landmark ruling.

This week, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said government forces also spotted ""illegal"" mand-made structures in Pagkakaisa Banks or Union Banks, a group of features in the Kalayaan Island Group that includes Julian Felipe Reef.

The government has increased the deployment of Navy, Coast Guard, and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessels in the area to augment routine patrols and assert the country's sovereignty.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2021/4/3/Delfin-Lorenzana-Chinese-vessels-Julian-Felipe-Reef-_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Delfin-Lorenzana--Chinese-vessels-Julian-Felipe-Reef-_CNNPH.jpg,"['philippines', 'tells', 'sea', 'west', 'ph', 'china', 'lorenzana', 'leave', 'vessels', 'fool', 'chinese', 'group', 'felipe', 'reef', 'julian']",

Beavers have been released into an enclosure at a Welsh nature reserve to help manage important peat bog habitat, conservationists have said.

The first members of a family of beavers, a father and son, were released into a secure fenced area at Cors Dyfi Nature Reserve, near Machynlleth, Powys, which was once used as a conifer plantation.

Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the reserve, said the impact of former forestry ditches and tree stumps meant traditional methods of dealing with areas of the site, such as coppicing, were all but impossible.

Over the years the trust has considered alternatives including water buffalo, but now it is hoped the beavers will help efforts to return the landscape to wet lowland peat bog.

The semi-aquatic mammals are known as “ecosystem engineers” which can restore wetlands and benefit wildlife through their foraging for plants and trees to eat and building dams.

The family have been taken under licence from the wild in Scotland, as an alternative to lethal control where beavers are coming into conflict with farmers or other landowners, and the mother will join them shortly.

Beavers were historically found in British rivers and wetlands but were hunted to extinction by the 16th century for their fur, meat and glands.

Various organisations and landowners are introducing them in fenced sites to boost nature and reduce flooding, while they are now also found wild on a number of rivers across Britain.

Emyr Evans, Dyfi projects manager at Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said: “The beavers will be a fantastic tool in our efforts to return Cors Dyfi into a wet lowland peat bog once again.

“Our volunteers are really excited to have beavers at the reserve and it will be their job to monitor the beavers and measure the positive impacts of these mammals.”

The father, who is a rare black beaver, and his son, who is brown with patches of darker fur, were released with the help of naturalist and television presenter Iolo Williams.

He said: “Finally, after more than four centuries, these wonderful animals are back where they belong and I’m sure they will prove to be as big an attraction as their osprey neighbours.”

The Welsh Beaver Project, led by North Wales Wildlife Trusts on behalf of all the Wildlife Trusts in Wales, has assisted Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust in applying for a licence to release the beavers and funding the enclosure.

A public consultation into the scheme was held last autumn by Natural Resources Wales and a licence issued earlier this month.

While the beavers are not wild, the team behind the scheme say having the animals at a visitor hub such as Cors Dyfi will help inform people about their behaviour and how it can support the restoration of habitats.

The Welsh Beaver Project is also developing plans for reintroducing beavers into the wild, which will be subject to a separate public consultation led by Natural Resources Wales in due course.

Conservationists back the return of the once-native species to restore wetland habitats, boost other wildlife, curb flooding, improve water quality and support eco-tourism.

But farmers and anglers raise concerns over their impacts on the landscape, business and recreation.

Alicia Leow-Dyke, Welsh beaver project officer, Wildlife Trusts Wales, said: It is wonderful to finally see beavers at Cors Dyfi nature reserve, where people can visit and learn more about the many benefits beavers can bring.

“We hope this will help bolster support for a managed reintroduction to the wild in the near future.”","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1f7DkS.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f,"['peat', 'beavers', 'released', 'manage', 'wild', 'bog', 'wildlife', 'help', 'nature', 'welsh', 'reserve', 'cors', 'dyfi', 'enclosure', 'wales']",
