Parts of southern China still cleaning up Thursday from floods that have left at least 20 people dead or missing are forecast to be hit with more rain over coming days.

Nearly 3 million people have been affected by the floods with 228,000 forced to seek shelter and 1,300 homes destroyed, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Direct economic losses are estimated at more than $500 million, the ministry said.

While damage has been concentrated in Hunan province and the Guangxi region, authorities were monitoring the situation in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic, which lies along the Yangtze River, Vice Minister of Water Resources Ye Jianchun said Thursday at a briefing.

Guangxi's crucial tourism sector, already hit hard by the pandemic, has suffered further losses from the floods.

In the picturesque town of Yangshuo, famed for its river scenery and karst outcroppings, streets flooded and tourists had to be evacuated on bamboo rafts. The county government said more than 1,000 hotels and home-stays and 5,000 shops suffered water damage.

Firefighters and other public workers pitched in helping to clear debris and spray disinfectant, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- As heavy rainfalls continue to batter flood-hit south China, Chinese authorities have mobilized dramatic rescue efforts to fight the floods and protect people's lives and property.

More than 20 people were killed or remained missing after torrential downpours unleashed floods, mudslides and landslides in south China, according to a count based on local official reports.

The rain-triggered floods affected some 2.63 million people in 11 provincial-level regions as of Tuesday, said the Ministry of Emergency Management.

The heavy rains also forced relocation of about 228,000 people, destroyed over 1,300 houses and brought direct economic losses of over 4 billion yuan (about 566 million U.S. dollars), according to the ministry.

TIMELY RESPONSE

By 5 p.m. on Friday, floods and geological disasters reported in 66 county-level regions in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the local department of emergency management.

A total of 3,000 emergency relief tents and 3,000 foldable beds were allocated to Guangxi on Thursday to support local disaster relief work and to ensure the basic livelihood of flood-stricken people, said the Ministry of Emergency Management.

The extreme weather has also dealt a hefty blow to the region's tourism sector, which is still reeling from the COVID-19 epidemic.

In Yangshuo, a popular tourist destination known for its karst mountains and picturesque rivers, the water levels of the rivers rose sharply and trapped residents and tourists in the floods as torrential rain had been pouring since the early morning of June 7.

A rescue team rushed to the scenic spot of Darongshu and spent nearly eight hours piloting rubber boats from door to door to search for flood-trapped residents and tourists. All the 62 stranded people were evacuated in time.

""When people are in need, it is our duty to step forward in time,"" said Fang Yang, a member of the rescue team.

EARLY WARNING

Based on the early warnings of geological disasters triggered in the flood season, pre-disaster measures were taken to protect people's lives.

In the city of Guilin, Guangxi, the local government organized on June 7 two early evacuations involving 661 people threatened by landslides after the early warning system forecast potential geological hazards.

In Hunan Province, since the main flood season started on June 1, the persistent rain has affected 321,000 people in 21 counties and cities.

Before the rain came, officials in Zhongba Village, Shuitianhe Township, conducted a thorough investigation to clear up hidden dangers, launched an emergency response and warned villagers not to fish in nearby rivers.

After the heavy rain, no one was trapped or injured in the village owing to the early preparation, according to Long Anxie, deputy head of the township.

POST-DISASTER RECONSTRUCTION

In regions affected by flooding and waterlogging, post-disaster reconstruction including restoring power and repairing water supply facilities has been carried out in an orderly fashion to help the flood-stricken return to normal life.

Agricultural technicians in Baojing County, Hunan, rushed to help save crops in the flood-drowned fields. In a watermelon greenhouse of Ganxi Village, agronomists showed the farmers how to maintain the seedlings.

In the city of Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province, one of the hardest-hit areas, the local government helped farmers clean up the silt and damaged crops for subsequent replanting.

Torrential downpours are expected to enter the central regions of China in the near future, according to the National Meteorological Center.

The center advised local governments to remain alert for possible flooding, landslides and mudslides caused by heavy rain and recommended outdoor operations be halted in hazardous areas.

An early look at Saudi Arabia’s crude exports for May shows that historic production cuts have done little to squelch the kingdom’s flood of oil to China, which is just getting back on its feet from the coronavirus.

Saudi flows to the Asian nation were about 2.1 million barrels a day through May 28 — a figure that may rise in the coming days — tanker-tracking and fixture data show. That compares with 2.3 million in April, which was the highest since the start of 2017, when Bloomberg began tracking shipments. It’s also just the third time during that period when average daily exports to China breached the 2 million mark.

By contrast, overall Saudi crude shipments dropped to about 6.6 million barrels a day this month after reaching 9.3 million in April, also the highest in at least three years. Last month’s volumes were an anomaly, the result of a price war, and May’s exports are much closer to the average in recent years.

Still, the data show a nation straddling two eras as the coronavirus turns the oil market on its head. Saudi Arabia is leading an unprecedented international effort to slash global output by more than 10% to help remove a glut, caused by the pandemic crushing oil demand. Before it agreed to those curbs, however, the kingdom slashed selling prices to the lowest in decades. The effects of this grab for market share are still rippling through the market as China recovers.

Also of note in May, Saudi shipments to the U.S. and India both slumped. Last month, the kingdom sent almost 1.3 million barrels a day to the U.S., a glut that threatened to disrupt the American market. Flows to the U.S. this month have dropped to about 570,000 barrels a day, though the figure could rise as several vessels still haven’t signaled final destinations.

Saudi crude exports to India, its closest major market, plunged by almost 50% to 560,000 barrels a day in May. Last month, Saudi shipments surged as the kingdom edged out other exporters to the South Asian nation, notably Iraq.

Next month, the export picture could show another decline in overall flows. State oil producer Saudi Aramco has already indicated it will trim shipments to Asia while aggressively cutting those to the U.S. and Europe. And Saudi Arabia and Russia, the leaders of the OPEC+ effort to curb output, earlier this week pledged further coordination. OPEC+ and its allies are set to hold online meetings June 9-10 to discuss the future of their pact.

For the fourth time in a year, he stood by the Yellow River and shared his concerns about China's ""Mother River.""

The river plays an irreplaceable role in the nation's ecology as well as its history. Starting from Qinghai Province, the Yellow River, known as China's ""Mother River"" and the cradle of Chinese civilization, runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions before emptying into the Bohai Sea.

In August Xi described the Yellow River, the country's second longest river, as ""frail.""

As an ""ecological corridor,"" the Yellow River, linking the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Loess Plateau and plains in northern China with severe water scarcity, plays an important role in improving the ecological environment, combating desertification and providing water supply.

The 5,464-kilometer-long waterway feeds about 12 percent of China's population, irrigates about 15 percent of arable land, supports 14 percent of national GDP and supplies water to more than 60 cities, according China's Xinhua News Agency.

The river's natural and geological conditions have led to frequent flooding in ancient times. Over the past 2,500 years, the river broke its dikes 1,600 times and made 26 major changes in its course in its lower reaches in history, according to Xinhua News Agency, which reports that these efforts remain a priority in the nation's governance.

As of today, the river still faces three major challenges.

Firstly, sand: As it runs through the Loess Plateau with serious soil erosion because of ecological destruction, huge amount of sand and soil deposits are washed away by the running water in the lower stream, raising the riverbed and increasing the risks of the river bursting its banks and triggering floods.

Secondly, ecological degradation: The bottomland the stretches along the river is fertile in soil and provides a natural habitat for many wild animals, especially birds, but over exploitation is threatening these areas.

Thirdly, heavy pollution: Busy industrial activities along the river once put the Yellow River on the map as one of the world's most polluted rivers about 10 years ago, and today, despite some progress, pollution control remains one of the priorities in protecting the Yellow River according to Xinhua News Agency.

To deal with these issues, the central government as well as local governments along the river have taken a series of measures.

Over the past 70 years, China has carried out four large-scale embankment projects and built water conservancy projects such as Longyang Gorge, Liujia Gorge hydropower projects and the Xiaolangdi Dam, achieving a major breakthrough from passive treatment to active management of sand and water in the Yellow River.

Since 2012, the country has implemented two phases of flood control projects in the lower reaches of the waterway and completed the standard levee construction. The accumulated amount of silt and sand into the Yellow River has been reduced by nearly 30 billion tons and the sediment of the downstream river has been reduced by 11.2 billion tons, according China's Xinhua News Agency.

To tackle pollution, the state's Ministry of Ecology and Environment launched a pilot investigation in an attempt to find all sewage outfalls along the river by the end of 2020. It has also requested provinces and regions along the river submit remote sensing images by July 2020 that will be used to discover possible sewage outfalls. It will also send over 1,000 employees to carry out field visits.

At the same time, places along the river have also been exploring ways to help poverty-struck residents. For example, forage crop alfalfa has been wildly planted in places such as Shanxi and Gansu Provinces. The plant grows naturally in the region, but now it has been promoted for its economic and ecological benefits. It has not only brought extra income for locals, but because the locals can herd their livestock in the alfalfa fields instead of the wild, it protects the natural grazing grounds from over exploitation, according to Xinhua News Agency.

The country has built more than 400 wetland nature reserves and national parks in the river basin, according to a Xinhua news report.

It has listed the ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin a national strategy.

ITANAGAR: Road connectivity to the remote Shi-Yomi district in Arunachal Pradesh snapped after a bridge was washed away in the floods triggered by incessant rains over the last couple of days, officials said on Friday.

Shi-Yomi district, bordering China, was cut-off from the rest of the country after the RCC bridge (reinforced cement concrete) near Yapik village on the Aalo-Mechuka Road was washed away on Wednesday night, they said.

Transportation of people and essential commodities to the remote district would be badly affected as it is likely to take days to restore the bridge, the officials said, adding that people travelling between Mechuka and Aalo were also left stranded.

Expressing serious concern over the incident, state Assembly Speaker Pasang D Sona, who represents the district, has urged the Border Roads Organization (BRO) to restore the bridge on war footing.

In a letter to the chief engineer of Project Brahmank of the BRO based at Pasighat in East Siang district, the speaker said the Aalo-Mechuka Road ""is the key and strategic road for movement of people, transportation of essential commodities, life-saving drugs, construction material, and movement of defence personnel in the entire Shi-Yomi district"".

He said that owing to the inclement weather, supply of essential items and evacuation of emergency patients through sorties would also not be possible.

The bridge is required to be constructed on war footing to restore the connectivity and to mitigate the problems, Sona said, urging the BRO chief engineer to take immediate action.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/6/5/w600X390/Kerala_Rain_PTI.jpg,"['china', 'bridge', 'arunachal', 'speaker', 'road', 'washed', 'flood', 'cutoff', 'bordering', 'war', 'district', 'restore', 'bro', 'sona', 'essential']", 
13,13,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Opinion: Did China turn off the lower Mekong? Why data matters for cooperation - thethirdpole.net,https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/regional-cooperation/opinion-did-china-turn-off-the-mekong-tap-why-data-matters-for-cooperation/,"Recent reports claim definitive proof that the 2019/20 Mekong drought was caused by China – they do not according to researchers at the Australia Mekong Partnership for Environmental Resources and Energy Systems (AMPERES). Will the controversial analysis further polarise stakeholders, or could the crisis shift regional cooperation into more productive spaces?

The Mekong is one of the world’s great rivers. At the centre of this system is the flood pulse – a seasonal cycling of water that sees flow in the Mekong swell in response to the monsoon transporting water, nutrients and sediments from the headwaters to the floodplains and delta. Most years the flood pulse sustains the basin’s high levels of productivity and biodiversity, but during extreme years drought and flood can devastate basin communities.

The failure of the monsoon in 2019 and the drought conditions persisting to the present day have resulted in historic low river levels. The situation is so severe that Vietnam has declared a state of emergency in the Mekong Delta and Thailand has called on the army to support drought relief efforts.

An assessment released in April by Eyes on Earth of water levels measured at Chiang Saen in northern Thailand has attempted to shed light on what is happening in the Chinese Lancang basin (the name of the Mekong in China). Then a commentary by the Stimson Center shortly after claimed the Eyes on Earth study is definitive proof that Chinese water management policy caused the drought.

These bold assertions speak to long-held suspicions regarding China’s growing influence on lower Mekong flows, suspicions fuelled by a lack of transparency surrounding China’s upstream activity. The problem is that the new study is not definitive, and the conclusions go beyond what the evidence suggests.

Nonetheless, the findings and subsequent commentary have been widely distributed and generated significant attention in the media. The reporting has triggered a wave of much-needed public debate on the causes of worsening seasonal water scarcity in the basin.

But there remain questions surrounding the technical analysis itself and the extent to which it supports claims about Chinese water management policy. It raises broader questions related to the use and misuse of data in the river basin and the implications for regional cooperation.

Review of the Eyes on Earth study

The Eyes on Earth study uses satellite data to provide information on flow in the Lancang River (China’s name for its stretch of the Mekong). The analysis uses microwave imager data to develop a “wetness index”, which estimates the amount of water in the river catchment. Statistical analysis is then used to establish a relationship between the “wetness” of the catchment and monthly water levels at Chiang Saen station.

Concerns regarding the study have been expressed, including by the Mekong River Commission Secretariat (MRCS), academics, as well as by us at AMPERES.

First, a simple regression model may not adequately capture the complex hydrological processes (eg groundwater dynamics) of the Lancang River. Second, the use of water level data alone does not give understanding of the water volumes flowing in the river or water volumes stored and released by the reservoirs.

Third, the study also discusses water level and flow volumes interchangeably, which they should not be. Fourth, monthly water level data is too coarse to reflect hydropower operations occurring over much shorter timescales. Fifth, water flows in the Mekong are highly variable, and the baseline used in the study is too short to allow the reliable identification of a relationship between water levels in the river and wetness in the upstream catchment.

Finally, the study makes almost no reference to peer-reviewed literature on the Mekong system from the past 15-20 years, nor any evidence of the study having undergone a peer-review process – two critical safeguards in the scientific process.

The study by Eyes on Earth does not provide definitive proof of China’s responsibility, but it does represent a novel illustration of the potential for satellite imaging technology to transcend national boundaries and independently reveal hydrological conditions in the basin. Further research is required to develop and realise this potential.

Review of the Stimson Center reporting

Despite these concerns, the main technical findings of the Eyes on Earth study are however consistent with the prevailing scientific understanding. For example, the study concurs that flow at Chiang Saen began to diverge from natural conditions in 2012 when the Nouzhadu dam in China’s Yunnan province started filling. Dr Alan Basist, the main author of the study, also confirmed during a live stream that the low flows in the lower Mekong were largely caused by drought in the lower part of the basin outside China, but these were exacerbated by the control exerted by the Lancang dams.

With broad areas of consistency between the Eyes on Earth study findings and the prevailing scientific understanding, why did the study generate so much controversy?

The answer lies in how the study has been used as evidence for a simplified narrative that blames China for the drought. With the Eyes on Earth study in hand, the Stimson Center claims that drought in the lower Mekong was the direct result of Chinese water management policy; that China is hoarding water.

The Stimson Center also claims that China’s position on Mekong water is “not one drop of China’s water resource should be shared without China using it first or without making those downstream pay for it”, and that China’s claim to solidarity with downstream neighbours is false.

The think-tank concluded that although the Lancang catchment received an above-average amount of rain and snowmelt, nearly all the water remained trapped behind China’s dams. This contradicts earlier research. Indeed, our calculations suggest that the whole cascade of 11 dams could only store around 35-37% of wet season flow in an average year, even less during a year with above-average water availability.

The political conclusions drawn and widely disseminated by the Stimson Center are not substantiated by the Eyes on Earth study. These claims represent a politicisation of data. One that risks undermining the integrity of efforts by a community of researchers to build, over decades, a credible evidence base on the functioning of the Mekong system.

Drought déjà vu

While the data sparking the 2019/20 controversy is new, the pattern of severe droughts in the basin resulting in controversy is not. Droughts in 2010 and 2016, and their relationship to the role of hydropower, were also the cause of political controversy in the basin. The pattern has been that a major water-scarcity crisis devastates local communities, and protests and concerns bubble up causing lower Mekong countries to demand more transparency from China on its activities upstream.

China is stung by the criticism, and in an attempt to defuse the situation releases limited data regarding the hydropower operations in Yunnan province. But the data is insufficient to be conclusive, and for governments and civil society in the lower Mekong there remains ambiguity as to the role of the Lancang cascade on downstream flow variability. As the drought conditions abate so too does the impetus to pursue regional cooperation, until the next crisis.

Data becomes central to the negotiation between multiple actors who share the same water resource but have different interests, values and priorities. It also leaves data open to distortion or suppression. The misuse of data can typically be traced back to an effort to control the outcome of decision-making processes, to obscure the impact of investment projects, planning and policy, and constrain debate.

The claims in the Stimson article are an overinterpretation of available evidence. Conclusions have been drawn beyond what the data can actually tell us. But such use of evidence has been a common phenomenon in the debate surrounding the Mekong.

For example, 10 years ago, amid concerns that lower Mekong dams would cause a collapse in the Mekong fishery, private sector developers regularly used research on North American fish passages built for salmon species as evidence that fish ‘ladders’ would be successful for the hundreds of varied migratory species of the Mekong.

Data is often withheld to obscure system understanding and undermine the discussion of transboundary issues in the Mekong system. China’s long-standing reluctance to fully share data with downstream countries is a prime example of this type of misuse. But this too is a practice all too familiar in the basin. For example, in the early 2000s Vietnam was reluctant to share information on releases from the Sesan cascade with big impacts on downstream Cambodian communities.

The motivations for misuse

Such selective use or distortion of data represents efforts from actors on all sides to influence the debate and align outcomes with their own interests. Incidences of water scarcity offer strategic opportunities for stakeholders to use data to escalate or de-escalate the issue in an attempt to achieve their political ends.

Framing flow alterations as an existential threat to downstream countries serves to escalate the issue and allows its interpretation as a crisis, in which the use of emergency measures is legitimate. Drought and water insecurity become a threat to sovereignty, to diplomatic relations, to political stability nationally and in the affected communities. The Stimson Center’s treatment of hydrological conditions in the 2019/20 drought represent such an attempt to escalate the problem.

Conversely, efforts to placate the downstream states and de-escalate flow alterations attempt to prevent the treatment of the issue as a threat to security or stability and place it back within the realm of ‘normal politics’. In 2010, China’s release of data on dry season water levels in its upstream reservoirs in the days preceding a Mekong River Commission summit could be viewed as a proactive effort to prevent the public escalation of the issue.

For communities and governments of the lower Mekong, this is a familiar bind. On one side actors escalate the issue to try and force ameliorative action. On the other some seek to mute and de-escalate so that business as usual may continue unperturbed. Data is either absent or caught in-between.

This was the case in the previous droughts, such as 2010. Once drought conditions passed, so too did the political imperative to act, and there was no appreciable improvement in regional cooperation to better manage water scarce conditions.

What is the alternative?

Today the Mekong and the seasonal ebb and flow of its flood pulse stands at the centre of the trade-offs associated with basin development. When in the past it signalled the change in seasons, it now conveys the transboundary implications of national development decisions.

Key processes that underpin the functioning of the system such as the seasonal rise and fall of the Mekong, the flow reversal of the Tonlé River, the transportation of sediments and nutrients from the headwaters to the floodplains and deltas, and the migratory corridor for fish and other aquatic species are all under threat as human interventions regulate, fragment and extirpate connections.

Hydropower, rightly, is at the forefront of the debate. At the same time, other development pressures including the expansion of irrigation and drainage, urbanisation, large-scale infrastructure development and deforestation are accelerating. Climate change is also bringing with it uncertain and unpredictable changes to the hydrology of the basin. As the scale of change forced on the Mekong system has grown, so too have the impacts. Today the Mekong basin is facing unprecedented change, from droughts and floods to a sinking delta, weakened flow reversal in the Tonlé Sap and a collapse in the inland capture fishery.

Data has provided an instrumental contribution to understand the scale and seriousness of these challenges. But as the current controversy surrounding the 2019–20 low flows shows, how we generate, utilise and interpret data matters.

We see five principles of data production and management as essential to maintain the integrity of the Mekong evidence base: transparency, open access, peer-review, impartiality and, importantly, a separation of data production from political deliberation.

Data and evidence must shift focus to address the broader sustainability issues associated with large development decisions and their cumulative impacts. As has been repeatedly called for by civil society, there is a need for an inclusive and open process of deliberation.

We propose learning from arguably the most successful human effort to build an evidence base for policy response – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC represents one of the most wide-reaching and successful efforts to apply the scientific method to bring the environment and sustainability into planning and policy-making processes.

Its success has been in convening the peer-review of many independent scientific studies and their synthesis into a cohesive, integrated understanding of climate change and its impacts. This process-based approach of consensus building has not only contributed to significant advances in the science and understanding of climate change, but has also led to the robust coupling of science to policy.

For the Mekong, an IPCC-style inquiry would require mandate and oversight from all Mekong governments, a platform for meaningful civil society engagement and an independent process for scientific assessment. There must be integrity in the science, accountability to the people of the basin and real cooperation between governments for it to be successful. Such a structure would provide a process from which an understanding of the drivers and options for effective management of the Mekong could be explored.

However, an IPCC-style science-to-policy process need not start from scratch. In April 2020, Thailand called for a joint study between riparian states to study the drought issue. If that study was led by riparian governments, with meaningful entry points for civil society into the design and review of policy options, and supported by an independent, transparent scientific process, it could form a prototype for a much more productive relationship between science, deliberation and policy.

The drought of 2019–20, like the ones before, provides a sense of urgency and could galvanise a coherent and coordinated response.

The question is: can we start a process of robust and transparent investigation into these issues which will generate momentum that continues beyond the limits of the immediate crisis? Or will we again slide into a cycle of crisis-driven escalation and de-escalation, where the severity of water crises continues to escalate while cooperation stagnates?

Their arrival will mark the first batch of Made-in-China EVs to be put on European roads, paving the way for a new level of affordability for long-range electric vehicles.

The market introduction of the U5 EV was planned for April 2020. But it was delayed until August due to the global pandemic. The U5 SUV will be made available as a leased vehicle at first, and then for purchase or in a subscription. The U5 will be available in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and most likely France. Pre-orders opened in April.

The Aiways factory in Shangrao, China, has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. The first batch of 500 battery-powered U5s, which arrive in July, will be put into service by Hertz Corsica as rental vehicles on the Mediterranean island.

At a virtual press conference held in March in place of the canceled Geneva Motor Show, Alexander Klose, vice-president of overseas operations, said:

With the launch of the U5, we will become the first Chinese EV brand to bring an electric vehicle to Europe. This is a very important moment for Aiways and the Chinese car industry as a whole. We will show that EVs from China can compete with the best in the world.

Using a modest 63 kilowatt-hour, liquid-cooled battery pack, the U5 is rated for 250 miles of range in the WLTP cycle. A single 140 kW (187-horsepower) motor powering the front wheels will mean modest acceleration but likely good efficiency. We guess the real-world range will fall below 200 miles. Earlier reports indicated that multiple battery pack sizes would be available.

Chinese media reports indicate a starting price of the U5 at the equivalent of about $28,000 – that is, in domestic markets after incentives. Klose did not yet disclose the lease pricing for the U5 in Europe but pegged the “value” of a fully-loaded top-spec version of the U5 EV at €40,000 ($45,300) before incentives.

That top-spec U5 will be well-equipped. It’s expected to provide semi-autonomous driving, a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, automatic climate control, a sunroof, and a foot-controlled tailgate.

Battery cells come from CATL. Bosch supplies key electric components. A Mobileye EyeQ4 camera (along with a set of radar and ultrasonic sensors) power a Level 2 driver-assist system. The spec for quick-charging is not known, although the company is promising to charge from 30% to 80% in less than 30 minutes.

A crossover about the size of Model Y

Aiways styling is hard to place, a somewhat generic mashup of elements similar to a Mitsubishi and Toyota. The tape measure for the U5 reads: 184.3 inches long, 73.6 inches wide, and 66.9 inches tall. Fold down the rear seats to get 55 cubic feet of cargo space.

Compared to a Tesla Model Y, the Aiways U5 SUV is two inches shorter, nearly three inches taller, and almost identical in width. In other words, its dimensions match the specs of the current wave of electric crossovers, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Audi Q4 e-tron.

Aiways will use a direct-to-consumer sales strategy with a partnership network providing local service and repairs. The company claims zero maintenance is required until 100,000 kilometers.

In September 2019, Aiways became the first Chinese EV-maker to obtain approval from the German TÜV Rheinland agency — thereby certifying its U5 EV for sale in Europe. For the TÜV presentation ceremony, two U5s were driven more than 9,000 miles from China across Russia, through the Baltic states and Scandinavia, before reaching Frankfurt.

Electrek’s Take

Critical details about the Aiways U5, such as the price of a base model, are still unknown. Build quality and reliability are obvious questions. And a batch of 500 EVs is not a lot.

But the arrival of a Chinese EV in Europe is an important milestone. It won’t be long before other Made-in-China electric vehicles arrive in Europe and the United States. Of course, we know about Byton and Nio, as well as Geely-owned Volvo and Polestar.

However, the ability for countless other lesser-known Chinese EV makers to produce electric cars at a much larger scale and with a laser-focus on lowering the purchase price is a potential game-changer. In previous generations, American and European automakers scoffed at the quality of Japanese and Korean cars, only to become highly competitive international players.

The immense scale of electric-vehicle production in China is unique. Leveraging its capacity to make EVs, much like it produces many other electronic consumer products, could help reduce electric-car prices. It won’t happen immediately, but the arrival of the first shipment from China to Europe is another step in that direction.

ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 Nigerian states are at risk of heavy flooding this year, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said Thursday.

This year's flood projections will, as expected, vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country, and rivers are likely to exceed flood level with some low-lying areas to be inundated, said the NIHSA in a statement following an earlier survey.

Out of the 774 local government areas in the country, it said, some 102 local government areas across 28 states are at risk of flooding -- one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria, which has a devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on floodplains for livelihood.

Although the projections showed that the floods this year might not be as severe as in previous years, it was important to begin to carry out aggressive awareness campaigns for preparedness, the agency said.

In March 2012, 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected by flooding, in which more than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million displaced. Enditem","Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'flooding', 'severe', 'projections', 'nigeria', 'risk', 'nihsa', '28', 'areas', 'states', 'heavy']",

They started in late May and need to cover 153,000 square kilometers in just two weeks.

""This year, the output remains one kilogram of wheat per square meter. And this number has lasted for five years. I'm so happy,"" Liu Jiguang, a villager from Cuizhuang Village, Henan Province said.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic taking a toll on agriculture, China's Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs said the nation reaped good agricultural totals for the first quarter and could have a bumper grain harvest this year.

Ru Zhengang, a wheat scientist from Henan Institute of Science and Technology, said: ""We've had good harvests in grain for more than 10 years. One reason is because we made scientific breakthroughs to develop new species of wheat to increase output. Another reason is that China keeps developing high-standard farmland. It is drought and flood resistant. It needs less water, fertilizer and pesticide. ""

Just before harvesting comes to an end in Henan, the local government starts stockpiling the grain.

So far, more than 900 million kilograms of wheat have been stockpiled. Currently, the wholesale price for wheat is around 2.22 yuan per kilogram, and the government has offered to pay at least 2.24 yuan per kilogram to boost farmers' income and increase state reserves.

""In the past 14 years, grain-of-wheat output keeps more than 35 billion kilograms of wheat a year in Henan province. It provides one fourth of the nation's wheat production. So we say if central China has a good harvest, the whole country will have a sufficient supply,"" Liu Dagui, Vice Director of Henan Provincial Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, said.

In China, an old saying goes ""people won't panic if they have the grain in hand."" Because the country has a sufficient domestic supply of grain that is enough to last a year, it will not suffer a food crisis amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The Ministry of Agriculture said that it will continue to roll out measures ensuring total production of grain remain at 650 million tons for the year.","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://video.cgtn.com/news/2020-06-09/China-could-see-bumper-grain-harvest-this-year-official-RbIFM6UWek/video/b530790b0cd74aeebbf32327f8b443e7/b530790b0cd74aeebbf32327f8b443e7-750.jpg,"['china', 'bumper', 'harvest', 'province', 'henan', 'output', 'official', 'good', 'supply', 'yuan', 'kilogram', 'wheat', 'grain']",

23,23,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Dow Jones Jumps Despite Flood of Bad News; Visa Stock Rises on Positive Spending Data; Big Discounts on iPhones in China - Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/02/dow-jones-jumps-despite-flood-of-bad-news-visa-sto.aspx,"Recent news has not been good. Civil unrest has spread to many U.S. cities in the past few days, threatening to slow the economy's recovery from the pandemic. On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office warned that a full economic recovery could take as long as a decade.

The stock market doesn't seem to care. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up another 0.6% by 11:40 a.m. EDT Tuesday, despite the flood of bad news. The market was mixed overall, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffering a small loss.

Shares of Visa (NYSE:V) managed to gain on Tuesday after the credit card giant released data that showed a rebound in spending last month. Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was down slightly following reports of steep discounts for iPhones in China.

Visa sees payments recovery in May

April was a rough month for Visa. A combination of temporarily closed businesses, nearly nonexistent travel demand, and generally weak consumer spending led to a steep drop in payments volume. Total payments volume in the U.S. dropped 18% year over year, with a staggering 30% decline in credit card volumes. Cross-border volumes were even worse.

While May brought only minor improvements to the cross-border payments situation, spending on Visa's network in the U.S. picked up. U.S. payment volumes were down only 5% for the month, with a 21% decline in credit card volumes partially offset by a 12% rise in debit card volumes. Stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits no doubt played a role, especially considering that some Americans are making more on unemployment than they did when they were working.

Food and drugstores, home improvement, and retail services spending surged more than 20% in May, while automotive, retail goods, and telecom and utilities spending grew by less. Restaurant spending continued to decline in May, and travel spending was down more than 70%.

Globally, processed transactions were down 12% year over year in May for Visa, a 12-percentage-point improvement compared to April. The company noted that spending has shifted toward larger ticket transactions.

While another round of direct stimulus payments to Americans is possible, the expanded unemployment benefits as part of the CARES Act expire on July 31. If the unemployment rate remains high late in the summer, Visa could see payments volume regress as consumers tighten up on spending.

Shares of Visa were up about 0.6% by late Tuesday morning. The stock is now roughly 9% below its 52-week high.

Price cuts in China could goose iPhone sales

One thing that becomes far less urgent for most people when a deadly virus is rapidly spreading is a smartphone upgrade. In February, sales of iPhones in China reportedly dropped a whopping 61% year over year. In April, sales of iPhones in the U.S. crashed 77%, according to data from KeyBanc.

Apple has seen demand rebound in China since that country started reopening its economy, and that demand could accelerate with lower prices. CNBC reported on Monday that iPhone prices have been slashed on various third-party websites, including Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com. Discounts are as high as 21% for the high-end iPhone 11 Pro Max. The promotions are part of the 6.18 shopping festival.

The U.S. tech giant faces intense competition in China from local smartphone companies. In the first quarter, Apple managed a market share of just 8.5% in the country, far below the 41.4% share claimed by China's Huawei. Lower prices may help boost Apple's share, but the company is nowhere near as dominant in China as it is in the U.S., and that's unlikely to change anytime soon.

Apple stock was down about 0.5% by late Tuesday morning. The stock is just barely below its 52-week high, despite vast uncertainty about what smartphone demand will look like later this year.","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/576884/uncertain.jpg,"['china', 'jones', 'jumps', 'visa', 'volumes', 'positive', 'flood', 'dow', 'demand', 'volume', 'unemployment', 'rises', 'card', 'spending', 'stock', 'payments', 'iphones']",

26,26,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Heavy rains and flash floods predicted until next Tuesday from ‘Nuri’ - The Thaiger,https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/weather/heavy-rains-and-flash-floods-predicted-until-next-tuesday-from-nuri,"Today the public health department has reported another 4,528 Covid infections and 24 C-19 related deaths. Another huge proportion of todays cases – 1,902 – are from Thai prisons. We will post the provincial totals early in the afternoon as usual.

Here’s all today’s provincial totals as announced this morning for the past 24 hours…

• Thailand’s Department of Disease Control says it’s prioritising the distribution of Covid vaccine in Bangkok, during the national inoculation drive next month, to vaccinate at least 70% of the capital’s residents by July. Bangkok has an estimated population of 10-12 million (despite its official 8.2 million).

Outspoken DDC Director-General Dr. Opas Karnkawinpong says the distribution of vaccine for other provinces will vary, depending on the spread of infections in each area. Vaccine registration for people living in the provinces will open on June 14th via local hospitals, mobile apps developed for each province and health volunteers.

The department has a quota of 5 million doses for Bangkok and one million for workers who belong to the Social Security Fund. Dr. Opas said the department is still committed to having at least 70% of the nation receive their first shot by September, as there will be about 50 million vaccine doses available.

• Chon Buri officials have announced 90 new Covid infections today, and 1 new death, mostly driven by clusters at factories and migrant worker camps, according to Pattaya News. Phuket has reported another 3 cases today, the same as the past 3 days, as it races towards its planned re-opening for no-quarantine travel on July 1.

• 1 million doses the Sinopharm Covid vaccine is poised to arrive in Thailand over the next month. It will be offered as a paid alternative for particular groups who don’t want to wait for the state-offered free vaccines. The announcement was made by the Chulabhorn Royal Academy on Friday. The Academy is sponsored by HM The King’s sister, Princess Chulabhorn.

The Academy announced that, as the vaccines are being acquired by the institution with their own money, they would have to charge for it.

Sinopharm is a Chinese government-owned pharmaceutical company. The Sinopharm Covid vaccine has been approved for emergency use whilst the Sinovac vaccine, which has provided more than 90% of the Thai roll out, has been registered for use with WHO but not approved, despite being on the WHO desk for nearly 3 months.

Meanwhile, the Thai government were politely ‘hesitant’ to give the private move a full blessing and said they are “moving forward” to allow private organisations to import foreign-manufactured, and Thai FDA approved, vaccines.

• A new study of 862,000 recipients in Uruguay has found that the Sinovac vaccine is effective in reducing Covid-19 death by up to 97%. The study comes as early results are gathered from Uruguay’s vaccination campaign which has been 80% Sinovac vaccines given to its citizens. They found that for people who had already been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, infections were down 57% and severe cases requiring intensive care were reduced by 95%. CoronaVac is a traditional type of vaccine, using inactivated virus to trigger immunity, while Pfizer uses RNA messenger technology.

China has long been the world’s largest market for ecommerce and mcommerce, but this year it will overtake the US to become the world’s largest overall retail market for the first time, despite substantial economic headwinds caused by the pandemic.

What does China’s retail market look like in 2020?

China’s retail market is expected to decline for the first time on record. We forecast that retail sales in China will shrink by 4.0% this year. Still, China will surpass the US to become the largest retail market in the world for the first time—with $5.072 trillion (RMB35.043 trillion) in sales—as the US market will shrink by an even larger margin.

How much will consumers in China spend on retail ecommerce this year?

Consumers will spend $2.090 trillion (RMB14.440 trillion) on retail ecommerce this year, an increase of 16.0%. That is 7.7 percentage points less than our pre-pandemic forecast but still hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending compared with 2019.

How has the pandemic affected China’s top retail ecommerce sites?

Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo will command 83.6% of the retail ecommerce market in 2020, compared with 80.3% last year. This growth (including Alibaba’s first share increase in many years) can be traced to their diversified product offerings and resilient logistics, which enabled them to serve consumers during the pandemic better than their smaller competitors.

How will social commerce fare in 2020?

In our inaugural social ecommerce forecast for China, we expect consumers to spend $242.41 billion (RMB1.675 trillion) via social commerce channels this year, up from $186.04 billion (RMB1.285 trillion) last year. WeChat’s successful Mini Programs are proving to be a game changer for this category, even as China is evolving the very definition of social commerce.

Misleading spin, obfuscation, concealment, and hyperbole have been hallmarks of the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda campaign, before and during the coronavirus era. But the pandemic appears to have given rise to more forceful attacks on foreign governments, as well as a new level of flirtation with outright disinformation.

Thomas Wright: How should Biden handle China?

The party has never waged a global struggle quite like this one—and its battle with the U.S. over where the virus came from and whose failures made the pandemic worse have marked a serious deterioration in the two countries’ ties. Just months ago, Trump was praising Xi Jinping for how he handled the outbreak; now Trump is toying with cutting off relations with the Chinese government altogether.

Seven decades ago, Mao Zedong publicly embraced a benevolent view of propaganda, as if he were a latter-day prophet spreading the communist gospel: “We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory,” he mused in 1945. Just a few months ago, Xi Jinping urged state journalists to spread “positive propaganda” for the “correct guidance of public opinion.” Indeed, Beijing’s global propaganda efforts in recent years have been more about promoting China’s virtues than about spreading acrimony and confusion, à la Russian information ops and election meddling. Moscow wants a weakened and divided West, one that leaves Russia free to dominate its self-appointed sphere of influence—but Russia in 2016 was also an economically sluggish, oil-dependent nation with an economy a tenth the size of America’s, and lacked the resources to remake the world in its image.

Beijing has a much bigger prize in mind and a much longer-term plan to get it: The contest isn’t about who gets to run the U.S. It’s about who deserves to run the world. And China, with its economy poised to overtake that of the United States, has already plowed billions into crafting an image as a responsible global leader, and billions more into cultivating global dependence on Chinese investments and Chinese markets.

“While the [Chinese Communist Party] has long sought to be a global influencer, their efforts today are aggressive and sophisticated,” Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, wrote in an email. “In short, they’re looking to reshape the history of coronavirus and protect their reputation at home and around the world.”

Before the coronavirus hit, the party was becoming bolder in its propaganda efforts overseas as China grew richer and more powerful, trying to promote around the world the orthodoxy it enforced at home, about the beneficence and goodness of the CCP. This involved publicizing Chinese investments in the developing world, arm-twisting diplomats to toe a pro-China line, ruthlessly trying to stifle even other countries’ freedom to dissent—to the point of sanctioning Norway in 2010 when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded its peace prize to the imprisoned democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, who died in 2017. Xi has elevated the role of propaganda even further as he has vowed to build China’s power and prosperity, declaring, “The superiority of our system will be fully demonstrated through a brighter future.”","Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OSUZ5R3ZBl2oTgEbQgXYmpe16Ng=/0x177:8321x4511/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/05/Webart_chinacovidpropaganda_01/original.png,"['communist', 'china', 'planning', 'efforts', 'chinas', 'party', 'win', 'global', 'propaganda', 'world', 'xi', 'chinese', 'coronavirus']",

Rezaul Islam wades through waist-high water, a sack of rice on his head salvaged from what remains of his home, a week after a cyclone savaged Bangladesh and eastern India.

The strongest storm to hit the area this century killed more than 100 people, flattening entire villages, uprooting trees and ruining fish ponds in the Indian state of West Bengal, and south-west Bangladesh.

""We are trying to salvage whatever we can,"" 17-year-old Islam told AFP, his house still half-submerged in water left by storm surges unleashed by Cyclone Amphan.

With homes destroyed or uninhabitable, more than 200,000 people in India and at least 100,000 in Bangladesh remain crammed into cyclone shelters—often with little regard to coronavirus precautions.

The most damage caused by Amphan was from the accompanying storm surge, which wrecked several hundred kilometres (miles) of embankments that are supposed to protect homes and farms in low-lying coastal areas.

Locals worked through the night when the cyclone hit, desperately trying to shore up levees with sandbags.

It was mostly to no avail.

Tens of thousands of acres of farmland, fruit plantations and farms have been devastated by the saltwater.

Roofs ripped off

In the Bangladeshi town of Koira, thousands like Islam have been trying for days to retrieve belongings from what remains of their homes in the now-desolate landscape.

Many buildings had roofs ripped off by the 165-kilometre-per-hour (100-mile-an-hour) winds of Amphan.

Wells for drinking water have also been polluted and locals are now reliant on the army to deliver supplies.

""I could not salvage anything. All valuable items and furniture have rotted,"" said wizened 71-year-old widow Nosimon Begum.

The devastation goes beyond destroyed homes.

Shrimp and crab farming in the area are vital to the Bangladeshi economy—second only to the manufacture of garments for global brands like H&M.

Sanjay Mondol said even before the cyclone, he had lost almost $1 million after the coronavirus pandemic stopped his exports of crabs to customers in China and elsewhere.

The cooperative of around 300 farmers he belongs to saw more than 2,000 acres of washed away by the tidal surge.

""This storm has now broken our backbone. We now have no choice but to beg in the streets,"" Mondol said, tears welling up his eyes.

Unusual activities on the Indo-China border were first spotted in mid April, recent reviews of the month-long standoff indicate.

The first reports date back to about two weeks prior to the reported clash between troops at Pangong Tso on May 5. The incident had left soldiers from both sides wounded and unconfirmed visuals of the alleged altercation continue to flood Chinese social media.

With top military men of both armies scheduled to discuss a resolution to the ongoing standoff on June 6, both sides are hopeful of a breakthrough.

Movement of troops and heavy vehicular traffic on the Indo-China border was noticed in early May. These reports were followed by isolated incidents in Pangong Tso and Naku La in North Sikkim which led to the escalation.

There was a slight retreat by both armies in one of the flashpoints in Galwan and no violence or clashes have been reported from the region for the last two weeks, sources said. Areas considered vulnerable are four points in Ladakh, including Pangong Tso and three other spots in the Galwan Valley region where the current standoff continues with massive troop buildup.

Naku La in North Sikkim is also among other spots subject to contention. Lipulekh on the India-Nepal-China tri-junction is also being considered as sensitive territory after Nepal objected to India's road construction in the region.

This was followed by China enhancing troop deployment in the area and objecting to India's infrastructure development in the region for the aid of Mansarovar pilgrims.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202006/Indo-China_border__Reuters__1-647x363.jpeg?_7J1ovcob6KKLl2q5_bEDnNM_B7g080Z,"['pangong', 'ladakh', 'midapril', 'troops', 'buildup', 'region', 'standoff', 'sikkim', 'spontaneous', 'spots', 'tso', 'weeks', 'began', 'indias', 'chinese', 'troop', 'movement']",

Set to cover two million square metres of land on a peninsular alongside the Dachan Bay shipping-container terminal, the development will include offices, homes, parks and entertainment venues.

There will be no roads for cars in the district, which will be ""roughly the size and shape of Midtown Manhattan"" or two-and-a-half times better than Beijing's Forbidden City.

Instead, residents, commuters and visitors will connect to Shenzhen via subway and traverse Net City on foot or by bicycle. Ferries will provide public transport along the waterways.

Designing a car-free district is an opportunity to ""rethink cities for being for and about people"", said NBBJ.

""Typical city planning is restricted because it's based almost entirely around a grid system for use by cars,"" NBBJ told Dezeen.

""Planning a city with very few cars provides more flexibility to create solutions that are organic and human-focused.""

Terraced buildings will look towards the coast, ranging in height from one to 30 storeys. When complete the area should be able to accommodate up to 80,000 residents and workers.

NBBJ plans to plant mangrove trees along the shore to act as a natural flood defence. Sensors will be used to track flooding.

Net City will form part of China's Sponge City initiative for new urban zones with more environmentally friendly types of flood defences and water management. NBBJ is planning water runoff management schemes.

Solar panels will provide green energy for Net City. The project will be completed in three phases over the next seven years.

33,33,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Four new shopping trends revealed in post-lockdown China - World Economic Forum,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/4-new-shopping-trends-in-post-lockdown-china/,"An analysis of data generated by Chinese shoppers during and after the lockdown reveals several new trends.

Big shifts are taking place in what consumers are purchasing - and how.

Are Chinese consumers really indulging in 'revenge consumption' - a phrase coined by Chinese social media users to describe an anticipated flood of post-lockdown purchases - in the post-COVID era?

An analysis of data generated by JD.com's 618 Grand Promotion - the biggest mid-year shopping festival in China - is a good way to find out. Transaction volumes on JD.com on the first day of this event, which kicked off on 1 June, showed an increase of 74% year-on-year, demonstrating a strong recovery of consumer confidence.

JD’s data and analysis of the first half of 2020 has revealed the following lasting trends, as people gradually adapt themselves to a new shopping normal in the post-COVID era:

1. A big step forwards in online shopping habits

COVID-19 broke out during Chinese New Year, when most shops were closed, and people immediately turned to online shopping to stockpile essentials. Thanks to the readiness of Chinese e-commerce ecosystems in terms of supply chain and logistics, these shopping needs were largely met during the lockdown period. On JD.com alone, more than 160,000 tons of staple items and daily necessities were delivered to customers’ doorsteps in time - helping to prevent a great toilet paper panic from occurring in offline stores.

In the first four months of this year, China’s total retail sales of consumer goods amounted to RMB10.68 trillion ($1.5 trillion), a decrease of 16.2% compared with the same period last year, while sales of online retail reached RMB2.56 trillion ($360 billion), an increase of 8.6%.

This shift from offline to online is significant and has continued after the lockdown, leading customer’s online shopping habits to leapfrog at least one or two years, especially in the grocery category. On the first day of the 618 Grand Promotion, JD Super, JD’s online supermarket, saw its sales increase by 100% while online sales of fresh groceries rose by 140%, compared with the same promotional day last year.

2. More family responsibilities for young consumers

It’s no surprise that young people are the main driver of lockdown shopping, as they are savvier about using online shopping apps. With the extended holiday keeping them at home longer than usual, young people have taken on more responsibilities. Data indicates that since the beginning of this year, more than 70% of consumers born after 1995 have shifted from ""buying only for themselves"" to “buying necessities for the whole family”.

Furthermore, when many young people returned from major cities to their homes in China's lower-tier cities, they helped their family members to engage with online shopping - and to some extent they have driven the penetration of brand, quality and authentic products into lower-tier city markets.

These trends became more pronounced during the 618 Grand Promotion period. According to data from JD Super, young people have moved into the kitchen; purchases of kitchen paper towels by young people, for example, has doubled compared with the same period last year. Awareness of the need to protect the family has also strengthened; the data shows a 34-fold increase in transaction volumes of disposable cleaning products and a 340% increase in purchases of sterilization products year-on-year.



3. Shopping frenzy led by livestream and community group buying

To manage social distancing, consumers are using digital to connect, entertain and shop, fuelling a surge in livestreaming by retailers and social e-commerce. These innovative ways to shop have helped bolster sales for both international brands and local businesses.

The travel restrictions and closures of brick-and-mortar stores have not dampened Chinese consumers’ passion for big international brands. Interacting with their favourite brands online, combined with celebrities and attractive offers for fear of price rises later on due to production disruption, is the biggest emerging trend in the post-COVID market - and consumers are saving on travel expenses, too. More and more international brands are jumping on this bandwagon. For example, on 19 March, Canadian fashion brand PORTS did a nine-hour livestream on JD Live, featuring young celebrities and the fashion editor of Elle magazine. Over 1.3 million customers visited the livestream and PORTS’ sales surpassed RMB10 million ($1.4 million) on that day.

On the local business side, livestream and social channels are playing an important role in supporting direct sales for farmers and local factories who have been hit hard by the pandemic. Consumers feel inclined to support them, and are also benefited by these new shopping formats. Under a community group-buying initiative on JD platform, consumers bought over 225 tons of agricultural produce from Wuhan - the first epicentre of COVID-19 - in less than two months. Mingzhu Dong, chairwomen of China’s home appliances brand Gree Electric, staged a livestream session on 15 May and made RMB703 million ($99 million) in sales.

4. Value for money, comfort and the new normal

As consumers become more cautious in making purchase decisions in the face of ongoing pandemic uncertainty, sales of customized products that are more directly tailored to consumers' needs are rising. Consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) products, which are designed based on big data analysis of direct customer feedback, are increasingly popular, satisfying consumer demand and providing good value for money. are increasing popular. These products are designed based on insights gleaned from data generated by targeted consumers and are thus able to provide more customized functions at reasonable cost, resulting in better value for money.

Perhaps as a result of COVID-19, customers are looking to invest more in products and services that provide comfort at home. Data shows that besides books and exercise equipment, expensive home furnishings goods - such as latex mattresses, silk quilts, smart bathroom mirrors and electrically heated towel racks - are in high demand. In addition, demand for pet-related products and virtual support services - such as programmes that store pet profiles and preferences, and online pet hospitals - is also growing.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/I1yyXjN0o6WTPYLEgz12_n-oZGq0fRz8ci_B6Jjkeh4.png,"['china', 'revealed', 'livestream', 'consumers', 'products', 'shopping', 'sales', 'postlockdown', 'trends', 'young', 'online', 'data', 'chinese', 'million']", 
34,34,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Will China crumble under its own debt pile? - The Sunday Guardian Live - The Sunday Guardian,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/business/will-china-crumble-debt-pile,"2020 could see the collapse of China’s financial system.

By now all experts concur that post coronavirus, the world economy will not be the same and will take at least four-six quarters to recover. The over $14 trillion Chinese economy—second largest in the world—is also set to be completely altered, with some experts saying the setback could be permanent. For decades, China has been powering global manufacturing through its integrated supply chains on the back of large amounts of debt. Troubles are mounting for China since its years of profligacy on borrowed money has now resulted in its debt pile becoming extremely large at a time when its economy is contracting.

As per Institute of International Finance, China’s total domestic debt hit 317% of its GDP in first quarter of 2020, up from 300% last year, registering a largest quarterly increase. What’s worse, this data under-reports the true picture of China’s indebtedness, since a lot of debt is taken by local governments through financing vehicles that are not reflected in balance sheets. Since 2008, the annual growth in China’s domestic debt has been 20%, which has outpaced its GDP growth. Add to it the political culture of central Chinese leadership being favourably disposed towards local governments that have shown “development” backed by an ever increasing debt burden.

And China is set to take on more debt as it tries to beat the Covid-19 induced slowdown to increase its spending. With Beijing announcing advance quota of local government special purpose bonds to the tune of 1 trillion yuan to fund infrastructure projects, it is now almost a given that debt at the local level—which is non-transparent and often violates banking rules—is set to balloon further. The move will ensure local government debt will more than double as compared to last year from 1.9 trillion yuan in 2019 to almost 3 trillion yuan this year.

A banking crisis and systemic collapse of the financial sector are now looming large amidst growing concerns that many of the debts taken at household level and at local government level are at a very high risk of default. This could hit China’s state-dominated financial system hard and unravel the non-transparent financial dealings that have been the hallmark of its growth model. In fact, the extent of regulatory lapses can be gauged from the fact that Ministry of Finance has been forced to call out certain regional governments for illegal fundraising in multiple audit reports. Obviously, the pandemic will slow regional economies and will drive down revenues of local governments, which will limit their ability to repay/refinance previous large amounts of debt, leading to large scale defaults.

One round of bailout by the central government took place in 2019 as smaller Chinese banks were witnessing tremendous uncertainty. There are now expectations that many more Chinese financial institutions will need bailouts by the central government.

Earlier this month, MIE Holdings, a listed oil and gas company, failed to make a $17 million interest payment on its $248 million bond, indicating the pain that lies ahead for Chinese companies. The pain will ultimately be felt by the government, which has asked its banks to extend borrowing to small businesses since this will add more bad debts to the financial system going forward due to a poor economic scenario.

The world’s most indebted country is shovelling more money via debt to fund projects to bring back growth. 2020 will decide whether the Chinese growth model will unravel and lead to its collapse. For now, bond markets and investors around the world are on tenterhooks.

35,35,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Sichuan Rainy Season to Give Bitcoin Hash Rate a Much Needed Jolt - Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sichuan-rainy-season-to-give-bitcoin-hash-rate-a-much-needed-jolt,"The post-halving reality of Bitcoin’s network may soon change shape, some industry insiders argue. The reason is quite simple, and, surprisingly, it has nothing to do with crypto itself: The wet season has arrived in Sichuan, a southwest China province known as one of the hottest spots for Bitcoin (BTC) mining.

The rain in Sichuan is a good sign for all local farmers, Bitcoin miners included. The abundance of water leads to a hydropower supply glut, which, in turn, makes electricity prices — miners’ main burden — decrease. As a result, mining becomes increasingly profitable, which can lead to an increase in the overall hash rate. But is it possible for a single Chinese province to drive up the entire Bitcoin network amid slashed rewards?

The go-to place for mining

According to the latest data from the Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance’s Bitcoin Mining Map, Sichuan accounts for 9.66% of the total BTC hash rate. It is worth noting that the southwest province is not even currently the main mining spot in China, trailing Xinjiang, the desert region which represents as much as 35.76% of the global Bitcoin hash rate.

However, the distribution of hash power within China changes every year between May and October when the wet season begins in Sichuan. Local players then begin to migrate en masse from Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia to Sichuan and Yunnan to take advantage of the lower electricity rate. Leo Zhang, the founder of Anicca research, told Cointelegraph:

“Over the years, the mining industry started to organize itself around this schedule. Manufacturers do their product announcements in May. Facilities offer their special deals right before the rainy season begins.”

It all comes down to Sichuan’s intensive hydroelectricity sector. In 2019, the province reportedly produced 78.2 gigawatts and exported 104 billion kilowatt-hours, which constitutes around 30% of its total output, to other domestic regions. According to the Chinese mainstream press, the ample hydropower energy during the rainy season, as well as the cool climate in its mountainous areas, has made Sichuan “an ideal destination for miners.”

Delayed rainy season and post-halving issues

This year’s wet season in Sichuan arrived later than usual, as most of its areas entered the rainy season only around May 25. The delay has reportedly affected the local mining sector. According to a local crypto news outlet, some Bitcoin mining farms in Sichuan switched off earlier this month against the backdrop of electricity shortages.

The report cited a government notice issued on May 18, which stated that the electricity load within the region has increased by 22% since the start of May, while water flow in local rivers had decreased by 20%, resulting in a shortfall in hydroelectricity supply. According to the report, an unidentified local miner said that some of the local mines stayed blacked out for over three days, while others were only allowed to mine during the night.

This year’s rainy season is more complicated than in the past since the halving comes into play as well, Zhang told Cointelegraph. According to him, mining operations in southwest China are still slowly recovering:

“After the halving, as even more machines left the network, the facilities were in desperate need to fill the capacity. So far, the supply of hosting facilities greatly outweighs demand. Many facilities in Sichuan and Yunnan areas are having trouble finding clients. The oversupply of flood season hosting facilities further reduces average electricity prices. Compared to last year’s 0.24–0.26 RMB/kWh all-in cost, this year’s average can be as low as 0.10–0.20 RMB/kWh.”

The impact from the block reward halving will be partially absorbed by the lower cost of power, Zhang went on to add, outlining the current trends among Sichuan Bitcoin miners that many of the facilities have contracts with power plants outlining a minimum level of electricity usage. He added: “In order to attract business, some of them are offering ‘joint-mining’ programs, where the miners pay de minimis monthly cost and split the mining revenue with the facility owner.”

Pankaj Balani, the CEO and a co-founder of crypto derivatives platform Delta Exchange, shared a similar sentiment in an email sent to Cointelegraph, arguing that the wet season can even be dangerous for the local mining sector: “Whilst there are clear efficiency gains to be made regarding electricity costs for miners, complications can also arise, including flooding and the destruction of mining infrastructure.”

In 2019, the Bitcoin hash rate rose from 48 million to 90 million terahashes per second between May and September, with comparable rate gains experienced in 2018. This time, however, there might be different results according to Balani: “The recent halving plays a role here and it remains to be seen whether the observed rainy-season hash rate increase can be sustained in a low-revenue period such as this.”

Overall, the mining sector in China has been experiencing problems in recent weeks with the combination of COVID-19-related restrictions, slashed revenues and price volatility; for example, Canaan, one of the main China-based mining players, recently reported a $5.8-million Q1 loss and cut the price of mining hardware sold by up to 50%.

Ian Descoteaux, the head of mining at Bitcoin.com, does not think there will be an increase in the hash rate “considering we are not even settled yet after the halving” either, but, in his view, the rainy season will at least help to prevent further drops in Bitcoin’s hash rate. Meanwhile, some experts are much more positive about this year’s wet season. Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a consultant and the former CTO of Genesis Mining told Cointelegraph that she is expecting a surge:

“A large chunk of my clients have been unplugging last generation machines and moving them around, just because it’s still profitable at 0.03 kWh versus recycling the hardware. We’ve also seen a continual hash rate gain of 207% in 2017, 73% in 2018 and 104% in 2019. So, I expect to see a similar growth paradigm in 2020.”

New ASICs are coming

The mining market is currently in the bear phase, and margins “are thinner than ever,” according to Matt D’Souza, the CEO of Blockware Solutions, a mining hardware broker, told Cointelegraph, who added that in order to break that trend, more inefficient miners will have to quit the game, or alternatively, Bitcoin’s price needs to move up.

The quitters are being replaced by the next generation of mining devices like MicroBT’s M30 series and Bitmain’s Antminer S19 machines. Those units are capable of producing up to 100–120 TH/s, thereby mitigating the increased mining difficulty. Some of them have already been shipped out in limited quantities but have yet to become widespread among miners. Descoteaux told Cointelegraph:

“We will see a significant increase in hash rate when the S19 from Bitmain finally ships during the summer. The S19 is a significant improvement over even the S17. So, while miners are not really deploying more power, the overall efficiency gain of the network will result in greater net hash rate number.”

According to D’Souza, Chinese miners have been “aggressively” upgrading to the next generation equipment. “It is why they [new devices] are sold out through September.” He also believes that the start of the rainy season will increase the hash rate, but it is nonetheless unlikely to cause a massive spike.

Many farms had been switching over to newer ASICs months in advance, Minehan confirmed, although the coronavirus, shipping delays and material delays “caused a bit of a backlog.” According to her, “June, April and September will be the next upgrade periods. So, we can expect to see ‘increases’ in the net hash in those months.” She added: “Many of the Chinese miners are old hats — meaning this isn’t their first halving — and they have just been planning deployments accordingly.”","Sat, 30 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kNjY3NWM5NjM3ZGE5MjM3OWZlZDUzZTNhNzAyMzdjNC5qcGc=.jpg,"['rate', 'hash', 'jolt', 'electricity', 'local', 'rainy', 'mining', 'sichuan', 'season', 'bitcoin', 'needed', 'miners']", 
36,36,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Hong Kong's rush to attract China listings comes with a risk - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/hong-kongs-rush-to-attract-china-listings-comes-with-a-risk,"HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - Hong Kong exchange's race to attract big Chinese technology listings comes with one big risk, say money managers: The city's ability to keep the investing dollars flowing in as it's roiled by political tensions.

Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) has been pulling out all the stops to attract China's brightest stars as questions mount about their US listings. Approvals for JD.com and NetEase were greenlit in a matter of weeks due to rule changes and the fact that they already had listings. Approvals for initial public offerings typically take months.

The bourse is also pushing to cut the settlement time for listings to boost liquidity, an issue that has dogged multibillion-dollar deals in the past, causing dislocations to interest rates and the currency. Some investors now fear a flood in issuance will be hard to absorb and be left with little support, especially at a time when the international investor base the city needs is becoming increasingly worried about US retaliation after Beijing proposed a controversial new security law for Hong Kong.

""If the US creates measures barring US funds from investing in Chinese company IPOs (initial public offerings), or listings in Hong Kong, that could really hurt liquidity,"" said Louis Tse, Hong Kong-based managing director of VC Asset Management. There is already concern, he said, about the impact of the proposed security law on international investors.

While Hong Kong led the world in listings last year, turnover on the exchange is just about a quarter of the dollar value relative to US peers. Alibaba Group Holding has drawn just a fraction of activity in Hong Kong compared with New York after last year's US$13 billion secondary listing, partly due to a local stamp duty which curbs high frequency trading. Alibaba is not part of the link through which Chinese mainland investors can place money in Hong Kong, a decision that's being held up in Beijing.

The recent legislative push from Beijing has reignited large pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and fanned tensions with the US. US President Donald Trump has threatened to revoke Hong Kong's special trading status, which could potentially include the right to freely trade the dollar to which its domestic currency is pegged.

""There's concern that from the US's perspective they could view Hong Kong as a loophole for China to tap international capital,"" Michael Joseph, co-chief executive officer of Ion Pacific, a venture capital fund that operates in Hong Kong and the US. ""If the US really wanted to take a hard stance on China, they could plug the gap, which could spell trouble for Hong Kong.""

The upshot is that Hong Kong may end up with big names that attract but a modicum of investor interest - a situation that can only threaten its ambitions to catch up with London and New York.

DEEP, LIQUID

The exchange emphasised that its move in 2018 to allow weighted voting right companies such as Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping to list has been a success, with their daily turnover now accounting for 11 per cent of the total. Stock trading on the bourse has jumped 33 per cent this year, hitting HK$116 billion (S$20.81 billion) a day, in part due to volatility during the coronavirus pandemic. It recently announced a licence agreement with MSCI to introduce a suite of futures and options contracts.

""Hong Kong's international financial markets are broad, deep, liquid and resilient,"" HKEX said in a statement to Bloomberg. Its share price rose 0.2 per cent as at 11.27am in Hong Kong trading.

NetEase last week raised US$2.7 billion in its listing, while China's No 2 online retailer JD is seeking to raise as much as US$4.1 billion in a deal that is multiple times oversubscribed by institutional investors, people familiar with the matter said.

A welcome source of liquidity amid the turmoil is coming from China. Mainland money is flowing into Hong Kong at an unprecedented pace this year, primarily supporting Chinese state-owned firms. Mainland investors own about 2.9 per cent of the stocks eligible for cross-border trading, the highest since data became available in March 2017, according to Bloomberg calculations.

But that flow is still far from the quota limit of 84 billion yuan (S$16.49 billion) a day. Opening the link to the likes of Alibaba could go a long way in boosting inflows further.

The rush to list comes as a proposed bill in the US Senate could force Chinese tech companies to stop trading in New York by imposing greater accounting disclosure requirements, a move that's opposed by Beijing. Nasdaq has also tightened its rules for listings, primarily aimed at Chinese companies.

The Hong Kong bourse has also conducted a consultation on whether to allow corporate entities to hold weighted voting rights, which if passed might attract more of the portfolio companies backed by large corporates such as Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, according to Michael Yu, a partner at Cooley in Hong Kong.

""The Hong Kong exchange is trying to reform its regulatory framework in ways more similar to its US peers, by giving issuers and investors more flexibility,"" he said.

The bourse's plan to reduce the settlement time in IPOs from the current five days also won't likely be implemented until towards the end of the year at the earliest, Bloomberg reported earlier.

But the actual cost of trading has also hampered activity.

The bourse two years ago flagged it was evaluating rebates for market makers, easing collateral rules across multiple positions and removing or reducing the stamp duty. Little of that has materialised.

At the end of the day, not all companies will attract the same amount of interest as Alibaba, especially if secondary listings continue to build. Yum China Holdings is preparing for one and Baidu and Trip.com Group are also reported to be weighing the option.

Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, called it “very disturbing” and asked why YouTube was “censoring Americans on behalf of the CCP ”. Jim Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, fired off a letter to Sundar Pinchai, Google’s boss. One would expect, he wrote, that the “spirit” of the First Amendment would be extended into the American firm’s online platforms.

Google says the moderation of Wumao and other anti- CCP terms was an “error”, which it has fixed. YouTube’s moderation systems, which are highly automated, had not taken “proper context into account and incorrectly removed some comments”.

But what context did the systems miss, and why? Google will not say. The conspiratorial suggestions popular with more hyperbolic sectors of the internet commentariat do not wash. The idea that Chinese spies who had infiltrated YouTube would risk blowing their cover just to mess up the moderation system is nonsense. So too is the suggestion that Google is somehow being paid off by the CCP ; few issues cut across the partisan divide in American politics more effectively than the perception of a looming threat from China. For Google knowingly to censor any criticism of the CCP would have been political madness.

More likely, the explanation lies in the nature of the software Google uses to moderate content automatically, which uses a set of computer-science techniques called machine learning. Such software can update itself based on how users interact with the website, without any intervention from human programmers. This automated nature, combined with the software’s complexity, make it plausible for errors to arise in ways that are difficult to understand.

For example, if YouTube comments about Wumao and other CCP -critical phrases are flagged enough times by enough users as spam, hate speech or bullying, then the system could start removing them automatically. This could be the result of something as harmless as a furious comment war between pro- and anti-China factions, or of a campaign designed to influence the moderation software. Google says this was not the source of the error, but would not say what was.

It is also possible that the error occurred on Google’s side. Machine-learning systems need to be given context to understand the material they are to be used on, and Google probably contracted out the job of labelling the Chinese phrases that are being blocked. Its supplier may have labelled Wumao and other words as being in breach of Google’s community guidelines, without Google checking its work. Google declined to comment.

Problems with complex systems like this can be solved, but they are opaque not just through Google’s choice, but inherently through their technical design. If YouTube’s comment-moderation systems were nudged into the automated deletion of anti- CCP phrases, despite the application of the highest tech, similar holes will surely pop up in future.

The only way for Google to win this game of cat-and-mouse is to shut down YouTube comments entirely. Or it could gain an edge by spending a lot of money on humans to do the moderating. Neither is likely. Instead, such issues will probably keep providing sticks with which Mr Cruz and friends can beat the tech giant. With the outcome of a Department of Justice investigation into Google’s monopoly power looming, that may prove a liability. ■","Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200530_USP005_0.jpg,"['political', 'american', 'ccp', 'raises', 'eyebrows', 'youtubes', 'youtube', 'googles', 'comments', 'google', 'systems', 'wumao', 'antibeijing', 'removal', 'moderation']",

Officials in Henan are investigating a so-called ‘central kitchen project’ in Yucheng County, where four government-contracted catering companies were supplying school meals to 4,500 kids.

Distressing images from rural hospitals in the county showed young children hooked up to intravenous drips while others were slumped on chairs in waiting areas with their parents.

More than 100 children have been admitted to hospital since 10 June. County officials said most have been discharged, but some are still receiving treatment.

A spokesperson for the Yucheng Bureau of Education said multiple schools reported their pupils experiencing food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhoea.

The municipal health commission said pupils were arriving from the towns of Duji, Huangzhong and Zhanji.

A spokeswoman said: “All of our ambulances have been sent. All the victims are pupils. They’re coming from many towns.”

Similar reports have emerged in the larger city of Shangqiu, which administers Yucheng County, though education officials said they did not believe their cases to be related.

According to Chinese state media, four catering companies in Yucheng are being investigated as possible sources of the suspected food poisoning scandal.

The firms have been contracted by the local government for all public primary and secondary schools since May 2018.

47,47,FL-2020-000147-CHN,"In China, concerns grow about academic freedom and COVID-19 - Inside Higher Ed",https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/28/china-concerns-grow-about-academic-freedom-and-covid-19,"Concerns have been raised about the treatment of Chinese academics deemed to have strayed from official narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to news reports and testimony from some of those involved, there has been an increase in online harassment and censorship, and in some cases interventions by universities and the police, as Beijing bristles against international criticism.

The claims come as Wuhan Diary, a critical firsthand account of lockdown conditions by the popular author Fang Fang, is set to be translated into English.

Peidong Sun, a Chinese historian, told Times Higher Education that she faced criticism for speaking about academic freedom and the new coronavirus. After finishing her teaching loads for Fudan University in January, she left for France in early February, where she is now a visiting professor at Sciences Po.

Sun actively discussed the novel coronavirus on Chinese social media platforms, although many posts were deleted. In January, she wrote about 70 COVID-19 posts on her personal Weibo account, which had more than 50,000 followers. She also used Fudan’s WeChat groups to ask for preventive measures against the coronavirus, such as better mask distribution.

One Weibo post, which called for a statue to honor the late Li Wenliang, the doctor who was an early whistle-blower on the epidemic, drew criticism from a Communist Party official at the university, who, Sun alleged, asked her to delete the post. When Sun refused, she was removed from all of Fudan’s WeChat groups, she said in an essay published by the Council on Foreign Relations. Fudan did not respond to a request for comment.

Outside official channels, Sun has been the target of online abuse. “When I said I supported Fang Fang on Weibo, a flood of gangsters cursed me every day,” she said.

She felt that the space for debate had narrowed since the pandemic began. “The more of a crisis China has, the more attacks or punishments [there are] towards Chinese intellectuals, such as professors, lawyers and investigative journalists, who tell the truth about China issues,” she said.

Sun also felt that female internet users like herself were more likely to face online harassment.

Hubei University said on April 26 that it was investigating Liang Yanping, a Chinese language and literature professor, while Hainan University said on April 30 that it was investigating Wang Xiaoni, a poet and retired professor. The state media reported that they were being questioned for comments about Hong Kong and a shrine in Japan. However, the controversy over their now-deleted posts seems to stem mostly from discussions of Fang Fang. The universities did not respond to requests for comment.

In other cases, two constitutional law scholars were pressured after posting open letters and essays linking the coronavirus response to political reform.

In one of those cases, Tsinghua University has suspended and is investigating Xu Zhangrun, Hong Kong media reported in March. The month before, he had written an essay and signed an open letter critical of the government, and was subsequently placed under house arrest. Tsinghua declined to comment.

Katrin Kinzelbach, co-director of the master’s in human rights program at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) in Germany, said, “It is important to understand the persecution of individual scholars as one phenomenon of a larger pattern. By cracking down on a few professors, many more scholars are incentivized to self-censor.”

Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London, said China had been “reducing the scope for academic freedom for several years, and this clearly predates COVID-19. But the scope for academic freedom has certainly been reduced further since the pandemic.”

He added that the government’s priority was “to keep a tight control over the narrative, both domestically and globally. This includes putting forth the narrative that China is not to blame for the pandemic. Hence, it is essential that Chinese scholars, scientists or otherwise, as well as journalists, do not provide information, data or analysis that contradicts the government’s narrative.”

Clare Robinson, director of advocacy at Scholars at Risk, said, “Efforts by Chinese authorities to punish scholars amid the COVID-19 outbreak should be deeply alarming for all of us, regardless of our profession or where we reside.

“Especially during national and global crises, like COVID-19, scholars have a social responsibility to sound the alarm and publicly discuss the problem at hand, how governments and other stakeholders respond, and the conditions under which they’re operating, including respect (or lack thereof) for academic freedom.”","Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/THE%20Logo%20%282016%29_3_0_0.jpg,"['weibo', 'china', 'fang', 'university', 'covid19', 'concerns', 'scholars', 'freedom', 'grow', 'chinese', 'coronavirus', 'academic']", 
48,48,FL-2020-000147-CHN,OPINION: Decoding the Chinese sense of humour and geopolitics - THE WEEK,https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/05/31/opinion-decoding-the-chinese-sense-of-humour-and-geopolitics.html,"Anyone who has seen photographs of Chinese leaders, especially during the national party congresses, may feel that the Communist Party lacks a sense of humour. Indeed, the modern Chinese word for ‘humour’, youmo, was transliterated from English by Lin Yutang only in 1923. It can give the idea that the Chinese were not funny in the two thousand years prior.



The reality is that Chinese humour can often differ from traditional notions of comedy.



A typical version of Chinese sardonic humour comes in the form of what they call a “cold joke” (leng xiaohua); the joke is considered to be good when the hearers do not get it, and there is a resultant awkward silence. For example, when the raconteur says, “once upon a time, in Shanghai, there was a man called Zhao: one day he died”, those who get it would respond with “it is cold in here” or “there is a cold wind blowing”; for the rest, who do not get it, there would be an awkward silence.



When China told Mahinda Rajapaksa that Hambantota Port would be developed for the good of Sri Lanka, nobody would have said “it is cold in here” until Sri Lanka was forced to lease the port to China.



Ancient China was geographically a much smaller kingdom than the present-day People’s Republic of China. It was Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, who amalgamated China into the great Mongol Empire, made Beijing the capital and gave China the borders it has today. The Mongol Empire was so large that today there are 16 million people all over the world who can trace their genes back to Genghis Khan. The Chinese later acknowledged Genghis Khan as a Chinese Emperor and duly laid claim to his Empire, including Mongolia.



Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Manchuria are Mongolian gifts to China. The amalgamation of the rest of the great Mongol Empire has recently commenced through ‘historical claims’ and the One Belt One Road project.



The day is not far when China will announce that 16 million humans on the Silk Route have the Yuan Emperor’s genes and hence the present Emperor will rule over the areas where they live. Notice that nobody is saying, “it is cold in here”.



In the 1950s, China laid claim to approximately 3,400 square km of Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and carried out frequent border violations. Pakistani President Ayub Khan announced that the intrusions will be repelled with force. In 1959, after the Chinese ambush of Indian patrols in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, Ayub Khan proposed a joint defence union with India, stating that, “I can see quite clearly the inexorable push of the North in the direction of the warm waters of the Indian Ocean”.



The Chinese were very systematic in getting what they coveted. In 1963, they forced Pakistan to cede 3,400 sq km area of Kashmir to China, who had already started construction of the Karakoram Highway into PoK. The assimilation of Pakistan got underway with the establishment of the CPEC, the construction of Gwadar Port, the introduction of the Yuan as a currency for trade and the rise of Chinese companies calling the shots in Pakistan. After all, the great Chinese Emperor Genghis Khan’s descendants once ruled Pakistan and hence it belongs to China. Dare anyone say that there is a cold wind blowing?



The case of Bhutan is even “funnier”. In 1908, Maharaja Ugyen Wangchuk united the warring factions and became the King of Bhutan. During the coronation ceremony, China wrote to him saying that Bhutan, the Southern gate of the Chinese Empire, was under Chinese suzerainty and that the Amban (minister) proposed sending a Chinese officer there to report on the state of the economy. A few years earlier, the Chinese Amban in Tibet had sent badges of Chinese official rank, a seal, a hat, a button of imitation coral and a peacock feather, to Ugyen Wangchuk, who was then the Tongsa Penlop (one of the two prominent warring chieftains).



After the coronation, China ‘bestowed permission’ for him to wear those, which he declined. Bhutan and China came to have a boundary after the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, whence the process of assimilation commenced. Bilateral dialogue to resolve boundary disputes commenced in 1963 and so far, many rounds have been completed. Since Chinese claims are ‘historical’, they occupied the contested territory when they realised that they could not browbeat Bhutan through dialogue.

A typical example is the Doklam plateau, which PLA had been violating for a long time, despite protests from Bhutan. Sensing Bhutan’s inability to retaliate, they tried to expand further, when they were stopped by Indian forces. The CCP was surprised that anyone could doubt the claims of the Emperor. The Chinese public, of course, can only know what the CCP wants them to know. They will not sense the humour if, very soon, China announces that Doklam was always part of the OBOR leading to Siliguri. Will it be funny if Chinese money and tourists flood Bhutan and the King is forced to kowtow to the Emperor sometime in the future?

Next in line appears to be Nepal. In Article 2 of the Treaty of Thapathali, signed on 24 March 1856, Nepal and Tibet had agreed that the states of Gurkha and Tibet have both borne allegiance to the Emperor of China up to the present times. Both had to pay the price of being the Emperor’s neighbour. Tibet has already been assimilated into the Empire and the process of assimilating Nepal is probably underway.

The BRI has crossed the mighty Himalayas. Infrastructure development and establishment of a large number of Confucius centres will be followed by economic aid and the introduction of the Yuan as the currency for trade and political interference. The poor Nepalese are getting a lesson in Chinese humour, but apparently, they have not been able to feel the ‘cold wind blowing’ yet.

Xi Jinping has a great dream of China being a superpower, which probably came out of the book China Dream, by PLA Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu, which says that the rise of China will introduce a golden era of Asian prosperity, with Chinese trade, culture and values setting world standards. As history has been scripted by the CCP, 1.4 billion people must believe that the ‘son of heaven’ is doing them all a favour by presiding over ‘Tian Xia’, or all under heaven, much longer than the traditional 10 years. He has embarked on distributing his largesse by establishing a Silk Road to all corners of the world. In return, those who cannot afford to give tributes need only to kowtow to the emperor.

China’s economic power seems to have numbed everyone’s senses and no one can sense ‘the cold wind blowing’. Two events of interest in the future could be that Trump has understood the youmo and hence responds with a trade war, even as China constantly tries to extend the nine-dash-line—possibly to the far side of the moon. Is it possible that the coronavirus has improved the Chinese sense of Youmo?

49,49,FL-2020-000147-CHN,China approves controversial Hong Kong security law - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1560099,"BEIJING: China’s parliament approved plans on Thursday to impose a security law on Hong Kong that has ratcheted up tensions with the US and sparked new protests over fears the city is losing its special freedoms.

The vote by the rubber-stamp National People’s Congress (NPC) came hours after the United States revoked the special status conferred on Hong Kong, paving the way for the territory to be stripped of trading and economic privileges.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the status had been withdrawn because China was no longer honouring its handover agreement with Britain to allow Hong Kong a high level of autonomy. “No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China,” Pompeo said.

China made the security law a priority at its annual NPC session, after huge pro-democracy protests rocked the financial hub for seven months last year.

The law would punish secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and acts that endanger national security, as well as allow mainland security agencies to operate openly in Hong Kong.

On Thursday, the final day of the congress, delegates endorsed plans for the law with an almost unanimous vote and enthusiastic applause.

Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, said she welcomed the resolution being passed. As required in the resolution, Lam said she would submit regular reports to Beijing and “step up law enforcement and public education for safeguarding national security”.

But the law has met fierce criticism.

“It’s the end of Hong Kong .... They are cutting off our souls, taking away the values which we’ve always embraced, values like human rights, democracy, rule of law,” pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said.

Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist, said the security law “will kill Hong Kong’s democratic movements”.

NPC Standing Committee Vice Chairman Wang Chen said last week that Hong Kong’s delays in implementing its own security law had forced the Chinese leadership to take action.

US action

Under a US law passed last year aimed at supporting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, Washington must certify that Hong Kong still enjoys the promises of freedom made by Beijing when it negotiated with Britain to take back the colony.

But Beijing’s proposed security law “lies in direct conflict” with those commitments and put China in violation of its international obligations, the US and Britain said in a joint statement with allies Canada and Australia on Thursday.

A day earlier Washington signalled that the city could lose its trading privileges, including lower tariffs than the mainland, with the world’s largest economy.

US President Donald Trump will ultimately decide which actions to take, said David Stilwell, the top State Department official for East Asia.

He said the United States did not want to hurt the people of Hong Kong, adding: “This decision was made by the government in Beijing, and not by the US.”

China’s foreign ministry office in the financial hub said on Thursday that the US revoking Hong Kong’s special status was “the most barbaric, the most unreasonable and the most shameless”.

Under the “one country, two systems” model agreed before the city’s return from Britain to China, Hong Kong is supposed to be guaranteed certain liberties until 2047 that are denied to those on the mainland.

The mini-constitution that has governed Hong Kong’s affairs since the handover obliges the territory’s authorities to enact national security laws.

But an effort to do so in 2003 was shelved after huge protests by Hong Kongers.

China is motivated by fear of a younger Hong Kong generation that “does not agree with the political system of the Communist Party,” said Hua Po, an independent political commentator based in Beijing.

“If they lose control over Hong Kong, the impact on the Chinese mainland will be huge,” Hua said.

51,51,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Chinese factories humming doesn't mean everyone is buying - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/chinese-factories-humming-doesnt-mean-everyone-is-buying,"SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG, AFP) - China's factories are starting to hum again, but executives are now worried that the rebound could falter on weak demand at home and abroad.

Mr Justin Yu, a sales manager at Zhejiang-based Pinghu Mijia Child Product that makes toy scooters sold for American retailers, is among those seeing their order book improve from the depths of the coronavirus lockdown, but remain well below normal.

""We are seeing more orders coming in this month as we get closer to our normal peak season,"" Mr Yu said. ""But our orders are still 40-50 per cent lower than last year."" The factory's production capacity is running at about 70 per cent to 80 per cent, and Mr Yu is making to order to avoid any build up in stock.

The disconnect between China's recovering production and still dormant demand had shown up in data revealing a rise in inventories, though the latest figures show that easing. The worry remains that sustained overproduction will lead China's factories to keep cutting prices, compounding global deflationary headwinds and worsening trade tensions, before they eventually cut back on production and therefore jobs.

""The supply normalisation has already outpaced demand recovery,"" said Mr Yao Wei, China economist at Societe Generale. ""In other words, the recovery so far is a deflationary recovery.""

Purchasing manager index figures for May underlined the slow nature of the recovery, with the manufacturing outlook slipping back. The PMI was at 50.6 points in May, remaining above the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction each month. But the figure was down slightly from 50.8 the month before, and 52.0 in March, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

Given the weak export outlook, manufacturers such as Fujian Strait Textile Technology are switching their business models to target the home market. It used to sell 60 per cent of its products to Europe and the US before the coronavirus crisis wiped out those sales. Now, Mr Dong Liu, the company's vice-president, is looking for opportunities at home.

""Our company executives have started to visit the local market to make more potential clients know about us,"" he said. ""Since May 26, we have been producing 24 hours every day at full capacity. All the inventory has already been sold and we're rushing to make goods.""

But the domestic strategy isn't without its challenges. While China's consumers are largely free to resume their regular lives as fresh virus cases slow to a trickle, they just aren't spending like they used to.

Retail sales slid 7.5 per cent in April, more than the projected 6 per cent drop. Restaurant and catering receipts slumped by 31.1 per cent from a year earlier, after a 46.8 per cent collapse in March.

In Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, Ms Melissa Shu, an export manager for an LED car lighting factory, said although orders are steadily improving, there's no sense of urgency from her clients and the outlook remains uncertain.

""We're just making goods slowly,"" Mr Shu said. ""We are worried about the coming months.""

Some producers may be hoping for a real-life enactment of Say's law, a part of economic theory which suggests that ultimately supply will create its own demand, as long as prices and wages are flexible.

Another scenario is that industry self corrects, according to UBS Group chief China economist Wang Tao. She points to strong steel production during the depths of the coronavirus lockdown, even when demand was weak. Higher inventories mean that even as demand recovers, steel production won't show much of a pick up. And once producers know that orders are falling, they will adjust output.

""I do not think supply will outstrip demand for long - once inventories build up, or producers know orders are falling, production will come down as well,"" she said.

That could pose other problems though, especially as unemployment rises. Premier Li Keqiang in a press conference on Thursday (May 28) highlighted job creation as a critical priority for the government.

The urgency to create jobs may mean there's even less likelihood of a shake-up of state-owned companies in the heavy industrial sectors that have historically fuelled excess production.

The disconnect is already clear in data points that show, for example, stronger coal consumption by power plants and rising blast furnace operating rates by steel mills, while at the same time gauges for property and car sales are improving more slowly. That combination will drag on China's growth over the coming months, according to economists at Citigroup Inc.

The problem for China's industrial sector - due to its massive output - is that it really needs both local and global demand to be strong. If both are weak, it's clearly a dire outlook. But if local demand recovers and global demand doesn't, there are still problems.

""At the end of the day, China's economy is driven by demand and right now there is no demand,"" Mr Viktor Shvets, head of Asian strategy at Macquarie Commodities and Global Markets, told Bloomberg Radio.

A scenario where manufacturers capacity originally dedicated to the export market is retooled to produce for the home market instead would still lead to overproduction. Then the supply-demand mismatch would end up adding to deflationary pressures and a pose fresh headwinds to economic growth, according to Mr Bo Zhuang, chief China economist at research firm TS Lombard.

For now, China's factory owners are hoping it won't come to that.

52,52,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Google Removes Viral Indian App That Deleted Chinese Ones: 10 Points - Gadgets 360,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/remove-china-apps-google-play-store-removal-top-10-things-2239894,"Google has pulled an app from its Google Play store that helped users identify and remove apps of Chinese origin. The Mountain View, California-based company told Gadgets 360 that the “Remove China Apps” application violated Google Play policy. Before getting removed from Google Play, the app – developed by Jaipur-based OneTouch AppLabs – clocked over 50 lakh downloads in just over two weeks of its launch. It is the second viral app from India to be pulled from Google Play in a matter of days. Google has earlier removed Mitron, a TikTok clone.

Here are the top 10 points you need to know about this big story:

Google told Gadgets 360 that “Remove China Apps” application was violating its Deceptive Behaviour policy. The policy highlights various things that apps listed on Google Play can't do but one specific point is relevant in the case of “Remove China Apps” story. Google says it doesn't allow “apps that mislead users into removing or disabling third-party apps or modifying device settings or features.” While the app from OneTouch AppLabs claimed to be developed for “educational purposes,” it was capitalising on the anti-China sentiment prevalent across the country right now. The anti-China sentiment in the country has been sparked by the novel coronavirus pandemic, India-China border dispute, and more. A survey recently indicated that 67 percent of Indians hold China responsible for the spread of COVID-19. Remove China Apps made its debut on the Google Play store on May 17 and was downloaded over 50 lakh times before getting pulled, as per data from Google Play. It was not available on Apple App Store for iPhone users. Android is the prevalent mobile operating system in the country and as per StatCounter, it is used by 95 percent of mobile phone users in the country. The app also led the top free apps chart on Google Play and remained there for at least two days. After the removal of the app, Zoom is back on top of free apps list on Google Play, followed by government's contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu. Remove China Apps allowed users to identify and remove apps that were of Chinese origin on their smartphones. While it was able to identify popular apps, including the likes of TikTok, ShareIt, UC Browser, and CamScanner, from Chinese developers, it didn't detect apps that come pre-installed on phones from Chinese manufacturers. Remove China Apps was free and fairly easy to use, and didn't include any advertisements. To use the app, the Android users simply had to install it from Google Play store and give the necessary permissions. Following which, the users just had to tap on Scan Now to scan their phone and the app would list all the Chinese-origin apps installed on the phone. The app would also give a delete icon next to every app which when tapped would uninstall the app from user's smartphone. The app claimed to use market research data to identify which apps were of Chinese-origin. OneTouch AppLabs has remained tightlipped about the app and hasn't responded to media requests. It used Twitter and its website to announce the removal of “Remove China Apps” from Google Play late-Tuesday and simply wrote – “Google has suspended our #RemoveChinaApps from google play store. Thank you all for your support in past 2 weeks.” Apart from India, the Remove China Apps application was also gaining momentum in Australia, where according to data from App Annie, the app had topped the Tools section in Google Play store. Still, the majority of the app's users resided in India. Even though the app has been removed from Google Play store, it will continue to function on phones that already have it installed. Remove China Apps' removal comes soon after Google had pulled the Mitron app from Google Play store. Mitron was a clone of TikTok that also benefitted from anti-China sentiments and also saw lakhs of downloads. Despite issues the app still managed to find traction among users and went viral. TikTok, a popular short-video app, was also in news recently, in part because of the anti-China sentiment. TikTok is developed by ByteDance, a company that is headquartered in Beijing. Scores of smartphone users in the country took to Google Play and Apple App Store to downrank the app. Notably, apart from anti-China sentiments, the other key reasons for the 1-star rating flood were the ongoing YouTube vs TikTok debate on social media as well as a video glorifying acid attacks from a TikTok user.

Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose for a photo during their meeting in Naypyitaw in January 2020. / Myanmar State Counselor’s Office

YANGON—When Myanmar announced its seven-point economic relief plan to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 in late April, one item immediately raised eyebrows among China analysts in the country. The initiative’s third main objective is stated as “Easing the Impacts on Laborers and Workers”, and one of the ways the government intends to achieve this is putting laid-off laborers and returning migrants to work on “Implementation of Labor-Intensive Community Infrastructure Projects” before the end of this year.

At first glance, it seems a worthy goal, as it aims to benefit workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

However, with several megaprojects in the planning stages as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), experts are concerned that the COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP)’s emphasis on reviving the economy will see Myanmar push ahead with the implementation of BRI projects without properly assessing their risks in terms of conflict sensibility, potential for incurring unsustainable debt and commercial viability, among other criteria.

Adding to their worries, shortly after the plan was unveiled, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai and Myanmar’s Deputy Minister for Planning, Finance and Industry U Set Aung met to discuss how to move forward on the development of China’s ambitious projects in Myanmar in the context of the CERP. The New Yangon City; Kyaukphyu Deep-Sea Port and Industrial Zone; and China-Myanmar Cross-Border Economic Cooperation Zone projects—all of which were agreed during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Myanmar in January—were among those discussed at the meeting.

Furthermore, Xi expressed hope that Myanmar would speed up its cooperation with China on implementation of the infrastructure projects during a telephone conversation with Myanmar President U Win Myint in late May.

Since then, speculation has grown that the CERP’s third goal is tantamount to a green light for the projects.

However, The Irrawaddy learned this week from a senior official familiar with the matter that, so far, the infrastructure projects to be promoted under the CERP do not include any Chinese megaprojects.

The official confirmed to The Irrawaddy that BRI megaprojects are not among those listed in connection with the CERP, adding that there is no danger of the China-backed projects being rushed through or avoiding proper scrutiny.

“When it comes to choosing strategic infrastructure projects, they must already have been proposed but facing delays; they must be implemented by a reputable company with international experience; and the projects have to be commercially viable—not a burden on the country,” the official said.

The official added: “According to the criteria, BRI projects are not among those slated to be chosen.”

Based on the official’s comments, the three projects agreed during Xi’s visit—New Yangon City, the Kyaukphyu Deep-Sea Port and Industrial Zone, and the China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zones—seem far from meeting the criteria.

The Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in western Myanmar is expected to boost development in China’s landlocked Yunnan Province and provide China with direct access to the Indian Ocean, allowing its oil imports to bypass the Strait of Malacca.

Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee, head of the China desk at the Institute of Strategy and Policy (ISP)-Myanmar, told The Irrawaddy that the key BRI projects, including the Kyaukphyu SEZ, are not commercially viable.

“It would take at least 10 to 15 years to become commercially viable. But it is still not certain. Because the result will also depend on geopolitical factors, as the project’s implementation is being planned from a strategic perspective [of giving China access to the Indian Ocean],” Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee said.

The China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zones are planned as industrial hubs spanning the Shan State-China border. They will form part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC). The CMEC is envisioned as a corridor for transporting goods to and from Yunnan’s Kunming via Myanmar’s Muse along trade routes in Shan State through Mandalay to the Kyaukphyu SEZ in Rakhine State.

However, the corridor traverses highly volatile areas in northern Shan State that are currently plagued by frequent clashes between ethnic armed groups and government troops. Of the six major ethnic armed groups active along the China-Myanmar trade route in northern Shan State, five have not signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. Last year, a series of attacks launched by armed groups shut down border trade for several days. Experts have urged the government not to implement the projects without first securing a political settlement with the ethnic groups. They also warn that if the plan goes ahead without taking the armed conflict into consideration, it would aggravate the situation and provoke new grievances among local people.

U Khine Win, director of the Sandhi Governance Institute, agreed that the Kyaukphyu SEZ is not commercially viable.

He told The Irrawaddy that Kyaukphyu would be commercially viable only after interlinked projects are finished, such as the Muse-Mandalay railway project and Shan State’s cross-border cooperation zones—both of which are components of the CMEC. But he said the armed conflicts pose risks to the successful implementation of both those projects.

“It will take time,” U Khine Win said.

In late May, the CEO of New Yangon Development Company (NYDC), which is slated to develop the controversial New Yangon City project on the west bank of the Yangon River, said he was hopeful the project would commence this year and did not expect any change to the project plans. After reviewing the CERP, he was confident the project would move forward.

And in contrast to the views of the official quoted above, U Khine Win believed it was indeed possible that the BRI projects could be accelerated as the government takes steps to support mega-infrastructure projects under the CERP in a bid to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.

New Yangon City has been a source of controversy due to its flood-prone location as well as the involvement of China Communications Construction Company. The Hong Kong-listed, Chinese state-owned company has been accused of engaging in corruption and bribery relating to development deals in at least 10 countries in Africa and Asia, from the Philippines to Bangladesh to Tanzania, according to international media reports.

And even as China pushes Myanmar to implement the megaprojects, serious questions are being asked about whether Myanmar can still finance them given that its economy has slowed significantly due to COVID-19 and the government has committed to increasing spending on economic stimulus and improving social security and health care in the wake of the outbreak.

The Irrawaddy has learned that Myanmar has added a key condition to the CMEC Cooperation Plan stipulating that China must allow Myanmar to seek financing for the projects from multiple international financial institutions, especially the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to avoid incurring unsustainable debt obligations to China.

The official said that despite China’s push, the Myanmar government has firmly insisted that it will unbundle the projects to avoid implementing white elephant projects that are not commercially viable.

Recently, the Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry signed an agreement with Singapore’s Infrastructure Asia (IA) under which the latter will help Myanmar identify suitable investors and assess commercial viability—including by inviting international-standard tenders—for strategic infrastructure projects listed in the country’s Project Bank, an online database of priority projects aligned with the country’s sustainable development plan.

The Irrawaddy has learned that the government is also planning to add all the BRI projects to the project bank to ensure they are screened for commercial viability and adherence to the sustainable development plan. Moreover, it plans to seek more agreements with firms such as IA to consult on the implementation of strategic projects.

Daw Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee said, “The government is cautious when it comes to BRI projects. The preliminary agreement for the CMEC was reached in 2017. It has been more than two years, but implementation of the backbone projects is still being negotiated.”

She added, “I don’t see any projects that have gotten off the ground. That means the government is handling the Chinese projects carefully to avoid the potential risks.”","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.irrawaddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ASSK-China-e1591880780438.jpg,"['china', 'plan', 'project', 'recovery', 'favor', 'chinas', 'wont', 'bri', 'implementation', 'projects', 'covid19', 'official', 'economic', 'myanmar', 'kyaukphyu']",

During his daily press conference on Sunday afternoon, Minister of Health and Welfare and CECC head Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) announced that as the country had successfully surpassed 56 days, the equivalent to four incubation periods for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the CECC was easing a number of its epidemic prevention measures that day as scheduled. In anticipation of this, half a million Taiwanese flocked to Kenting, restoring visitor numbers to pre-pandemic levels.

According to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Directorate General of Highway (DGH) and police data, 27,000 cars headed south on Provincial Highway 1 to Kenting in Pingtung County and to Taitung County on Saturday (June 6), reported Liberty Times. Some 20,000 vehicles arrived in Kenting and the Hengchun Peninsula from Saturday to Sunday.

On Saturday alone, the Hengchun Peninsula and Kenting saw the arrival of 13,000 vehicles. According to the DGH, Kenting saw a total of 500,000 visitors over the weekend, marking the first time crowds of that size had been seen since the pandemic began.

Due to bad publicity stemming from complaints online about price gouging in its night market and hotels, Taiwanese tourists have shunned Kenting in recent years. Over the past six or seven years, travel to Kenting by Taiwanese steadily dropped, while arrivals from Hong Kong, Macau, and China rose.

Taiwan has not yet opened its borders to foreign tourists, and many overseas destinations are still heavily impacted by the pandemic. Therefore, the vast majority of travelers to Kenting over the weekend were Taiwanese citizens.

During the Tomb Sweeping Day vacation in April, when the CECC issued a nationwide alert, occupancy rates at hotels in Kenting plummeted to 10 percent. However, as the country has gone eight weeks without a new local coronavirus case, occupancy rates have risen to 60 percent.

However, these bookings are mainly concentrated on weekends. Now that many epidemic control restrictions have been rolled back and the summer vacation nears, local hoteliers anticipate a boom, including on weekdays, in the coming months.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/06/08/1591588114-5eddb51243531.jpg,"['restrictions', 'tourists', 'flood', 'cecc', 'vehicles', 'visitors', 'lifts', 'saw', 'taiwanese', 'weekend', 'vacation', 'epidemic', 'kenting']",

In the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody and the ensuing protests worldwide, the music industry called for June 2 to be turned into ""Blackout Tuesday,"" a day to press pause on business as usual and turn toward fighting racial injustice. Many other people joined the call for a day of action by posting images of black squares to social media. As of 9:30 a.m. PT on Tuesday, there were more than 17 million posts on Instagram using the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.

Floyd, an African American, died on May 25 after then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe."" Protests since then have been staged worldwide, many peaceful but with some erupting in violence.

Chauvin, who was fired, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Friday. The three other officers involved were also fired and are under investigation.

On Tuesday, Instagram acknowledged concerns about the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag being flooded with images of black squares. The company said people can edit posts to remove the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and their post will no longer be shown on Instagram's hashtag page, adding that it can take up to 10 minutes for a post to be removed once edited.","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/xAjUsWisfaBLLmPoqNKOzR8AfEw=/1200x630/2020/06/02/05b17b20-c3bb-4ac4-a9c9-6ce6cc7a297e/screen-shot-2020-06-02-at-11-12-10-am.png,"['images', 'instagram', 'flood', 'protesters', 'blacklivesmatter', 'post', 'information', 'hashtag', 'protests', 'black', 'squares', 'posts', 'tuesdays', 'silencing', 'blackout']", 
58,58,FL-2020-000147-CHN,America's Big China Mistake - Washington Monthly,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/06/07/americas-big-china-mistake/,"Since President Nixon’s historic “opening to China” in 1972 and President Carter’s formal recognition of the communist regime in Beijing, U.S. policy has been to promote trade and investment with China. I myself was a leader of the first U.S. trade mission to Beijing in 1982. Our strategy then and thereafter was founded on the notion that free global trade and investment would stimulate not only economic growth but also the spread of democracy and peace.

At the time, it seemed like a smart bet. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 statement that “to get rich is glorious” seemed to confirm our ideas. Both unleashed euphoria in the West. Francis Fukuyama’s book, The End of History and the Last Man, was widely acclaimed. Despite having shot at least several hundred and perhaps thousands of its own students in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, the Beijing regime was welcomed as a trading partner by the free world. Clinton campaigned for President under the slogan “no coddling of dictators from Baghdad to Beijing,” but as President adopted a policy of “positive engagement,” eventually negotiating to bring China into the World Trade Organization. Of China’s attempts to censor the internet, he joked: “I’d like to see them try to control the internet. It will be like trying to nail jello to the wall.”

But from early on, it should have been clear that this policy was misguided. The Clinton administration’s argument for bringing China into the WTO, widely supported by the economics and foreign policy establishment, was that doing so would liberalize China while dramatically reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Beijing. None of this took place. China became more authoritarian. The deficit mushroomed from about $80 billion annually to $500 billion. Many U.S. companies moved their factories to China to take advantage of cheap labor, the absence of unions, and the lack of safety and environmental regulations. Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), meanwhile, began to raise billions of dollars of new capital by listing their shares on the New York Stock Exchange without meeting the same accounting standards as U.S. corporations.

George W. Bush and Barack Obama adopted similar policies, with similarly dangerous consequences. In 2005, as they continued to move production to China, free-world companies began suffering theft of their innermost secrets by hackers with ties to Beijing. Few people raised alarm. Similarly, no one seemed to be concerned when in 2012, General Electric Chairman Jeffrey Immelt, then also Chairman of President Obama’s Commission on Jobs and Competitiveness, transferred GE’s U.S.-based avionics division to China as part of a joint venture with China’s state-owned Avic. Because avionics is not labor intensive, cost reduction could not have been the reason for the move. Clearly, China had let GE know that if it wanted to sell avionics in China, it would be best to make them there.

It was all evidence that, rather than disappearing, SOEs were consolidating and becoming ever more powerful—as was the Communist Party. China began subsidizing economic sectors such as the semiconductor industry in pursuit of international leadership. Its SOEs began investing heavily and strategically abroad in everything from ports in Europe to telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. The country began dredging reefs and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea, along with sinking the fishing boats of other nations—all as part of its plan to seize control of the Sea. It began mass arresting its Uyghur minority.

This was not at all in keeping with the long held free world expectations, and eventually, even the biggest cheerleaders of free trade began to admit that, far from becoming a “responsible stakeholder in the liberal, global order,” China was bent on becoming the hegemon of its own authoritarian order. On March 1, 2018, The Economist announced in its cover story that the West had made the wrong bet on China. It simply wasn’t becoming more market oriented or liberal.

By now there has already been talk of companies targeted by China’s industrial policies “de-coupling” from the country: leaving completely. They began to move production to places like Vietnam and even back to the United States. There has also been economic analysis by MIT Professor David Autor and others showing that the offshoring of U.S. jobs has contributed to overall unemployment, and that it has been a drag on working—and middle-class incomes.

Still, there’s resistance to departing China by many companies. Billions of their dollars have gone into putting factories and supply chains in China and training their workers. The cost of tearing it all down and moving elsewhere, even if elsewhere has cheaper labor, seems daunting.

Now, however, the COVID-19 virus, China’s continued militarization of the South China Sea, its drive for high-tech autarky, and its muscling of Hong Kong have put the cost question in a different light. Previously, few asked about the potential cost of over-dependence on fragile supply chains anchored to a single production site in a somewhat hostile country. What would be the costs to the company or to a country if that supply chain went down? What was the cost of not being able to obtain key drugs, masks, ventilators or anything else that you had once made but had long ago outsourced? The virus has revealed the answer to be “very high indeed.”

Simply questioning the Communist Party invites retaliation, as Australia discovered when it called for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus pandemic. The world is slowly realizing that the risks from dependency on China are much greater and more dangerous than ever imagined. The United Kingdom, once ready to embrace Huawei technology, has said it will not. Countries like Japan have already budgeted billions of dollars to assist their companies in bringing their factories back home. Germany and others have imposed strict limits on investment in their countries by Chinese companies. The United States must learn from this experience and these examples. Indeed, there is already a bill in the U.S. Congress to add $100 billion to the budget of the National Science Foundation specifically for the purpose of maintaining U.S. technology leadership over China. The Trump administration is also now limiting exports of some advanced U.S. semiconductor technology to China.

This is not to say that globalization can or should be halted. But it is to say that globalization must be guided by better understanding of its true costs and benefits—and by consideration of the welfare of all citizens, not just that of big corporations. No democracy with a rule of law can afford to be tightly coupled economically with an authoritarian China.","Sun, 07 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://kwtri4b8r0ep8ho61118ipob.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/35450047340_a03a259e40_b.jpg,"['beijing', 'china', 'americas', 'big', 'free', 'mistake', 'cost', 'policy', 'trade', 'companies', 'world', 'began', 'president']",

Brussels says China and Russia have sought to undermine European democracy and burnish their own reputations during the pandemic with ""targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns"".

The unusually blunt accusation came in an official EU strategy paper for tackling what officials say is a ""flood"" of false healthcare claims, conspiracy theories, fraud and hate speech surrounding the pandemic.

The report published today came a day after EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell held video talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Borrell insisted the EU was ""not starting anything"" with China, and said he had reassured Wang during their talks.

""I told him: 'Don't worry, Europe is not going to embark on any kind of Cold War with China',"" Borrell said.

The report, which also calls on web giants such as Twitter and Facebook to do more to tackle disinformation, accuses Moscow and Beijing of ""seeking to undermine democratic debate and exacerbate social polarisation, and improve their own image in the Covid-19 context"".

The row raises tensions ahead of a video summit later this month between EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese leaders.

EU-Chinese relations have hit a rocky patch as Brussels struggles to calibrate its response to Beijing's growing assertiveness under President Xi Jinping.

The bloc has characterised Beijing as a ""systemic rival"" - to the disgruntlement of Chinese officials - and sought to challenge it on human rights issues such as Tibet and Hong Kong.

But the EU has struggled to maintain a united front as 27 national governments pursue their own political and economic interests with the Asian giant.

On Wednesday morning, the RM announced that as of June 9 it has declared a local state of emergency, saying its efforts are focused on saving roads that are still passable. It said if roads have been washed out, they will not be prioritized as crews work to save existing ones.

""The situation overnight has not improved,"" the RM said on its website. ""The RM of Piney staff understand the significant impact this is having on residents and we are doing our best to cope with the situation.""

Wayne Anderson, the reeve of the RM of Piney, said the state of emergency was called because of the amount of rain that fell in a short period of time.

""We declared a statement of emergency due to the overland flooding. It is damaging our roads. We don't know what extent this is going to play out,"" said Anderson.

He added that he expects the state of emergency to be in place for the next week.

Anderson said no one has been evacuated yet, but the RM continues to monitor the situation.

""Our RM is a little more fortunate that a lot of houses are on higher land,"" he said. ""Most of the damage is to the roads because they wind through lower areas.""

He added some homes have only one access point to their property and the RM has been in contact with those owners, but Anderson said the owners have decided to stay for the time being.

The RM encourages residents in the area to contact the RM office or Richard Gamble, the emergency coordinator, if their home or well-being is affected by roads and weather conditions.

The RM said it is working with provincial agencies to assess the risks to residents in the area.

Anderson said he has never seen a flooding incident like this in the RM before and he is encouraging residents to not go out to see the damage and to stay home and stay safe.

More information can be found on the RM of Piney website.

MANDATORY EVACUATIONS CONTINUE IN STUARTBURN

This state of emergency comes as mandatory evacuations continue in the RM of Stuartburn.

The following addresses are required to leave due to potential danger caused by flooding:

14036 RD 43E

14148 RD 43E

14162 RD 44E

14127 RD 44E

44075 RD 14N

15033 RD 44E

15038 RD 44E

The order was given on Wednesday morning, after the first evacuations were ordered Tuesday night.

Lucie Maynard, who is the chief administrative officer for the RM, said the situation has not improved.

""We've had to do a bit of aqua damming in the community of Vita. So we had some water going over some mile roads nearby causing some concern for the town here,"" said Maynard.

She added transportation is also becoming a problem in the community.

""I think right now the biggest concern is access. A lot of the roads have flood water over them, so the travel is obviously not advised and in some cases, they're impassable. So when you are down to only one exit you kind of need to tell the members just to leave.""

She added some people are choosing to stay because they have livestock but Maynard said they have to know the risks and that services like EMS will not be able to get to them.

Maynard said more than 80 people have been impacted by the evacuation notice. If people don't have someone to stay with, she said they are being advised to go to the Days Inn in Steinbach.

She said the good news is no other houses have been overtaken by floodwater, besides the original four, which were reported on Tuesday.

More information can be found on the RM of Stuartburn Facebook page.

ROAD CLOSURES

The province said Highway 203, between Woodridge and Garrick, is closed as of Wednesday morning due to overland flooding.

The road closures come as southeastern Manitoba continues to deal with flooding following significant rainfall in the region since the weekend.

On Monday, Highway 210, from the junction of Highway 12 to Rat River, was closed due to flooding. It is still listed as closed on Manitoba 511 as of Wednesday morning.

62,62,FL-2020-000147-CHN,India and Pakistan brace for worst locust attack in 27 years - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/India-and-Pakistan-brace-for-worst-locust-attack-in-27-years,"NEW DELHI -- In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, India and Pakistan are battling another crisis -- their worst locust attack in nearly three decades.

The flying insects have crossed over to India in a wave of desert swarms from neighboring Pakistan, sweeping several parts of the country and threatening to damage crops.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted in a Sunday radio address that many parts of the country have been affected by locust attacks, adding that efforts are on to help farmers and reduce crop losses by using modern techniques to tackle the crisis. ""I am sure that together not only will we be able to battle out this crisis that is looming on our agricultural sector, but also manage to salvage our crops,"" Modi said.

Among Indian states affected by the desert locusts, one of about a dozen species of short-horned grasshoppers, are northwestern Rajasthan, northern Punjab, western Gujarat and central Madhya Pradesh. Several other states as well as the territory that includes the national capital have also sounded the alarm over a potential attack in their regions.

In Pakistan, the desert locusts have reportedly entered from Iran, and have already devoured considerable quantities of crops in over 60 districts in all provinces, including Balochistan in the southwest. Media also say the country is intensifying efforts to combat the plague with pest control systems including spray aircraft.

The local government in the Indian capital region where New Delhi is located has directed authorities to take preventive measures to control and eradicate the locusts to avoid the ""devastating effect on standing agricultural and horticultural crops, vegetation, plants, gardens, orchards"" and other potential targets of the insects. It is considering measures including creating awareness among the public and farmers about the attack and spraying insecticide and pesticide on crops.

In India's worst-hit areas, people have also resorted to tactics such as banging utensils and playing loud music to scare away the pests.

India experienced its worst locust attack in 1993 when it witnessed 172 swarm incursions. According to a 2014 document issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, ""technical assistance and capacity building were provided to India and Pakistan [in 1993] that successfully prevented swarms from migrating to other regions."" India treated 311,199 hectares (3,112 sq. kilometers) of area by air and ground operations and Pakistan treated a total of 316,979 hectares, it said.

Locusts are an omnivorous and migratory insect that can fly hundreds of kilometers in swarms and easily cross national boundaries. Apart from Africa and Asia, it is also found in the Middle East, and inhabits some 60 countries. A swarm one sq. kilometer in size contains about 40 million locusts, which eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people, according to the FAO.

The attack is a double blow for India as it comes amid the spread of the coronavirus. Confirmed cases as of Monday climbed to 190,535 with 5,394 deaths.

Narendra Singh Tomar, India's minister for Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, last week reviewed the country's locust control operations during a high-level meeting.

In a statement, the government said it is set to procure 60 insecticide sprayers from Britain. It added, ""drones will be used to spray pesticides on tall trees and inaccessible places for effective control of locusts, while plans are afoot to deploy helicopters for aerial spray.""

""This type of locust attack is usually seen in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular eastern African countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia,"" Sandip Das, an agriculture and food security expert, told the Nikkei Asian Review. Das said that this year's attack is ""much more"" intense than one last year.

Das added, however, that most of the wheat harvest in India is complete, with fields now being prepared for rice planting once the monsoon rains start this month. ""So, there won't be extensive damage to big crops, though fruits and vegetables"" could be affected by the attack, he said.

Usually the locust swarms enter India through Pakistan for summer breeding in June or July with the advent of the monsoon. But this year, Indian officials say, the pink swarms started much earlier in April because of presence of a residual population in Pakistan that couldn't be controlled last season.

Pink immature adults fly high and cover long distances during daytime hours before settling on trees at night. They are very active and their mobility makes it difficult to control individual swarms.","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F1%252F3%252F5%252F1%252F27401531-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1590972633RTS33UMO.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['locusts', 'pakistan', '27', 'worst', 'including', 'india', 'crops', 'brace', 'control', 'attack', 'indian', 'locust', 'swarms']", 
63,63,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Jet stream: Is climate change causing more 'blocking' weather events? - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/jet-stream-is-climate-change-causing-more-blocking-weather-events,"The past few months have seen some remarkable weather, from the UK’s sunniest spring on record to Siberia’s dramatic heatwave and “zombie wildfires”.

Key to this unseasonable weather are persistent high-pressure “blocking” weather systems, which bring clear, dry conditions on the ground below for many days or weeks.

Blocking events bat away oncoming low-pressure systems that would bring the prospect of clouds and rain. They are particularly synonymous with heatwaves and drought in summer and bitterly cold conditions in winter.

But what are the prospects for blocking events in a warming climate? And could a rapidly warming Arctic also have a role to play?

In this Q&A, Carbon Brief takes a closer look at the causes of blocking events and the potential changes in the future.

What is ‘blocking’?

Around the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, low-pressure weather fronts, which bring cloudy, windy and potentially wet weather, generally move from west to east. These are carried along by the jet stream – a current of fast-flowing air high up in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere. (Jet streams encircle the mid-latitudes of both the northern and southern hemispheres.)

The jet generally keeps a steady stream of weather systems moving across the Earth’s surface. This means that any low-pressure system – or intervening high-pressure system that brings clear, still and sunny conditions – will generally only linger for a matter of days before being shunted on by the next system.

However, sometimes weather systems can get stuck in place for an extended period of time. This is known as “blocking”, explains Prof Tim Woollings, associate professor of physical climate science at the University of Oxford, Oxford joint chair of the Met Office Academic Partnership, and author of a book on the jet stream. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Blocking is a stationary and persistent weather pattern, most often an anticyclone [high-pressure system], that blocks the oncoming jet stream and storms.”

With a high-pressure weather system in the way, the oncoming weather is either deflected away or it, too, stays put. This can bring extended periods of consistent weather, says the UK’s Met Office:

“In terms of the weather you will get, this means that under the high pressure the weather will remain mainly dry and settled for a few days or perhaps weeks. However, if you are in the area where the weather fronts are, you are likely to get wet and windy weather for a long time.”

This persistent weather can cause extreme conditions. The UK has just experienced its sunniest and fifth driest spring on record, an extraordinary about-turn after the wettest February on record just months earlier. Prof Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, described this wet-to-dry shift as “unprecedented”.

As the Met Office explained in a guest post for Carbon Brief, the remarkable spring weather was a result of a blocking weather pattern:

“This spring, the jet stream buckled and shifted northward, allowing successive areas of high pressure to dominate the UK. These ‘blocking’ patterns of high pressure are the main reason for the extended periods of sunny, dry and relatively warm conditions that we have seen this spring.”

At the same time, the usually chilly expanse of Siberia has been simmering in unseasonable heat. Average temperatures during May, for example, were 10C above the norm – reigniting wildfires still simmering from last year. This extended period of heat was also the result of a blocking weather pattern.

Blocking is most common in spring, the Met Office says, but is often most associated with dramatic heatwaves in summer and severe cold during winter.

For example, blocking was a driver of the heat and drought of the UK’s 1976 summer, the deadly European summer heatwave of 2003, Siberia’s heatwaves and wildfires in the summer of 2013, and Europe’s extreme cold winter of 2009-10. A blocking pattern – in different positions – brought the US a record-breaking warm March in 2012 and record-breaking cold March in 2013.

Blocking has also been shown to affect the paths of tropical cyclones, potentially steering them on unusual tracks.

There are certain regions where blocking “preferentially occurs”, says Prof Len Shaffrey, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

“In the northern hemisphere, these are on the northern and eastern sides of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans – so for the North Atlantic that means over Greenland and Europe.”

The maps below, from a 2018 review paper by Woollings and colleagues, give an indication of the frequency of blocking events across the northern hemisphere over 1958-2012. They show the percentage of days in the season with blocking for winter (top) and summer (bottom) according to three different methods of characterising blocking events. The darker the orange shading, the more days of blocking.

The estimates vary quite a bit between method, region and season, Woollings notes, but “typical numbers for blocking regions – over Eurasia, the Atlantic and Alaska, for example – would be one or two events per season, with each event lasting about a week on average”.

It is worth noting that blocking happens in the southern hemisphere, too, adds Woollings:

“[Blocking] tends to be less persistent in the southern hemisphere as the westerly jets are stronger. Despite this, they do have some important impacts, such as over Australia, New Zealand and southern South America.”

For example, blocking events were behind the record hot, dry weather that saw devastating bushfires during Australia’s 2019-20 summer, and a major drought in southeastern Brazil in 2014-15.

What causes blocking?

So how do these blocking weather patterns arise? Woollings points out that “there are several different mechanisms involved and the balance between these seem to be different in different regions“.

In general, however, “Rossby waves” in the atmosphere are “thought to be crucial”, says Woollings. Rossby waves – named after Carl-Gustaf Rossby, the Swedish-born American meteorologist who identified them – are giant meanders in the jet stream that stretch across the mid-latitudes. They are also known as “planetary waves”.

Rossby waves are a natural phenomenon that form as a result of the rotation of the Earth. As they are a feature of rotating fluids, they are also observed in the oceans and in other planets, such as gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

Blocking weather patterns can occur when Rossby waves “become amplified and/or break”, says Woollings. Amplified Rossby waves can be seen in a “wavy” jet stream. This tends to slow the east-to-west progression of weather systems, making conditions more persistent and, potentially, allowing blocks to form.

An example is the “omega block”, so-called because it resembles the uppercase letter omega (Ω) in the Greek alphabet. In this shape, alternating areas of high and low pressure form in the peaks and troughs of the Rossby waves, respectively.

The video below, by the UK Met Office, explains how omega blocks – and an alternative form of blocking called the “diffluent block” – can form over the UK. (There are several other patterns of blocking too.)

A block interrupts the prevailing flow of westerly winds, which typically bring in mild air during winter and cooler, fresher conditions in summer. Therefore, it opens up the potential for more extreme conditions, depending on which type of weather system is overhead.

In the summer of 2010, for example, an omega block left a high-pressure system sitting over western Russia for much of July and August. The resulting heatwave saw most of western Russia record its hottest summer in history. As a 2011 paper on the event explains:

“The heat over Russia produced many days where the high temperature was greater than 40C (104F). Russia had a record-warm summer, with Moscow averaging near +18C and +16C above normal for the months of July and August, respectively.”

The hot, dry and still weather also brought the worst drought conditions in roughly 40 years. In total, the heat, wildfires and associated poor air quality caused at least 56,000 deaths in Moscow and other parts of western Russia.

But while Russia was baking in the heat, a few thousands miles to the southeast, Pakistan was sitting under a low-pressure system that was part of the same omega block. Unusual wind patterns caused by the block pushed monsoon rains north and west, bringing heavy rains to northern parts of Pakistan.

Nationwide rainfall totals for Pakistan were 70% above average in July and 102% above in August. The resulting floods affected more than 18 million people, caused 1,985 deaths and damaged or destroyed 1.7m houses.

Have blocking events changed as the climate has warmed?

As blocking events can bring such extreme conditions, an important question is how their frequency and severity is being – and is likely to be – affected by a warming climate.

However, there are a couple of reasons why this is less than straightforward. First, there is no set definition for a block, explains Woollings:

“Blocks come in various shapes and forms, so that while meteorologists would all agree on what a cyclone is, there are often different views on whether a particular weather pattern should be classed as a block or not.”

The 2018 review paper by Woollings and colleagues – mentioned earlier – noted that a “bewildering range of indices” have been developed to identify blocking events. It added:

“A major weakness in dynamical meteorology is that there is currently no comprehensive theory capturing the different processes acting at all stages of the blocking life cycle: onset, maintenance and decay.”

This makes it more difficult to monitor and track changes in blocking events, as well as directly compare results from different studies.

Second, “blocking is a sporadic weather pattern and, hence, highly variable from year to year, even from decade to decade”, says Woollings. This means that blocking events will naturally vary a lot from one year – or decade – to another, so a clear view on any long-term trend is muddied by short-term fluctuations.

Overall, Woollings says “there are no clear trends in blocking seen against this noise”. Shaffrey agrees:

“Historical weather records suggest that blocking hasn’t changed significantly over the past few decades. However, this is somewhat dependent on the method used to define blocking events.”

One possible exception is over Greenland, Woollings notes, which has seen an increase in summer blocks since the 1990s. However, it is not yet clear whether this is down to natural variability or not, he says:

“Several methods give about a 1-in-20 chance of this trend occurring by chance, so it seems interesting. But then, if you test 20 different combinations of region and season, you would indeed expect one of these to show such a change purely by chance.”

A 2018 paper says the increase in blocking could have “been triggered by low-level regional warming promoted by surface feedbacks” – such as increased snowmelt and ice melt on Greenland, and Arctic regional sea ice losses – or changes in the jet stream, but this is currently “unknown”.

How might climate change affect blocking in future?

For scientists making projections of how blocking might be affected by continuing climate change, there is another hurdle: climate models generally struggle with simulating blocking, and have the tendency to underestimate both the frequency and duration of events.

In general, models “predict a general decrease in blocking occurrence in the future”, says Woollings. He explains:

“The dynamics of blocking is focused up at jet-stream level in the atmosphere and here models predict the strongest warming in the tropics. This strengthens the jet-stream winds, making it harder for blocks to form.”

Earlier this year, for example, Woollings discussed in a Carbon Brief guest post how recent tropical warming has changed the pattern of Rossby waves, which contributed to the deadly 2010 Russia heatwave.

However, while there is “good agreement between models” on this theory, Woollings warns that “we should still be cautious because it is not clear that the models are capturing the physics correctly”.

The maps below – also from the 2018 review paper – show projections for northern-hemisphere blocking in winter (top) and summer (bottom), according to three different methods of characterising blocking events. The shading indicates projected increases (orange) and decreases (blue) in the percentage of blocking days in the season, between 1961-90 and 2061-90, under the very high emissions RCP8.5 scenario.

The maps highlight the regional differences in the projections. As Shaffrey explains:

“For example, wintertime blocking over western Europe is projected to decrease slightly, while blocking is expected to increase in eastern Europe associated with shifts in the jet stream over the North Atlantic Ocean.”

For the summer, the maps suggest that blocking will shift polewards, reducing the number of events in the mid-latitudes, but increasing them in high latitudes. This is reflected in other research, too.

Glossary RCP8.5: The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. Close The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. RCP8.5 is a “ very high baseline ” emission scenario brought about by rapid population growth, high energy demand, fossil fuel dominance and an absence of climate change policies. This scenario is the highest of the RCPs and sees atmospheric CO2 rise to around 935ppm by 2100, equivalent to 1,370ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e). The likely range of global temperatures by 2100 for RCP8.5 is 4.0-6.1C above pre-industrial levels. The release of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) has introduced a number of additional “no-new-policy” scenarios, meaning RCP8.5 is no longer the sole option available to researchers as a high-end no-mitigation pathway.

Model projections also indicate declines in blocking for the southern hemisphere. A 2019 study, for example, estimated that the number of winter blocked days over Australia and New Zealand could fall by about one third by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5.

It is worth noting that the projected declines in blocking are “quite gradual”, says Woollings, which means it is “not going to go away any time soon”:

“Blocking will likely play a central role in extreme weather events over the coming decades, particularly mid-latitude heatwaves.”

An angle that has received less attention is regarding the size of blocking events. But research published in 2019 suggests that the spatial extent of blocks is likely to increase with climate change.

Using two climate models and the RCP8.5 scenario, the researchers project that the area of blocking events could increase by up to 17% and 7% in the northern hemisphere summer and winter, respectively (by 2076-2100, compared to 1981-2005). For the southern hemisphere, projections indicate a decline in block area in summer (up to 2%) and an increase in winter (up to 8%).

The reason for the increase in size is down to expected changes in different characteristics of the jet stream, explains co-author Dr Pedram Hassanzadeh from Rice University in the US. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Specifically, we found that the speed of the jet stream’s winds, the latitude of the jet and the width of the jet determine the size of the blocking events. All these three characteristics of the jet streams are known to change as the climate warms.”

For example, he says, “over the North Atlantic region in summers, the jet stream becomes wider and shifts to the north, leading to an increase in the size of the Euro-Atlantic blocking events”. And over the North Pacific region in winters, “the jet stream becomes wider and faster and shifts to the north, all together leading to larger blocking events over the western Pacific Ocean and eastern North America”.

Hassanzadeh’s ongoing work also suggests that moisture levels can affect the size of blocking events. As a warmer climate is likely to bring more evaporation and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, this could also affect blocking events. Hassanzadeh and his colleagues are “currently working on validating this hypothesis and understanding the mechanism”, he says.

(A study from 2015 was the first to suggest that moisture is important for blocking more generally. Woollings describes this as “one of the biggest new ideas on blocking in recent years”.)

The risk of larger blocking events is that they could lead to extreme events that affect more people, Hassanzadeh says:

“Blocking events can cause, among other weather extremes, severe heatwaves in summer. If the blocking events get bigger, we can expect heatwaves that cover a larger area and thus have more impact on the public health and wider ecosystem.”

What role does a warming Arctic play?

While models – tentatively – suggest that blocking events could decline in the mid-latitudes, there is also a prominent theory that a rapidly warming Arctic could bring more of them.

The Arctic is warming more than twice as quickly than the global surface average. This phenomenon is known as “Arctic amplification”. In part, this stems from the rapid loss of sea ice cover in the region – as the ice diminishes, energy from the sun that would have been reflected away by the bright white ice is instead absorbed by the ocean, causing further warming. (Declining snow cover over Arctic land areas has the same effect.)

There are some theories that these rapid changes in the Arctic “might influence the frequency of blocking events”, explains Shaffrey:

“The theories suggest that as the Arctic warms, changes in the strength and position of the northern hemisphere jet stream will allow blocking events to become more frequent.”

For example, as the strength of the jet stream is driven by the difference in temperature between the cold air over the Arctic to the north and the milder air to the south, a fast-warming Arctic reduces this temperature difference.

This could weaken the jet stream, making it more susceptible to developing the large meanders that allow blocks to form.

There are other mechanisms of how a warming Arctic could affect the mid-latitudes, which Carbon Brief explored in a detailed Q&A in early 2019.

Research has suggested that Arctic amplification has contributed to some recent mid-latitude extremes in the northern hemisphere – including very cold winters in the US and Asia and the Russian 2010 heatwave.

However, “there’s still a lot of debate in the scientific literature about whether these theories are supported by observations and climate-model experiments”, says Shaffrey.

And any impact that the Arctic has could be outweighed by influences from elsewhere, adds Woollings:

“As Arctic warming strengthens, we expect it to impact the jet stream and this could act to increase blocking in some regions. Climate models currently suggest the competing influence of the warming tropics will be more important, consistent with an overall decrease in blocking.”

Nonetheless, Woollings concludes: “Arctic warming is one of the processes in the mix of several which will shape blocking behaviour in the future.”

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Local officials in Yilan are calling for the government to change the name of Taiwan's Diaoyutai Islands to the Toucheng Diaoyutai Islands (頭城釣魚台) on Monday (June 8) to counteract the name change proposed by Japan's Ishigaki City.

According to The Asahi Shimbun, the Ishigaki City Government is slated to submit a proposal to its city assembly with the intent to change the administrative designation of the area containing the Diaoyutai Islands from Tonoshiro to Tonoshiro Senkaku. Ishigaki Mayor Yoshitaka Nakayama defended the proposal in an interview with the news agency, saying that the change is meant to streamline administrative work by further dividing the Tonoshiro area, which at present contains both the Diaoyutai Islands and central parts of Ishigaki.

The sovereignty of the East China Sea islets has long been disputed by Taiwan, Japan, and China. In 2012, after the Japanese government nationalized the islands by buying them from their owners, the conflict between the three nations over the maritime assets reached a boiling point, UDN reported.

The Taiwan-Japan Fisheries Agreement signed in 2013 was seen as a temporary solution to secure the rights of Taiwanese and Japanese fishermen in the East China Sea without touching the sensitive issues of the islets' ownership. However, the latest developments have potentially sparked a new round of conflict.

Yilan County councilor Tsai Wen-i (蔡文益) said the Diaoyutai Islands belong to Yilan's Toucheng township and that the Japanese have no right to change the name. He added that the name change affects not only sovereignty but also fishing rights, calling such a decision arbitrary.

The county's magistrate, Lin Zi-miao (林姿妙), swore to visit the islets with supporters in order to place a marker for Toucheng. Democratic Progressive Party Councilor Chen Chun-yu (陳俊宇) suggested that the Japanese government respect Taiwan's voice instead of damaging the precious friendship the two countries had established.

On the other hand, Mayor Nakayama has stated that Ishigaki City's proposed name change is based on an existing system.","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/CNA/20160610/20160610/6760799.jpg,"['islands', 'diaoyutai', 'ishigaki', 'toucheng', 'tonoshiro', 'china', 'officials', 'change', 'taiwans', 'japanese', 'push', 'islets', 'taiwan']", 
65,65,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Smallholder coffee farmers fight climate change and oversupply - Diálogo Chino,https://dialogochino.net/en/agriculture/35703-smallholder-coffee-farmers-fight-climate-change-and-oversupply/,"In October 2018, a caravan of over 7,000 Central American migrants set off on a perilous journey by foot to try and cross Mexico and eventually reach the US.

Around three-quarters of people who attempt to migrate in large groups from Mexico to the US are from Honduras, according to a UN survey of people arriving at Tijuana in autumn 2018. Of those surveyed, 28% had worked in agriculture.

Honduras is the world’s sixth-largest producer of coffee, but in recent years poor weather and a deteriorating economic climate have driven scores of farmers to abandon their farms and flee north. In 2019 alone, land use for coffee production in Honduras decreased by 5%, or 19,000 hectares.

Coffee farms in Central America are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as small variations in temperature and rainfall can have a significant impact on yields and profitability.

“Arabica [coffee] requires cool temperatures of 18-21C and very specific amounts of rainfall, conditions that are generally found in the tropical highlands. As temperatures rise, areas where coffee can grow become more limited,” according to Raina Lang from Conservation International.

By some estimates, changing temperatures and rainfall could lead to a 38%-89% reduction in the land available for coffee farming in Central America by 2050. The potential loss for Honduras could be up to 50%, says Lang.

100,000

acres of coffee plantations were lost in Colombia between 2018 and 2019

The situation is also dire in Colombia, where unpredictable weather has driven many of the country’s estimated 500,000 smallholder farmers out of business. Between 2018 and 2019, Colombia lost close to 100,000 acres of coffee plantations, equivalent to over 4% of the country’s total, according to the National Federation of Coffee Growers (Fedecafé).

Brazilian beans flood the market

In addition to climate change, smallholder coffee farmers across Latin America face a tough economic situation resulting from oversupply and low international prices.

In 2018, Brazil, which accounts for around one third of global coffee output and exports, produced a record 62 million bags. This significantly increased global supply and sent international benchmarks prices to their lowest levels in 13 years. Last year its share of global coffee exports rose from 29% to 32%. It is expected to go up again in 2020.

Brazil’s 2018 bumper harvest also coincided with a weak currency, which further undermined the competitiveness of other regions.

Dramatically lower prices meant that Central American farmers were no longer able to cover their costs, estimated to be 30% higher than those of Brazil because their operations are smaller and they focus on premium varieties.

China’s growth market

In China, coffee consumption has been increasing at an average annual rate of 16% in the last decade, taking the value of its market to an estimated US$43 billion as of 2020.

Luckin Coffee, which in three years has become China’s largest coffee chain with 4,500 branches, surpassing Starbucks’ 4,300, best exemplifies this growth.

Most of Luckin Coffee’s locations are akin to “cloud kitchens” – open spaces with no seating that focus on deliveries and pickups, enabled by its strong technology platform. The company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May 2019, fetching a valuation close to US$3 billion.

Seattle-based Starbucks has had its own remarkable Chinese growth story, and was credited by many for acquainting local palates with coffee and laying the groundwork for the subsequent boom. Since opening its first Beijing store in 1999, Starbucks has made China the focus of its strategy for global growth. In 2017 the company launched the Reserve Roastery Shanghai, then the world’s largest Starbucks.

In spite of remarkable growth, China’s is still only a fraction of the size of more mature markets.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, China’s yearly coffee consumption is 3.3 million bags, equivalent to only 12% of the 27.3 million bags consumed in the US. Europe is the world’s largest market, consuming 46.2 million bags. Brazil is third with 23.5 million.

Although China is currently only the world’s ninth-largest importer of coffee, the country is seen as an increasingly important destination for producers such as Brazil and Colombia.

Brazil’s coffee exports to China more than doubled between 2015 and 2019, according to Eduardo Heron Dos Santos of the National Coffee Exporters Council (Cecafe), in an interview for Xinhua. Brazil exported 177,000 bags to China in 2019.

Dos Santos attributes this growth to the increasing popularity of coffee amongst China’s young urbanites, and the relentless expansion of coffee chains such as Luckin Coffee and Starbucks.

Colombia, meanwhile, is targeting an increase in coffee exports to China from 40,000 bags to 300,000 bags over the next four years.

Yet for Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, hopes of becoming major exporters to China remain distant as long as these countries maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which makes trade significantly more difficult and costly.

Giving small farmers a chance

Both the non-profit and private sector players have been trying to help small coffee farmers cope with the dual impacts of climate change and a challenging economic outlook.

Starbucks, which purchases about 3% of global coffee production, and close to 40% of specialty arabica varieties farmed in Central America, has made direct payments to support over 8,000 farmers in Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.

These payments are meant to mitigate the impact of low international prices and ensure that farmers can continue to operate. In addition to direct payments, Starbucks also runs training and knowledge-sharing programmes to help farmers adapt to the changing climate.

Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was quoted by Time magazine as saying: “Make no mistake, climate change is going to play a bigger role in affecting the quality and integrity of coffee.”

Keurig Green Mountain, another major coffee purchaser, part of JAB Holding Company (which also owns Peet’s Coffee, Caribou Coffee and Krispy Kreme), runs another programme to train farmers in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua on coping with water scarcity.

Small farmers also stand a better chance when they work together, according to Catherine Tucker from the University of Florida, who has spent over two decades researching coffee farmers in Honduras. “Farmers that are part of a larger cooperative can adapt better,” she says.

One such cooperative is Café Orgánico Marcala (COMSA), a group of 1,200 organic coffee producers in Honduras. By training farmers to produce high quality coffee, and marketing its sustainability credentials, COMSA is able to secure higher prices and improve the livelihood of its members.

Consumers also have a role to play. “If we want to have that quality coffee, we need to get people to pay for it. Because if we don’t, that coffee is going to disappear,” says Tucker.

“Being conscious about where our coffee is coming from […] Thinking about the producers who make our coffee, and [being] willing to pay that extra bit to help them cover their costs, that will help make a difference.”","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://dialogochino.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coffee-climate-change-scaled.jpg,"['china', '2018', 'growth', 'coffee', 'change', 'honduras', 'smallholder', 'climate', 'global', 'fight', 'bags', 'starbucks', 'farmers', 'oversupply']",

Equipment is being readied as unclogging of drains gets underway in the flood-prone areas of Bangkok, which is expected to be hit by two tropical storms between August and September, said the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA).

Bangkok is bracing for its wettest period from the middle of next month until September, says City Clerk Silpasuay Raweesaengsoon.

Meanwhile, the Meteorological Department said the rainy season began on March 18 and is likely to last until the middle of October.

The expected storms and seasonal heavy downpours have raised concerns about flooding in low-lying areas across the capital as well as locations where water may be slow to drain, according to the BMA.

Ms Silpasuay said that so far, 6,464 kilometres of the city's drainage system have already been cleaned. Also, water hyacinths and other floating weeds have been plucked from 1,984 canals and waterways. Faulty water pumps at pumping stations and water-retention ponds have also been repaired.

The BMA has marked 14 areas in nine districts as being flood-prone.

They include a stretch from Klong Prapa to Klong Prem Prachakorn in Laksi district on Chaeng Watthana Road, a spot opposite Bangkok Bank's branch on Ratchadaphisek Road in Chatuchak district, a section from Amornpan Market to Kaset intersection on Phahon Yothin Road and an area from Rajabhat Suan Dusit University to Krung Thon bridge in Dusit district.

The agency has also marked 56 flood-watch locations across 26 districts with many of them being along the main roads in the north of Bangkok such as Ngam Wong Wan, Kamphaeng Phet, Phahon Yothin, Ratchadaphisek and Chaeng Watthana.

The problem with the flood-prone and flood-watch areas involves low-lying geography and small underground drainage pipes. During heavy rains, large amounts of water is siphoned out from around adjacent offices and dumped into the drainage system causing water to overflow and flood nearby areas.

The city clerk added that construction of electric trains along some routes may also slow the pace at which water is removed from roads and the BMA had asked contractors to quickly wrap up building work in certain locations where drainage may be impeded.

Workers were removing rubbish from waterways to keep them from clogging water release channels at water stations.","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/newdesign/assets/images/bg/thailand/images_thailand_1.jpg?v=0.1,"['locations', 'yothin', 'floodprone', 'water', 'bangkok', 'road', 'work', 'begins', 'bma', 'drainage', 'areas']", 
67,67,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Poor quality PPEs flood market due to lack of strict..edural loopholes lead to rise of pandemic profiteering - Firstpost,https://www.firstpost.com/health/poor-quality-ppes-flood-market-due-to-lack-of-strict-quality-control-procedural-loopholes-lead-to-rise-of-pandemic-profiteering-8434021.html,"Sources said the government is looking at several complaints filed by the notified associates flagging the names of hundreds of such certification firms that are operating without experts, experienced auditors and office address.

New Delhi: With demands for Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), masks and gloves mounting each day to protect frontline workers and others involved in the fight against highly contagious coronavirus , the unauthentic certification firms have popped across the country to make quick money.

According to the experts, many of these fly-by-night operators distributing certificates for meagre Rs 5, 000-10,000, are neither by National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB), an organisation working under the aegis of Quality Council of India nor registered with the drug controller under medical devices rules to carry out an audit of the manufacturing site.

NABCB provides accreditation to certification and inspection bodies based on the assessment of their competence and in accordance with international standards and guidelines and those seeking to register with drug controller needs to have prior accreditation from NABCB.

Sources said the government is looking at several complaints filed by the notified associates flagging the names of hundreds of such certification firms that are operating without experts, experienced auditors and office address.

Some suppliers are flaunting ISO number to claim certification from US and Europe based accreditation bodies, operating as non-governmental organisations. Significantly, only 11 firms are NABCB accredited bodies and eight companies registered with drug controller are authorised to carry out an audit of medical device manufacturers.

Anil Jauhri, former CEO of NABCB told Firstpost that these unauthentic PPE certification bodies are taking gullible buyers for a ride because these cannot be authenticated by a third party. Jauhri said those agencies directly buying from the manufacturer must examine if the certificate is issued by NABCB notified bodies because we are at least 18 months away from strict regulation for medical devices.

“We do not have regulation in force today to ensure standardization of medical devices. PPEs are also not regulated and for the next 18 months, we have to rely on the voluntary regime as far as quality is concerned. Now, in the absence of regulation, anything is selling in the market. A large number of certification bodies are distributing certificate, which is of no worth at all. That is why my suggestion is not to go for export of PPEs because we are not producing standard quality PPEs and we should not be branded with China for providing sub-standard PPEs,” Jauhri said.

""Secondly, the buyers need to be educated about the difference between bogus and genuine accreditation and the must-have tools to check whether they have been certified by NABCB’s notified bodies. Also, in the absence of regulation, genuine manufacturers should go for Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) voluntary certification that would ensure quality PPEs and masks,” he said.

The medical devices which were earlier not defined have now been notified effective from 1 April 2020 but manufacturers have been given 18 months breather to meet the rules.

Aradhana Mishra, senior general manager of MTIC INTERCERT, an European notified body for PPEs and medical devices, said many PPEs buyers purchasing directly from a small manufacturing unit doesn’t even know if they have NABCB rating. She said Delhi has become a hub for phoney certification of PPEs and medical device and requires strict crackdown by the government.

“Some are even offering certification for Rs.5000. This is shocking because it simply means they are printing the name of suppliers on the certificate without actual audit etc. They will only be caught if exporting these materials on the basis of such a certificate because the lie will be called immediately by international accreditation bodies. We have been raising this issue and trying to create awareness in MSME meetings,” Mishra said.

Jauhri said in order to ensure the quality of PPEs, the procuring agencies must purchase it from manufacturers tested and certified which also includes nine authorised labs as recommended by textiles ministry.

""Ministry of Textiles have done a commendable job in producing quality PPEs during the ongoing pandemic. The ministry not only eliminated our dependence on Chinese import but also put in place a mechanism to check the quality. Now, hospitals, government or private agencies must buy PPEs from manufacturers certified by these nine labs as suggested by the ministry,” Jauhri said.

Dr BK Rana, founding CEO of Quality and Accreditation Institute said the government has started enforcement measures and they have formed a group of experts from textiles and quality consultancy domain to run an awareness campaign for the users to spot a sub-standard PPE coverall and unauthentic certification. Rana said plethora of suspicious certification firms is sprouting just to make quick money taking advantage of this distressful situation.

“Many of these certification bodies registered in India or abroad are not illegal but at the same time, they are not recognised by international standard organisations. We have struggled with this issue for the last two months and now putting a mechanism in place to check suspicious certificates and poor quality PPEs. Even for the gloves that doctors wear, we have noticed some manufacturers have used cheap material and after wearing it for an hour, the hand is turning white. So we have started an awareness campaign as well for the procurement agencies,” Rana said.

Soumik Mondal of SGS India, a notified body of NABCB said they are having a series of webinar with the government as well as industry experts to educate more people about PPEs certification.

“The big issue is legal vacuum and lack of awareness among procuring agencies,” Mondal said.

Jauhri also clarified that normally in no country there is a specific law to regulate the issue of certificates but in India, due to rampant abuse, there is need for a law to regulate both accreditation and conformity assessment bodies, which means labs, inspection bodies and certification bodies.

“Since there is no specific law, anyone can open a certification body or lab and issue certificate or report. We would not know if it’s competent or follows right process or method,” Jauhri said further adding that many certification firms today are taking advantage of lack of regulatory mechanism.

Steps to ensure standardisation

In the absence of strict regulation, the BIS has relaxed testing norms for critical components for safety wear and have also allowed third-party testing certification for manufacturers, who lacks the in-house facilities. BIS is the national standard body of the country for the harmonious development of the activities of standardisation, marking and quality certification of goods.

BIS has said that the latest move will boost the number of PPEs being manufactured every day in the country. It said the norms have been relaxed to enable more manufacturers to be brought in the ambit of BIS product certification scheme, which will, in turn, result in a greater quantity of BIS certified PPEs being made available to the users.

The details of new norms reviewed by Firstpost for three components — filter half masks, surgical face masks and eye protectors — reveals the testing procedures though relaxed will ensure that products are certified by a notified body and accredited lab, approved by the government. The experts believe this move will have twin advantage -- help small manufacturing sector and bring more manufacturers under the ambit of standard.

For face masks, BIS has approved sub-contracting for tests with enough safeguards. As per the new guidelines, the lab must be recognised by the BIS or it should be a government lab empanelled by the BIS.

“Conformity of the materials to the requirements of the standard may be established either through the supplier/manufacturer’s test certificate or test report issued by BIS lab/BIS recognised Lab/BIS Empanelled Lab or through in-house testing,” BIS guidelines for masks manufacturers said.

For the manufacturing of Eye Protectors, BIS said if the testing of sample is done at the factory of a BIS licensee, it will be conducted under supervision of a BIS certification officer.

Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator of Association of Indian Medical Device Industry said this relaxation was sought for N95, three-layer surgical mask and eye protectors (goggles) to enable a larger pool of compliant manufacturers so that non-licensed manufacturers could use the facility of the licensed manufacturer as cost of test equipment like for three-layer surgical mask manufacturing is Rs 15-16 Lakh. The cost is quite prohibitive for an SME manufacturer and it takes time to set up.

He also said for users who are dependent on HLL the move by BIS means access to a larger pool of indigenous manufacturers with lower prices than imports currently and for new manufacturers, it will ensure flexibility and ease of doing business.

“There is an acute shortage of goggles and also of masks. So by sharing of limited testing equipment and resources, we are trying to have more suppliers added to pool,” Nath said.","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Coronavirus-PPE.jpg,"['market', 'bis', 'notified', 'medical', 'masks', 'pandemic', 'rise', 'accreditation', 'procedural', 'bodies', 'certification', 'poor', 'strict', 'quality', 'loopholes', 'profiteeringhealth', 'manufacturers', 'ppes']",

""This is a dramatic situation for thousands of people who have lost their livelihoods. I call on the international community to support the efforts of the government and the United Nations to urgently reduce the suffering of thousands of Salvadorans,"" said Miguel Barreto, WFP's Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. ""It is crucial to support governments that are facing extreme weather events amidst an ongoing pandemic.""

The results of a WFP rapid food security assessment in El Salvador conducted after the storm that hit the country on 31 May, estimate that 336,300 people in urban and rural areas could be pushed into severe food insecurity, meaning that they may not have the means or resources to feed themselves. On 6 June, WFP and the City of San Salvador began distributing food to 5,500 people in 73 shelters located in the departments of San Salvador, Sonsonate and La Libertad.

Following the storm’s passage, WFP needs US$8 million to provide urgent food assistance for two months to 153,500 people in severe food insecurity. This request for funds is in addition to the US$19 million required to support the Government of El Salvador in its response to COVID-19.

""These are the worst rains I've seen since Hurricane Mitch in 1998,"" said WFP’s Representative in El Salvador, Andrew Stanhope, who added that ""the impact of Tropical Storm Amanda and the pandemic has worsened the food security of the poorest families. Now more than ever we must redouble our efforts to urgently reach those most in need with food assistance.""

The west and centre of the country are the main areas affected by the storm, the first in this hurricane season. Authorities have reported heavy flooding, with between 500 to 800 mm of rain accumulated in some departments, and severe damage to infrastructure. The government of El Salvador has declared a state of emergency.

WFP is also supporting the Government of El Salvador in its response to COVID-19. Starting in April, WFP provided food or cash to 32,000 vulnerable people.

COVID-19 has had a number of unexpected impacts on the environment, curtailing recycling and increasing the use of plastic around the world.

Governments need to act now to ensure a green recovery that incentivizes sustainability.

Between the end of February and mid-April this year more than a billion items of personal protective equipment were given out in the UK alone.

That’s millions of gloves and masks being used then thrown away every single day - just in UK healthcare settings. So it’s not difficult to see why conservationists around the world are sounding the alarm over where all these single-use products are ending up.

Waterlogged masks, gloves, hand sanitizer bottles and other coronavirus waste are already being found on our seabeds and washed up on our beaches, joining the day-to-day detritus in our ocean ecosystems.

Divers on a clean-up mission around the Côte d'Azur are finding increasing amounts of COVID-19 waste Image: Opération Mer Propre

Along with photos and videos giving disturbing evidence of this new form of pollution, French clean-up charity Opération Mer Propre is among those calling for action. “There risks being more masks than jellyfish,” Laurent Lombard from the organization said in one Facebook post.

It’s just as much of a problem on the other side of the world. Back in February, OceansAsia flagged the growing number of masks being discovered during its plastic pollution research. Masses of masks were found on the Soko Islands, a small cluster off the coast of Hong Kong.

Masks are an increasingly common sight, even on the beaches of remote islands. Image: OceansAsia

Adding to the problem

Already, some 8 million tonnes of plastics enter our ocean every year, adding to the estimated 150 million tonnes already circulating in marine environments.

One study estimates that in the UK alone, if every person used a single-use face mask a day for a year, it would create an additional 66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging.

What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak? Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum’s mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. How can we collaborate to stop the spread of COVID-19? Since its launch on 11 March, the Forum’s COVID Action Platform has brought together 1,667 stakeholders from 1,106 businesses and organizations to mitigate the risk and impact of the unprecedented global health emergency that is COVID-19. The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action. As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched – bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.

World leaders and politicians are aware of the problem - and that it needs to be addressed.

“Maritime nations know far better than anyone how our ocean economies are dependent on ocean health,” said Zac Goldsmith, Minister, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK in a recent World Economic Forum webinar about ensuring a green recovery.

“But we all ultimately depend on our shared oceans and changing the role that plastic plays in every part of our economy.

“Efforts to tackle plastic pollution can help us improve ocean health, tackle climate change, support biodiversity and build sustainable livelihoods.”

COVID-19’s cost to the environment

Single-use plastic waste is not the only impact COVID-19 is having on the environment.

Despite a temporary crash in carbon emissions as lockdowns have meant fewer people travelling and less industrial activity, there are concerns the pandemic will divert governments’ attention away from green issues.

The UN’s COP26 climate change conference, set to be held in November 2020, has already been postponed.

In some US cities, recycling programmes have been paused, while parts of virus-hit Italy and Spain also put a hold on recycling.

The quarantine economy has driven more people online, resulting in greater packaging waste from deliveries. Medical waste has rocketed.

Import and export restrictions, as well as declines in the availability of cargo transportation, mean that large amounts of food have also gone to waste. And as this organic waste decays it will release greenhouse gases.

And unless economic stimuli focus on green initiatives, there is a risk of a sudden upsurge in polluting activity as construction and manufacturing are used to drive recovery from the global downturn the virus has created.

Sunny weather in the months preceding the heatwave caused plant growth to accelerate across the continent, which, in turn, led to the fast drying out of soil, the research says.

The dry soil, in combination with record-breaking summer heat, created the conditions for 2018’s extreme drought – which caused millions of pounds of crop damage and fanned wildfires from Greece to the UK.

The findings come as the UK emerges from its sunniest spring on record. This year’s unprecedented sunshine could heighten the risk of another extreme drought in summer, depending on weather conditions in the coming months, the lead author tells Carbon Brief.

Parched

The northern hemisphere’s 2018 summer heatwave dominated frontpages. The extreme heat lasted for months and temperature records were broken simultaneously across North America, Europe and Asia.

At the same time, Europe was plunged into a continent-wide drought, which caused severe crop damage and fanned the flames of wildfires.

A study covered by Carbon Brief found that the summer heat seen across the northern hemisphere in 2018 would have not been possible in a world without human-caused climate change.

The new study, published in Science Advances, is the first to investigate how weather in the months leading up to the heatwave could have contributed to Europe’s extreme drought.

It finds unusually sunny and warm weather in the spring had a lasting “legacy effect” on the land, which then amplified drought conditions in the summer, says Dr Ana Bastos, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Germany and lead author of the study. She tells Carbon Brief:

“Spring conditions led to an enhancement of photosynthesis early on in the growing season, but at the cost of strong soil-water depletion. In the crop-dominated areas in central Europe, increased growth in spring made ecosystems more vulnerable to drought in summer.”

Premature plants

For the study, the authors reexamined the weather conditions in Europe in both the spring and summer of 2018. They also looked into weather conditions during two previous European summer heatwaves in 2003 and 2010.

The maps below show mean temperature (top), rainfall (middle) and solar radiation (bottom) across Europe during the spring months of 2003 (left), 2010 (middle) and 2018 (right). On the maps, red signifies above average temperatures or rainfall deficits, while yellow shows above average solar radiation (sunny weather).

The maps illustrate how the spring of 2018 saw unusually warm and sunny weather across much of the continent, when compared to other years experiencing summer heatwaves. Some parts of Europe also saw unusually large rainfall deficits in the spring of 2018, but this was not uniform across the continent.

The authors then investigated how the weather in the spring of 2018 could have affected plant growth – and, subsequently, soil moisture – across the continent.

To do this, they used a set of 11 vegetation models capable of simulating how plant growth responds to changes in climate. Bastos explains:

“We ran three simulations – one with the observed climate conditions for 2018 and two others where spring or summer were replaced by the average conditions of the past 40 years.”

By comparing these scenarios, the researchers were able to work out to what extent the changes in plant growth seen in the 2018 simulation were down to its unique climate conditions in spring and summer.

The results show, in the 2018 simulation, plant growth rapidly accelerated in spring across much of the continent.

This can be viewed in the video below, which shows a timeseries of modelled “gross primary productivity” – a measure of plant growth – across Europe from the beginning to end of 2018. (A running time series of soil moisture is shown beneath the map.)

In the video, bursts of dark green during spring – particularly in April and May – indicate large increases in plant growth.

This accelerated plant growth caused soils to dry out rapidly, Bastos explains:

“In crop-dominated areas in central Europe, increased growth in spring made ecosystems more vulnerable to drought in summer – and resulted in photosynthesis collapse during the summer.”

This collapse can also be seen in the animated map, where spots of dark green suddenly turn to brown in the summer months across countries including France, Spain and the UK.

The collapse in plant growth likely caused large releases of CO2 and widespread crop damage in the summer – amplifying the effects of the summer heat, Bastos says.

Previous research suggests that the likelihood of springtime heat in Europe is expected to increase with climate change, Bastos says:

“With increasing temperatures and atmospheric CO2, vegetation will grow earlier and at a faster pace in spring, which will contribute to earlier soil water depletion and increase the risk of summer droughts.”

It is possible that this year’s record sunshine in spring will lead to extreme drought in Europe, but this will depend on weather conditions in the coming months, she adds.

Tree power

While the accelerated growth of plants in spring worsened the summer drought in most parts of Europe, it had the opposite effect in the Nordic region, Bastos says:

“In the forest-dominated Scandinavia, increased growth in spring helped offset the negative effects of the summer drought.”

This is likely because the Scandinavian landscape is dominated by trees rather than by crops, she says:

“Trees can control water loss by adjusting the opening of pores in their leaves – and have deeper roots than grasses or crop plants. This enables them to use water more economically and to trap the water at greater depths during periods of drought.”

This finding suggests that increasing tree cover in central Europe might help to stave off the impact of spring heat on droughts in future, she says:

“The role of forests in attenuating and mitigating the negative impacts of extreme summers should be considered in future land-management strategies, such as the proposed New EU Forest Strategy and the European Green Deal.”

Overall, the findings are “interesting”, says Prof Sonia Seneviratne, a researcher of climate extremes from ETH Zurich, who was not involved in the study. She tells Carbon Brief:

“These results suggest that the often-hypothesised positive effect of CO2 on plant water efficiency is possibly already being overpowered during strong drought conditions in a large part of Europe.”

71,71,FL-2020-000147-CHN,Kalytera Provides Data Demonstrating that Prodrug R-107 Provides Sustained Release of Nitric Oxide - GlobeNewswire,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/05/2044240/0/en/Kalytera-Provides-Data-Demonstrating-that-Prodrug-R-107-Provides-Sustained-Release-of-Nitric-Oxide.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, June 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kalytera Therapeutics, Inc. (TSX VENTURE: KLY and OTC: KALTF) (the ""Company"" or ""Kalytera"") today announced new in vivo data demonstrating that R-107 exhibits rapid conversion to its active payload R-100 in rats, followed by sustained release of nitric oxide from R-100.



Kalytera announced on May 19, 2020 that it has entered into a binding Letter of Intent to acquire Salzman Group, Inc., a privately held company located in West Tisbury, MA (“Salzman Group”). Salzman Group is the owner of R-107, a proprietary drug with issued and pending composition of matter and method of use patents in approximately 40 countries, including the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea.

R-107 is a Nitric Oxide Prodrug

R-107 is a liquid prodrug of nitric oxide that can be administered by injection, unlike nitric oxide gas, which requires a special type of delivery device, and complex administration by trained respiratory therapists. When administered by injection, R-107 is slowly hydrolyzed, releasing its active moiety, R-100, which in turn steadily and slowly releases nitric oxide into the lung tissue.

Put simply, following injection, R-107 is metabolized, and releases R-100, which in turn releases nitric oxide into the tissues of the lung. R-100 is the pharmaceutically active payload of R-107.

Pharmacokinetic data are Indicative of Rapid Conversion of R-107 to Active Therapeutic Payload

Salzman Group studied the pharmacokinetic characteristics of R-107 when administered at a dose of 10 milligrams per kilogram to rats via an intravenous injection. The purpose of this study was to measure the levels of R-107, and its payload R-100 and the metabolite HMP (generated after release of nitric oxide from R-100), in the plasma of rats following injection. This study is a requirement for an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application that the Company intends to submit in Q2 2020 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of a first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial. The Company is planning to carry out a Phase 1a safety and pharmacokinetic study of intramuscular R-107 using a single dose escalation design in healthy middle-aged volunteers at CMAX, a clinical contract research organization located at Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia.

Results from this rat pharmacokinetic study, carried out at Envigo Labs in the United Kingdom, demonstrated a rapid buildup of the prodrug R-107, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached after 5 and 8 minutes (Tmax) in male and female rats, respectively. Conversion of R-107 to its active payload R-100 was extremely rapid, with R-100 attaining its peak plasma concentration (Cmax) only 15 minutes after the dosing of R-107. Thereafter, R-100 was cleared from the plasma with half-lives (t ½ ) of 2.7 and 7.7 hours in male and female rats, respectively. Given that R-107 and its payload, R-100, are hydrophobic, it was not unexpected to observe a large volume of distribution (Vd), indicative that they had partitioned into fat stores forming a functional drug depot. These findings predict that a single dose of the R-107 prodrug in humans will produce sustained plasma levels of the active payload R-100, which would then release nitric oxide into the lung over many hours.

Pharmacokinetic data are Indicative of Sustained Release of Nitric Oxide from Active Payload R-100

In a follow-on pharmacokinetic study also carried out at Envigo Labs, the active payload R-100 was administered at a dose of 10 milligrams per kilogram to rats via an intravenous injection. The purpose of this investigation was to measure the levels of the metabolite HMP, which is formed when R-100 discharges nitric oxide. This study is also an obligatory component of the IND to be submitted to the FDA. Results from this study showed a total exposure to HMP of less than 30% of the total R-100 administered, indicating that the release of nitric oxide from HMP is relatively slow. Accordingly, R-100 functions as a depot of nitric oxide, providing for sustained exposure to nitric oxide in tissues.

Taken together, the interpretation of the findings from the above two studies is that R-107 is readily converted in vivo into its active payload R-100, which accumulates in a tissue depot and provides for a sustained release of nitric oxide into tissues. Pharmacokinetic studies taking place now in large animals will offer additional insight into the predicted exposure levels in humans dosed with R-107.

Regional director Hank Cameron says crews are starting to make good progress on Cherryville's flooded Hanson Park.

Three pieces of heavy equipment spent the day working in the park, using six loads rip-rap rock to reinforce a drainage ditch so as to better control the flow of water spilling over from Cherry Creek.

Cameron says the floodwaters claimed a small ticket booth/concession structure, which was washed away in the creek, but the foundations of other buildings on site appear to be stable.

""We're starting to make progress in redirecting the flow,"" he said Monday afternoon, noting the cycle of the waterway typically sees it peak in the morning.

Cameron said he expects the creek level will climb higher by the end of the week.

New Delhi, June 14: You might have come across news about few people infected by the coronavirus becoming seriously ill, while others show little to no signs of the symptoms, or are asymptomatic? The answer might be in a blood group.

Research from genetic-testing giant 23andMe Inc. found evidence on how differences in a gene that influences a person's blood type can affect a person's susceptibility to Covid-19.

The study says that COVID-19 patients with blood group O are less likely to test positive for coronavirus.

According to the study,""Individuals with O blood type are between 9-18 per cent less likely than individuals with other blood types to have tested positive for coronavirus.''

However, those with A-type blood were confirmed to have contracted the virus, alongside 1.5 percent of people with B or AB blood.

India reports highest single-day spike of 11,929 new coronavirus cases, total tally at 3.20 lakh

''There appeared to be little differences in susceptibility among the other blood types,"" 23andMe said in a blog post. These findings hold when adjusting the data like age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and co-morbidities.

23andMe also found that differences in rhesus factor (blood type + or -) did not affect whether the blood type was protective against coronavirus, nor was this a factor in susceptibility or severity in cases.

The study is based on 750,000, with plans to include 10,000 more particpants outside of 23andMe who have been hospitalised and diagnosed with COVID-19.","Sun, 14 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.oneindia.com/img/1200x80/2020/06/coronavirus234-1592018783-1592120488.jpg,"['study', 'type', '23andme', 'covid19', 'group', 'types', 'affect', 'differences', 'blood', 'susceptibility', 'coronavirus']",

Honor the memory of George Floyd!""But criticism was nonetheless swift.""It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, during a news briefing Friday. ""Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.""Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, speaking on CNN, called on Trump to retract it.""During these times, we can condemn violence while also trying to listen, to understand, to know that there is deep frustration, rightfully so, in our country -- that there has not been enough action on creating equality, opportunity, and in health care, and in a time of this COVID-19 epidemic, it's laid bare all of that,"" he said.And Jeffery Robinson, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Trone Center for Justice and Equality, said Trump's message was ""hypocritical, immoral, and illegal.""Twitter's action Friday morning marked the second time this week that the social media giant has flagged the president's content, this time adding a warning label that prevented it from being shared or liked. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, thus accusing the White House of promoting violence.Floyd's death and fury it has sparked are set against the backdrop of a heated presidential election and competing political priorities for the president.Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger.Trump - who rarely holds his tongue - has been silent in the face a long list of high-profile police-involved killings of black men, including Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and whose dying words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.)Since even before his 2016 campaign, Trump has portrayed himself as a staunch defender of law and order. He has often spoken in front of law enforcement groups, and in one speech appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after his presumptive Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, suggested last week that black voters who support Trump ""ain't black."" A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference - and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric.Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November.Trump's back-and-forth with Twitter comes a day after he signed an executive order challenging the site's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices.The company said it had flagged Trump's latest tweet ""in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts,"" but kept it accessible to users because they felt it was ""important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""Supporters of the president balked at the move.""It seems like they're carrying out a vendetta against the president,"" Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 GOP House leader, said on Fox News Friday.","Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/6219058_052920-cc-ap-trump-img.jpg?w=1600,"['death', 'trump', 'night', 'leads', 'attempts', 'thats', 'floyd', 'looting', 'explain', 'house', 'shooting', 'starts', 'george', 'black', 'white', 'president']",

Grade 12 Vanier Catholic Secondary School student Thomas Janzen poses for a photo in front of his school in Whitehorse on June 5. Janzen is one of the countless graduating students across the globe who has had to come to terms with the fact that, thanks to COVID-19, the graduating ceremonies he’s imagined for years are going to be different. (Crystal Schick/Yukon News)

Prom, cap and gown, parties — long-held traditions the class of 2020 went into the school year anticipating would mark the end of their years as grade school students.

Some were involved in the fundraising for the grad activities, some took part in the planning and many more looked forward to the moment they’d walk across a stage to accept their diploma.

Those plans are now cancelled, or at least on-hold in light of COVID-19, as students, administrators and teachers find new ways to celebrate the accomplishments of the class of 2020.

Along with June 10 being declared Yukon Graduate Day in the territory, parades, photo shoots, scavenger hunts, family dinners, doorstep gifts, banners and more are part of a long-list of alternatives happening for the 347 Yukon high school grads this year with the global pandemic putting large gatherings and ceremonies on-hold.

Grade 12 Vanier Catholic Secondary School student Thomas Janzen had envisioned this time of year being “our time” for himself and those he’s spent the last five years at Vanier with.

When it was first announced that school would not resume immediately after March break, it occurred to Janzen that the ceremonies and events that are so much a part of graduation might not occur. Even through April after face-to-face classes were suspended for the school year, Janzen held out hope that the traditional grad activities would still happen.

It took awhile for reality to set in, he said.

“It hit in waves,” Janzen said, adding while it’s not the graduation he envisioned there is some comfort in knowing a cap and gown ceremony is tentatively being planned for August if gatherings are permitted at that time.

Along with rescheduling the cap and gown, Vanier also hired a photographer so that each graduate will have grad photos with their family.

As Janzen looks to the future, plans he and his friends made to travel to Australia and New Zealand are also on-hold with Janzen now planning to work for a year before he looks at post-secondary school.

Along with individual travel plans graduates like Janzen were making is the loss of the final school trips.

In Watson Lake, the graduating class spends much of their year fundraising for their graduation trip, which this year would have taken them to Costa Rica.

As principal Jean Maclean said, that means not only has COVID-19 impacted local graduation events, but also a major trip the students were looking forward to and working to pay for through spaghetti dinners, bake sales, and more.

April would have also seen a trip into Whitehorse to get professional grad photos taken.

Maclean said the community has been integral to helping the school find a new way to celebrate the accomplishments of its 11 high school graduates this year.

“It’s just a huge milestone,” she said.

In a typical year, the weekend after the school year ends would be a time to celebrate with the cap and gown and prom.

Liard First Nation and Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society also provides regalia for each grad along with hosting a dinner for the graduates of both Grade 12 and Grade 7 in the community.

That won’t happen this year, but the First Nation is continuing to provide the regalia to students with a photo shoot planned in addition to the previous cap and gown photos taken at Wye Lake. A video will also be produced.

A photo of each grad from each photo shoot will be used for banners to line the Alaska Highway through town — a cap and gown photo on one side and regalia on the other — showcasing the class of 2020.

Arrangements have been made so that each graduate will get a family dinner from the local Chinese restaurant so they can celebrate with their family.

The school has also committed to holding a cap and gown ceremony when gatherings are permitted again.

Maclean said while no date is set, she’d like to have the ceremony in December when a number of the graduates will likely be in town for Christmas holidays. She noted that even if it happens next year, she’s assured 2020 grads their event will not be combined with next year’s graduation.

Similarly, the Costa Rica trip is also more on-hold rather than entirely cancelled with it now being planned for 2021.

Maclean noted with the banners and family celebrations, there are a number of other ideas coming forward that may honour Watson Lake grads in other ways.

In both Pelly Crossing and Haines Junction, parades have been held to celebrate the accomplishments of their graduates.

Eliza Van Bibber School principal Joshua Korten said it wasn’t long after in-person classes were cancelled that school staff began talking with students about how they could celebrate the school’s three 2020 graduates and the idea of a parade was born.

More than 30 vehicles including RCMP, community safety officers, the school’s wolverine mascot and more made their way around town with residents turning up to congratulate the grads from a distance.

“It was awesome, just awesome,” Korten said, adding the graduates have worked hard and the community support for them was evident.

“We need to celebrate these kids,” he said, pointing out in a typical year there would be upwards of 200 people turning out for the cap and gown ceremony.

The Selkirk First Nation also honured the graduates with gifts.

It is one of a number of ways First Nations in the territory are honouring their graduates.

The annual Yukon First Nations graduation is typically a major celebration that draws more than 700 people to the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre in Whitehorse.

This year more than 90 Yukon First Nations grads were set to don regalia — often made by family members — and take part in the event, said Pixie Ingram, the 2020 Yukon First Nations grad coordinator.

Along with booking the entire cultural centre for the event, caterers and photographers were being lined up for the 2020 ceremony when it was cancelled.

“Things were in place,” Ingram said.

While there’s been clear disappointment expressed that the ceremony won’t go ahead, people are also very understanding.

With more than 23 awards to be handed out along with gifts to the First Nations grads throughout the territory, Ingram said officials are working to recognize the grads and make sure gifts get to them.

“We’re doing what we can,” she said, highlighting plans for the graduates to have photos done showcasing their regalia while also coming up with plans to get gifts and awards to graduates in the communities.

That effort appears to be happening throughout the territory as communities and individuals continue working to help graduates mark a major milestone in life with new events, recognizing long-standing traditions won’t happen this year as they have in the past.

As Gabriella Rayo — another Grade 12 Vanier student — said, she understands why the ceremonies and prom won’t happen at the end of the school year and appreciates the effort to have the cap and gown in August, but is sad and disappointed her grad year isn’t what she envisioned.

After helping out with last year’s prom, she was looking forward to being more involved this year for her own grad and was enjoying the fundraising and planning activities that preceded the pandemic.

She said with a number of grads expected to go Outside for post-secondary school or with other plans, there will likely be fewer grads taking part in an August ceremony than if it had been held at the end of the school year.

As for her own plans, Rayo said she too had been focused on working for a few months after graduation and then travelling with friends. They were looking at travelling to Thailand and other parts of southeast Asia.

“That might be pushed back,” she said of the travel plans.

If that’s the case she will likely continue working rather than travel.

As graduates adjust their plans to a changing world, many are recognizing their resiliency and accomplishments.

As education minister Tracy McPhee stated in declaring Yukon Graduate Day: “Yukon Graduate Day is an opportunity for Yukoners to celebrate the accomplishments and success of Yukon graduating students. It allows us to come together to celebrate, support and recognize the incredible resiliency, perseverance and optimism that Yukon students and graduates have shown during their learning journeys. The Government of Yukon is pleased to recognize the many accomplishments of this year’s graduates on Yukon Graduate Day.”

After cratering in April as a result of the pandemic, the number of travelers and airline and airport employees filtering through the Transportation Security Administration’s airport checkpoints has steadily climbed in recent weeks. The low point arrived on April 14, when the agency screened fewer than 90,000 people, just 4 percent of those screened on the same date last year. On Sunday, the agency screened more than 440,000 people, about 17 percent of last year’s number and the best day since March.

Investors appear to have noticed those numbers, and airline stock prices have surged. American Airlines is up nearly 90 percent since Monday morning last week, United Airlines is more than 70 percent higher, and Delta Air Lines is up more than 45 percent.

Still, the airline industry’s reckoning is far from over.

Industry executives and analysts generally agree that it is likely to be several years before airlines fly as many people as they did before the pandemic. Airlines are still losing tens of millions of dollars every day. That number is shrinking, but the losses are expected to continue through the end of the year.

Generally, a flight needs to be about three-fourths full for an airline to turn a profit; most are far from it because airlines can’t or won’t fill up planes.

Despite the relatively small numbers of travelers, some are concerned the people moving around the country more, whether, via airplane or other modes of transportation, will help drive infection rates higher.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington released new, higher figures on Monday, estimating that 145,728 people in the country could die from coronavirus by August. That number is an increase of about 5,000 from its projection earlier in June and of about 10,000 from a projection made at the end of May.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/us/01virus-us-briefing-funeral/merlin_171909705_c55b3a20-1d50-462b-97cc-95fc5a39b9ef-facebookJumbo.jpg,"['passes', 'airline', 'numbers', 'pandemic', 'travelers', 'number', 'transportation', 'screened', 'global', 'higher', 'projection', 'caseload', 'airlines', 'coronavirus', 'million']",

The team will stay in Bangladesh for two weeks and make propositions for containment and treatment of Covid-19

A team of Chinese medical experts, who have first-hand experience of containing the virus and treating the patients with remarkable success, is scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh on Monday with an array of medical equipment.

The Chinese medical expert team has made full preparation and kept their eyes on the situation of Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh, reports UNB.

The team members have discussed and studied the appropriate measures and advice for Bangladeshi people, said the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka on Sunday.

The experts said they are well-prepared and expect to have efficient communication and cooperation with their Bangladeshi medical peers in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The team is organized by the National Health Commission and consists of 10 respiratory physicians selected by the Hainan Provincial Health Commission, according to the officials at the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka.

During their two-week stay in Bangladesh, the experts will visit designated hospitals, quarantine centres, and testing centres, have discussions on the pandemic with their Bangladeshi counterparts, and make calibrated propositions for containment and treatment.

As Bangladesh’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic continues to become fiercer, Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, had a phone conversation with Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, on May 20.

In that talk between the leaders of the two friendly nations, President Xi reassured Prime Minister Hasina of standing side by side with Bangladesh as the truest friend in this war against Covid-19.

Many cooperative measures have been taken by the Chinese side, most of which have already been implemented in Bangladesh since the outbreak here, according to Chinese Embassy in Dhaka.","Sun, 07 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/06/watermarked/331675/1591524397772p2-1591456197493.jpg,"['experts', 'medical', 'bangladeshi', 'pandemic', 'xi', 'leading', 'fighters', 'bangladesh', 'covid19', 'embassy', 'team', 'chinese']",

Here are 12 ways to rent your possessions. Some of them are highly lucrative.

“We have people making $3,000 or $4,000 renting out things that they already own,” says Stefan Cordova, founder of FriendWithA, a rental platform that specializes in high-end sporting goods. “You also get to share the gear that you love with like-minded individuals.”

It doesn’t matter whether you own big things, such as houses and cars, or little things, such as camera equipment and tools. There’s a platform to help you market it for rent.

Before you begin

But before you rent out anything, you should have a conversation with your insurance agent. Renting assets to others presents unique risks that are unlikely to be covered by your standard home and auto policies.

Advertisement

For instance, if your household possessions are stolen under normal circumstances, they’d be covered by homeowner’s insurance. But, if a person you were renting household items to doesn’t return them, you are not covered for the theft. Why? Most policies have a “voluntary parting” clause that says you’re not covered when you voluntarily hand something over for someone else to use.

By the same token, if a friend has an accident while using your house or car, you’re covered under a standard home or auto policy. But if your renter has the same problem, you are not. That’s because these policies typically exclude injuries caused by commercial use of your property.

Although some rental platforms automatically provide appropriate insurance coverage when you sign up, most of their policies impose deductibles and other limitations that could prove costly to property owners. Some rental platforms offer no coverage at all.

You can buy your own coverage for both voluntary parting and commercial use of your property, if you need it. But this coverage requires either a separate rider or a separate policy.

Once you figure out the insurance, it’s only a matter of deciding what possessions you’re willing to share and where to list them for rent. Here are 32 platforms that can help you rent out a dozen types of possessions, from swimming pools to storage space.

Baby gear

Got kids? Then chances are good that you’ve also got high chairs, car seats and cribs. If the kids are now toddlers, you’ve probably also got board books, puzzles, scooters and slides. These trappings of a happy childhood are exactly the things that families traveling with little ones need but find difficult to cart around the country when they go on vacation.

Enter BabyQuip, a site dedicated to helping families rent out their unused baby gear to other families. The person with baby goods to rent decides what items are available and sets the daily rates for rental and delivery (if provided). BabyQuip takes a fee to market your wares and provide insurance. There’s also a $100 start-up fee, however. So don’t sign up here unless you think you’ll probably stay long enough to recover that cost.

A lower-tech — but lower-cost — option would be to list your baby equipment for rent on a neighborhood website such as Nextdoor or Craigslist.

Camera equipment

If you have high-end cameras, lenses, video equipment, lighting or photography supplies, ShareGrid and KitSplit specialize in listing and renting it out to moviemakers and photographers.

Damage and theft, while rare, are not unheard of on these sites, however. And while ShareGrid has insurance to cover voluntary parting, the policy has limitations. Be sure to record everything you’re renting out, piece by piece. Poor records lead to poor claims experiences.

Cars

Five sites promise to rent out your spare car.

Three of these sites — Turo, GetAround and Fetch — rent cars to tourists. Of the three, Turo works best for those who can meet renters in person to hand off the keys. GetAround and Fetch use keyless technology that they charge you to put in your car. It’s not cheap to install, but the keyless technology is convenient when it works. Unfortunately some car owners say it has caused mechanical problems that GetAround has been unwilling to fix. Make sure you find out whether the site will cover a fix if its technology harms your vehicle. And get that promise in writing.

If you have a classic automobile, your best bet is likely to be Giggster, a site that rents houses and cars by the hour to studios and photographers. On this site, instead of renting out your car for, say $25 a day, you rent it for $25 to $100 per hour. Better yet, you can stipulate whether the production company has the right to drive it; if you prefer, it’s used only in still shots.

The only car rental platform that SideHusl.com strongly cautions against is HyreCar, which rents vehicles to Uber and Lyft drivers. Although that clientele often needs long-term rentals, the site’s insurance policy is riddled with holes. That can leave car owners with big losses. (Read our review if you want details.)

Ad space on your car

If you don’t want other people to drive your car, you have another rental option. You can rent the space on your car as a sort of rolling billboard. Sites such as Carvertise, Wrapify and Promotocar will pay you to place placards on your car doors or wrap your car with advertising. You then drive it as usual.

The amount you earn varies by how much of the car is used, the advertiser, the length of the campaign and how much you drive. Ad campaigns are not offered every day, but it’s fairly easy money when they are.

Got a garage full of power tools, power washers or recreation equipment? Five sites will help you list those items for rent: Zilok, RentNotBuy, FatLama and Loanables. Each has a slightly different geographic footprint and fees. The best site or sites (you can list on multiple sites) will depend on where you live.

Houses and rooms

If you have extra space in your home or even a whole guest house or vacation home, there are three distinct options for renting it. You can rent by the month, by the day or by the hour.

Monthly: To find a monthly renter, you can advertise on Craigslist. However, if you want someone who is carefully screened, consider Silvernest and Nesterly. Both sites focus on finding renters for empty nesters. The homeowner sets the rental rate and terms; the sites facilitate screening compatible renters and processing rent payments.

Daily: Airbnb is the industry leader in finding daily rentals for whole homes or even a room in your house. However, there are literally dozens of other sites that will list your home — or rooms in your home — for rent. Most of them charge the homeowner more than Airbnb, however.

Hourly: If you have unique space that you’d be willing to rent out by the hour to photographers, moviemakers and event planners, there are dozens of options. Some of the best: Giggster, Peerspace, Splacer and CozyMeal.

Parking spaces

If you happen to live in an area where parking is hard to find, you may be able to rent out your parking space or driveway. CurbFlip, ParqEx and Pavemint all list parking spaces for rent.

Recreational vehicles

RV owners can list on Outdoorsy and set their own rental rates. The site charges the owner a fee that’s equivalent to 20% to 25% of each rental. That gets you an insurance policy, but there’s a big deductible. So make sure you also request a big deposit from renters to cover possible damages.

Swimming pools

If you have a swimming pool, Swimply can help you list it for rent by the hour or day. The site also encourages you to list whether your pool comes with other amenities, such as a barbecue or bathroom access.

Sporting equipment

Theoretically, FriendWithA is a rental platform for all types of goods. But in reality, this is the place to list (or find) high-end sporting goods, such as electric scooters, bikes and one-wheels. (A one-wheel is a cross between a skateboard and a Segway, propelled by an electric motor that responds to you shifting your weight.)

Storage space

Got empty shelves in your garage, basement or attic? You can rent out that space to other people who want to store stuff through Neighbor. You set your own rates and pay a modest 5% service fee to the site.

Watercraft

Owners of boats, paddle boards, kayaks or Jet Skis and other watercraft can rent them out through GetMyBoat and Boatsetter. Like most other rental opportunities, you set the rates and terms. When you’re renting a boat, you can even decide whether you’re willing to let someone else be the captain or if you go with the ship, so to speak. And, yes, if you go with the ship, you can also charge for your time.

They also expressed concerns about health care coverage, adequate testing for COVID-19 and the availability of personal protective equipment.

“Today we’re here because we feel Hawaii has a great opportunity to reopen the tourism industry safely,” said Unite Here Local 5 Key Leader Erin Kelley. “Global travelers are looking to Hawaii as one of the safest places to travel, and we feel Hawaii should not waste this opportunity by not opening safely.”

Kelley, who works in Kaanapali as a bartender at the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa, said testing for COVID-19 must be part of the reopening strategy.

“We’ve been working with public health experts and officials to make sure not only the guests are safe, but our workers are not put at risk. We want to make sure hotels are testing guests and workers. That is the only way we on Maui will be safe.”

Union shop steward Evie Charguelaf, who works at the Sheraton’s front desk, echoed many of her fellow members when she said maintaining health care coverage is vitally important.

“We’re here to raise awareness of workers’ lives,” Charguelaf said. “Reopen the state the right way. One of our main goals is we continue our workers’ health coverage.”

Sheraton housekeeping staffer and mother of three, Marilyn Fernandez, agreed.

“Health care is very important for my kids,” Fernandez said. “Safety is very important to me.”

The caravan started at Lahaina Gateway and cruised the length of Kaanapali Parkway before ending at Lahaina Cannery Mall.

Other signs Saturday included: “Up up with safety, down down with COVID-19!” “Safe hotels = safe Hawaii, Safe airports = Safe Hawaii,” “Maui should be aware: we need PPE, testing and health care,” “HI legislators do your job, Hawaii needs testing” and “Make Hawaii safe again.”

Kelley said many travel industry workers have lost their health care coverage due to the economic slowdown and hotel shutdowns caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.

“Our priority number one is nobody losing their health care coverage,” Kelley said. “Losing health care coverage is a danger to us all, our families and our community. The hotel industry should bring everybody back instead of using the pandemic to cut hours. It not only benefits the people we are serving, but it benefits the workforce as well. We’re demanding all classifications of workers are brought back.”

Union member Noah Berkey, who works at the Sheraton’s front desk, urged officials to listen to the union’s concerns.

“We just want to be part of the conversation and make sure they open up right,” Berkey said. “Testing is very important. We can’t open the island if they are not testing them to come in.”

The union is scheduled to continue highlighting the issue with a sign-waving event from 3 to 4 p.m. Monday in Kahului near the intersection of Kaahumanu Avenue and Puunene Avenue.","Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2020/06/13151859/mt-hotel-protest6-800x487.jpg,"['west', 'workers', 'hawaii', 'hotel', 'care', 'rally', 'safe', 'reopening', 'travel', 'industry', 'testing', 'health', 'works', 'coverage']",

The development comes ahead of the Assembly bye-polls in the state, likely to be held in September.

The former state minister was part of the Congress but had reportedly quit the party in 2009 because of his differences with Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the BJP in March. Shukla is said to be displeased with Scindia’s entry into the saffron party.

Shukla was welcomed back into the Congress fold at former chief minister Kamal Nath’s residence. The former chief minister called Shukla’s entry back to the party “a homecoming”. “Balendu Shukla joined Congress,” Nath said. “The reason why he left the Congress earlier is not in the party anymore. We all welcome them. There are many people who want to join the party.”

Shukla is the second leader to return to the Congress from the BJP in recent times, according to The Indian Express. On May 31, former Lok Sabha MP Premchand Borasi “Guddu” rejoined the Congress, within two years of quitting the party and joining the BJP. He also reportedly cited Scindia as the reason to quit the saffron party.

There are speculations that the Congress could field Shukla as a candidate when the bye-elections to 24 seats are announced. Shukla has always contested from seats in and around Gwalior.

The Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh collapsed in March after 22 MLAs, considered close to former Congress leader Scindia resigned. They later joined the BJP. Scindia had joined the saffron party on March 11 and was named the party’s Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh.

BJP leader and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath for the post on March 23. The next day, he won a trust vote in the Assembly, from which all Congress MLAs absented themselves. MLAs from the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and Independent leaders voted in favour of the motion.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/138623-ypgytiyzqa-1586690637.jpg,"['calls', 'nath', 'leader', 'joined', 'scindia', 'bjp', 'minister', 'mlas', 'congress', 'saffron', 'party', 'madhya', 'byepolls', 'bjps', 'pradesh', 'homecoming', 'joins', 'shukla']",
