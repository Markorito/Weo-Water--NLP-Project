Bangladesh is experiencing flood for the fourth time in this same year and the latest one in the month of August has made the country adrift. As monsoon rain kept on pouring and overflowing the rivers in the country as well as the upstream hilly regions of neighbouring countries, Bangladesh is currently facing a flood affecting the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river basin. The northern, north-eastern and central part of the country are experiencing flood from the Saturday night and around 4 million people are reported to be affected by it.

As of 16th August 2017, approximately 3.9 million people affected and 531,517 houses damaged in 24 districts. The most affected districts are Dinajpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Naogaon, Sirajganj, Jamalpur, Bogra, Tangail, Netrokona, Sylhet and Sunamganj, Gaibandha and Thakurgaon, Panchagarh. Total 56 people reported killed in this current flooding.

As per the FFWC report during last 24 hours’ water level of 56 points have been increased and 32 decreased out of 90 monitored points and water of 30 rivers points is flowing above danger line, with the waters of the Jamuna, Padma, Surma and Brahmaputra rivers expected to rise further over the coming 72 hours. As a result, 23 districts of the country have been rampaged by the water of flood and many roads, railways, and embankments got destroyed.

According to the NDRCC report published on 15 August 2017 the Government has also opened 1,392 emergency flood shelters, with an estimated 282,479 people have taken refuge. Affected communities lack temporary shelters, safe food and drinking water, and access to emergency medical services. The Government of Bangladesh has allocated of 6,913 tonnes of GR rice and GR cash of BDT 24,525,000. As on 15th August 2017, 3589 MT GR rice and GR cash BDT 15,307,000.00 have been distributed among the flood affected population. Moreover, many people in different districts are in extreme need of relief, food, shelter and purified drinking water.

Millions of people have been displaced across the region, and 245 people are recorded to have been killed by collapsed buildings or by drowning.

In Nepal, incessant rain has flooded hundreds of villages leaving 110 people dead. The government has come under fire for not responding fast enough to the disaster.

As security forces scrambled to rescue those marooned on rooftops and helicopters distributed food and water to the worst-hit districts yesterday, the home ministry spokesman Ram Krishna Subedi said relief supplies were being mobilised as soon as possible. Elephants were deployed to help rescue those stranded following three days of torrential rain, including 700 tourists in the popular town of Chitwan.

Across Nepal’s southern border, 13 districts have been hit by severe flooding in the Indian state of Bihar, leaving 41 people dead.

In the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, emergency workers have been scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing 46 people.

A further 21 people died in the remote north-eastern state of Assam, where soldiers were deployed to rescue those stranded on rooftops.

Meanwhile a third of Bangladesh is flooded after monsoon rains swept through the densely populated riverine country.

At least 27 people have died and a further 600,000 have been marooned across the low-lying delta region, according to Bangladesh’s disaster management minister, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury.

More than 16 million people have been affected by monsoon flooding across the South Asian countries of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh – putting huge numbers at risk of disease, hunger, and death.

One-third of Bangladesh and Nepal have been flooded, said Martin Faller, deputy regional director for Asia Pacific at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

“This is fast becoming one of the most serious humanitarian crises this region has seen in many years, and urgent action is needed to meet the growing needs of millions of people affected by these devastating floods,” Faller said.

“Millions of people across Nepal, Bangladesh, and India face severe food shortages and disease caused by polluted flood waters,” he added.

According to officials, more than 400 people have died in the three countries over the last seven days, with India accounting for 239 fatalities, 128 dying in Nepal, and 39 in Bangladesh.

Flood levels had already reached record highs in Bangladesh. Flooding of major rivers such as the Jamuna surpassed levels from 1988, the year of the deadliest floods the country has ever faced, the humanitarian agency said.

“More than one-third of Bangladesh and Nepal have been flooded and we fear the humanitarian crisis will get worse in the days and weeks ahead,” Faller said.

Aid group Save the Children director Mark Pierce said the situation is “extremely desperate”.

“The sheer volume of water is also making it really difficult to access some of the communities most in need,” he said in a statement.

In Nepal, many areas remain cut off after the most destructive floods and landslides in recent times on August 11-12. Villagers and communities are without food, water, and electricity.

In India, 168 deaths were reported in Bihar and Assam states, the worst-hit by the floods. Officials said the situation remains grim with the weather bureau forecasting more heavy rain in the region over the coming days.

Dhaka: Flash floods triggered by heavy seasonal rains and onrush of water from hills across the Indian borders on Sunday claimed lives of at least 18 people in three northwestern Bangladesh districts.

Flood situation in Dinajpur district, some 338 km northwest of capital Dhaka, deteriorated drastically early on Sunday after an embankment for protection of the the district town was broken, Xinhua quoted Monsur Ali Sarkar, officer-in-charge of the district's Kaharol police station, as saying.

He said that five people were dead after flash floods swept away places in Kahrol.

Abdul Majid, another official of the district's Birol Police Station, said four people were dead and one man was missing after a flash flood roared Birol.

Overall flood situation is also alarming in two more Bangladesh districts - northwestern Lalmonirhat and northern Kurigram - where rivers are flowing above the danger level.

Eight more deaths have been reported in these two districts in connection with the massive floods.

The Lalmonirhat and Kurigram deaths reported by the local media, however, have not been confirmed immediately.

Apart from the district, flash floods eroded large portions of villages and agricultural lands, and washed away buildings elsewhere in Bangladesh.

Authorities have evacuated residents of hundreds of villages to higher grounds in a number of Bangladesh districts that are prone to torrential rains between June and September.

TV reports showed villages in the country's north and northeast have gone under up-to-waist-high water. The residents were seen leaving their houses wading through flooded roads or on boats in search for shelter or a dry ground to live temporarily.

A Bangladeshi minister said last month that there was possibility of ""high magnitude flooding"" in the country amid moderate to heavy rains which have led to further elevated rivers and canals.

""There is possibility of high magnitude flooding in the second half of August,"" Water Resources Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud had said.

He said the country has been experiencing an increasingly intense rainfall over the last weeks.

Experts said Bangladesh, bordering the Bay of Bengal, has become more vulnerable to climate change-related problems like cyclones, flooding, as its capacity to protect its people and land is feeble.

In 2007, two floods in Bangladesh killed more than 1,000 people.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bangladesh-flood_social.jpg,"['firstpost', 'water', 'villages', 'rains', 'bangladesh', 'houses', 'districts', 'district', 'lost', 'washed', 'heavy', 'flash', 'floods', 'lives', 'flooding']",

Many schools have had to be shut down due to dwindling attendance of students who had taken refuge in flood shelters along with their family members. Books and other instruments have been lost or damaged while mid-term exams have been postponed. The number of affected education institutions is increasing across the country as new areas become flooded every day. However, government officials said that in some areas, the floodwater has already started going down. Mahbub Elahi, the deputy director of Rangpur division office of the Directorate of Primary Education, said a total 1,946 primary schools had been shut down across the division while 1,359 schools had been closed due to flooded classrooms. A further 587 schools were being used as shelters. “Three schools have been swallowed by the river while some infrastructure and educational goods were saved,” he said. “In cases of swallowed schools, new schools will be built on government land with the governmental allocation, and educational activities would be started soon. If there is no land, then we would ask local people for land for establishing educational institutes.” At least 3,000 primary schools have been affected by the flood in Joypurhat, Gaibandha, Bogra, Kurigram, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Rangpur, Lalmonirhat, Thakurgaon, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Naogaon, Jamalpur, Tangail, Sirajganj, Sherpur, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Netrokona, Faridpur, Rajbari, Shariatpur and Manikganj. Deputy Director of Rangpur divisional Directorate of Primary Education Abul Khayer said school teachers were hopeful the children could make up time lost to the flooding. “They will pay extra concentration in classrooms to minimise the loss after the situation is improved so that they can do well in completion and annual exams,” he said. In Rajshahi division, academic activities have been suspended in around 131 schools in Sirajganj, 120 in Naogaon, 76 in Bogra, 19 in Pabna and three in Joypurhat. Eight schools in Sirajganj, two in Pabna and one in Naogaon were swallowed by the river, the sources said. According to sources at the Rajshahi divisional office of the Directorate of Primary Education, educational activities have been interrupted in 564 schools from a total of 8,840. Classes have been suspended in 426 schools while 11 schools have been swallowed by the river. Sixty schools are being used as flood shelters. Primary Education Director Md Abdur Rouf (Planning and Development) told the Dhaka Tribune that they had been collecting field level information on flood affected schools but the total amount of losses and damages have yet to be determined. “Floodwater has entered the classrooms and in many cases, the buildings have been badly damaged. We will get an overall idea of the damage after the water has receded,” he said. According to Rajshahi divisional office of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, 138 schools and madrasas have been affected by the flood. Among them 87 institutions are in Sirajganj, 24 in Naogaon, 11 in Joypurhat, 11 in Bogra and five in Pabna. In Sylhet division, 33 educational institutes have been affected in Sunamganj district while academic activities in eight schools and madrasas have been interrupted, source said. Around 750 primary schools in the division have been affected by the flood while academic activities of some 321 schools were suspended. In Sunamganj, 567 primary schools were affected while classes and exams were suspended in 302 schools, the sources said. Prof Md Elias Hossain, director (secondary) of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, told the Dhaka Tribune: “According to our primary report, around a thousand secondary schools, colleges and madrasas have been flooded.” Meanwhile, National University authorities have suspended degree pass and certificate examinations of the students of 2015 (old syllabus) scheduled for Wednesday and yesterday because of the ongoing floods. A press release signed by the National University acting examination controller Badruzzaman said that they suspended philosophy fourth part exam for August 16 (Wednesday) and geography fourth part exam for August 17 (yesterday) due to the deteriorating situation. “The new schedule of the suspended examination will be announced later,” the press release added. On July 15, the examination began with the participation of 267,000 students of 1,600 colleges across the country. Candidates of Primary Education Completion Examinations and Junior School Certificate Examinations are the worst sufferers as the exams are scheduled in November. But the academic lives of many students have become uncertain as many schools have been left severely ravaged or entirely swallowed by the river. Government officials said steps will be taken to restore academic activities in educational institutions after the flood water is totally gone.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2017/08/Jamalpur-flood-pic-02.17.08.17.jpg,"['activities', 'flood', 'primary', 'academic', 'education', 'disrupts', 'school', 'country', 'swallowed', 'suspended', 'educational', 'schools', 'affected']",

Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 70 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh.

Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains.

Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels.

Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster.

In Nepal, police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods.

As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 47 people were missing, presumed dead.

The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.

""In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards,"" spokesman Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP.

""Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment.""

In India, emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh.

In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand -- which also borders Nepal -- three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP.

Bangladesh deploys troops

Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country, where flooding has killed 22 people.

Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain.

""We've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988,"" he said, referring to the worst-hit district.

""The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water, submerging most of the main town.""

The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours, raising fears the flooding could spread.

In Nepal, the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai, the country's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture.

""We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated,"" said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government.

""Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage.""

Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June.

The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from the area expected to be hit.

Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/flood-asia-web.jpg?itok=BFfz7jIN,"['monsoon', 'kill', 'water', 'rivers', 'bangladesh', 'told', 'state', 'killed', '165', 'nepal', 'floods', 'flooding', 'india']",

Last Sunday, a photograph appeared on the front page of Nepal’s leading daily, Kantipur, depicting the body of a five-year-old boy floating in Nepal’s Koshi River. The child, later identified as Kamalu Sada of Tilathi, Saptari District, had been let adrift after he died and his parents could find no dry land to bury him. Although natural disasters are not a new phenomenon in Nepal — severe earthquakes rocked the nation in 2015 and some degree of flooding and landslides occur each monsoon season — the photograph shocked the nation.

Currently, floods are affecting over 16 million people in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. In Nepal, the floods began late last week, and although the waters have begun to recede, communities are devastated. According to the Nepali government, the floods have killed at least 120 people, destroyed 7,000 homes, and displaced over 18,000 families. Although the accuracy of much of the data right now is questionable, the Nepali government is in the process of a rapid assessment of damage, and is likely to publicize the results soon.

Whereas damage from the 2015 earthquakes was concentrated in Nepal’s hills and mountains, the current floods have primarily affected Nepal’s southern plains which abut India, although earthquake-affected areas have also suffered landslides related to the heavy downpours.

The flooding has affected the poorest the most, such as those in Bairawa village in Saptari District, whose residents are mostly Dalits – so called “untouchables.”

Many people in Bairawa have taken refuge on whatever high ground is available — schools, temples, the sides of roads, and embankments. They sleep outside with their livestock, fearing nighttime attacks by snakes and other wild animals.

The poorest are most vulnerable to flooding because they often live on floodplains, explains Ajaya Dixit, a hydraulic engineer and water expert who heads the Kathmandu-based NGO ISET-Nepal. “They’re not there because of their own choice. They’re there because historical, social and other factors forced them to live there.”

Many of Nepal’s poorest citizens depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, although agriculture only represents about a third of the country’s GDP. According to an estimate by the Ministry of Agricultural Development, the floods have caused over Rs. 8 billion in damage to crops, or about $77 million, primarily to rice paddy and vegetable crops.

Agricultural damage is felt most acutely by smallholders and tenant farmers. In Kanchanrup Municipality in Saptari District, Biso Paswan, 65, says the rains destroyed his crop on the five kattha of land he was renting (about one-sixth of a hectare). He says he owes the landlord about 600 kilograms of rice, and does not know how he will provide it.

The floods have also done significant damage to government infrastructure. Roads and bridges have been wiped out in a number of places, and traffic on the main highway connecting Kathmandu to India has been disrupted. The Ministry of Irrigation has estimated damage worth Rs. 2.42 billion to irrigation systems around the country.

Furthermore, the floods have killed livestock, farmed fish, and other animals. At least one rhino drowned, and others were washed away from Nepal’s Chitwan National Park into Bihar in India.

Natural and Human Causes

Though Nepal experiences severe flooding in pockets during most monsoon seasons, this year is unusual in that the floods have spanned nearly the entire breadth of the country from east to west at the same time. When clouds burst open, 424 millimeters of rain (almost 17 inches) fell in just eight hours in some parts of the country. Although scientists still debate the overall effects of climate change on the South Asian monsoon, an emerging pattern is that rainfall events are spaced further apart and are becoming more intense, according to Rajendra Sharma, a Nepali government hydrologist interviewed by The Record. Sharma points out that just days before the current floods, areas in the eastern Terai experienced drought-like weather.

The most recent rainfall event comparable to those earlier this week in Nepal occurred in July 1993, when a cloudburst led to 540 mm (21 inches) of rain in 24 hours. Devastating floods also hit the Terai in 2008, although these were primarily caused by a breach of embankments on the Koshi, Nepal’s largest river.

The current floods have been exacerbated by urban development and environmental degradation. Ajaya Dixit, the hydrological engineer, says that rapid urbanization has changed local hydrology in some places, causing flooding in areas that had not seen it before. In addition, the booming construction industry has driven up demand for sand and gravel, which are mined from upstream river beds during the dry season. Such mining often occurs illegally; contractors conspire with local officials in charge. When the monsoon comes, the mining causes loose sediment to travel downstream, where it settles in the plains, causing rivers to meander and flood more frequently. Haphazard road construction in Nepal’s hills, which also causes erosion, has exacerbated flooding too, says Dixit.

Poorly designed infrastructure has also contributed to the flooding. Elevated roads in the Terai, which often run perpendicular to the flow of water, lack sufficient drainage, as the journalist Cheryl Colopy discusses in her book Dirty, Sacred Rivers. In addition, man-made embankments on major rivers can stop them from overflowing in the short-term, but also can cause flooding on the outside by preventing tributaries from draining into the main river, as a recent Al Jazeera report shows.

The mainstream Nepali press has criticized India for contributing to floods by not releasing water from dams and barrages on Nepal’s major rivers like the Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali, and Mahakali. But Dixit is skeptical of this argument, saying that the Indian dams are only responsible for flooding in Nepal’s southernmost villages, not upstream. (Meanwhile, the Indian media often blames Nepali dams for floods in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, a claim Dixit also rejects, noting that the floodgates of storage dams in Nepal, with one exception, are in fact controlled by India.)

Moreover, most of the current flooding is caused by minor rivers fed by the Mahabharat and Churia hills, located to the south of the main Himalayan range. This has caught planners off-guard, since most flood-control engineering has focused on snow-fed rivers that originate in the northern Himalayas. “Churia rivers have never been on the radar screen of our psyche… nobody pays attention to them,” says Dixit.

The Response

After facing criticism in its handling of relief and reconstruction for the 2015 earthquakes, the Nepali government is struggling to respond to the current floods.

In the immediate aftermath of the floods, many people depended on family, friends, and neighbors for rescue, food, and shelter. In Biratnagar, a major city in the eastern Terai that suffered flooding, youth groups, religious groups, and volunteer organizations played an early role in relief, according to Chand Iraki, the president of Nepal Leo Clubs.

The government’s response, when it came, was directed centrally by the Ministry of Home Affairs. It has deployed 27,000 army, police, and civil servants to assist in rescue and relief operations. As of Thursday, the government had released Rs. 1 billion (roughly $9.7 million) from the Prime Minister’s Relief fund for relief efforts. At the district-level, relief is led by District Disaster Relief Committees (DDRCs) which are headed by Chief District Officers, who are bureaucrats appointed by the central government. The DDRCs have been involved in a variety of activities, including the distribution of food, health camps, and the disposal of dead animal carcasses, according to Saptari’s Chief District Officer, Bhagirath Pandey. The government has been assisted by the Nepal Red Cross; the UN Humanitarian Country Team has also been activated.

Although Nepal is undergoing a transition to a federal system and decentralization enshrined in the country’s 2015 constitution, the government response to the floods has been fairly centralized. For example, while municipalities — the most local level of government — are playing an important role in relief work, they take direction from the DDRCs. Part of the reason for the municipality representatives’ secondary role in relief is their newness — local representatives were elected just in May and June this year, after a 15-year gap with no locally elected representatives. Furthermore, local representatives have not yet been elected in Province 2, where elections have been delayed until September due to ongoing political disagreements over the new federal structure.

But the government has also taken other measures to centralize its control of aid. The government has ordered that all flood aid be directed through the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund, disallowing NGOs and INGOs from engaging in independent relief activities. The government has also not declared a state of emergency, further constricting what organizations can do independently.

Ostensibly, the rationale for these decisions is to ensure that aid is distributed equally and fairly. But the decisions also take place amid tensions between the Nepali government and international NGOs, with whom they have traded blame over the delayed earthquake reconstruction process. The government’s decision to direct all aid through the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund has been criticized for obstructing relief in the Nepali press. Still, some private groups have disobeyed the government’s orders to deliver aid independently, and in some cases the DDRCs have helped coordinate independent aid, despite orders from above, according to Mahesh Nepal, a governance expert at the INGO Pact based in Nepalgunj, in the western part of the country.

Lasting effects

Many effects of the floods remain to be seen. The damage to crops is likely to continue in food shortages throughout the year. And for many people, recovering from the loss of life and property will be a long process that will take many years.

In Ghoghanpur village in Saptari District, Sallatul Khatun, a single mother of four young children, sits on top of a pile of tin sheets and rough-hewn wood — the remains of her home. She cries silently — she has a disability that prevents her from speaking. Though she is landless, members of her community had built the home for her to live in earlier this year, as an act of charity. It was simple, and lacked a toilet, but it was a space she could call her own.

For now, she and her children shelter in a local school.

The previous floods occurred in these two river basins during the middle of July. Water levels currently crossed the Danger Levels (DLs) in the Jamuna, Teesta, Dharala, Atrai, Jamunaswary, Ichhamati, Gur, Little Jamuna, Tangoan, Korotoa, Ghagot, and in their tributaries in the north central of Bangladesh.

Similar floods have also been observed in Assam in India, which is the upstream of the Brahmaputra River

Last week, we also observed floods in the major rivers of the Meghna basins such as Surma, Kushiyara, Jadukatha, Bhugai, Kangsha, Someswwati, Sari Gowain, and Manu.

The north, north-central, and northeast districts of Bangladesh are currently suffering from major floods.

Floods in Bangladesh are nothing new, and people are used to natural monsoon floods. However, what is unexpected is the frequency and intensity of flood in recent times.

When water levels cross a certain level known as Danger Level (DL), it is considered a flood.

Water levels above the danger level often cause damage to property, infrastructure, crops, livestock, and, in some cases, even causes human fatalities.

Alarming patterns and statistics

This year we have already observed floods in the two basins, and now we are passing through the second wave of the monsoon floods which normally occur between June and September. Severe floods occurred in 1988 (a return period of one in 100 years in the Brahmaputra river), 1998 (prolonged floods lasting more than two months in some places), 2004 (a return period of one in 100 years in some stations), 2007 (also affected Dhaka city) and in 2016 (affecting more than 25 districts of Bangladesh).

However, this year, the rise of floodwater will be unprecedented in our recent history, considering the height of the peak flood. It has already crossed the Record High Water Level (RHWL) in various stations of many tributaries of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river systems such as Mohadevepur in Atrai, Badarganj in Jamuneswari, Kurigram in Dharala, and Dalia in the Teesta.

This week, it will cross the RHWL at Bahadurabad in Jamuna river and then Sirajganj in Jamuna river. It may touch the RHWL of the Kusiyara at Sheola in this week. Last year, at Baghdadabad in Jamuna river, peak flood also crossed the previous RHWL, and it was above 11cm above the previous RHWL in 1988 (20.6m).

Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods

It is alarming that RHWL will be crossed in many stations of this Brahmaputra-Jamuna river again during this monsoon season. This indicates that the severity of the floods have been increased in recent decades in our major rivers of Bangladesh.

Blame climate change

It was not completely unexpected that the severity of the floods in the major rivers of South Asia would increase due to climate change.

In many studies, it was shown that floods in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins would be more intense.

Due to global warming, mean global temperatures have already increased by about 1 degree centigrade from the pre-industrial period. It has been predicted by IPCC that Earth will be much warmer at the end of the century due to the anthropogenic green-house gas emissions.

Global warming will alter the hydrological cycles, and floods will become more severe in South Asian regions. Results from a recent collaborative study by BUET under a collaborative research project titled “High End Climate Impact and Extremes (HELIX)” funded by the EU under the Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013 also confirmed so. This study was carried out to assess the impacts of the extreme climate change in Bangladesh and its impact of the river discharge.

Although the Paris Agreement in 2015 brought hope that global emissions will be reduced to such a level that global temperature rise will not be above 2C from the pre-industrial period, UNFCC countries which signed the agreement must make good on it.

Otherwise, the most climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh will suffer the most from extreme climate events like floods.

The rise of the sea level due to climate change will put additional threats to the flooding of our country, as it will have a “backwater effect” on floods. Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods. Perhaps the floods in 2017 will not be as prolonged as the 1998 floods, as the waters in the Ganges river is well below the danger level, and there is not much chance of synchronised three flood peaks of the three major rivers: Ganges, Brahmapura, and Meghna.

Moreover, the spring tide will occur in coastal rivers after the new moon on August 21. This will provide enough time for the floodwater in the Jamuna and Meghan river systems to recede in many places. However, there is no doubt that extreme events like severe floodings have become more frequent, and more intense than before. Bangladesh, concerningly, will become more and more vulnerable in the coming days.

A mother and child were washed to their deaths when they fell from a collapsing bridge during heavy flooding amid ‘one of the most serious humanitarian crises’ aid workers have known.

The horrific moment was recorded on camera as desperate families risked everything to flee the flood waters in eastern India, which has already claimed the lives of hundreds of people.

The video shows families taking turns to run across the rapidly deteriorating bridge as the heavy waters surged below and undercut its foundations.

One man is seen on the far side waving for others to cross. He eventually crosses to guide the woman and child back.

Tragically the bridge gave way as they were inches from safety. The mother and child plummeted into the waters below with the man managing to cling on.

Since August 13 an estimated 343 people have been said to have been killed in the disaster caused by heavy rain across the three nations.

The unprecedented floods in Agartala city in northeast India due to intense rainfall over just two days point to an immediate attention required towards building urban climate resilience

A deluge on August 11 and 12 caught Agartala, the capital of Tripura in northeast India, completely unawares. Almost the entire city went under water, all urban services including local transportation came to a standstill. There were lives lost and property damaged.

Between 8 a.m. on August 10 and 8 a.m. on August 11, Agartala witnessed a total of 102.70 mm rainfall, India Meteorological Department data show. It was 93.90 mm in the next 24 hours. A total rainfall of 196.6 mm plunged the city under water and threatened its infrastructure.

Although the city is slowly recovering, it still faces the challenge of thwarting epidemics. Schools and colleges were closed for two days. Chief Minister Manik Sarkar, whose official residence was also flooded, had to take a bus to reach the State Secretariat, some 5 km away. The floods have rendered some 11,000 people homeless and resulted in four deaths till August 15.

Avoiding such urban calamities, which seems to be occurring in increasing frequency in cities across India, requires focused attention. In Agartala, they must centre on reviving the Haora river, once the lifeline of the city; modernising its drainage system; and restoring and preserving its rich natural ecosystem.

Extreme weather events

Agartala is unprepared for extreme weather events. The Greater Agartala Planning Area (GAPA) has expanded 30 times from 3 sq. km in 1901 to 92 sq. km in 2017. During the same period the population has increased 85 times to an estimated 550,000. Today, the population density of Agartala is about 6,000 people per sq. km.

Agartala, capital of the third smallest state in India, experiences an annual rainfall between 2,200 and 2,600 mm. Although heavy rainfall is par for the course, the intensity this year has had disastrous consequences, similar to the floods the city experienced in 1984 and 2004. But the magnitude of damage caused this year has been unprecedented.

Located only 12.80 metres above mean sea level, the future of the city is at great risk, and it is high time that measures are taken to create a road map for sustainable development of this historic city. Agartala, which is located just next to Bangladesh border, can also take lessons from that country in managing floods.

Bangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change effects, including sea level rise. “The location and geography of Bangladesh makes it not only particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, but also extremely hard to protect,” researchers Mohammed Fazlul Karim and Nobuo Mimura wrote in the Global Environmental Change magazine.

It is likely that Tripura will also witness similar rainfall in increasing frequency in the coming years. There are many lessons to be learnt from this year’s floods on how to prepare to tackle such situations better. There are three measures that would go a long way to make Agartala a better-prepared and sustainable city.

Situational analysis

Agartala was established in 1849 by Krishna Kishore, then the king of Tripura. Two rivers flank the city — Katakhal in the north and Haora in the south, the latter with a much bigger catchment area. The ecosystem of the city has been strongly linked with these two rivers. Over a period of time, the carrying capacity of the Haora was reduced drastically because of deforestation and other construction activities in its catchment areas.

On August 11, the embankment on the Hoara was damaged in two locations and all the water coming in from that river flooded the city, doubling the impact of rain-induced floods. All the rivers in Tripura flow into Bangladesh. This time, making things worse, neighbouring areas of Bangladesh also witnessed heavy rainfall and the water could not flow out of the city.

Increasing importance

In last few years Agartala has emerged as an important city in the region. It has highest air traffic in the northeast after Guwahati. India’s third international Internet gateway, after Mumbai and Chennai, was launched at Agartala last year by the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh.

Given the fact that surface connectivity to other parts of India from the northeast via Bangladesh is going to improve significantly, Agartala is going to be the nerve centre of all such developments. There are three factors that require immediate attention in the second most important city of northeast India.

Not without Haora: First and foremost, attention must be paid to the Haora river. Its water carrying capacity has been reduced drastically. However, it remains the lifeline of the city because about 60% of residents, particularly those living in the slums, depend on it for drinking water and other domestic usage. The river has a catchment area of about 414 sq. km and flows through a distance of 53 km. Reckless deforestation, extraction of sediment from the riverbed and construction of road and bridges have resulted in the swelling water coming inside the city with excessive rain.

Modernise city drainage: Agartala has a storm water drainage system about 60 km long. About 50% of the existing city area is covered by open drains. These drains carry sanitary wastes, which is discharged into the drains from septic tanks and toilets. During the monsoon, the situation worsens as the city is flooded by water from Haora and Katakhal. Then there is backflow from water bodies.

Pumping out the entire water out will be a Herculean task considering the magnitude of the floods. The need of the hour is widening and deepening the existing drains. Desilting of rivers and drains needs to be carried out along with aligning the drains for proper outflow of water. Widening the drains in and around the central part of the city and other market places needs to be taken up on a war footing.

Restore and preserve ecosystem: For years, there used to be a natural drainage connection between Katakhal and Deotachara, a tributary to Haora. This used to ensure free flow of water out of the catchment areas. Now due to construction of roads and buildings, this natural flow is disrupted affecting drainage.

The city and its peripheral areas had many lakes, ponds, other water bodies and marshy lands. These used to be the absorbent of storm water. Many such bodies got converted into habitat and commercial zones. A lake near Joynagar has disappeared over a period of time. The size of another prominent lake at College Tilla got drastically reduced. The areas like Kunjaban, Lichubagan in the north and Arundhuti Nagar and Amtoli in the south have witnessed degradation of natural resources due to construction activities and other human interventions.

These buffer zones are becoming more like concrete jungles, increasing the vulnerability of the city. Therefore the expansion of the city has to be planned in a more rational manner so that the absorbing capacity of the natural ecosystem is not compromised.

Basir is among around 800 Indians, including a number of children, hailing from two areas of Cooch Behar district under the Indian state of West Bengal, who have taken shelter in Lalmonirhat, a northern district of Bangladesh. The Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) told the Dhaka Tribune on Monday that the flood-affected Indian citizens were provided shelter in Mogolhat and Durgapur union parishads of Sadar and Aditmari upazilas of the district. Locals of the two upazilas said the troubled people started thronging the two union parishads and taking shelter in homes and streets on Saturday evening. Many of the Indians took shelter in the homes of their relatives or acquaintances in the district. This correspondent visited numerous homes and some shelter centres in the two upazilas and found that the Indians in trouble include a number of children, women and elderly people. During the spot visit, some expecting mothers were also noticed in the shelter centres. Arjina Khatun, a seven months pregnant woman, came to Lalmonirhat along with her husband, their three daughters and a son to avert fatalities in their village home in Cooch Behar. Meanwhile, people of Lalmonirhat are highly elated to give shelter to the Indians. Reazul Haq, a resident of Sadar upazila, said: “There should not be any question over crossing the borderlines when it comes to natural disaster or any other massive crisis. “Keeping the matter in mind, we stood by the flood-affected Indians only to help them in such a tough situation.” When contacted, Lalminirhat 15 BGB Battalion Commanding Officer Lt Col Golam Morshed said they allowed the Indian nationals to get into Bangladesh considering the humanitarian ground. “We are gathering information on the Indian nationals’ whereabouts, who are from Daibas and Jari Dhorola areas under Dinhata subdivision,” he added. However, many of the Indians were reeling from growing uncertainty since they left behind their assets and cattle back home. Their concern over earning a bread is also spiraling with days going by. “Me and my husband used to work in a garment factory in Delhi. But, I do not know how we could be employed again,” said Meher Bani, who expressed her gratitude to Bangladeshi people and the BGB for the shelter.","Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2017/08/Lalmonirhat-Dharla-Flood-News-Indian-Nationals-News_Moazzem-hossain_14-08-2017-1-copy.jpg,"['indians', 'basir', 'indian', 'natural', 'manmade', 'disaster', 'lalmonirhat', 'district', 'shelter', 'bangladesh', 'homes', 'wipes', 'evening', 'borders', 'upazilas']",

The patch, which enveloped parts of West Bengal, North East India and Bangladesh, signified that there had been more than 175 mm rainfall in these areas in the past 24 hours. Though this was surprising, it was not unheard of at this time of the year.

Within hours however, an unprecedented wave of floods hit these regions. The purple patch, which typically disappears within a day, lasted for 42 hours. By the weekend, floods were wreaking havoc in parts of Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Nepal and Bangladesh.

Heavy rainfall in Brahmaputra valley on August 11: Screen shot of NASA's one-day rain accumulation map, taken at 6.58 am. Regions in yellow indicated rainfall between 125 mm and 175 mm; orange indicates rainfall between 75 mm and 125 mm; red indicates rainfall between 35 mm and 75 mm.

Heavy monsoon spreads to West Bengal and Bihar by August 14: Screen shot of NASA's one-day rain accumulation map at 4 pm

At the time of writing this piece on August 12, the Central Water Commission’s flood forecasting website had marked at least seven sites in orange, signifying that water levels in these areas was less than half a metre short of the highest-ever flood level for that region. These included Torsa, Raidak-I, Sankosh, Gaurang, Beki rivers (all northern tributaries of Brahmaputra) as well as the Brahmaputra alone at three sites: Neamatighat, Dibrugarh and Tezpur. Many other sites, marked with a pink dot (signifying that river water level is above the danger mark), were likely to turn orange or red in over the next 24 hours.

August 14: Screenshot of the flood warning map from the Central Water Commission. Red dots indicate unprecedented flow, while orange dots indicate high flow. Pink and yellow stand for moderate and low flow.

Raidak-I river at Tufanganj in Cooch Behar (West Bengal) was already red at the time of writing this article, meaning that the river water level had crossed the highest ever flood level for that site. The river had crossed the earlier highest ever flood level of 36.36 m, recorded 24 years back on September 21, 1993. So, this region was seeing the worst floods in at least a quarter of a century.

Assam and parts of West Bengal that had already experienced several waves of floods earlier in this monsoon were facing the prospects of an even bigger deluge. All indicators showed that neither the state nor the Centre was ready for this new wave of floods.

The table below gives an overview of the sites where the water level was less than half a metre short of highest-ever recorded flood levels from Central Water Commission’s flood forecasting site, as on August 12.

Barring Kokrajhar, Dibrugarh and Neamatighat, the water levels were predicted to rise in all other areas over the next 24 hours.

Ganga basin flooded

That the Ganga basin could also face similar unprecedented floods in the coming days was apparent from the flood forecast of the Basua site in the Supal district in Bihar, along the Kosi river, on August 12.

The highest flood level for this site is 49.17 metre (reached on Aug 25, 2010). As of 11 pm on August 12, the river water level here was 49 metre and it was predicted to reach 49.23 m by 7 am on Sunday – meaning it would breach the highest flood level recorded so far. By Sunday at around 1 pm, Basua breached the highest flood level and water levels reached 49.23 metre and water levels were within half a metre of the highest ever level in seven other areas in the Ganga basin.

On Monday, the situation in Bihar’s Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar districts worsened and the death toll in the state rose to 13.

Assam’s double deluge

In Assam, which had seen heavy flooding in July, has been hit hard by the second wave of floods and the total death toll has gone up to 99, according to news reports.

Here are numbers from the latest available flood report from the Assam Disaster Management Authority on the damage done so far by the the latest round of floods (as on August 13):

Dam problem

During the earlier round of floods in Assam and other parts of the North East, the role of dams, hydropower projects and embankment breaches had come into focus. Questions had been raised about efficacy of these structures. Similarly, the government’s attempt at dredging the river, creating waterways, building roads and embankments on both sides of the Brahmaputra river was also questioned.

Demands have been raised to decommission the Ranganadi Hydro in Arunachal Pradesh, the Loktak Hydro Project in Manipur, in addition to Dumbur Dam in Tripura earlier and the Lower Subansiri Dam on the Arunachal Pradesh-Assam border.

Questions were also raised about the reliability of the Central Water Commission forecasting ability, as no floods had been predicted in many areas that had went under water during the weekend. Their flood forecasting has been criticised for coming too late, being erroneous or just not available to the right people at right time.

Around 15 rhinos, 185 deer and at least one Royal Bengal tiger have died in the devastating floods that have submerged almost the entire Kaziranga National Park in Assam state, Satyendra Singh said.

“Carcasses of animals were seen floating in the floodwaters. It’s a heartbreaking scene,” Singh said.

Meanwhile, across northern India and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh, the death toll from drowning, collapsed houses and landslides triggered by annual monsoon rains climbed to around 578 on Saturday.

Army soldiers and disaster management workers in the three countries have launched mammoth rescue efforts to evacuate and provide food and shelter to the nearly 16 million people affected by the floods in South Asia.

In the northern Indian state of Bihar, at least 153 people died as swirling floodwaters submerged hundreds of villages and swept away homes made of mud and straw.

Eleven million people have been affected by the floods in 17 districts of the state, said Pratay Amrit, an official in Bihar’s disaster management department. Nearly half a million people were in more than 1,300 state-run relief camps, where they were being provided rice and lentils and medical care, he said.

In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state, the death toll rose to 40 as floodwaters submerged entire villages after 13 small dams were washed away, state officials said.

The Rohini, Gandak and Rapti rivers were flowing above the danger mark and could breach their banks, adding to the sense of urgency in evacuating people from low-lying villages, said Avnish Awasthi, a government spokesman.

The flood situation worsened after water was released from swollen rivers in Nepal that threatened to overflow, Awasthi said.

Soldiers used motorboats to rescue people marooned on rooftops while air force helicopters dropped packets of food and drinking water to those trapped in their homes.

Officials said 144 people were swept away or drowned in Assam while 60 others were killed in West Bengal state.

At Kaziranga, nearly 80 per cent of the 430-square-kilometre wildlife park was under water. Some of the animals had crossed a highway and moved to higher land. The Assam government has deployed security guards on the highway to protect the rhinos from poachers, said Singh, the park director.

In Nepal, floods have killed around 110 people since the monsoon rains began in June. However, the floodwaters were receding and no new casualties have been recorded, officials said.

In Bangladesh, more than 70 people have died over the past week due to drowning or snake bites this monsoon season.

The government’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Saturday that the flood situation was expected to continue to improve over the next few days.

Many flood protection embankments and dikes have collapsed because of the force of the floodwaters across the impoverished northern region of Bangladesh, a delta nation of 160 million people that’s criss-crossed by more than 130 rivers.

""These rivers are now flowing below the danger level, but if the rising trend continues they will cross the danger limit within 3 to 4 days,"" said an FFWC official.

""The river Jamuna is flowing over the danger levels in many points. This will rush to rivers around the capital after flooding the north and central region,"" FFWC executive engineer Sazzad Hossain said, adding, ""this is the reason the water level in these areas will rise in 3 to 4 days"".

He told bdnews24.com that ""the Jamuna at Bahadurabad point crossed the danger limit. Those water will come towards the central region increases the risk of flooding.""

This is the second spell of flooding this year in which more than 600,000 people in 20 districts in the north of the country are affected.

The water from the north would reach the Bay of Bengal through Meghna river, so there is danger of flooding in Dhaka, Munshiganj, Shariatpur, Narayanganj, Narshingdi and adjoining areas.

According to FFWC, the Buriganga in Dhaka registered a rise of 20cm in last 24 hours. Moreover, Balu in Demra point 12cm, Sitalakhya in Narayanganj 11cm, Turag in Mirpur 8cm and the water level in Tongi canal recorded a rise of 5cm during that period.

The Kaliganga at Taraghat point rose by 25cm, Dhalesweri at Jagir point 19cm and Rikabi bazar point 6cm, and Bangshi river increased by 8cm in Nayarhat point.

The FFWC official said that the Buriganga was still flowing 138cm below the danger level.

Fulbari flood victims lament losses - Bangladesh News 24 hours,https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2017/08/18/our-village-is-now-a-river-fulbari-flood-victims-lament-losses,"As river banks eroded and floodwaters broke through the embankments, people scrambled to save their homes and belongings. Stories of losses now fill the air of the villages in Fulbari.

Abu Hossain, 60, said he was resting in his home at Chargorok Mondol village on Saturday afternoon when he heard a loud noise.

""I was feeling sleepy lying on my bed when I heard people screaming outside. I ran to the road beside the embankment and saw a deluge headed our way.

""I went back home. Then I heard that horrible noise. The torrent was tearing down trees and soon there was water everywhere. I saw the village mosque and my neighbour Abul Hossain's home disappear into the water.""

A stream of the Dharala river had torn down the embankment at Gorokmondol.

""I managed to move my family to safety. But we couldn’t save anything. The household I built for 40 years is gone. It's gone away with water and mud,"" the man said as he cried uncontrollably.

The others had similar stories. They had witnessed floods that submerged their village and crops, but losing entire homes was something new altogether.

The road connecting Fulbari to Kurigram was gone in a glance, said Abdul Khalek of Charboroloi village. ""The huts of tin and thatch were simply crushed. Some don’t even have traces. Our village is now a river. We couldn't save anything.""

""I didn’t expect the flood to be this bad. My home went under neck-deep water in just two minutes,"" said Ishak Ali, a former union council member, who found shelter on an embankment at Prankrishna.

Aid did not come often, and when it did, the food provided is not enough to last more than a day, the people complained. Some tried to dry their rice grains whenever the sun peered through the clouds.

""We are poor people. We won't get help even if we die. The union's chairman and members don’t look after us,"" said an elderly 'Sofur'.

Papers were seen floating in the floodwater submerging Prankrishna's Kuthibari Modern High School. Moving further was difficult because most bridges and streets had been torn down by torrents of water.

""I was given 10 kilograms of rice to distribute to 40 flood victims. But who will I give this to? There are hundreds of people here! I am in trouble,"" said Khoimuddin, a union council member at Barabhita.

At least 8,000 families in Barabhita union have suffered damages in the flood, said chairman Khaibar Ali.

""I have ten tonnes of rice. This is way below what is needed.""

Fulbari Upazila Executive Officer Debendranath Urao said the floodwaters are starting to recede and people are returning to their homes.

""The Upazila administration has been running a kitchen for distributing Khichuri among flood victims. We will continue to provide them the food until situation returns to normal.""

So far over three million people have faced damage in 22 flood-stricken districts during the second flooding of the season starting July, according to the Department of Disaster Management.

The heavy rains of August 14 and 15 will stay in the memory of Bengalureans for some time. Floods, waterlogging, sewage flowing into homes are not things that people will forget fast. There is much blaming to happen on the woeful state of our city infrastructure but there are lessons to be learnt too.

The data generation on rainfall has improved by leaps and bounds. The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (www.ksndmc.org) has an extensive set of weather monitoring stations, currently numbering 82, which provide increasingly granular data on rainfall across the city. The recent rain for example was concentrated in the south central part of the city while the north had very less rainfall. The city is not homogeneous when it comes to rainfall for intensity, duration and total rainfall.

Is there a pattern to this? Are there areas which receive heavier rainfall? Are there areas which are more vulnerable to rainfall? All these are interesting questions which can be answered robustly by flood modelling. This is currently being carried out by the IISc and KSNDMC together, one understands. In the mean-time here is what citizens, communities, wards and the city can do to tackle the problem.

Citizens: Do not build on old tank beds, buffer zones of lakes and rajakaluves and generally low lying areas prone to flooding. Understand that a built plot can increase the runoff from site on to the storm-water drain by factors of 6. A 150 mm rain falling on a 150 square metre site can send 22,500 litres of water outside the plot. Add up all the sites in a neighbourhood and that is a flood waiting to happen.

Follow and exceed the bye-laws for rainwater harvesting. If the law mandates harvesting 20 mm of rain falling on a site, design to hold in sump tanks or percolate in recharge wells at least 60 mm of rain, if not 100 mm That means a 100 square metre of roof area should provide for 6,000 litre or 10,000 litre of storage. In case of a recharge well, the dimensions should be at least 3 feet in diameter and 20 to 30 feet deep with a grill on top for safety and security. Allowing all the site rainwater can recharge the aquifers and prevent flooding

Communities: Identify and map flood prone areas in your layout, apartment complex or neighbourhood. Make sure the drains are cleaned regularly and there is no dumping of garbage blocking and choking drains.

Keep emergency pumps ready with a plan to bail out water and the place to put the water into. Have the contact numbers of the local Civil Defence and BBMP authority responsible ready.

Identify the nearest lake or waterbody and make sure that the bund is robust and will withhold full levels. Make sure that the overflow weirs and rajakaluves are cleared and ready to drain storm water out.

Ward level: With the help of the Corporator, identify flood prone zones and develop plans to ensure drainage. Regular desilting of storm drains and removal should be insisted upon and pushed especially during the months of August, September and October when heavy rains are expected.

The connections between roads and stormwater drains are weak points which tend to get choked. Good design should be ensured here. Wherever possible, recharge wells should be made within the storm-water drain to percolate water into the aquifer. Regular removal of leaves and a good solid waste collection system avoiding the dumping of any waste in drains should be in place during the monsoon.

City level: A flood response cell with adequate maps of flood prone areas should be in place to quickly provide rescue and relief efforts.

Prediction using rainfall and storm water modelling and transfer of information to citizens and ward level teams should become part of the management system.

The global concept being tried out is called ‘sponge cities’ where the hard crust of urbanisation is converted into a sponge concept with aquifers, wetlands and lakes being included to detain and retain storm water and convert foods into a water asset stored for later use.

Water wisdom lies in transforming a problem into a resource. Urban floods are wake-up calls to treat rain with respect.

Considering the importance, the parties every year organise numerous programmes. They also have posters, banners, festoons and placards printed, showing their solidarity to the loss the nation had faced on the fateful night of August 15, 1975. The Awami League has organised a month-long programme and had printed banners, posters and festoons from the outset of the month as it does every year in remembrance of the Father of the Nation. Taking advantage of this a number of self-proclaimed leaders and activists of the Awami League do it all only to come to the limelight. One thing that the banners, placards, posters and festoons have in common is those are printed with photos and names of the leaders and activists which are bigger than that of Bangabandhu. Some central leaders of the party said the so-called leaders and activists are also defaming Bangabandhu and his ideology through the mourning day posters and banners. While visiting parts of the capital city, the Dhaka Tribune has found hundreds of such posters and banners reading messages on the National Mourning Day. In most cases, the size of photos of Bangabandhu’s daughter and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is also smaller compared to those of the leaders and activists. When the matter was brought to the attention of several central Awami League leaders, they also raised their eyebrows over the tendency that has been a regular phenomenon on different national occasions. Awami League Central Working Committee Joint General Secretary Abdur Rahman said: “It is a matter of ethics and value that the picture of Bangabandhu will be larger. Anyone can make a poster or banner with Bangabandhu’s large picture and he can use his picture or name in a small size.” He, however, said there is no specific party rule on how to make a banner or poster, and there is no restriction or bar in this regard as well. Meanwhile, senior Awami League leader Qamrul Islam, referring to an instruction by the party’s high command, said the banners and posters only having the photo of Bangabandhu are allowed during August. “The instruction is being grossly violated as I hardly see any banner or poster on display with bigger photo of Bangabandhu, which I think is a heinous crime,” said Qamrul. Another central Awami League leader, requesting anonymity, said some unknown and opportunist leaders are involved in the act, aiming to impress the party chief and draw her attention. “These leaders do it without even thinking that they are belittling Bangabandhu and his daughter,” he said, suggesting that such leaders and activists in question be banned from the party.","Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2017/08/MG_8712.jpg,"['flood', 'party', 'defaming', 'awami', 'leaders', 'dhaka', 'central', 'banners', 'activists', 'posters', 'mourning', 'printed', 'day', 'league', 'bangabandhu']",

This, however, did not end the plight of lakhs of people marooned in different parts of five districts. Train and bus services remained suspended. Scarcity of food and relief material led to agitation in many places. At Itahar in North Dinajpur district, angry villagers even looted relief material and a man was injured, allegedly by a rubber bullet fired by the police.

In Malda district, the grievance of flood-affected people turned into a political issue. Sanjay Sharma, a BJP councillor from Englishbazar municipality, alleged that BJP supporters were denied relief because of their political affiliation. Malda witnessed the worst calamity in recent years.

“More than 200 people in Ward 9 are going through extremely difficult times. But the Trinamool-run municipality is not providing them with relief material and shelter. This is nothing but political vendetta,” alleged Sharma, who was elected from the ward. He even wrote a letter to Nihar Ranjan Ghosh, chairman of the civic body.

Ghosh neither accepted nor denied the charges. “Any discrimination during distribution of relief material is undesirable. I have taken note of Sharma’s complain. I am looking into it,” Ghosh told HT.

At Itahar in North Dinajpur district, flood-hit people alleged that police fired rubber bullets at them when they were protesting against mismanagement in relief work and shortage of food. Bijoy Burman, a shopkeeper, was allegedly injured by a rubber bullet on Thursday evening.

District police superintendent Shyam Singh and Sanjay Seth, an orthopedic surgeon at Raigunj district hospital, made contradictory statements on the injury Burman suffered. While Singh claimed that police never opened fire at the crowd, Seth said Burman’s wound was caused by a rubber bullet but he was out of danger.

People staged agitation in South Dinajpur and Malda districts as well. Villagers looted relief material at Chanchal in Malda on Friday.

State irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said because of incessant rainfall in Bihar, water level in the Mahananda and Fulahar rivers has risen again. “This is leading to inundation in areas that were earlier not affected although North Bengal received less rain in the last 48 hours,” said the minister.","Sat, 19 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/19/Pictures/_77647b38-84d5-11e7-929c-3545fa1ac73c.jpg,"['loot', 'shortage', 'affected', 'rivers', 'district', 'north', 'rain', 'agitation', 'rubber', 'lakhs', 'material', 'floods', 'malda', 'leads', 'relief', 'bengal', 'political']", 
35,35,FL-2017-000108-BGD,How residents of Assam’s vulnerable sandbar villages saved themselves from this year’s floods - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/847406/how-residents-of-assams-vulnerable-sandbar-villages-saved-themselves-from-this-years-floods,"Living on the chars or sandbars on the mighty Brahmaputra and its fast tributaries isn’t easy. But this year was different for some villagers on a small islet called Tapajuli Pathar in Assam’s Barpeta district. For the first time in many years, Amirjan Khatun and her neighbours in Tapajuli Pathar have survived the annual flood without their houses being destroyed.

This is despite the fact that this year’s flood in Assam has been particularly severe. In the Barpeta district alone, 26 villages and more than 7,000 people have be badly hurt by the floods till a few days ago.

Floods occur with depressing regularity in Assam. This year has been as disastrous as ever, already claiming 84 lives and affecting more than 1.7 million people. Most often, the first areas to be flooded are the chars, or small river islands, found on the Brahmaputra and its tributaries.

There are over 2,000 chars in Assam, with an estimated three million people living on them. With about 68% of the char dwellers living in abject poverty, the floods have a devastating impact on their lives and livelihoods.

The elders in the char villages say that the nature of the floods has changed in the past three decades. Earlier, they could predict the timing and could take precautions. In recent times, they have had to move to government relief camps on higher ground during floods. The tiny camps of about 60 sq ft are woefully inadequate to house entire villages.

Mitigating measure

“This year too our area was flooded for a few weeks, but thankfully we could stay at home without being affected,” Amirjan told VillageSquare.in. This near-miracle has been made possible for Amirjan and her neighbours because of an innovation called plinth raising, which entails constructing a high earthen platform on which to build a house.

In this method, earth from nearby areas is used to raise the ground level. These platforms are raised to a height of at least three feet above the level of the previous year’s flood. The earth is compacted and grass is immediately planted on the slopes of the platform to hold the soil together. The villagers are encouraged to start vegetable gardens on the platforms and grow banana trees on the slight slope of the platforms to prevent soil erosion.

Life is hard

Most people in Tapajuli Pathar have lost their land to floods and erosion in the last few decades. They have ended up working as daily wage earners in nearby towns or in others’ farmland. “The financially sound families have left the place to buy land in other places,” rued 40-year-old Rahmat Ali, who lost his house and property twice in the last five years. “Some have shifted to stay with their relatives permanently.”

“I have seen enormous suffering of the char dwellers. To arrive at a solution, I even went to Bangladesh to study how they tackled the flood situation,” Abdul Kalam Azad, secretary of Jhai Foundation that initiated the plinth-raising measure under the Char Development Programme, told VillageSquare.in.

Surveys were conducted to get a better understanding of the problems faced by the char villages. The solution of raising the plinth was arrived at after a series of discussions involving dwellers, teachers, government officials, local administrators, experts and academia.

Choosing households

The participants in the programme were selected during the meetings, based primarily on their economic status. “Char Development Programme is not just about dealing with the floods, but also about bringing a positive change,” said Zahedul Islam, a development worker. “We ensured that the beneficiaries did not practice child marriage and child labour.” Other factors taken into consideration included whether a family was headed by a woman – a widow in most cases – or whether the family had members with special needs or if they sent their daughters to school.

Based on these criteria, 50 families were selected from the badly affected Mazidbhita, No 4 Bhera and Balikuri chars, besides Tapajuli Pathar on Beki River, one of the major tributaries of Brahmaputra.

The project began in 2016. Jhai Foundation spent some Rs 4.5 lakh to raise the plinths of 50 houses at an average of Rs 9,000 each. The families contributed labor.

Life on raised plinths

“The plinth-raising has changed our lives,” said 33-year-old Amirjan. “Last year we had to take refuge in others’ houses. This year we have our own home. Four of our children are going to school. My husband has been able to go to Kerala for work, since he doesn’t have to worry about us during the floods.”

“Earlier we had to move to a relief camp. I couldn’t grow any vegetables; all would perish in the flood. But this time, I grew them on the plinth. Most importantly, my pregnant daughter-in-law didn’t have to suffer sanitation and health problems during the flood,” Rong Bahar, a 65-year-old widow, told VillageSquare.in.

“This plinth-raising has made the char dwellers aware of the corrupt practices in government works,” said Kalam. “The villagers estimate that the same earth-filling work under a government scheme would have cost Rs 15 to 20 lakh because of corruption at various levels.”

Floating school

The schools in these areas were always closed during the floods. The village kids have now special floating classes aboard a boat stationed at Tapajuli Pathar. Every day, Jahidul Baig teaches 45 kids of different ages. “We are lucky not to miss classes this year during the flood,” said Anjuwara, a Class 6 student.

Though the floodwaters have receded and schools have reopened, the classes on the boat continue. “We started it in this locality six months back to help the students, besides their regular classes. And it proved to be a great help during the flood as the schools were closed for more than a month,” Jahidul Baig, the teacher, told VillageSquare.in.

The Char Development Programme will now be extended to other char villages. The community mobilisation for raising the plinths of houses has inspired an equal number of economically capable families to raise the plinths of their houses on their own.

36,36,FL-2017-000108-BGD,The real story behind flooded Assam school hoisting national flag - DailyO,https://www.dailyo.in/variety/assam-school-patriotism-independence-day-flag-floods-himanta-biswa-sarma-bjp/story/1/19024.html,"On August 15, Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma proudly posted some heart-wrenching images on Twitter with an equally emotional message: ""Big salute to these bravehearts, including teachers & students, who defeat adversity to celebrate #IndependenceDayIndia. Bow in gratitude (sic).""

That was around 3.09pm. But much before that these images started inundating Twitter and Facebook after Mizanur Rahman, an assistant teacher from Naskara LP school in Dhubri district, broke the news early on August 15.

Every news channel and website, including DailyO, picked up the news with pictures of headmaster Tazem Sikdar and two children standing chest-deep in mucky waters, saluting the national flag, and assuaging the fears of millions of hypernationalists that all those living in the minority-dominated district of Dhubri (which borders Bangladesh and is suspected to have a large number of illegal migrants from Bangladesh) love their country - India - and won't be told to go back to Bangladesh or to Pakistan henceforth.

For the skull cap-wearing men and burqa-clad women in Dhubri proving their patriotism becomes more important than their counterparts living in other parts of Hindu-dominated India. Bengali-speaking Muslims in Dhubri and other districts of Assam bordering Bangladesh often complain of harassment in the name of detection of illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

Who would know this better than Mizanur Rahman, who was also involved in the process of updating the National Register of Citizens 1951, according to the same The Telegraph report.

Rahman's pictures posted on Facebook sparked a spate of headlines and TV voice-overs soaked in nationalistic pride, TV anchors announcing in choked voices - ""Flood-affected in Assam celebrate Independence Day.""

More pictures followed from more locations across the state with similar headlines.

Image credit: Time 8

But just like the repetitive headlines, there was a recurrent theme in all the pictures - bearded men in skull caps or checkered lungis or kurta and pajamas rolled up until their knees. Some even in their gamchas.

(One can't help but wonder why didn't the education minister of Assam - Himanta Biswa Sarma - or any other senior government official join any such Independence Day celebrations in the flooded schools of Assam, something that would have definitely encouraged the students and teachers for more brave endeavours in future.)

Next day, headmaster Tazem Sikdar told The Telegraph that he had no clue how to hoist the national flag in the floodwaters.

This is what the report said:

""On August 15, there was no rain but the water had risen further. Still, by 7am on Independence Day, at least 25 students stood on a road about 10 metres away, waiting to hoist the national flag. Since it was chest-deep water for the kids, we selected two Class III students, Jiarul Ali Khan and Haidor Ali Khan, who know swimming, while the rest waited on the road.""

Sikdar and three assistant teachers - Rahman, Nripen Rabha and Joydev Roy - and the two students then hoisted the flag at the school, some 2.5km from Fakirganj town and 200km west of Guwahati.

'We hoisted the flag, sang Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram while the rest of the students followed us from the road,"" Sikdar said. ""In my 22 years of service, this is the first time we faced flood on Independence Day.'

Roy, one of the assistant teachers, clicked pictures of the flag. Mizanur Rahman, his colleague, uploaded on Facebook the pictures that went gone viral, drawing over 61,000 likes and more than one lakh shares by that evening.""

The same report said the photographs had to be sent to Amir Hamza, the cluster resource centre co-ordinator who monitors at least 11 schools.

""That's the state government's rule. Any school event must be recorded through photographs,"" Rahman was quoted as saying by the newspaper.

The coordinator, a government official, then sends the pictures to the block officer, who then forwards them to the education department in Dispur, Guwahati.

While the efforts of the teachers may or may not have been motivated by the instructions of the Ministry of Human Resource Development - which had reportedly issued a circular on August 7 to all states, instructing schools to organise programmes revolving around Independence Day - the incident certainly shows traces of the prove-your-patriotism syndrome which has swept the country of late.

In Uttar Pradesh, where more than 70 children died in a government hospital in Gorakhpur just days before the Independence Day, madrasas were aksed to send photographs and videos of Independence Day event to district minority welfare officers.

After Naskara LP school managed to make national headlines - with its pictures flashing on TV screens as the ultimate example of how-to-prove- patriotism - the school teachers and others in the village and nearby areas hope the ""problems they have been facing for years will finally get the attention they deserve"".

That seems unlikely though.

Ironically, this is not the first time that Rahman, who sadly lost his 18-year-old cousin to the floodwaters in Fakirganj a few hours after the flag-hoisting, posted such moving images floods.

If one scrolls down his Facebook timeline, there is a video, with the caption ""flood everywhere"", of a National Rural Health Mission centre crumbling due to flooding. It was posted just a day before his flag-hoisting images went viral.

Sadly, there weren't many takers for it, nor did it make to the Twitter timeline of the state health minister (which again is Himanta Biswa Sarma).

Unlike patriotism, the flood fury - worst in 36 years - that continues to wreak havoc across Assam, fails to sweep the popular sentiments of 'New India'.

Well! a picture is worth a thousand words. But there is a lot more than meets the eye.

Location: This is the saga of The Naskara Lower Primary School in flood-hit Dhubri district of Assam. Due to heavy monsoon rains, large parts of Assam have been inundated for weeks now. This school got submerged on August 13.

Name the heroes: Tazem Sikdar--the man in the beard and facing the camera--is the headmaster.Mizanur Rahman--the man in white shirt--is a teacher at the school. Mizanur Rahman's teenage cousin drowned a few hours after the flag-hoisting ceremony.

Haidor Ali Khan ( first student from left) Jiarul Ali Khan (Second student from left) are class 3 students. They were selected for this rather risky adventure because they know how to swim. Other students, not in the picture, watched the flag hosting ceremony from a nearby road.

The picture was clicked by Assistant teacher Joydev Roy.

According to reports, rules require that pictures of all schools functions should be sent to cluster resource centre coordinator.

Problems are numerous for all those who live here. Their miseries get compounded during monsoon season which leads to soil erosion, erratic power supply, and flood in many areas.

Dhaka – In the wake of a flood feared to be devastating, Bangladesh has decided to import 1.5 million tonnes of rice and 500,000 tonnes of wheat apparently to face an imminent crisis.

The government’s Food Monitoring and Evaluation division at a meeting headed by Food Minister Quamrul Islam on Wednesday also decided to lower the rice import duty to two percent from existing 10 per cent to encourage private businesses to import the prime staple.

“The decision does not mean that there is a shortage of food in the country. It is for precaution,” the minister told reporters after the meeting.

In June this year, the government had decided to reduce the import duty on rice to 10 per cent from 28 per cent as crops on a vast area of marshland in the north-eastern Bangladesh were damaged by an untimely flash-flood in April.

The country had set a target of 19.01 million tonnes of rice this year to feed its more than 160 million people. But the flood in April and BLAST (a disease for paddy) caused damage to the harvest, said the minister.

Lowering the import duty on rice would encourage the private business to import the food and help keep the price stable in the domestic market, justified the minister.

The minister, however, claimed the price of rice in domestic market was within the reach of the common people.

He informed reporters that the process of 250,000 tonnes of rice from Vietnam was almost completed. Yet another 250,000 tonnes of rice will be imported from Cambodia provided the cabinet committee on purchase approves the proposal.

The minister said distribution of food among the poor and destitute was on.

More than each of the 5 million poor people will be provided with food aid from the next month. They will be provided with 30 kg of rice at the cost of Tk 10 per Kg for three months.

“Nutrition depends on many factors. Our food habit must improve and we should eat in a timely manner.”

The prime minister called on people to adopt a balanced diet and stressed the importance of raising awareness of nutrition in rural areas.

Hasina also called for an increase in fish production to improve nutrition for rural areas.

On Apr 23, 1975 the then President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ordered the formation of a Bangladesh National Nutrition Council.

A year after the Awami League government came to power in 1996, the government made the first national nutrition action plan.

The national nutrition plan took until 2015 to receive approval.

Work on a second national nutrition action plan began in 2016 to decide the initial steps required to reach the goals set out by the government.

It will only be possible to reach nutrition goals if we reach food production goals, said Hasina.

The Awami League has always inherited a food shortage from its preceding administrations, said Hasina.

When the BNP handed over power in 1996, there was a four million-tonne shortage of food in Bangladesh. In 2001, when the Awami League handed over power, the country had a food surplus of 2.6 million tonnes.

In 2009, when the Awami League returned to power, there was a food shortage of three million tonnes.

The prime minister noted that flooding caused significant damage to food production this year.

“We believe there may be another flood. We may face a food problem if the flooding is severe,” Hasina said.

“The government is preparing to import and store food so that this problem does not arise and sufficient food can be provided to meet the needs of people.”","Sun, 13 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/08/13/pm_pid002.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/PM_PID002.jpg,"['shortage', 'awami', 'nutrition', 'bangladesh', 'power', 'security', 'goals', 'hasina', 'target', 'food', 'national', 'league', 'reach', 'production']",

They said at least 500 Rohingya made the difficult journey into Bangladesh, some claiming they had been abused by soldiers in Myanmar.

The latest influx follows a months-long bloody military crackdown on the mainly Muslim minority in Myanmar last year that led tens of thousands to flee across the border. The United Nations has said the violence may amount to ethnic cleansing.

Abu Toyyob said he escaped with his seven-member family as the army vandalised Rohingya houses and detained young men.

""They arrested my younger brother from home and injured my two-year-old son by kicking him with boots,"" the 25-year- old told AFP.

""I immediately set off with my family and crossed the Naf two nights ago,"" he added, referring to the river that divides the two countries.

Dhaka estimates that nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees are living in squalid refugee camps and makeshift settlements in the resort district of Cox's Bazar, which borders Rakhine.

Their numbers swelled last October when more than 70,000 Rohingya villagers began arriving, bringing stories of systematic rape, murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar soldiers.

Bangladesh border guards said they had stepped up patrols after reports of a military build-up on the other side of the river.

Last week, the UN special rapporteur Yanghee Lee voiced alarm at reports that an army battalion had flown into Rakhine to help local authorities boost security in the region.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long faced criticism for its treatment of the more than one million Rohingya who live in Rakhine, who are seen as interlopers from Bangladesh, denied citizenship and access to basic rights.

But they are also increasingly unwelcome in Muslim- majority Bangladesh, where police often blame them for crimes such as drug trafficking.

Dhaka has floated the idea of relocating tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote, flood-prone island off its coast, despite opposition from rights groups.

An official with the UN Organisation for Migration (IOM), which looks after settlements for unregistered Rohingya refugees, said the organisation was aware of new arrivals.

""The numbers were ""not as alarming as the October influx,"" the official said.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-11/30/full/1480507955-9543.jpg,"['escalates', 'tens', 'rohingyas', 'tension', 'bangladesh', 'reports', 'settlements', 'rakhine', 'military', 'fresh', 'thousands', 'sees', 'influx', 'refugees', 'myanmar', 'rohingya']",

47,47,FL-2017-000108-BGD,Swiss Re: Miami Is More Vulnerable to Hurricanes Like Andrew - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2017/08/10/460775.htm,"Almost 25 years have passed since a Category 5 hurricane struck south of Miami, and the city’s vulnerability to catastrophic storm damage has grown exponentially, according to a new insurance underwriters’ analysis.

At the time, Hurricane Andrew was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history, causing more than $26 billion of damage in Florida’s most populous areas, including $15.5 billion in insurance payouts. Stringent building code enforcement followed in Miami, but so did population growth, coastal development and climate change.

“Our concerns lie with the fact that even though we’ve made good changes, 25 years later you have a much larger population living in Florida, and people forget what can happen or they don’t know what could happen,” said Monica Ningen, chief property underwriter for the U.S. and Canada at Swiss Re.

The Switzerland-based reinsurance company released an analysis Wednesday estimating the losses if a hurricane similar to Andrew’s size and strength hit Miami and its suburbs today.

Catastrophic Losses

On Aug. 24, 1992, Andrew blasted ashore about 20 miles southwest of Miami with winds topping 165 mph. The hurricane killed 15 people and indirectly caused the deaths of 25 more in Miami-Dade County alone, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Andrew destroyed 25,524 homes and damaged another 101,241; nearly all the mobile homes in its path were completely lost.

If a similar hurricane barreled down the same track today, Swiss Re estimates damage would range from $80 billion to $100 billion, including up to $60 billion in insured losses.

Should a similar hurricane target Miami directly, Swiss Re estimates unprecedented losses: $100 billion to $300 billion, including insured losses up to $180 billion.

Storm Surge

For all the extreme conditions Andrew produced, storm surge flooding from the compact hurricane was relatively minor in Florida. The abnormal rise of sea levels, driven ashore by storm winds, can be a hurricane’s most deadly hazard, but no one died because of Andrew’s storm surge – a fact the hurricane center considered “a fortunate aberration.”

According to hurricane center records, only $96 million in federal flood claims were reported after Andrew.

Rising sea levels caused by climate change is expected to exacerbate storm surge flooding. Even a moderate rise of 3.5 inches by the 2030s could increase storm-surge-related losses along South Florida’s coastline to roughly $11 billion, said Megan Linkin, a meteorologist and natural hazards expert at Swiss Re.

That’s particularly troubling because even a tropical storm can cause major coastal flooding.

For example, Sandy’s enormous size drove catastrophic storm surge onto the New Jersey and New York coastlines even though the storm weakened and lost its tropical characteristics before making landfall in October 2012. Causing more than $50 billion in losses, Sandy now ranks as the second most costly hurricane to hit the U.S., ahead of Andrew and surpassed by only Hurricane Katrina.

Protection Gaps

Swiss Re now estimates the combined residential values in three Miami-area counties are roughly $660 billion and commercial values are about $550 billion.

Insuring those properties can be expensive and difficult in Florida. Only 19 percent of the state’s homeowners have flood insurance. Many insurers stopped renewing homeowner policies after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005, forcing property owners into the state-managed insurance company created 10 years after Andrew, which lawmakers intended to act as Florida’s insurer of last resort.

That company, Citizens Property Insurance, now has more than 451,000 customers statewide who face rate increases that officials say are needed to cover rising costs associated with water damage claims not related to tropical storms or hurricanes.

Ningen advises homeowners and elected officials to focus on closing protection gaps by exploring new insurance products that can help cover losses, upgrading existing structures through the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety’s “Fortified Home” program, heeding new hurricane center advisories setting deadlines for completing storm preparedness and supporting infrastructure projects such as the installation of a $400 million system of stormwater pumps in Miami Beach.

“To us, resiliency does not mean waiting for the federal government to bail you out,” she said. “It’s what you can do, and local governments stepping in to do what they can do.”

Majority of the areas in South Dinajpur, Malda, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and Balurghat remain inundated by flood waters.

In a meeting held on Wednesday by state irrigation and waterways minister Rajib Banerjee the flood relief package was announced with a decision to provide more funds to areas like Maharjpur in South Dinajpur, Mekhligunj at Coochbehar, Dinhata at Coochbehar as well as parts of Balurghat.

North Bengal has been totally cut off from the rest of the state because of the floods. A majority of the North East Frontier Railway trains were also canceled. Bus services in the area remain suspended as water is yet to recede in areas. The state government has also ordered that schools should remain closed till 20 August.

The enclave dwellers in Mekhligunj, Dinhata in Coochbehar claimed that they are facing a trying time as the Kalsi bridge that connects Bangladesh with Coochbehar has been washed away (India has enclaves in Bangladeshi territories). Residents of these areas have already urged the district administration to repair the bridge.

“We have already urged the district administration to repair the Kalsi bridge. We are unable to cross the area and as a result, the trade and commerce between two countries have been affected,” a resident of Changrabandha at Mekhligunj, Coochbehar, Dipen Roy, said.

According to the state government around 40,000 people have been affected by the flood and already more than 50 people have died.

The road connectivity between West Bengal and the North East was disrupted and large portions of National Highway 31 that connects Coochbehar with Toofangunj remained underwater till Wednesday afternoon.

Senior officials of the state government said that major rivers like

Torsha, Raidak, Mansai at Coochbehar and Atreyee river in South Dinajpur is flowing above the danger mark. The district administration has been instructed to monitor the situation and provide a daily report to the disaster management authority.

“We have convened a meeting with senior officials of the district administration and have instructed them to provide adequate relief to the people who lost their livelihoods due to flood. Even some BSF outpost near Coochbehar has been washed off due to flood and we have also urged the district administration to set up those outposts, once the water recedes,”Rajib Banerjee said.

According to the BJP, the state government has failed to renovate the banks of the river in North Bengal, although they had claimed that they had set up a huge infrastructure for the development of the area.

“We have urged the chief minister to repair the river banks and set up infrastructure in the flood affected areas so that residents of North Bengal can get some relief,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/08/17/LEAD_(24)_77698_730x419.jpg,"['flood', 'coochbehar', 'package', 'south', 'west', 'administration', 'district', 'state', 'rs', 'crore', 'areas', 'north', '100', 'announces', 'urged', 'relief', 'bengal']",

Another flood victim Satya Narayan Yadav complained that his family was living in a tent. He said flood displaced people lacked food.

Flood victims from Kusaha village complained that the rice they received from District Disaster Rescue Committee was rotten and stinking.

Most of the flood victims complained that genuine victims were deprived of government relief as party leaders had distributed relief to victims of their constituency, keeping in view the third phase of the civic polls.

The Nepali Army has stepped up work to repair damaged embankments in flood-hit areas. The NA distributed beaten rice and noodles by helicopter in flood-hit areas today.

A suspected militant who planned to attack people marking Bangladesh’s National Mourning Day blew himself up in a Dhaka hotel room on Tuesday after officers confronted him, the country’s police chief said.

The suspect, identified as Saiful Islam, 21, set off a bomb at the Hotel Olio International in the Panthapath neighborhood, about 300 meters (984 feet) from a house in the adjacent Dhanmondi neighborhood where founding President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and much of his family were assassinated on Aug. 15, 1975.

Saiful, who was a madrassa student and a member of militant group Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), had checked into the hotel armed with explosives on Monday night, Inspector General of Police A.K.M. Shahidul Haque told reporters. Police have blamed a faction of JMB for carrying out a terrorist attack at a local café, the Holey Artisan Bakery, that left 29 people dead in July 2016.

“We had the information that this militant planned to attack the people going to the Dhanmondi 32 to pay their respects. This precaution helped us to avoid an attack,” Haque told reporters, referring to Old Road No. 32 in Dhanmondi.

“We repeatedly urged him to surrender starting Monday night, but he rejected our pleas. … Finally he blew him up at around 9:45 a.m. as our forces started the operation to capture him,” he said.

Aug. 15 is observed in Bangladesh as a national day of mourning to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Sheikh Hasina, who is now the prime minister. She was out of the country when the assassination took place 42 years ago.

The explosion occurred about three hours after Hasina and President Abdul Hamid placed floral wreaths at the house, which is now a museum.

The blast ripped an outside wall from the hotel and injured a security guard and a police officer. Other guests and employees had been evacuated from the hotel, according to officials.

“A huge explosion followed and the wall of the room collapsed. It rocked the whole building,” Sanwar Hossain, an additional deputy commissioner of the counter terrorism unit, told BenarNews.

Fire brigade members rushed to the scene and took one injured person to a nearby hospital.

Haque identified Saiful as a JMB member who was a former member of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a faith-based political party. Jamaat-e-Islami and JMB are not linked.

Assistant Inspector General of Police Mohammad Moniruzzaman said Saiful was from Southwestern Khulna district and had been a political science student at B.L. College in Khulna.

Witness account

Salahuddin, a salesman whose shop is in front of the hotel, told BenarNews that he saw troops mobilize after 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, but thought they were being deployed for the day of mourning.

“I sleep here. When I tried to open the shop, (the police) ordered us not to come out. After a while I saw members of different security agencies flood the area,” he said, adding that traffic came to a halt.

Salahuddin said he saw a Special Weapon and Tactics officer fire a shot from across the road, at around 9:44 a.m.

According to a Panthapath area resident, who asked not to be named, police had been conducting security checks in the area over the last two weeks.

“A person had to undergo three security checks before reaching Hotel Olio. How could he reach the hotel with explosives,” the resident told BenarNews.

Militancy Not Over

Earlier, Monirul Islam, the chief of the police’s counter-terrorist unit, told reporters that ongoing preemptive law enforcement attacks over the last year had eroded militant networks in Bangladesh. At least 70 suspected militants have been killed in police raids since the Holey Artisan attack, according to authorities.

Extremist groups are having a tough time regrouping, but militants will not disappear unless their distorted ideology was rooted out, Islam warned.

An analyst agreed.

“Look, militancy had been there, and now exists. This is yet to be eliminated. The law enforcers have done a commendable job. They must remain alert at all times,” Shafqat Munir, a fellow of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, told BenarNews.","Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/bengali/mourning-suspect-08152017155653.html/170815_One_militant_620.jpg/@@images/image,"['suspected', 'bangladesh', 'told', 'attack', 'security', 'dhaka', 'militant', '15', 'wall', 'hotel', 'jmb', 'blows']",

A troop standoff along the border with China isn't the only worry for Indian policy makers.The weaker yuan is intensifying a flood of cheap Chinese goods into the country, threatening to hurt India's struggling factories and blow out its biggest bilateral trade deficit. So authorities should take steps to support domestic companies as well as curb gains in the rupee, said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, the nation's biggest lender and one of its top currency traders.India must ""reduce dependence on such frivolous Chinese imports,"" Ghosh said. Failing to do so would erode competitiveness at Indian companies and put at risk Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship 'Make in India' campaign, he said.The comments follow years of U.S. threats to brand China a currency manipulator and come as Indian and Chinese soldiers face off in a remote area of the Himalayas. The risks to India's economy are more pronounced as a new national sales tax disrupts supply chains. Factory output contracted in June for the first time in four years, official data show, mirroring subdued private surveys. That stands to only burnish the appeal of inexpensive Chinese imports.India mainly ships electronic products, engineering goods and chemicals from China, its biggest trading partner, with whom its trade deficit has ballooned nine-fold over the past decade to $49 billion in 2016. This figure was about $51 billion for the fiscal year through March 31, on imports of $61.3 billion.India's central bank does not comment on day-to-day currency fluctuations and doesn't target a particular exchange rate for the rupee. But it has been intervening in the currency market to curtail the rupee's gains, traders say.The rupee has strengthened 6 percent versus the U.S. dollar this year, while the yuan has gained 4 percent. China's currency has weakened some 2 percent against the rupee, extending last year's 4 percent decline, the steepest fall among 10 major Asian currencies.These rupee gains could trigger expectations of further appreciation, lulling importers into leaving their currency exposures unhedged, Ghosh warned. At least 40 percent of current portfolios aren't protected against exchange-rate swings, according to State Bank of India projections.

53,53,FL-2017-000108-BGD,'Water on deck!' 'Get out!' — The Navy's official report of the Fitzgerald's catastrophe at sea - NavyTimes.com,https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-military/2017/08/17/water-on-deck-get-out-the-navys-official-report-of-the-fitzgeralds-catastrophe-at-sea/,"Sailors had less than a minute to escape as seawater blasted through a massive hole in the destroyer Fitzgerald after a container ship struck its starboard side on June 17, according to a Navy report released Thursday.

Seven sailors could not escape the afflicted ship’s Berthing 2 area during a terrifying and chaotic scramble to get to higher ground. The berthing area filled with water in less than 90 seconds, according to Adm. Bill Moran.

The Navy’s official report released Thursday offers a harrowing account of the minutes and hours after the massive ACX Crystal container ship plowed into the Fitzgerald off the Japanese coast.

The report into the circumstances surrounding the death of seven sailors showcases acts of valor among shipmates in horrific circumstances. Obtained by Navy Times, the 41-page report stems from the preliminary inquiry and line of duty determination from Carrier Strike Group Five.

Yet the report does not address the cause of the collision or how the Crystal was ever able to get so close to one of the Navy’s most state-of-the-art, AEGIS-equipped vessels in the first place. It also does not address the actions of the Philippine-flagged Crystal. Several other investigations into the at-sea disaster remain ongoing.

The Navy recently revealed plans to discipline up to 12 Fitzgerald sailors, including the commanding officer, in connection to the destroyer’s fatal collision that led to the drownings of seven sailors.

On the night of the collision, there were calm seas and moonlight as the two ships were underway in busy shipping lanes about 56 nautical miles southwest of the Fitz’s Yokosuka, Japan, home port.

At about 1:30 a.m. local time, the 728-foot Crystal’s bow struck the 505-foot Fitz’s front starboard.

The commercial ship’s bulbous bow bludgeoned into the hull near berthing 2, punching a 13-foot by 17-foot gaping hole that spanned the second and third decks below the main, according to the report.

Seawater poured into the berthing area and an adjacent auxiliary space. The door between Berthing 2 and a starboard access trunk pulled away from the ceiling and bent to a 90-degree angle.

“As a result, nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly,” according to the report.

The 10-foot high berthing and auxiliary area would be completely submerged about 10 minutes later as seawater flooded in through the hull gash, according to the report.

Several areas of the ship above the waterline, including the commanding officer’s quarters, suffered catastrophic damage as well.

The impact caused the Fitzgerald to tilt 14 degrees to the left before settling into a 7-degree starboard list, and the flooding weighted the ship deeper to the right, according to the report.

Some of the 35 sailors in Berthing 2 at the time were flung from their racks, while others recalled a loud noise and unusual movement, the report states.

“Still other Berthing 2 Sailors did not realize what had happened and remained in their racks,” according to the report. “Some of them remained asleep.”

Some reported hearing alarms after the collision, “while others remember hearing nothing at all,” according to the report.

“Water on deck!” shipmates screamed in the berthing, seconds after impact. “Get out!”

“One Sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water. ... Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one Sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,” according to the report.

Senior sailors checked for shipmates still in their beds, and within a minute, the main area of Berthing 2 was flooded.

“By the time the third Sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep,” the report states.

Mattresses, an exercise bike, wall lockers and other debris floated into the narrow aisles between racks, hindering sailors from jumping off their racks and escaping as the water rushed.

The Navy has released their report on the USS Fitzgerald collision The Navy’s official report has been released, offering a harrowing account of the minutes and hours after the massive ACX Crystal container ship plowed into the Fitzgerald off the Japanese coast. Seven sailors perished.

The ship’s five- to seven-degree starboard list made it even harder for sailors to cross to port side to its two escape routes.

Battle lanterns, which turn on when power is out, lit the way.

The report suggests the sailors remembered their training and lined up “in a relatively calm and orderly manner” to climb the port side ladder and head through the watertight scuttle, according to the report.

“Even though the Sailors were up to their necks in water by that point, they moved forward slowly and assisted each other,” the report states.

Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Rehm, the most senior of the seven sailors to die that morning, pushed a sailor out from under a falling locker at one point, one sailor told investigators.

Two other sailors who had already escaped the main part of Berthing 2 remained at the bottom of the ladder well to help others.

But those two sailors were forced to abandon rendering assistance as water reached the top of the berthing compartment.

“They continued to assist their shipmates as they climbed, but were eventually forced by the rising water to leave Berthing 2 through the watertight scuttle themselves,” the report states. “Before climbing the ladder, they looked through the water and did not see any other Sailors.”

The entire berthing and auxiliary area were reported completely flooded 10 minutes after the collision.

About that time, all power forward was lost. A sailor had to call Destroyer Squadron 15 on a personal cell phone at about 2:15 a.m. to notify them of the catastrophe, according to the report.

Once through the scuttle, out of the rising water and on the landing outside Berthing 1, sailors continued to search for shipmates, reaching down into the dark water of Berthing 2 to find anyone else.

Sailors managed to pull two submerged shipmates up and out of the inundated compartment. The last sailor pulled to safety from the flooded berthing had been in the bathroom at the time of impact and was knocked to the floor by the flood of water.

“Lockers were floating past him and he scrambled across them towards the main berthing area,” the report said. “At one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free.”

He made his way toward the port side watertight scuttle, which was “the only light he could see,” and was swimming toward it when he was pulled from the water, “red-faced and with bloodshot eyes,” according to the report.

“He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water,” the report states.

After that last sailor was pulled to safety, the two sailors helping at the top of that scuttle noticed water coming into the landing from Berthing 1.

They stayed at the ladder that now sank into berthing 2’s murky depths and again stuck their arms into the morass, trying to find other sailors.

“Berthing 1, with no watertight door between it and the landing, began to flood,” the report states.

Another sailor appeared with a dogging wrench, which is used to tighten hatch bolts and stave off flooding, according to the report.

“The three Sailors at the top of the ladder yelled into the water-filled space below in an attempt to determine if there was anyone still within Berthing 2,” the report states. “No shadows were seen moving and no response was given.”

Meanwhile, water was spilling up and out of Berthing 2 and onto the landing as the sea kept coming.

The sailors tried to close the scuttle to stop the water, but the flood’s force was too strong and the scuttle was left partially open, according to the report.

They climbed up the ladder to the main deck and secured the hatch and scuttle there between the main deck and berthing 1.

Twenty-seven of 35 sailors in berthing 2 at the time of impact escaped via the port side.

One sailor was able to escape Berthing 2 via the starboard side, right next to where the Crystal had struck.

After the collision, he tried to leave his top rack that sat in the row nearest to the starboard access trunk, according to the report.

He inadvertently kicked someone, so he crawled back into his rack and waited until he thought everyone else was out.

“When he jumped out of his rack a few seconds later, the water nearly reached his top bunk, already chest high and rising,” the report states.

The sailor moved against the incoming flood of water and lounge furniture.

He heard someone say “go, go, go, it’s blocked.”

Soon, he was underwater, but managed to find a small air pocket.

“After a few breaths … he eventually took one final breath and swam,” the report states. “He lost consciousness at this time and does not remember how he escaped Berthing 2, but he ultimately emerged from the flooding into Berthing 1, where he could stand to his feet and breathe.”

The sailor climbed to the main deck and collapsed.

Gunner’s Mate Seaman Dakota Rigsby, 19; Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25; Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T. Truong Huynh, 25; Gunner’s Mate 1st Class Noe Hernandez, 26; Fire Controlman 1st Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23; Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24; and Chief Fire Controlman Gary L. Rehm Jr., 37, did not escape Berthing 2.

The Navy announced this week that they were posthumously advanced to their next rank. Their ranks above reflect the ceremonial advancement.

Their racks were located closest to the starboard access trunk “and directly in the path of the onrushing water,” according to the report.

“Hanging wires and ripped steel”

The Berthing 2 survivors scattered to mess decks to treat injuries and pass out food and water, while others went to assist with damage control efforts.

“One Sailor later took the helm and stood a 15-hour watch in aft steering after power was lost forward,” the report states.

Cmdr. Bryce Benson, the ship’s CO, was in his cabin above the waterline when the Crystal’s bow directly struck his quarters, trapping him inside.

His crew sprang into action minutes after the collision.

“Five Sailors used a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies to break through the door into the CO’s cabin, remove the hinges, and then pry the door open enough to squeeze through,” the report states.

Debris and furniture still lay wedged against the door, so a junior officer and two chiefs crawled into the cabin.

“The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel,” the report states. “The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship.”

Benson was taken to the bridge, where his condition worsened. He was evacuated off the ship via helicopter a few hours later.

The ship’s combat systems officer was injured in the collision after returning to his stateroom to help a roommate trapped in his rack and was later medically evacuated as well.

Meanwhile, damage controlmen and other sailors worked furiously to pump water out of the listing ship.

Parties tried to pump out the five feet of water now sitting in Berthing 1, but with the watertight hatch leading to the flooded Berthing 2 still open, it was a lost cause, according to the report.

The starboard passageway was partially flooded, and damage control parties used shoring to reinforce the damaged area.

In radio central, the crew combatted flooding with stuffing tube compound, mops and buckets.

As damage control continued, reports of missing sailors began to come in.

Three sailors were reported trapped in sonar control as the spaces above them flooded.

They radioed for help but rescue teams could not reach them because the passageway was completely blocked, according to the report.

A team was eventually able to reach sonar control via an escape hatch and those sailors were rescued about 45 minutes after the impact.

By the time of a final all-hands muster at 5:40 a.m., roughly four hours after the crash, the seven lost sailors were reported as unaccounted.

Two Japanese coast guard ships arrived just before 5 a.m., along with U.S. maritime patrol aircraft.

A Japanese coast guard helicopter evacuated the injured CO back to Yokosuka, Japan.

As the broken ship steamed toward land, it couldn’t go faster than three to five knots, for fear it would take on additional water.

The deputy commodore of Destroyer Squadron 15 arrived in a helicopter just after 9 a.m. with a chaplain, doctor and chief damage controlman in tow.

The combat systems officer who was injured assisting his roommate, and the sailor who had escaped Berthing 2 via starboard, were evacuated off the ship.

A team from the destroyer Dewey came aboard around noon and helped with dewatering and passing out food and water.

The ship’s list held at 5 degrees starboard once flooding was stabilized, and aft steering was used since standard steering had been knocked out of commission.

The ship reached the Yokosuka pier just before 7 p.m. that day, and divers got to work.

The following morning, just before 5 a.m., they swam through the gaping starboard wound and into Berthing 2.

They immediately found Rigsby and took the Virginia native out of the ship.

They returned to the berthing and subsequently found Douglass, Sibayan, Martin and Ngoc in the lounge area, the report states.

Hernandez was found in the main passageway near the lounge area, while Rehm was found behind the closed door of a bathroom, according to the report.

The ship’s command master chief identified the lost sailors.

Adm. Charles Williams, head of Carrier Strike Group 5, praised the valor and professionalism of the sailors who escaped Berthing 2, and those who got the Fitzgerald back to land.

“No damage control efforts…would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,” Williams wrote. “The loss of seven shipmates is a tragedy beyond words and a reminder of the dangers inherent in the mission of every ship and Sailor.”","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/7DZDNTHIjLyBWqXOTGQ40HZsJbY=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J243LO3QYJHCRAUMSJSFLD5YLY.jpg,"['water', 'official', 'berthing', 'navys', 'according', 'sailor', 'fitzgerald', 'ship', 'deck', 'sailors', 'navy', 'report', 'starboard', 'sea', 'catastrophe', 'fitzgeralds']", 
54,54,FL-2017-000108-BGD,Map of the Day: Where People Have Been Forced to Flee From Their Homes in 2017 - UN Dispatch,https://www.undispatch.com/map-day-people-forced-flee-homes-2017/,"Today’s map comes from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, which tracks internal displacement around the world. People become “internally displaced” when they are forced to flee their homes because of violence or natural disaster, but do not cross an international border. (If they flee across a border, they can be considered refugees and can be afforded certain protections under international law that IDPs typically do not receive.)

And so far in 2017, some 9 million people have become newly displaced.

About half of the people newly displaced this year are fleeing conflict. And though the year is half over, the 4.6 million people displaced by conflict is about two-thirds of last year’s total.

According to the report, the countries with the highest new internal displacement by conflict are: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): 997,000; Iraq: 922,000; Syria: 692,000; the Philippines: 466,000; Ethiopia: 213,000; Central African Republic (CAR): 206,000; South Sudan: 163,000; the Gambia: 162,000; Afghanistan: 159,000; Nigeria: 142,000; Yemen: 112,000; and Somalia: 70,000.

In the DRC, many of the newly displaced come from the Kasai region, which was not a location that experienced much violence until this year when a localized dispute began spiraling out of control. This region now has the potential to become Africa’s next big conflict and many more people are likely to be displaced. In Iraq, much of the newly displaced are from Mosul and were forced to flee when Iraq forces began their liberation of the city from ISIS.

Natural disasters are another driver of displacement, accounting for nearly half of all displacements worldwide. Again, just a few disasters that struck key population centers are responsible for most of the displacements

From the report:

The two largest events of displacement by flooding in China and by Cyclone Mora in Bangladesh, Myanmar and India are stark reminders of the fact that the concentration of populations in flood plains and on hazard prone coastlines combined with high levels of vulnerability repeatedly trigger large-scale new displacements – and will continue to do so in the face of climate change. Large-scale new displacements in the Philippines, Peru and Sri Lanka also took place in the context of seasonal flooding. “This shows us that seasonal, to be expected, weather patterns still result in large numbers of new displacements year after year, clearly illustrating that we are not investing enough in reducing vulnerability and exposure. While preparedness, early warning and evacuation systems may have improved over the years, the overall risk of being forced out of your home and becoming displaced in these countries has not been reduced.” says Bina Desai, Head of Policy and Research at IDMC.

Earlier this year, I spoke with Alexanda Bilak, who directs the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, for a Global Dispatches podcast episode. She explained that one of the key challenges facing IDPs around the world is their precarious legal status. Unlike refugees, she said, countries are under no special obligation to care for people displaced within their borders. The United Nations and other groups are trying to change this and help poorer countries that are vulnerable to disasters — manmade or otherwise — devise policies that help reduce the humanitarian fallout from these events. Progress is being made, but far too slowly.

56,56,FL-2017-000108-BGD,Government spends twice as much abroad on fossil fuels as renewable energy - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/government-fossil-fuels-renewable-energy-uk-export-finance-climate-change-global-warming-co2-a7887376.html,"The Government has been accused of undermining its own efforts to tackle climate change after new research revealed it is investing twice as much in fossil fuel projects overseas as it is in renewables.

Almost half (46 per cent) of the money the UK spent on energy overseas went on fossil fuels while barely more than a fifth (22 per cent) was spent on renewable energy sources.

The research, commissioned by Catholic charity CAFOD and carried out by the Overseas Development Institute, analysed spending between 2010 and 2014 – the last period for which data is available.

It shows that, of the £7.5bn the UK spent on energy abroad, £1.3bn was spent on renewables and £2.9bn on fossil fuels – appearing to contradict both government ministers’ promises on climate change and the UK’s international commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.

The treaty, signed in 2015, says countries must work towards “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”.

The Conservative manifesto, meanwhile, promised ministers would “continue to lead international action against climate change”.

However, UK spending on fossil fuels overseas increased by more than half a billion pounds in the five-year period up to 2014 – up from £2.2bn in 2009-2013.

Only a fraction (8 per cent) of UK spending on energy in developing countries went to helping poor people access energy sources, despite ministers having committed Britain to the international Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to make sure everyone in the world has access to affordable and sustainable energy sources by 2030.

The data also reveals apparent tensions at the heart of government over whether to prioritise the UK’s climate change commitments or focus on short-term economic benefits.

Progress made by the Department for International Development means almost a third of its energy spending (32 per cent) went to renewable sources compared to 22% per cent on fossil fuels.

In contrast, more than 99 per cent of UK Export Finance investment, which helps British companies sell their products and services overseas, was spent on fossil fuels - suggesting environmental factors are barely a consideration when decisions over spending are made.

It means different government departments are seemingly undermining each other’s efforts, with some departments helping to fund the shift towards renewable energy sources while others are investing in the fossil fuel industries that renewable energy producers have to compete with.

And at the same time as encouraging developing countries to prioritise renewable energy, and contributing almost £6bn to its International Climate Fund, the UK Government is continuing to invest in fossil fuel industries in the very same countries.

The report authors said the Government investing in fossil fuels overseas while also spending billions trying to combat climate change was an “inconsistent” approach.

The UK must “urgently” phase out all public funding of coal, they added.

The data was released hours after Nigel Lawson, the former Conservative Chancellor and a vocal climate change denier, claimed it was ""not true"" that the UK subsidises fossil fuels.

""It's not true - we tax fossil fuels and we subsidise renewable energy,"" he told the BBC Today programme.

✕ Donald Trump doesn't believe in climate change

Green Party Co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""These shocking figures show that Britain's overseas spending on energy is utterly skewed towards the fuels of the past. With air pollution and climate change posing a grave threat to the developing world Britain should be ploughing resources into clean energy - but instead we're paving the way for increased fossil fuel consumption and dirty air.

""Behind the Green veneer this Government has a rotten core when it comes to protecting our natural world. Britain should look to cut spending on fossil fuel projects and help communities in the global south embark on ambitious clean energy projects that empower people and provide them with power for years to come.""

Campaigners said the Government’s investment strategy was undermining international climate change efforts and attempts to help developing countries develop cleaner energy sources.

Dr Sarah Wykes, lead analyst on climate change and energy at CAFOD, said: “To tackle climate change we have to leave fossil fuels in the ground and switch rapidly to renewable sources of energy. Yet the UK carrying on a business as usual spending pattern overseas in recent years suggests a huge inconsistency in policy and a missed opportunity to promote greater investment in renewable technologies, as DFID has tried to do through its spending.

“It doesn’t make sense for there to still be any public money going into fossil fuels overseas, whether that’s through aid money, loans or export finance to support British companies operating overseas.”

“The Conservatives made manifesto commitments they would continue to lead international action against climate change and extreme poverty, but supporting fossil fuels overseas puts that leadership at risk at a time when international leadership is needed now more than ever on the Paris Agreement.”

Hannah Martin, Head of Energy at Greenpeace UK, said: ”The UK government has promised global leadership on climate change, yet it keeps using millions in taxpayers' money to bankroll fossil fuel projects all around the world. What's worse, many of these projects are in the same developing countries that are already bearing the brunt of climate change.

“This seems to be an acute case of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing, and it makes no economic or environmental sense. Renewable energy is booming, and Britain has done a lot of pioneering work on technologies like offshore wind. Instead of using public money to drive more climate change, ministers should use it to help Britain export clean technologies that can help tackle the problem while creating trading and employment opportunities that will last beyond the fossil fuel age.”

Of the UK money spent on fossil fuels overseas, 87 per cent (£2.5 billion) went to oil, gas or a combination of the two. A further 9 per cent (£240m) was spent on coal – the most polluting of all fuels.

The research also raises concerns about whether UK aid and investment is going to the countries that need it most.

Only 9 per cent of energy spending went to countries classed as “low-income”, while almost half (47 per cent) went to “upper middle-income” countries.

By far the biggest recipient of UK spending on energy was Brazil, where £1.6bn was spent. That was followed by Vietnam, Turkey and India. £206 million of UK money was spent on energy in Russia – the fifth biggest recipient of British energy spending.

Critics are also likely to question why more than a fifth of UK aid spending on energy is being spent on the highly polluting fuels that are responsible for climate change.

Experts said there should be no contradiction between spending on aid and investing in green energy, because renewable energy sources are generally cheaper and quicker to set up than fossil fuel sources, meaning they are of greater benefit to people living in poverty or in remote areas.

A Government spokesperson said: “The UK is a global leader in tackling climate change – we played a key role in securing the historic Paris Agreement and have helped 12 million people gain access to clean energy around the world through development assistance.

“Our priority is to help developing countries establish a secure and diverse energy supply, supporting their economic growth as part of the transition to a low carbon economy.”","Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/04/08/oil-rig-shell.gif?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['fossil', 'spending', 'believe', 'abroad', 'spends', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'twice', 'change', 'photographs', 'uk', 'energy', 'renewable', 'fuels']",

Imran and his friend agree to escort us till Chhoto Gorul Jora or CG Jora, the last Indian village on border.Cooch Behar town is dotted with enclave settlements and beyond these enclaves are a few villages, right at the border.The entry to CG Jora was an arduous task with Border Security Force (BSF) officers manning our movement. After spending hours at the BSF camp in Digaltari for permission to visit CG Jora, we were on a road both sides of which fell in Bangladesh.At first glance, CG Jora is like any other village in rural Bengal with huts that have thatched tiled roofs, banyan trees peeping from every corner and small fish ponds after every few houses. But beyond the usual flora and fauna, the barbed wire makes its presence felt.CG Jora, surrounded by Bangladesh on three sides, was fenced only a decade ago after the border fencing began in the mid-1980s. On the way to the village head’s house, a group of men sitting at the corridor of the only primary school rue about how the village has got eerily accustomed to the BSF rules.“Most of us work as contractual labourers in Bihar and Maharashtra. It is not possible to earn anything here. Most men have left the village and it’s only women, children and elderly who been left behind,” says Rahat Hussain, who works in Gaya and is at home to meet his family.The entry and exit to the village are manned by the BSF and what irks the villagers the most is the strict control over timings and food supplies. Rehmat Bibi, an octogenarian sits nonchalantly at the verandah of her mud house which overlooks a heap of meshed iron wire fencing. Married at the age of nine, she has been living at CG Jora since then.Bibi had been an expert swimmer when she was in Patgram in Bangladesh and it did help her when she came to CG Jora. “Previously there was no fencing. We could swim across to the other side or even take a boat. Fetching supplies for daily needs from Bangladesh was easier than sourcing them from Dinhata (India). But now things have changed. One might get shot at if she ventures out,” she says.Barely a few houses from Bibi’s, we see children climbing up an old dilapidated building with protruding iron rods from the bare walls. This is the secondary school of the village with two teachers and 150 students. Just next to the school is Moinudin Akram’s ration shop.Every morning Akram opens his shop along with three others in the village. But today he is a sad man. “I need to travel to Dinhata to get the supplies. Now the BSF does not allow us to purchase more than the specified limit. How long can the shop run with 5 kg sugar and 2 kg washing powder? And god forbid if we are late beyond 8 pm, then we have to spend the night outside our own village,” says Akram.BSF officials, however, say that such checks are necessary so that the essentials are not transported to Bangladesh.At Pradhan’s house we see a group of women waiting for the local physician, who doubles up as someone who can help people with government documents and approvals from the BSF. Birajuddin (name changed) looks quite unlike others from the village. Dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, the physician says the villagers are being deprived of a normal life.“Whenever someone is sick, they have to travel to Nazirhat which is 8 km away. Village gates are not opened after the official timings, sometimes even during medical emergency,” says Birajuddin.He points towards a barbed wire fence which cuts the village in two parts. Ironically, the territory on the other side is also in India but as per rules fencing is done 150 yards away from the international border. This means 80 Indian families stay on the other side of the fence.Several children, men and women often stick their heads out of the barbed fence to speak to their friends and relatives on this side. Razia Begum, who lives on the other side of the fence, usually comes on this side at permitted hours to work in her agricultural land.“Many of us have agricultural lands on the other side, but such restricted entry does not allow us to take care of our crops. Often the cattle destroy it and we are only mute spectators. Although we are Indians, every time we cross this fencing, we are made to produce identity cards and it is hell if there is an emergency at night,” says Razia.But for the BSF such restrictions are mandatory. When asked, BSF Commanding Officer Harish Kalja says often the jawans have to fight armed cattle smugglers at night. “As we cannot use weapons, we only have non-lethal means to fight them. But they attack us in huge numbers with anything from axe to knives. We can’t look the other way even for a minute,” says Kalja.Smuggling or not, the villagers feel helpless. “We hardly feel a part of India. If given a chance; we will happily relocate somewhere else. This place has not given us anything,” laments Birajuddin.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.news18.com/static_news18/pix/ibnhome/news18/indias-frontier-villages/images/share/sharebengal.jpg,"['border', 'partition', 'village', 'bangla', 'prisoners', 'house', 'jora', 'cg', 'fence', 'night', 'children', 'bsf', 'fencing']",

Now, they’re beginning to prove it

ON CEDROS ISLAND IN MEXICO—Matthew Des Lauriers got the first inkling that he had stumbled on something special when he pulled over on a dirt road here, seeking a place for his team to use the bathroom. While waiting for everyone to return to the car, Des Lauriers, then a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside, meandered across the landscape, scanning for stone tools and shell fragments left by the people who had lived on the island in the past 1500 years.

As he explored, his feet crunched over shells of large Pismo clams—bivalves that he hadn't seen before on the mountainous island, 100 kilometers off the Pacific coast of Baja California. The stone tools littering the ground didn't fit, either. Unlike the finely made arrow points and razor-sharp obsidian that Des Lauriers had previously found on the island, these jagged flakes had been crudely knocked off of chunky beach cobbles.

""I had no idea what it meant,"" says Des Lauriers, now a professor at California State University (Cal State) in Northridge. Curiosity piqued, he returned for a test excavation and sent some shell and charcoal for radiocarbon dating. When Des Lauriers's adviser called with the results, he said, ""You should probably sit down."" The material dated from nearly 11,000 to more than 12,000 years ago—only a couple thousand years after the first people reached the Americas.

That discovery, in 2004, proved to be no anomaly; since then, Des Lauriers has discovered 14 other early sites and excavated two, pushing back the settlement of Cedros Island to nearly 13,000 years ago. The density of early coastal sites here ""is unprecedented in North America,"" says archaeologist Loren Davis of Oregon State University in Corvallis, who joined the project in 2009.

The Cedros Island sites add to a small but growing list that supports a once-heretical view of the peopling of the Americas. Whereas archaeologists once thought that the earliest arrivals wandered into the continent through a gap in the ice age glaciers covering Canada, most researchers today think the first inhabitants came by sea. In this view, maritime explorers voyaged by boat out of Beringia—the ancient land now partially submerged under the waters of the Bering Strait—about 16,000 years ago and quickly moved down the Pacific coast, reaching Chile by at least 14,500 years ago.

Findings such as those on Cedros Island bolster that picture by showing that people were living along the coast practically as early as anyone was in the Americas. But these sites don't yet prove the coastal hypothesis. Some archaeologists argue that the first Americans might have entered via the continental interior and turned to a maritime way of life only after they arrived. ""If they came down an interior ice-free corridor, they could have turned right, saw the beaches of California, and said, ‘To hell with this,’"" says archaeologist David Meltzer of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

The evidence that might settle the question has been mostly out of reach. As the glaciers melted starting about 16,500 years ago, global sea level rose by about 120 meters, drowning many coasts and any settlements they held. ""We are decades into the search for coastal dispersers, and we're still waiting for solid evidence or proof,"" says Gary Haynes, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada in Reno, who thinks the first Americans likely took an inland route.

The hunt for that evidence is now in high gear. A dedicated cadre of archaeologists is searching for maritime sites dating to between 14,000 and 16,000 years ago, before the ice-free corridor became fully passable. They're looking at the gateway to the Americas, along stretches of the Alaskan and Canadian coasts that were spared the post–ice age flooding. They are even looking underwater. And on Cedros Island, Des Lauriers is helping fill in the picture of how early coastal people lived and what tools they made, details that link them to maritime cultures around the Pacific Rim and imply that they were not landlubbers who later turned seaward. ""All eyes are on the coast,"" Meltzer says.

On a sunny June day, Des Lauriers crouches in a gully here, bracing himself against the wind blowing off the ocean. He leans over to examine what could be a clue to how people lived here 12,000 years ago: a delicate crescent of shell glinting in the sun. A few centimeters away, a sharply curved shell point lies broken in two pieces. Des Lauriers knows he's looking at the remains of an ancient fishhook. He has already found four others on the island. One of those, at about 11,500 years old, is the oldest fishhook discovered in the Americas, as reported this summer in American Antiquity.

Des Lauriers wasn't planning to collect artifacts on this trip, but the shell fishhook is too precious to leave to the elements. His team scrambles for anything they can use to package the delicate artifact. Someone produces a roll of toilet paper, and Des Lauriers scoops up the fragments with his trowel and eases them onto the improvised padding. Each fragment is wrapped snuggly and slipped into a plastic bag.

Twenty years ago, most archaeologists believed the first Americans were not fishermen, but rather big-game hunters who had followed mammoths and bison through the ice-free corridor in Canada. The distinctive Clovis spear points found at sites in the lower 48 states starting about 13,500 years ago were thought to be their signature. But bit by bit, the Clovis-first picture has crumbled.

The biggest blow came in 1997, when archaeologists confirmed that an inland site at Monte Verde in Chile was at least 14,500 years old—1000 years before Clovis tools appeared. Since then, several more pre-Clovis sites have come to light, and the most recent date from Monte Verde stretches back to 18,500 years ago, although not all researchers accept it. Genetic evidence from precontact South American skeletons now suggests that the earliest Americans expanded out of Beringia about 16,000 years ago.

Not only were the Clovis people not the first to arrive, but many researchers also doubt the first Americans could have made it by land. Glaciers likely covered the land route through western Canada until after 16,000 years ago, according to recent research that dated minerals in the corridor's oldest sand dunes. Another study showed that bison from Alaska and the continental United States didn't mingle in the corridor until about 13,000 years ago, implying that the passage took at least 2000 years to fully open and transform into a grassland welcoming to megafauna and their human hunters.

That makes the coastal route the first Americans' most likely—or perhaps only—path. It would have been inviting, says Knut Fladmark, a professor emeritus of archaeology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, one of the first to propose a coastal migration into the Americas back in 1979. ""The land-sea interface is one of the richest habitats anywhere in the world,"" he says. Early Americans apparently knew how to take full advantage of its abundant resources. At Monte Verde, once 90 kilometers from the coast, archaeologist Tom Dillehay of Vanderbilt University in Nashville found nine species of edible and medicinal seaweed dated to about 14,000 years ago.

On Cedros Island, artifacts suggest that people found diverse ways to make a living from the sea. That isn't a given because 13,000 years ago, the island was connected to the mainland, hanging off the Baja peninsula like a hitchhiker's outstretched thumb; early sites cluster around freshwater springs that would have been several kilometers inland back then. But Des Lauriers's work reveals that the Cedros Islanders ate shellfish, sea lions, elephant seals, seabirds, and fish from all sorts of ocean environments, including deep-water trenches accessible only by boat.

In addition to making fishhooks, the island's inhabitants fashioned beach cobbles into crude scrapers and hammers—""disposable razors,"" as Des Lauriers, a stone tool expert, calls them. Such tools are best for scraping and cutting plant fibers, suggesting that the islanders were processing agave into fishing lines and nets. Researchers have found a similar suite of tools at other early sites along the Pacific coast, hinting that fishing technologies were widespread even though the organic nets, lines, and boats likely decayed long ago.

Certain tool types found here suggest even more distant connections. Des Lauriers often finds stemmed points, a style of spear point found from Japan to Peru and perhaps used on the island to hunt sea mammals and native pygmy deer. The shell fishhooks even resemble the world's oldest known fishhooks, which were crafted from the shells of sea snails on Okinawa in Japan about 23,000 years ago.

Although the evidence of a widespread, sophisticated maritime way of life along the ancient Pacific coast—what Meltzer calls ""Hansel and Gretel leaving a trail of artifacts""—is provocative, it can't prove the coastal migration theory, he says. The oldest sites on Cedros Island are younger than the first Clovis spear points used to bring down big game on the mainland.

But older coastal sites are beginning to turn up. This year Dillehay announced the discovery of a nearly 15,000-year-old site at Huaca Prieta, about 600 kilometers north of Lima. Its earliest residents lived in an estuary 30 kilometers from the Pacific shoreline but still ate mostly shark, seabirds, marine fish, and sea lions, and their artifacts resemble those at other coastal sites. ""I was stunned how similar [the tools of Huaca Prieta] were to [those of] Cedros Island,"" Davis says.

Still, pinning down the coastal migration theory will take a string of well-dated sites beginning before 15,000 years ago in southeastern Alaska or British Columbia in Canada and extending through time down the coast. To find them, archaeologists will have to take the plunge.

Loren Davis tries to stay steady as he makes his way into a laboratory aboard the research vessel Pacific Storm. The archaeologist was desperately seasick in his cabin for 2 days in late May as the 25-meter-long ship fought rough seas more than 35 kilometers off the Oregon coast. With Davis laid low, his team members scanned the ocean floor with sound waves.

They are seeking the now-flooded landscape ancient maritime explorers would have followed on their journey south, when today's coastlines were dozens of kilometers inland. Some coastal travelers did eventually turn landward, as shown by early inland sites such as Oregon's Paisley Caves, which yielded a 14,200-year-old human coprolite. But the earliest chapters of any coastal migration are almost certainly underwater.

Sixteen thousand years later, it's tempting to envision such a migration as a race from beach to beach. But as people expanded into the uninhabited Americas, they had no destination in mind. They stopped, settled in, ventured beyond what they knew, and backtracked into what they did. So the first step for archaeologists is to figure out where, exactly, those early mariners would have chosen to stick around.

The decision likely came down to one resource: freshwater. ""Water is the lifeblood of everything,"" Davis says. So he has been painstakingly mapping the probable courses of ancient rivers across the now-drowned coastline, hoping that those channels are still detectable, despite now being filled with sediment and covered by deep ocean.

As team members pulled up early results to show Davis during May's cruise, a black line representing the present-day sea floor squiggled horizontally across the screen. Then it diverged into two lines, a gap like a smile opening across the image: An ancient river channel lay below the modern sea floor, right where Davis's model had predicted. ""If I hadn't been so sick—and if there had been alcohol on the ship—that would have been a champagne moment,"" he says. ""We can [now] begin to visualize where the hot spots [of human occupation] are probably going to be.""

This summer, Davis's colleague Amy Gusick, an archaeologist at Cal State in San Bernardino, used one of his maps to take the first sample from another probable hot spot: a drowned river off the coast of California's Channel Islands. Terrestrial sites on the islands have already yielded 13,000-year-old human bones as well as characteristically coastal stone tools. But since then, the rising sea has inundated 65% of the islands' ancient area. Gusick and her colleagues are confident that submerged sites, possibly even older than the ones on land, exist off today's coast.

In June, she used a 5-meter sampling tube to pierce what Davis's map told her was the ancient riverbank. The muck she collected will reveal whether ancient soil, perhaps including plant remains, pollen, animal bones, or human artifacts, can still be recovered from deep underwater. Eventually, Gusick hopes to understand the drowned landscape well enough to pick out anomalies on the sonar map—possible shell middens or houses—and target them for coring that might bring up artifacts and the organic material needed to date them. A date of 15,000 years or older would show that before the ice-free corridor fully opened, adept mariners had explored the Channel Islands, which were never connected to the mainland and could be reached only by boat.

""This is the biggest scientific effort to move us down the road to answering this question"" of how and when people settled the Americas, says Todd Braje, an archaeologist at San Diego State University in California, one of the leaders of the coring project. ""Those submerged landscapes are really the last frontier for American archaeology,"" says Jon Erlandson, an anthropologist at the University of Oregon in Eugene who has excavated on the Channel Islands for decades and also is part of the project.

All the same, to make a definitive case for the coastal route, researchers must find pre-Clovis coastal sites in the doorway to the Americas itself: on the shores of southeastern Alaska or British Columbia. Luckily, archaeologists working there may not even have to go underwater to do it.

About 13,200 years ago, someone strolled through the intertidal zone just above the beach on Calvert Island, off the coast of British Columbia, leaving footprints in the area's wet, dense clay. When high tide rolled in, sand and gravel filled the impressions, leaving a raised outline. Layers of sediment built up over the millennia, preserving the barely eroded footprints under half a meter of earth.

Daryl Fedje, an archaeologist at the University of Victoria (UVic) and the Hakai Institute on Quadra Island in Canada, spotted that outline while excavating on the beach in 2014. Since then, he and his UVic and Hakai colleague Duncan McLaren have documented 29 of those footprints beneath Calvert's beaches. A piece of wood embedded in a footprint's fill provided the radiocarbon date. ""It raises the hairs on the back of your neck,"" says McLaren, who in April presented the footprints at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Vancouver, Canada.

Such an intimate view of early coastal Americans is possible on Calvert Island because of a geological quirk. The melting ice sheets flooded coastlines elsewhere. But when the coasts of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska were suddenly freed from the weight of the nearby glaciers, parts of the underlying crust began to rebound, lifting some islands high enough to largely escape the flood.

To maximize their chances of finding ancient sites, McLaren, Fedje, and their UVic colleague Quentin Mackie have spent decades mapping the local sea level changes along the coast of British Columbia. On Calvert Island, where the footprints were discovered, sea level rose only 2 meters. Around nearby Quadra Island, local sea level actually fell, stranding ancient shorelines in forests high above modern beaches. There, ""potentially the entire history of occupation is on dry land,"" Mackie says.

The painstaking work required to identify and search those ancient coastlines is paying off with a march of increasingly older dates from the British Columbia coast. The remains of an ancient bear hunt—spear points lying in a cluster of bear bones—in Gaadu Din cave on the Haida Gwaii archipelago date to 12,700 years ago. The Calvert footprints stretch back 13,200 years. And a cluster of stone tools next to a hearth on Triquet Island is 14,000 years old—the region's oldest artifact so far, according to radiocarbon dates from the hearth's charcoal. Although reports about the footprints and the Triquet tools have yet to be peer reviewed, several archaeologists say they are impressed by the British Columbia team's approach. ""They're looking in exactly the right place,"" Erlandson says.

Despite the proliferating evidence for the coastal route, not everyone is ready to discount the ice-free corridor entirely. The region has barely been studied and is ripe for ""interesting surprises,"" says John Ives, an archaeologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. For example, the corridor may not have been a welcoming grassland until 14,000 years ago, but Haynes says it is naïve to assume that people couldn't have ventured into the corridor as soon as the ice was gone. Before grass took root, ""the inland corridor route would have been full of freshwater sources, seasonally migrating or resident waterfowl by the millions, and large and small mammals exploring new ranges,"" he says. ""Eastern Beringia's inland foragers of 14,000 years ago were descendants of expert pioneers and could have traveled far south on foot.""

And so the hunt continues. Before breakfast one morning on Cedros Island, Des Lauriers spreads out satellite images of the island's southern edge. Most of the land appears as brown pixels, as one would expect from a desert island. But here and there, clusters of blue pixels appear—signs of moisture in the ground. Find the springs, Des Lauriers knows, and he'll find the people.

Davis and the rest of the team pile into the back of a pickup truck, and Des Lauriers follows a dirt path to a spring he hasn't visited before. The patch of green lies at the bottom of a steep-sided arroyo, which is otherwise bone dry. Algae cover the surface of a meter-deep pool. The dark soil is rich with organic matter, unusual for arid Cedros Island and possibly indicating an ancient settlement. Stone tools characteristic of the earliest islanders dot the surface. ""There's a lot of stuff here, Matt,"" Davis calls to Des Lauriers. ""It's punching all the boxes.""

Interspersed with the recognizably early tools are things neither of them has seen on the island before: large, striated scallop shells belonging to a species known as mano de león (lion's paw). Today those scallops live in lagoons east of here, on the coast of the Baja peninsula. Des Lauriers says he suspects that similar lagoons connected Cedros Island to the mainland before 13,000 years ago. Were people here early enough to visit such lagoons? Could those shells be hinting at a phase of settlement even older than the one signaled by the Pismo clams 13 years ago?

Express News Service

Ever heard of ""hostess girls"" who entertain men at Japanese bars? A variant of the Japanese geisha tradition where young women who were trained from childhood to become ‘hostesses’ well-versed in the arts and art of entertaining male guests, liquor mates in the bars of Assam's Guwahati keep men company while they enjoy a drink.

Young girls, mostly from the upper and central Assam districts work as 'liquor mates' to lonely men who come to gulp a few pegs at the bars near Guwahati railway station in the Paltan Bazaar area.

A girl would typically approach the customer at the table, asking him if she could take a seat. After an affirmative nod, she would request the customer to order a peg of liquor of her choice and then start chatting with him. After a few pegs, some cigarettes and sharing of stories, she would leave for the next customer.

While the public perception is that the 'liquor mate' girls indulge in prostitution, the girls say they refuse to have sex with customers, despite frequent requests.

""Mostly, middle-aged men would demand sex,"" said Tutumoni Gogoi (name changed), who hails from upper Assam's Sibsagar district.

Though most young girls would at first claim that they are students of colleges Guwahati, once prodded, they would reveal that they work as 'liquor mates' and that it is their only source of income.

Besides paying for their liquor, customers often pay the girls handsomely for the company. Besides, the bars also pay them a percentage of the total sale on the table, as the presence of the girls draw in customers.

Most of these girls hail from regions that are severely affected by floods every year. When asked about the annual calamity, a pall of gloom hangs over their faces.

Narrating about her family's annual flood ordeal, Neekumoni Phukon (name changed) says her native Dhemaji district is flooded every year when big dams in the upper course of Brahmaputra open their sluice gates.

""Floods have become such a routine that every year before the monsoon, I have to send my family back home a good sum so that they don't face problems when they go to take shelter in schools and government offices that are in relatively higher grounds. After floods, I have to send them some money for repairing the house,"" Neekumoni said.

""To earn some extra money, I have to give hugs to the customers and sometimes give a peck on their cheeks,"" she added, saying that’s as far as she goes with physical intimacy.

When asked about the societal perception of her job, Pompi Das (name changed) of central Assam's Nalbari district says:""The Assamese media hounds us, society hates us and people use us. Despite inundation in my native village every year, I can't call my parents to Guwahati to stay with me. My secret would come out, which they won't be able to digest. I can't let that happen."" Pompi has told her family that she works in a beauty parlour and sends them money every month.

Are these women forced to work in this profession or are they hooked to the flowing money and free booze? The answer is both.

""Many of us initially did not like drinking but saw this as an easy method of earning money. Gradually, we got addicted to free booze. But, even if any of us wants to leave, the racket has so many tentacles leading to highly-placed individuals. So it is nearly impossible to get a decent job once we quit and leave,"" said Rimpi Saikia (name changed) of Lakhimpur district. ""Also, we need the money to sustain our families back home,"" she added.

Bar owners agreed that the girls are a catalyst to their business. ""Many people come only to chat and spend some time with these girls over a few drinks. The girls act as a catalyst in boosting our sales,"" a bar owner said.","Thu, 10 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/11/w600X390/Bar.jpg,"['sex', 'upper', 'say', 'sticks', 'liquor', 'bars', 'work', 'stigma', 'young', 'mates', 'men', 'women', 'guwahati', 'table', 'girls', 'changed', 'money']",

It'll be the first total solar eclipse visible to people in the contiguous U.S. since 1979. Here in Southern California, we'll only see a partial eclipse, but more than half of the sun will be covered — which means that we'll see some eerie mood lighting.

Folks further north in Oregon will experience a total solar eclipse at 10:21 a.m. – the same time the partial eclipse here will be at its maximum. The total eclipse will then track southeast across the U.S., following a path of totality 70 miles wide that will pass through Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina.

NASA solar eclipse video

Over the past 500 years, the same path of totality has been followed only 15 times.

What you'll see in L.A.

If you're in L.A., you're about 670 miles from totality — meaning you won't see one of those iconic eclipse images of the moon's shadow surrounded by the sun's dancing corona.

But lucky you, about 70 percent of the sun will be covered by the moon, and you'll be able to see that from anywhere you can see the sun. (But never look at the sun or a partial eclipse with the naked eye. More on that below.) Here's how much eclipse we're getting in Los Angeles:

How much of an eclipse we'll be able to see in Los Angeles. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

At 9:05 a.m., the moon will start its transit across the disc of the sun, peaking at 10:21. Everything will return to normal by 11:44. During the transit, the temperature will drop, and it's estimated that utility companies will need to add an extra 6,000 megawatts to make up for the decrease in solar energy.

You won't see a total solar eclipse in L.A. in your lifetime

Total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months or so, but only 0.5 percent of the earth is covered during the events — and since 70 percent of the Earth is covered in water, they're not always easily visible.

2024 will be the next time a total solar eclipse will be visible in the U.S., but the path of totality will run through the center and eastern parts of the country. If you're waiting to watch one from your backyard in L.A., it's going to be at least another 1,000 years.

To predict future eclipses, scientists have to do a number of calculations. They've got to determine when there's going to be a new moon and when the Earth, moon and sun will line up perfectly, at exactly the right time.

Since the sun is 400 times the size of the moon, but 400 times as far from Earth, they appear to be the same size in our sky. If they don't line up perfectly, we don't get a total solar eclipse. It's believed that Claudius Ptolemy figured out how to make some of those predictions around 140 A.D.

There are few constants in the universe, and since the moon is creeping away from the Earth at a rate of 1.5 inches per year, at some point it'll be too far away to cause any total solar eclipse.

Viewing the eclipse without eye protection can be dangerous

If you view the sun without eye protection, you run the risk of damaging your retinas. Even if the sun is 99 percent obscured, a small sliver of light peaking out from behind the moon is enough to flood them with ultraviolet radiation, causing permanent damage. Burning your retinas by viewing the sun is called ""solar retinopathy,"" and it can include blurred vision and vision loss.

To view the eclipse safely, you can use a pinhole camera or wear specially-made eclipse glasses.

The American Astronomical Society has a list of approved vendors that you can buy eclipse glasses from.

There are eclipse watching parties going on around L.A.

It's likely too late to find a place to stay that's in the path of totality. People have been booking their accommodations for over a year, but that doesn't mean you can't have some fun in Southern California.

The Mount Wilson Observatory will host an event, complete with telescopes available to the public.

The Griffith Observatory will also be staffed by professionals who will have telescopes open to the public.

Caltech is hosting their own solar eclipse festival the weekend prior to the big day, and they'll host experts from JPL on the day itself.

The Kidspace Children's Museum will hold a kid-oriented event.

There are also events at L.A. public libraries across the city.

UC Riverside's Physics and Astronomy Department will hold an event open to the public, on campus.

Awami League General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader met with President Abdul Hamid Khan on Monday to discuss the Supreme Court’s 16th Amendment verdict. Obaidul Quader went to Bangabhaban to meet the president at noon on Monday, reports the Bangla Tribune. He said: “I met the president to share the Awami League’s stance over the 16th Amendment verdict with him. We discussed the matter.” According to sources, Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha went to Bangabhaban that morning to exchange greetings with the Hindu community on Janmashtami. Obaidul Quader met the Chief Justice at his residence on Saturday to discuss the verdict. While addressing a rally at Dhaka's Palashi intersection after the meeting, Obaidul Quader said there is no reason to worry over Supreme Court's observation in its judgement scraping 16th constitutional amendment, reports BSS. ""There might be concern among us, but there is no need to worry. I have met Chief Justice with the permission of the president of my party Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

""The government is out to make a drama over the 16th amendment verdict as it has exposed that Awami League has no legitimacy to stay in power. It has also clearly manifested that the party has no moral ground to run the government,"" he said. Fakhrul came up with the remarks while talking to journalists during his visit to different flood-affected areas in the district, reports our district correspondent Zakir Mostafiz.The BNP leader said their party is considering the apex court's verdict as a historical and significant document as it has revealed the truth and the ruling party's real colour. He said it is Awami League's old habit to oppose the court verdict which goes against its interests. ""We strongly condemn the Awami League's efforts to stir a controversy over the Supreme Court's 16th amendment judgment,"" Fakhrul said. He hoped that good sense will prevail upon the government to hold a fair election under a non-party supportive government through talks with political parties.Awami League Joint General Secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif on Monday said his party's General Secretary Obaidul Quader went to Chief Justice's residence to resolve the ongoing crisis and there is no scope of any debate over it. ""The judiciary is independent, the government and the Awami League want the judiciary work independently. We want the crisis which has been created after the verdict to be resolved soon and for this reason Obaidul Quader went to CJ's residence.....there is no scope of debate over it,"" he said. Hanif came up with this remark a day after BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir expressed concern over Obaidul Quader's meeting with the Chief Justice at the latter's residence. ""We've got surprised by the visit as they were attacking the Chief Justice with aggressive and indecent words, "" said Fakhrul at a programme on Sunday and urged his party colleagues to remain alert as the government has been hatching a new plot to obliterate democracy. Hanif was addressing a seminar titled ""Tumi E Bangladesh"" organised by Shotirtho Shojon at the National Press Club. Terming the observation in the Supreme Court verdict that annulled the 16th Amendment as objectionable, Hanif said: ""Expunge the statement given in the name of observation immediately. It is the demand of people. People of the country are not ready to accept the observation, they have been angry and shocked at it.""

77,77,FL-2017-000108-BGD,Response to responsibility - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2017/08/19/response-to-responsibility,"I always thought that the term “corporate social responsibility” was a least-adhered-to topic in Bangladesh.

However, it feels quite nice when I see the term and the related activities along with it are being discussed in a public forum.

In a recent workshop organised by the Centre on Budget and Policy of Dhaka University and the Asia Foundation, CSR experts sat together and opined that the government, the private sector, and charitable organisations should think of working together to ensure that CSR funds are spent efficiently so as to support communities as well as the economy.

They emphasised on the “value for money” while spending for any CSR activity. They are so right when they say this. These days, while thinking of any CSR activity, the importance of charity and philanthropy has reduced among the practitioners.

Companies around the world, in the last decade, have been considering a business link while spending for CSR. For example, a bottled water company would think of choosing a CSR activity in the water sector. It wouldn’t choose something that doesn’t connect with its core business.

The benefits of spending

However, spending for CSR in Bangladesh couldn’t yet come out of the concept of charity and philanthropy. If we look at the how the banks in Bangladesh have been spending their money which has doubled in the last decade, we’d see most of them aren’t spending those funds which are not related to their core business. The benefits of spending the money aren’t returning to the banking sector.

On the other hand, the telecom sector in the country has turned around when they think of their CSR strategy. They say that they are digital companies and they would think of doing something that would improve and benefit the digital environment of Bangladesh.

This is indeed a welcome phenomenon that they aren’t spending their money for football tournament or organising get-togethers of alumni associations. Rather, they are seen to focus on technology and education.

What would a cement company or a tobacco company do? They may certainly think of the environment and the people’s health. They wouldn’t do anything for the sake of doing. What would a beverage company do? It would mostly likely do something that raises its customers’ health consciousness.

Many may term CSR activities as voluntary work. Yes, it may be voluntary, but the necessity of running this voluntary work should come from within the companies, from their sense of responsibility that directly or indirectly connects the customers as well as the society as a whole with their core business.

As a nation, we’re still far from defining and understanding the nuances of CSR. I don’t think one consultation meeting can complete the task

And yes, the work has to be sustainable; they mustn’t do anything that they cannot do every year. If they cannot continue the activity or cannot increase the intensity of the activity, the work wouldn’t, then, be sustainable.

Remember when the rich people were spending money on charity and building schools and hospitals? They were actually spending those funds for their own children and families. If there’s no school in a village or a hospital in a town, where would their children study? Where would their family members go for treatment? They would have to travel to faraway lands for these purposes.

Corporate human responsibility

The term CSR these days has shed the word “social” and in many countries has become only “corporate responsibility.” And in a few countries, they aren’t even talking about corporate responsibility; they’re discussing “corporate human responsibility.”

The concepts aren’t being confined to the companies anymore -- they have crossed the boundary of companies, they have gone to the level of individual citizens. We, in Bangladesh, are also subconsciously thinking in the same fashion.

Look at what the citizens are doing for the flood-affected people right now. They have gone all-out in helping the victims so that they survive the calamity. This response has come from the citizens’ sense of responsibility. They understand that the government, as the biggest corporation of the country, would not be able to shoulder the responsibility alone.

Therefore, the government itself needs to realise that it alone cannot do everything for the people in need. It should develop a mechanism or a framework that could create the opportunity for the citizens to participate.

To my mind, similarly, the government should also create an opportunity for the companies to participate in social activities or human activities. However, this hasn’t been the case in our country. This realisation has led to the idea of developing a national guideline.

Now, what should the CSR guideline contain? I believe as a nation, we’re still far from defining and understanding the nuances of CSR. I don’t think one consultation meeting can complete the task of understanding CSR. I have been for a national CSR guideline for the last 20 years, yet we couldn’t develop it.

Why? Because we haven’t been talking about it, we haven’t putting proper emphasis on what CSR can achieve. The companies were seen to have a CSR department on the sidelines of their operations just because the government had asked them to do so. This practice has borne very little result in the society.

Therefore, I believe that the guideline shouldn’t be developed in haste. The planning ministry, the think-tanks, or the academics alone shouldn’t try to develop the guideline. Rather, they must include those, the companies to be specific, who are already practising CSR. We should gather all the experience, and then examine them with an open mind, and then go for a guideline.

The guideline should be able to inspire the companies to be more responsive to their responsibilities towards human beings -- their customers.

A steep uphill ride on a sturdy engine - some two hours from Islamabad - brings you to this lush, dense forest. As your ears get accustomed to all the sounds, your eyes take in the stunning landscape. Fresh, clean air fills yours lungs. You’re in Ayubia National Park.Spread over 3312 hectares in the Galliat region of Nathiagali, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), it is part of Pakistan’s last stretch of moist temperate forest. The park, habitat of a diverse species of wildlife, has been facing severe deforestation, water shortage, soil erosion, landslides and flash floods.Locale of 757 plant species and 203 bird species, Ayubia is part of the Western Himalayan Eco region. Besides being declared an Eco region, the park also falls under regions classified as Endemic Birds Areas of the world (EBA), recognised by BirdLife International. Eco regions are identified by their unique biogeographical characteristics, such as endemic species, environmental conditions, and ecological patterns and risk being lost forever if not conserved.To preserve the biodiversity of this region, specifically the conifer forests, Ayubia was declared a national park - a region protected by the state - in 1984.The Western Himalayan Ecoregion is the catchment area of Indus river. It is responsible for the streamflow of 70-80 per cent of water to the river. The freshwater streams and springs at the park are a significant source of water supply for the residents of the area.Over the decades, unsustainable land management practices such as fuel wood harvesting, overgrazing and urbanisation have led to deforestation, water shortage, landslides and flash floods in Ayubia National Park; the livelihoods of the locals were threatened along with the biodiversity of the region.Significant animal species in Ayubia National Park:A nocturnal hunter, with small ears, long whiskers and powerful jaw muscles; the common leopard preys on domestic animals in addition to wild animals such as foxes, wild boars and Rhesus monkeys.Although protected under all provincial laws the common leopard is critically endangered in Pakistan. It is frequently found in Ayubia and contiguous forest areas of K-P and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Rhesus monkey is widely spread across south, southeast and east Asia . In Pakistan the Rhesus monkey is found in mountainous regions with forest cover.Frequently spotted in Ayubia, Red foxes have a very wide recorded habitat. They can survive in arctic and sub-arctic regions as well as deserts and forests. They are lone hunters who prey on rodents, rabbits and birds among other wild animals. They also feed on fruit and vegetables, fish, frogs and worms.Native to Pakistan and India, Murree vole is a nocturnal, crepuscular, herbivorous rodent . It’s common habitat is temperate forests such as the Ayubia National Park. It has a very wide assessed distribution in the area. ( Molur et al. 2005 ).Woolly flying squirrel (Eupetaurus cinereus) was once thought to be extinct. However surveys confirmed the presence as well as a sustainable population of this species in the northern areas of Pakistan. Data gathered by International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) suggests that the species is endangered and has suffered a 50 per cent reduction in population in the last ten years. (Hasan 2008, Rao and Marwat 2003) Habitat destruction is the most immediate threat to the survival of the woolly flying squirrel according to the The Wildlife Conservation Society Pakistan. It is highly dependent upon pine needles in its diet (Zahler and Khan 2003)13-15 inches from head to tail, Kestrels are a birds of prey species that have an extremely large range.Kalij pheasant is native to Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar; Nepal and Thailand. It is commonly found in forests and thickets, especially in the Himalayan foothills. Although three of its eastern subspecies are threatened, the Kalij pheasant is not considered vulnerable according to Birdlife International. However the population is declining due to habitat destruction/degradation and hunting. (d el Hoyo et al. 1994 ).Found in Ayubia, Koklass pheasant is native to Afghanistan, China, India and Nepal besides Pakistan. The species is decreasing in population due to habitat degradation and fragmentation resulting from pasturing and cutting of understorey to fulfill firewood requirements. ( del Hoyo et al. 1994 ).Forests are home to eighty per cent of the world’s terrestrial plants and animals. Millions of species risk losing their habitat due to deforestation. Chir pheasants are already extinct in Pakistan due to shrinkage of chir forests. Musk deer and the black bear are also on the verge of extinction in the country due to forest degradation and loss.Forests also play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Trees soak up carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere that contribute to negative changes in climate. According to a study conducted by NASA in 2014, ""tropical forests absorb 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide out of a total global absorption of 2.5 billion"". Further the study revealed:“Forests and other land vegetation currently remove up to 30 percent of human carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. If the rate of absorption were to slow down, the rate of global warming would speed up in return.”Not only that, forests also protect our watersheds. They reduce stormwater runoff via infiltration and deescalate downstream flood flows that erode stream channels and are harmful to plants, animals and people. Forest cover alongside streams filters sediments during storms and contribute to stream health by removing nitrates and phosphates as well as pollutants from soil and water.Distinct tree species found in Ayubia National Park include:This is the tree that gives usseeds, widely consumed in winters throughout Pakistan. Native to Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Nepal, China and Afghanistan, the Blue Pine is a striking coniferous evergreen that can grow up to 50 metres tall, but is usually 10 to 30 metres in height . The branches of this tree are covered in blue-green needles all year round. Blue Pine is a common species listed as stable by IUCN Locally known as Deodar, Cedar is the national tree of Pakistan. It is also known as the Deodar cedar and the Himalayan cedar. A chief timber tree in the region; its wood is used in construction as well as furniture and Carpentry. Although it is currently listed as a Least Concern species by IUCN , deforestation and forest degradation may pose local threats to its population in Pakistan.Usually a prominent tree in stands Fir tree also occurs with other broad leafed conifers. The species has suffered a population decline of 25 per cent in the past three generations according to IUCN. This tree is therefore listed as Near Threatened approaching Vulnerable A2.Another endangered species, Yew forests are listed as endangered by the IUCN . Himalayan Yew has undergone a major decline within the last 25 years and the trend is ongoing. The wood from the Yew tree is commonly used for construction of houses and furniture. Local communities also use the wood for grave covering and as fuel.WWF-Pakistan has a few projects in the Western Himalayan Eco region. Keeping in line with Pakistan’s National Climate Change Strategy which calls to “promote integrated watershed management including ecological conservation practices in uphill watersheds”, In 2008 WWF initiated a programme titled: Improving Sub-watershed Management and Environmental Awareness in and around Ayubia National Park.Supported by Coca-Cola Foundation the project aimed to improve the ‘sustained flow of clean water in the region thereby conserving its biodiversity.The project’s efforts have been greatly appreciated by the beneficiaries and partners.The project mobilized the community and helped spread awareness about the significance of forests. To control landslides and protect streams and gullies from erosion the project treated landslides and land slips with bioengineering measures and constructed live brushwood check dams, flood control spurs, gabion check dams and improved vegetation cover by 4.62 per cent.It also introduced measures to reduce pressure on existing forests by providing fuel efficient stoves to some houses, solar water heaters and introduced the use of concrete RCC slabs in graves instead of the wood obtained from Taxus wallichiana. Taxus wallichiana is now being protected and annually five trees have been saved in 10 villages according to estimates.To address the issue of water availability, the project initiated water harvesting and waste management campaigns. The project has contributed to the overall health of the watershed by improving the livelihoods of people via training on agricultural practices, provision of fruit and vegetable plants as well as by establishing improvised pipe irrigation schemes.Further, the project has been able to replenish 215.06 million litres of water annually.Local, Abdul Shakoor, an activist says “Our mountains are beautiful, it is our duty to protect them. We will continue collaborating with locals and the government to protect our region.”The residents of the area hope that the government will further help the region by introducing water schemes, subsidised LPG; to be used in stoves and a system for vaccination of livestock.Government projects such as the 'Billion tree tsunami' have proved to be a triumph. In just a year it added three-quarters of a billion new trees, as part of a “tree tsunami” aimed at reversing worsening forest loss.The project aims to increase K-P’s forest area by at least two per cent. The Billion tree tsunami has been recognised by the Bonn Challenge, a global partnership which aims to restore 150 million hectares of the world's deforested and degraded lands by 2020. Here’s hoping we will see more.","Sun, 13 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://tribune-reloaded.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/1480650-ayubianationalparkwwfpak-1502620852/1480650-ayubianationalparkwwfpak-1502620852.jpg,"['region', 'water', 'forest', 'vanishing', 'tree', 'project', 'forests', 'wildlife', 'ayubia', 'species', 'national', 'pakistan']",

(Source: PTI) Guwahati: Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. (Source: PTI)

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday asked the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to complete the ongoing fencing work along the Indo-Bangladesh border and seal it completely. Sonowal also urged the Department of Telecommunication to enhance bandwidth for seamless internet connectivity in Assam.

At a meeting with top officials of the NBCC and CPWD, Sonowal asked them to complete the task on a “war footing” so that 48.11 kms of unfenced areas of the international border could be sealed, a state government statement said.

Sonowal asked the Border Security Force to use proven technology to intensify its vigil and squeeze the alleged influx and smuggling from across the border. “Fencing of the unfenced areas of Indo-Bangla border would lead to complete sealing of the border between the two geographical entities and it will also stop illegal movements from across the border,” the chief minister said.

During the meeting, the NBCC and CPWD officials pointed out that of the 48.11 kms unfenced border between Assam and Bangladesh, fencing of 13.38 kms would be completed as soon as the flood water recedes.

However, erecting fence on the remaining areas involves enormous challenges as nearly 3-km stretch particularly in Silchar sector is full of deep gorges. Sonowal asked the NBCC and CPWD to start the fencing work right from October so that the whole process can be completed before the onset of the next monsoon, the statement said.

At a separate meeting with officials of the Department of Communication, the chief minister sought upgradation and amplification of the bandwidth in Assam to bring the internet facility at par with major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.

“If this can be done the far-flung areas of Assam can be brought under the ambit of internet connectivity,” he said.

It will create an ambience conducive for spearheading a new paradigm of development in information technology, he said.

Sonowal underscored the need for Optical Fibre Cable connectivity through neighbouring Bangladesh’s Cox Bazar.

The chief minister urged the DoT to raise the number of mobile towers for seamless connectivity in the far-flung areas of the state.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/07/sonowal-7591.jpg,"['border', 'minister', 'cpwd', 'completion', 'fencing', 'work', 'areas', 'cm', 'seeks', 'nbcc', 'assam', 'connectivity', 'sonowal', 'sarbananda', 'chief', 'early', 'indobangla']", 
81,81,FL-2017-000108-BGD,"Remembering Khudiram Bose, the youngest revolutionary martyr of India’s freedom struggle - National Herald",https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/people/remembering-khudiram-bose-the-youngest-revolutionary-martyr-of-indias-freedom-struggle,"Born on December 3, 1889 in Habibpur of Midnapore district of the then Bengal Presidency, Khudiram Bose lost both his parents, Trailokyanath Bose and Lakshmipriya Devi, when he was just six. Never too fond of studies, he would rather spend his time helping people affected by flood and other calamities. A student of Midnapore Collegiate School, he gave up studies to dedicate his life to revolutionary activities. After dropping out, he became a member of the Revolutionary Party.

In 1905, when Bengal was divided, ‘Banga-Bhanga’ saw the strongest protests in Midnapore where Khudiram Bose actively participated in burning British products. The British attitude towards peasants, revolutionaries, farmers and other Indians further fuelled his anger.

As a member of the Revolutionary Party, he started distributing pamphlets with Vande Matram written on them. At one of the places where Bose was distributing pamphlets, he apparently slapped a police officer, breaking his nose when he was just 14 years old.

At the age of 16, he had learnt how to make bombs and went about planting bombs near police stations and targeted government officials.

In 1908, he and Prafulla Chaki were assigned to assassinate Muzzaffarpur district magistrate Kingsford. Kingsford, before being transferred to Muzaffarpur, was a magistrate in Bengal and his method of torturous punishments against revolutionaries had angered the youngsters of Bengal. It was decided that the two appointed men, Bose and Chaki, would hurl bombs at him in the court but after 10 days of monitoring Kingsford’s movements, they realised that hurling bombs in courtroom would injure a large number of innocent civilians. The plan was thereafter changed to assassinate him outside a club which he attended.

On April 30, 1908, Khudiram Bose instructed Chaki to run away and threw the bomb himself on the carriage, in which Kingsford was supposed to be travelling. However, as he had on previous occasions, Kingsford escaped death as the carriage was, instead, carrying the wife and daughter of a barrister named Pringle Kennedy. Bose was arrested from a railway station in Samastipur district, where he had reached walking barefoot for 25 kilometres (16 miles) after bombing the carriage. Later, the station where he was captured was renamed to Khudiram Bose Pusa railway station.

Unlike other parts of India, where revolutionaries could rarely afford a lawyer, educated Bengali lawyers’ teams used to represent the revolutionaries of Bengal for free. Khudiram’s statement was recorded in English, instead of the language used by Bose, and lawyer Narendra Kumar Basu used this, along with Bose’s tender age, to defend him. Bose was too young to know the art of making a bomb, he had argued.

However, the judge received a letter, where it was written that there would be revolutions not only in Bengal but also in Bihar if Bose was not sentenced, or sentenced lightly.

On 13 July 1908, Bose was finally sentenced to death. On being asked by the shocked English judge, as Bose was still smiling after hearing the judgment, whether he understood the judgment, the young freedom fighter said with a smile on his face, “Yes, I do and my lawyer said that I was too young to make bombs. If you allow me some time before I’m taken away from here, I can teach you the skills of making bombs too.”

He was, finally, executed at 4:30 in the morning of August 11, 1908.","Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://gumlet.assettype.com/nationalherald%2F2017-08%2Fc0d5d757-a7d1-48fc-bf80-abb564f0c2f6%2Fremembering-khudiram-bose-the-youngest-revolutionary-martyr-of-indias-freedom-struggle.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C538&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&fm=webp&ogImage=true,"['youngest', 'struggle', 'remembering', 'revolutionary', 'khudiram', 'freedom', 'used', '1908', 'revolutionaries', 'bose', 'young', 'bombs', 'indias', 'martyr', 'bengal', 'kingsford', 'sentenced']",

Reason? Emraan Hashmi, one of the lead actors from the film, has given us a sneak peek about what to expect with a whistle version of the song. Also Read - Tiger 3: Emraan Hashmi-Salman Khan Pit Against Each Other as ISI And RAW Agents

The song that stars Emraan along with Esha Gupta will be the third post Mere Rashke Qamar (starring Ajay Devgn and Ileana D’Cruz) and Piya More (starring Emraan Hashmi and Sunny Leone). The earlier two songs have been well received for the music as well the chemistry between the actors. Through an Instagram post a while ago, Emraan gave us a dekko into the song that’s coming out tomorrow. The caption read, “Bina rap wala remix sunna hai?” Also Read - Happy Birthday Jr NTR: Ram Charan, Mahesh Babu And Fans Flood Social Media With Wishes For 'Komaram Bheem'

The caption clearly highlighted how 2017 has been a year full of remixes and how most of these reprised versions have been ruined with unnecessary rap! If the tune doesn’t ring a bell, let us remind you that just like Rashke Qamar, which is a reprised version of one of the songs by Late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan; Socha Hai too is inspired by the cult hit Keh Doon Tumhe from the 1975 crime drama film Deewar. The song was sung by Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle and filmed on Shashi Kapoor and Neetu Singh. It was an instant hit.

We later heard the song in a remixed version by DJ Aqeel. This one too climbed up the popularity charts instantly. Now, looking at the versions of the song that we have heard and loved earlier, it is going to be a tough task for the Baadshaho team to bring us an old song in a more appealing than ever way. But with what they have done with Rashke Qamar, I have my hopes high. They gave the song a new lease of life without tampering with its essence and that won for the song. As we wait for 11 am tomorrow for the final verdict on Socha Hai, let’s check out the original and remixed versions of Keh Doon Tumhe and the already released songs from Baadshaho.

83,83,FL-2017-000108-BGD,How the legacy of the Partition of British India and Pakistan affects me 70 years later - Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/08/13/how-the-legacy-of-the-partition-of-british-india-and-pakistan-affects-me-70-years-later.html,"The remnants of all four of my grandparents’ early lives are scattered across the eastern Indian state of Bihar. Growing up in the home they rebuilt in Karachi, Pakistan, a home they named after the village they left behind, we’d sometimes hear the echoes of their past lives, from a time when Pakistan didn’t exist.

Within the walls of their new two-storey home, they’d remember the seven-storey building in the village where they all lived in Bihar. The garden in front of their new home couldn’t compare to the courtyard they gathered in every evening for big communal dinners in India. The long walk or bike ride they took every day was forgone for a shorter walk to the neighbourhood mosque or the nearby market.

Monday, Aug. 14 marks 70 years since they migrated westwards to Pakistan. The future leaders of the Muslim-majority country demanded independence in 1947 just as colonialism was leaving India and a deep-seated conflict between Hindus and Muslims was taking root, violently.

Seventy years on, their children and grandchildren would move westwards again, leaving everything behind once more, to suburban Canada — this time for reasons relating to social security and economic prosperity. We carry a legacy with us of a country the generation before struggled to live in, a legacy we’re just starting to understand.

After my paternal grandfather, S.G.M. Badruddin, died, my father found some unpublished essays of his — the personal experience of a journalist who had to flee from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the early 1970s, where he worked as a news editor, to West Pakistan (now just Pakistan). Therein was a story of a man I didn’t know — someone who had conversations with leaders, who escaped through secret paths and covert car rides with Christian missionaries across the subcontinent.

In a memorable essay, my grandfather describes the six-week journey he took from Dhaka in Bangladesh, to Calcutta and Patna in India, to Kathmandu in Nepal, and then to Bangkok in Thailand, all the way to Karachi. While reading it, I mapped out my own journey from Karachi to Riyadh, Al Khobar and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, to Dubai, to Mississauga.

His was a harrowing tale of struggle. Mine is less so. But we both lost homes. We both made new homes. We both changed our identities.

No one spoke of Partition when I was younger. My grandparents were quiet about the experience, and no one asked. Yet it was always a part of us. Every Aug. 14, the televisions would be turned to the parade at Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s tomb — the burial place of the father of the Pakistani state.

We commemorated their migration by wearing green and draping flags on our cars, across our balconies, across our chests. Back then it was tradition, a fun thing to do that connected me and my sisters to my cousins in Pakistan.

It stayed a tradition until we immigrated to Canada more than seven years ago. The fact that we would start celebrating with red and white and not the familiar green and white suddenly made us hyper-aware of the evolving fabric of my identity.

I wasn’t alone. Sarah Qidwai, a PhD student at the University of Toronto, has been hearing stories of Partition from her grandmother, Kamni Siddiqui, for as long as she can remember. But it took an undergraduate history course for her to sit down and record, in detail, her grandmother’s experience of it.

Siddiqui, a retired professor of chemistry, was 9 in 1947. Her father told her they were “going to a land where (you) will be free to practise your own culture and religion, but there will be hardships and surprises.”

Like me, Qidwai found parallels in this. “As a family, we moved to Canada in 2004 and it was a lot more peaceful than what Grandma experienced in 1947,” said Qidwai. And now that Siddiqui has applied for Canadian citizenship, the history seems more poignant — this time her choice had fewer hardships and surprises.

If the history of Partition is complicated, its legacy is even more so. Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi children grow up knowing the names of the leaders of Partition and their roles in the creation of the three countries. First came the British man who arbitrarily drew a border that separated India into East and West Pakistan. Second came independence, the constitutions, the death of a founder. And then, almost 15 years later, East Pakistan had another independence movement to become Bangladesh.

The fluctuating borders led to new identities that continue to be defined by the memories of their creation. To this day, the violent history is romanticized, the idea of a new state for Muslims to just be Muslims is lauded, the fact of independence is idealized.

The reality for our grandparents, however, was very different — and it took me 25 years and a journey to Canada to figure that out. As I became more comfortable in my hyphenated identity, I started asking more questions and reading more about the country we, metaphorically, left behind.

It was the same for Seemal Saif, an employee at the Ontario ministry of infrastructure, who was 19 years old, and studying in Canada, when she finally understood the weight of her grandmother’s history.

Before Partition, Saif’s grandmother lived in Jalalabad, India — a state right at the border with newly formed Pakistan. At 7 years old, Saif’s grandmother wasn’t aware of the severity of the riots between Hindus and Muslims — reports of rapes and murders of Muslim women were increasing rapidly.

All the women and children in the village, including Saif’s grandmother, were locked up as they awaited an opportune moment to escape. In the event that theycouldn’t, if the riots reached their home first, the family would burn down these rooms, women and children inside. It was deemed to be more honourable for them to be killed by their family members than raped by a Hindu mob.

By 1948, more than 15 million people had been uprooted, and estimates suggest between one and two million died, with death and suffering on all sides. The 1951 census of Pakistan alone identified the number of displaced persons in Pakistan at more than seven million.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

“These were communities that lived together for centuries, they had been neigbours for generations,” said Saif. “Being in Canada, there’s a lot of talk about diversity but it’s also a fragile concept … I value it a lot more knowing this history than I would’ve just living in Pakistan.”

There is a generation of new immigrants that is just starting to draw these parallels, myself included — a process complicated both by the deaths of our grandparents who experienced it and the fading memories of our uncles and aunts who moved with them, just children at the time.

Partition’s ghosts continue to affect us; our grandparents’ past continues to follow us. The legacy of their migration continues to influence the reasons we immigrate: the right to freely and safely be the way we want to be.

The one constant in both our journeys, though, as even my grandfather notes in his essay, is our personal identification with the places left behind. For him it was Dhaka and Patna. And while, I may be building a life in the streets of the 6ix, I’m pulled to the lives that used to be in the streets of Karachi, the roads through India, and the journeys across new borders.

My experience of Partition is just starting.

If left to my own devices, I’d never have visited Apna Pakistan. The name means Our Pakistan, and I am a reasonably patriotic Indian. The supermarket lay in Dubai’s Al Karama area, one densely populated by Indian and Pakistani immigrants. Behind it was a restaurant called Mumbai se, literally From Mumbai, and diagonally opposite to it, across the street, was my favorite, Bikanerwala, named after a town in India, Bikaner. In other words, there were plenty of red-blooded Indian options for me to choose from. But one summer in Dubai, all the Indian supermarkets failed me.

I first ventured into Apna Pakistan in the search of a very specific gourd variety, the luffa. I was looking for an Indian version of it, long, slender, dark green in color, and not the spongy kind I had encountered in other markets in Dubai. It was specific to Indian summers, and when cooked the right way, it took me back to my mother’s simple but immensely gratifying cooking, the kind of stuff you’d never find in a restaurant. There was another item, though, that invariably accompanied all those summer meals at home with the gourd: mangoes. Their presence made the meals complete, either sliced or as juice—called ras in western India—an indicator that life was normal and that there was still hope in the summers, even when the thermometer edged past 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Some 500 years back, a certain Afonso de Albuquerque, considered one of the greatest European conquerors of his time, invaded the western coast of India around Mumbai and Goa. He brought with him more than just the Portuguese army. He brought a variety of mangoes that would rule the hearts of Indians for generations to come: the Alphonso, named after him.

I spent several years of my life working in the bustling metropolis of Mumbai and there, a large part of summer evenings was dedicated to finding the best quality mangoes in the city. I scoured the most obscure streets for the perfect Alphonso. Those that came from Ratnagiri were the most famous, but there were mangoes from towns all around Mumbai. Whichever variety one chose, the test remained the same. It should have non-uniform colors, a mixture of yellow, green, and probably a bit of crimson; shouldn’t be too stiff or too squishy when held in the hand; and must heavily invigorate the olfactory senses even from a distance. For almost three months every year, my home was perfumed by arguably the best mangoes of India.

When I moved to Dubai, I was apprehensive about the mangoes I’d find here. I started my efforts my first summer, ducking under awnings of stores to somehow escape the scorching Dubai sun, frantically searching supermarket after supermarket, sniffing my way through their fruit sections. Yes, I found the Alphonsos of Mumbai, “export quality” as their packings would proudly claim, but they were nowhere close to those in Mumbai. In perfectly arranged crates of mangoes from Spain and Portugal, I tried searching for the ancestors of the Alphonso. There was the R2E2 variety from Australia, but those only arrived in winter months. There were the Kenyan and Egyptian mangoes; they tasted good, slightly tangy, yet left something to be desired. There were eye-candy mangoes from South American countries that sold for a small fortune, but each time I was disappointed.

You see, in the Indian sub-continent, mangoes are a very sensitive subject. Even within families, nothing reveals fault-lines more clearly than our preferences about the fruit. My father loves a certain Chaunsa variety, my mother swoons for the extra-sweet Dussehri, and I owe my allegiances to the aforementioned Alphonso. My friends from Delhi and Mumbai would fight over how the Alphonso was either the worst or best mango in the world, depending on which city they came from. I’m sure that at some point in our medieval history this debate could easily have led to one of the several wars between the clans of the Mughals, who ruled Delhi, and the Marathas, who ruled Mumbai. I, however, come from central India, and its ruling clans and their battles are lesser known. So, in the middle of all this mango imperialism, I could not even talk about the humble but delicious Badami variety that ruled our hearts and tongues for a good two months of the year. Which is why when I was first drawn by the intense smells of fresh Pakistani mangoes flown in from Karachi at Apna Pakistan, I was seriously questioning my allegiances to my country. This could be heresy, blasphemy, even pure treason!

Seventy years ago, India was partitioned into two states, India and Pakistan. Some of my closest Indian friends can still trace their ancestries to Pakistan. They all had the same story, grandparents who migrated from the western state of Punjab, or Eastern Bengal (now Bangladesh) settled in Indian Punjab, Delhi, or Kolkata, and began life afresh. It was later, in Dubai, when I first met people who had very similar stories but the other way around. People my age who were third-generation kids of those who had migrated away from India to Pakistan. In talks over lunch, we would exchange stories of how similar our halwa puris were, or the nuances that made their kshir korma different from our dessert kheer. It was also in Dubai where I first tasted mangos that traced their origins to India but were loved all over Pakistan.

The Anwar Ratol was one such variety. Pakistanis swore by its sweetness. In his book A Tryst with Mango, Dr. Om Prakash quotes an article in The Pioneer newspaper published in July 1981 about Ratol mangoes being gifted by Zia Ul-Huq to Indira Gandhi, then the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India respectively. It then goes on to quote a former Nawab (ruler) of Ratol, a village in the northern province of India, who claims that a sapling of this plant was taken from India to Pakistan during the partition.

These mangoes had to be pampered, caressed, and cajoled into oozing the juice

Ratols, though, reminded me of the summer holidays we spent at my Nana’s place, where not one, not two, but dozens of very small desi mangos (very similar to Ratol) would be drowned in a bucket of water, to drain out their excessive heat. As kids we would pick up one or two, roll them between our palms and suck out the juice from them, a natural tetrapack. When the Indian mango season passed (the mango season in India runs roughly from April to July and in Pakistan from June to September) and the Anwar Ratol from Pakistan continued to flood Dubai markets, I started buying them for the mandatory ras at home. But this juice couldn’t be made by cutting the mango in pieces and throwing it into a blender, the way my mother made it. The Anwar Ratols had to be pampered, caressed, and cajoled into oozing the juice, and then sieved into a large bowl, the old-fashioned way, the way my grandmother did, sitting for hours, extracting juice for the entire family: children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. This was slow food at its best in a pint-sized mango.

Then there was the Sindhri, which came from the province of Sindh in Pakistan. In summers, Sindh swelters in heat and, as my Pakistani colleagues tell me, the hotter the climate, the sweeter the mango. Sindhri has a very thin yellow skin, has very little fiber content, and is big, sometimes too big to hold in one hand. Even in the larger fresh vegetable markets of Dubai, in the historical Deira neighborhood, Sindhri’s widespread aroma can take first timers by surprise. The taste is as sweet, though a tad less so than the Ratol. The people of Sindh—Sindhis—are known for their sweet tooth. Many Sindhis fled from Pakistan at the time of the partition and settled in makeshift colonies in different parts of India. An Indian Sindhi friend once told me she wanted to learn the script for Urdu, Nastaliq, because all texts in the Sindhi language were written in it. That knowledge went missing when the people migrated, as did the quintessentially sindhi mango, Sindhri, which is rarely found in Indian markets, barring a few in and around Delhi.

It was on the Muslim holiday of Eid that I went to Apna Pakistan to tell the owner that I was taking their Sindhri mangoes home to India. The owner, a middle-aged man in white kurta-pyjama, stood possessively beside the crates of mangoes as I examined each variety in my hands. “If it’s for India, you must take Chaunsa then. It’s the sweetest, and doesn’t grow in India.” However, the Chaunsa is indeed grown and eaten across India, especially northern areas. When I revealed this, he was astonished, much the same way I was when I first found the treasure of Pakistani mangoes. Deep in his eyes I could see that perhaps my revelation had broken his heart a teeny, tiny bit.

Finally, there’s the langda variety. When literally translated, the name means ‘lame’ in both Urdu and Hindi. The mango, however, is anything but. It’s an interesting combination of tangy and sweet, interspersed in lots of fiber. As a kid, it was my favorite, the juxtaposition of its twin tastes a fascinating puzzle for the senses. After thirty years, my fascination reached new highs when I found the sweetest version of this childhood favorite in the Pakistani varieties of langda.

Over the last three summers, I have spotted more langda, far more Chaunsa, and yes, a huge bunch of Dussehri, at Pakistani stores across Dubai. And each of them, I am forced to admit, has been sweeter and tastier than their Indian counterparts. My conscience was jolted. My taste buds—my traitorous taste buds—have been overjoyed.

In some ways, the partition was probably the single most unfortunate event in the 5,000-year history of Indian lands. There was a lot that was lost at that time. The lives of at least a million people, the homes of another nine million, villages on either side of the border, and our goodwill towards each other. We also lost the prospect of an invincible cricket team and, very few people know, the sweetness of a six-month long mango season. If only our soldiers on the border could share mangoes rather than bullets every few weeks.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/roadsandkingdoms.com/uploads/2017/08/Alphonso-mangoes-of-India-1-1267x950.jpg?w=2400&quality=95&strip=color&ssl=1,"['indian', 'dubai', 'variety', 'quest', 'knows', 'mangoes', 'ratol', 'mango', 'mumbai', 'perfect', 'pakistan', 'way', 'borders', 'india']",

Jewel, 7, used to work at a shop in front of Lalon Shah's shrine, reports our Kushtia correspondent.

Around 3:30pm yesterday, Meru Miah and Tanjel from Cheuria village picked him up, tied him to a tree and beat him up, said Abdul Khaleq, officer-in-charge of Kumarkhali Police Station.

Meru and Tanjel tortured the boy after the latter’s mother-in-law Rokeya provoked them suspecting Jewel of snatching her mobile phone, the OC said.

Jewel was taken to Kushtia general hospital where he was given first aid, said Tapos Kumar Sarkar, resident medical officer of the hospital.

Jewel’s brother Rubel filed a case against three including Meru and Tanjel with Kumarkhali police station at night.

Two accused -- Tanjel and Rokeya -- were arrested from their houses but Meru went into hiding soon after the incident, the OC added.

87,87,FL-2017-000108-BGD,"Global Insured H1 Losses from Natural, Man-Made Disasters Were $23B: Swiss Re - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2017/08/18/461508.htm,"Global insured losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in the first half of 2017 totaled US$23 billion, while economic losses during the same period came to US$44 billion – an indication of the extent of the protection gap that exists across the globe.

These figures are included in a report on disaster losses published by “sigma,” Swiss Re’s industry research unit.

As a result of fewer and less intense natural and man-made events, both insured and economic losses during the first half were down significantly from H1 2016 when insured losses totaled US$36 billion, and economic – or uninsured losses – were US$117 billion.

Breaking down the global insured loss total of US$23 billion, sigma said that natural catastrophes during the half came to US$20 billion, down from US$30 billion in H1 2016, while insured losses from man-made disasters were US$3 billion, down from US$6 billion last year.

As for the economic total of $44 billion, sigma said that natural catastrophes accounted for US$41 billion in the first half of 2017, compared with US$110 billion in H1 2016. The remaining US$3 billion in H1 2017 came from man-made disasters.

Further, sigma noted, the $44 billion in economic losses reported during H1 2017 were well below the first half annual average of US$120 billion of the last 10 years.

Global deaths from disaster deaths also decreased during the first half when around 4,400 people lost their lives or went missing, compared with 4,800 in the first six months of 2016. However, the report said the H1 2017 toll may rise once estimates on the number of victims of Europe’s severe June heat waves are included.

A Year of Weather Extremes

A series of severe thunderstorms in the U.S. caused some of the largest losses in the first half of 2017, the sigma report said.

Severe convective storms, or thunderstorms, in the U.S. resulted in the largest losses in the first six months of this year, the report said.

Four separate weather events from February to May each had insured losses of more than US$1 billion, the report noted.

“The most intense and costly event was a four-day long storm in May with heavy damage to property inflicted by hail in Colorado and strong winds in other parts of southern and central states,” the report said, noting that the economic losses of this storm alone were US$2.2 billion, with insured losses of US$1.9 billion.

“Fortunately, in the U.S., most households and businesses are insured against wind risk so they are financially protected when severe storms strike,” says Swiss Re’s Chief Economist Kurt Karl.

The largest and most costly insurance event outside of the U.S. was Cyclone Debbie, a Category 4 tropical cyclone that hit the northeastern coast of Australia in late March and led to insured losses of US$1.3 billion.

The report cited other large events during the first half, including:

Floods in Peru

Severe frost damage in late spring in Europe and in the southeastern part of the U.S.

A European cold spell early in the year that claimed dozens of hypothermia victims.

Record high temperatures during summer heat waves in several European locations.

High temperatures and dry weather have continued during the northern hemisphere’s summer season, igniting wildfires in many parts of the world.

88,88,FL-2017-000108-BGD,"How a Common Man Became TN’s Weatherman, Whose Weather Forecasts Are Trusted by 2 Lakh People - The Better India",https://www.thebetterindia.com/111285/tamil-nadu-weatherman-weather-forecasts-facebook/,"How many of us follow weather updates everyday? They seem like a mundane feature of the news – a vestigial organ. What if I told you that there is an amateur weatherman – yes, a weatherman – with an almost cult-like following, whose forecasts people follow every day? And what if you learnt that he is not even formally trained, but receives thousands of questions every day about the weather?

Meet 35-year-old Pradeep John, a.k.a the ‘Tamil Nadu Weatherman’. For the last 7 years, this self-confessed Pluviophile (lover of rain), has been blogging and updating a Facebook page called Tamil Nadu Weatherman.

“In 2010 I started publishing interesting rainfall related information under different titles like ‘Top 20 rainfall stations in India’ and so on,” says Pradeep. Initially, the blog did not get much traction, but this didn’t deter him from posting articles regularly.

Today with over 2 lakh followers on social media, it would not be a stretch to say that this self-taught weatherman’s forecasts are more closely followed than the Met department’s! Pradeep, although untrained in meteorology, does have a degree in Computer Science, and an MBA in Finance.

What Pradeep does via his blog posts and Facebook is not just provide weather information, but also eliminate baseless rumours.

“I have taken on this role very seriously. One of the things I do is dispel rumours that keep floating around about the occurrence of cyclones in Tamil Nadu,” he says.

Some of Pradeep’s posts that were spot on and are indicative of his fan base are listed below:

On August 6, 2017 Pradeep put out this message: Chennai Rain Update – Sea breeze triggered Intense pop up over-head in Chennai. The abundant energy and moisture just made the small clouds intense one. It’s only Central City special. Will stop in 15 mins max.

As his post mentioned, most parts in Chennai received rainfall for only about ten -twenty minutes that day.

Another post made by him assured marathon runners in the city that an impending rain would not ruin the run. It read – Weather Report for Runners of Jawadhu Ultra Run on 6th August 2017. Don’t get fearful by night rains, it will be mostly clear by start of the run.

On 4th June, 2017, as all eyes were glued to the television for the India vs. Pakistan cricket match, many weatherman followers asked him if the rains would play spoilsport. His reply was accurate for the day – Another hot day for Chennai, only light rains are expected during India vs. Pakistan match.

Pradeep Ramakrishnan, a resident of Chennai and a follower of the weatherman’s posts, says, “I started following his posts during the Chennai flood. The biggest USP of the weatherman is the concise manner in which he gives out information. He breaks down the technical jargon for the layman to understand.”

His interest in the weather began as a 12-year old, fascinated by the power of nature, he witnessed his first cyclone in Chennai.

In the year 1996, Chennai, then Madras, received an unprecedented amount of rainfall in June, so much so, that most schools were shut for two whole weeks.

“I had the time of my life watching the rain then. When everyone at home would ask me to come in, and not linger by the window, I just sat there watching the rain in amazement. The sound of the rain calmed me. I knew that this was special,” he says.

He would make deep potholes in his colony so so he could measure the rainfall, and see how fast it filled up. Today, thanks to easy access to better equipment, – even school kids have access to high-end rain gauges, he says.

Promotion

From 1996 to 2008, Pradeep continued to decode nature and get a better understanding of it. “It was difficult to gather information and clear doubts back then. It was the early-internet era, so I had to rely mostly on newspaper reports,” he says. But improved access to the internet changed the way he worked.

The floods that devastated Chennai in 2015 was a turning point for Pradeep. During this time, the city witnessed its worst rainfall in over 100 years.

In addition to the torrential rains, a reservoir gate was opened causing the Adyar river to overflow, which in turn submerged whole neighbourhoods.

People were in a state of panic and wanted some guidance and information about the expected rainfall. Activity on Pradeep’s Facebook page had reached its peak during this period. From about 1,000 followers on his Facebook page his posts on the predictions of rainfall went viral and almost overnight he had more than 70,000 followers.

In May this year, there was speculation about whether or not cyclone Mora would hit Tamil Nadu. Rumours started doing the rounds. But a post by Pradeep helped calm the storm. ‘First rainy day in Chennai City (Nungambakkam) after 4 months, these rains have nothing to do with Cyclone Mora. Cyclone Mora is going to make landfall tomorrow in Bangladesh and is not going to affect Tamil Nadu in anyway.’

“I remember once I posted something on Facebook, two hours later that same message got forwarded to me via whatsapp by a friend. That is when I realised the reach of social media.” It was this incident that made him realise how effective his posts were. The fact that people were relying on them, gave him a sense of purpose.

When asked how he collates and interprets his data, he says, “I collect it from various sources and make predictions. Essentially I am privy to the same data that is available to the met department. Sometimes they might get exclusive data during cyclones, but it all boils down to how it is interpreted.”

Outside of tracking the weather, he enjoys his work as a Deputy Manager at Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL). His wife, Hannah, and daughter, Laura, play a big part in his love for the weather.

With some trepidation, he tells me about the time he whisked his daughter out in the open, so she could experience a cyclone. “I wanted her to feel the wind, and hear the howls. I was given an earful by many relatives for this but something in me wanted her to experience it,” he says.

With pride he also told me about how Laura loves watching the various patterns that the clouds make.

Mentioning how important it is to have a good support system he says, “Given the volume of messages I receive nowadays, it is my wife who looks through the messages and helps me identify the ones that need an immediate response.”

“The trust that people have placed in me is immense, I cannot let them down,” he says. This ‘rain-chaser’ even plans holidays according to the rain pattern. More power to people like Pradeep!

89,89,FL-2017-000108-BGD,An Inside Look at Trump's Infrastructure Plans - Tax Foundation,https://taxfoundation.org/trump-infrastructure-plans/,"President Trump signed an infrastructure permitting executive order on Tuesday, the intended highlight of that day’s news conference. The executive order is part of the White House’s “Infrastructure Week,” and has the goal of expediting permitting for infrastructure projects by requiring each project to have a lead federal agency in charge of navigating it through the bureaucracy, and directing federal agencies to determine ways to reduce average permitting time from seven years to two years. President Trump and Secretary Chao displayed a flowchart of the existing federal permitting process, which I’ve pasted at the bottom of this post. The executive order also revoked a flood control planning process relating to global warming mitigation.

As for a tangible plan, the focus so far has been more on financing than actual funds. During the campaign, Trump frequently mentioned a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, several times the $250 billion plan Hillary Clinton had proposed. But both plans focused on financing, not funding: Clinton proposed $25 billion in seed funding for a “bank” that would somehow turn that into $250 billion of projects. Trump’s proposal was originally $137 billion in generous 82 percent tax credits to private investors if they invested $167 billion into constructing $1 trillion worth of projects, meaning it could only go toward projects that could earn the cash to recoup the investment. An updated proposal, included in the President’s budget request, relies on a mix of $200 billion in tax credits and direct funds, although only $5 billion was requested for the 2018 budget and the new spending is offset by $95 billion of proposed cuts to highway and transit projects. At the same time President Trump has needled Senate Majority Leader McConnell to put a plan on his desk, his team has noted low federal borrowing costs, and this spring White House officials listened to a pitch covering 500 potential infrastructure projects from across the country.

It’s worth noting most infrastructure is funded, built, and owned by private actors, not public ones. In 2015, $2.3 trillion was spent building private infrastructure in the U.S., including pipelines, power stations, refineries, freight railroads, cell phone and broadband networks, and factories. That was about five times the size of public infrastructure spending that same year of $472 billion, split about $192 billion by the federal government and $280 billion by state and local governments. Most of that (about one-third) was for highways, with the rest primarily water utilities, mass transit, schools, and passenger rail. Most of the federal money was for new projects; most of the state and local money was for operations or maintenance of infrastructure. Unless we’re talking about spending much more money than either Clinton or Trump ever proposed, the biggest bang for the buck will be reducing obstacles in the way of private infrastructure builders.

Do we need more infrastructure? Most everyone seems to think so: the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), a not-disinterested bunch, gives the U.S. a D+ grade and estimates the country needs $4.59 trillion in infrastructure between now and 2025, of which $2.06 trillion is unfunded. Hardly a week goes by without a prominent person comparing the state of U.S. airports or passenger rail to gleaming European or Asian ones. Then there are the 58,791 American bridges categorized as structurally deficient, but that’s out of a total of 611,845. Rail and road systems are visibly in trouble, but the privately-managed freight network got the highest grade the ASCE gave (B) and state highways paid by dedicated user taxes and user fees seem in better condition compared to other transportation infrastructure more dependent on appropriations.

So maybe the focus should be on how to get operators more of an ownership stake and find a way for users to pay for what they use. Steps to do so with the woeful air traffic control system have begun, and perennial proposals regarding the U.S. Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Amtrak, interstate toll roads, and federally-owned lands and dams may need dusting off.

For that infrastructure that needs public funding, how should we pay for it? The federal gasoline tax has been fixed at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993; since then, construction costs have doubled while cars are getting increasingly more miles per gallon. In FY 2017, the federal highway trust fund collected $41 billion in gasoline and other user taxes but spent $54 billion. This imbalance continues to worsen; the CBO estimates that by 2027, the fund will collect $40 billion and spend $63 billion. The choices are cutting spending, raising revenue, or bailing out the fund with other tax revenue (as Congress has now done on several occasions). States, confronted with the same dilemma, have opted for raising revenue, both through higher gas taxes and through more user charges like tolls and vehicle miles traveled taxes. Earlier this year, we estimated the economic impact of additional infrastructure spending and found that it really depends on how you pay for it: funding $500 billion of infrastructure spending with gas taxes or user fees increases GDP by 0.06 percent, while funding it with higher business taxes reduces GDP by 0.41 percent. Deficit-financing it boosts GDP by 0.11 percent, although that obviously has the larger impact on the budget deficit.

One last note on infrastructure, or at least the word itself. The word appeared in France in 1875 to describe railways and occasionally appeared in dictionaries afterward, but only gained common usage after World War II when NATO used the term to reference installations necessary for the defense of western Europe. Winston Churchill, then leader of the opposition to the 1945-51 Labour government, mocked the increasing use of the term as superfluous: “In this Debate, we have had the usual jargon about ‘the infrastructure of a supra-national authority.’ The original authorship is obscure; but it may well be that these words ‘infra’ and ‘supra’ have been introduced into our current parlance by the band of intellectual highbrows who are naturally anxious to impress British labour with the fact that they learned Latin at Winchester.” In D.C. parlance one rarely hears “infrastructure” without “our nation’s crumbling” preceding it. More kind is a mantra of Mark Zuckerberg’s: “move fast with stable infrastructure.”","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170114104028/Bridge_to_NowhereSan_Gabriel_Mountains_0.jpg,"['user', 'trumps', 'taxes', 'inside', 'trillion', 'funding', 'trump', 'projects', 'federal', 'billion', 'plans', 'infrastructure', 'look', 'spending']",

91,91,FL-2017-000108-BGD,Global network responds rapidly to fill critical gap following Sierra Leone mudslides - Sierra Leone - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/global-network-responds-rapidly-fill-critical-gap-following-sierra-leone,"Thousands of vulnerable people in dire need following mudslides in Sierra Leone are to begin receiving urgent help today, following the decision yesterday by a global network of NGOs to fund six rapid-response projects.

The Start Fund, designed to fill critical gaps by enabling aid agencies to respond early and fast to emergencies, has approved £355,262 of funding to six agencies and their partners working on the ground. The funding will be used to provide urgent assistance for thousands of the most vulnerable people who were affected when the mudslides hit communities already suffering from high levels of poverty, on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital.

The projects began implementing today and will include:

The provision of clean water to reduce the risk of outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera

Psychosocial support provided to people who are injured

Cash grants to enable the most vulnerable families to buy what they need

Work to prevent further harm and loss, reducing the risks of another potential landslide and if the flooding worsens

Agencies raised an emergency alert on Tuesday, when they decided that the Start Fund’s ability to respond within 72 hours was needed to meet the basic needs of people affected. Agencies agreed to activate the Start Fund on Wednesday and at a meeting held in Freetown on Thursday using a process of peer review, six projects were selected out of a possible nine.

Humanitarian staff from members of the Start Network, a global network of leading NGOs, met and selected projects led by CAFOD, Christian Aid, Tearfund, Handicap International, Care International and ActionAid. Those agencies are working around the clock with the local communities and partners to ensure live-saving responses reach the most vulnerable communities in Sierra Leone.

Following the crisis the country has appealed for international support, however funding in the international aid system often takes weeks to arrive. The Start Fund, which is managed by the Start Network, aims to fill gaps by providing funding quickly, within 72 hours of receiving a crisis alert.

Alessandra Gilotta, operations manager of the Start Fund said: “_It is critical to act now to help mitigate further deterioration of this devastating situation. In a country that is recovering from the effects of Ebola, we must act quickly to reduce the risk waterborne diseases such as cholera, while putting measures in place to mitigate further harm and loss if another landslide hits. Speed is everything to save lives when a crisis hits and the Start Fund is there to respond early and bridge the gap in funding we see all too often in humanitarian crises”._

The Start Fund, supported by British, Irish and Dutch governments and the European Commission, has responded to 122 crises in more than 50 countries since it began in 2014.

According to the circular, the rice import tariff was lowered from 10 percent to two percent. The move came a day after a cabinet committee meeting decided to cut the import duty to keep the rice price stable.

Chitta Majumder, a rice importer, said their cost of rice import from India would come down to Tk 35.50 to Tk 36 from Tk 38 to Tk 38.50 a kg under the new tax rate.

Prices of coarse rice would come down below Tk 40 per kg within two to three days due to a cascading effect of the tax cut, Chitta, proprietor of Majumder Traders, told The Daily Star yesterday.

The retail prices of coarse rice shot up to Tk 47-48 in June-July, a 47 percent increase from last year's price band of Tk 30-34. However, the prices later stabilised at Tk 43-45, according to data of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

The importer said they had been waiting for over a week on the announcement of the tax cut. He hoped rice prices would ease as about 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of rice would be imported in the next four or five days.

Flashfloods in six northeastern haor districts and fungal attacks (rice blast) in 19 others during the Boro season damaged about 20 lakh tonnes of rice crop earlier this year.

At least 20 northern districts and some others elsewhere in the country have been hit by flood in the last few days.

Against this backdrop, the cabinet committee meeting at the secretariat on Wednesday approved the government's decision to import 20 lakh tonnes of food grains -- 15 lakh tonnes of rice and 5 lakh tonnes of wheat -- in the current fiscal year. The revised import target is 11 lakh tonnes more than the government's earlier projected food import volume of 9 lakh tonnes.

Yesterday's duty cut was the second this year after the government in June had slashed the rice import duty to 10 percent from 28 percent.

Under the new duty structure, importers will have to pay only Tk 1.56 crore instead of Tk 7.82 crore in tariff for releasing 24,000 tonnes of rice stuck at several ports.

Chitta Majumder said 15 lakh tonnes of rice was being imported by the government. Local importers could bring the rice into Darshana, Khulna at quickest time, he told this correspondent.

The government has so far floated international tenders seeking to buy 3.5 tonnes of rice.

Local importers, said Chitta, had supplied rice to the government in 2009 promptly. If the government floated local tenders, the importers would have been able to import rice from India and reach it to government granaries, he added.

DELIVERY OF RICE BEGINS

Rice importers started clearing customs at Hili Land Port in Dinajpur's Hakimpur upazila yesterday. They also started unloading rice, imported from India, from trucks that reached the port 12 days ago.

Around 600 trucks carrying 18,000 tonnes of rice had been stranded at the port since August 5 when the importers stopped clearing customs in anticipation of a duty cut.

Rice was unloaded from 400 trucks yesterday, said Moshiur Rahman Mondal, assistant commissioner of customs at the port.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/imported_rice_1.jpg?itok=aaNSU-Ar,"['tk', 'brought', 'duty', 'yesterday', 'importers', 'port', 'tonnes', 'lakh', 'imported', 'cut', 'rice', 'import']",

Jute Corporation of India (JCI), a nodal agency of the central government, is looking to procure more than four lakh quintals of raw jute in 2017-18, a top official said on Thursday.

“During the last crop year 2016-17, the Corporation procured raw jute both under minimum support price and commercial operations to the tune of four lakh quintals. In the current year, hopefully the quantity would increase from last year,” corporation chairman and managing director KVR Murthy told reporters in Kolkata.

He said the central government announced minimum support price of Rs 3,500 (on the basis of TDN 3, a grade of raw jute) per quintal, up by Rs 300 a quintal from last year. However, the MSP varies with different grade of raw jute.

Murthy said that this year, procurement is expected to be better as the production of raw jute is set to be higher.

As per meeting of Jute Advisory Board, production of raw jute is estimated in the tune of 85 lakh bales along with a carry forward of 22 lakh bales and import of five lakh bales from Bangladesh.

Murthy, however, said the agency would procure raw jute having moisture content up to 18 per cent and it would not have interest for procuring raw jute with more than this.

“The procurement has started this year. We have found that raw jute available currently in the market has moisture content to the range of 26-40 per cent,” he said.

The corporation, which has its presence in jute growing states like Assam, Tripura, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, is also introducing direct payment to the farmers for their sale quantity.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/plugins/wonderm00ns-simple-facebook-open-graph-tags/fbimg.php?is_home=0&is_front_page=0&object_type=post&post_id=7716&object_id=7716&img=https%253A%252F%252Fthenewsmill.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2017%252F08%252Fjute-cultivation-in-Assam.jpg,"['procure', 'quintal', 'rs', 'corporation', 'jute', 'lakh', 'tune', 'quintals', 'support', 'bales', 'raw', 'expects']",
