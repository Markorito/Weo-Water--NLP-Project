Description of the disaster

Indonesia has high level of precipitation and is prone to flooding during rainy season. According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, areas prone to flooding in Indonesia are approximately 39,371,167 hectares. These areas are inhabited by approximately 100,814,666 people. Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (Indonesian: Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, abbreviated BMKG) predicted the peak of La Nina would occur across the months of December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina is coinciding with the peak of the rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The simultaneous occurrence of these two events has triggered heavy rainfall across the country. Since December 2020 PMI has responded to around 14 different flooding events across several provinces. The most recent event, which commenced on 15 January 2021, has resulted in flooding and landslides in several districts in South Kalimantan province including in Tapin, Hulu Sungai Tengah, Hulu Sungai Utara, Hulu Sungai Selatan, Tanah Laut, Tabalong, Banjar, Banjarbaru, Banjarmasin, Balangan, and Barito Kuala.

Through its disaster monitoring portal - InaRisk, Indonesia’ Disaster Monitoring Agency has listed 13 districts6 in South Kalimantan as moderate-risk and high-risk flood areas. Moreover, Indonesia’s BMKG has also issued flood warnings for the above-mentioned districts. All districts currently affected by flooding are included in the list.

Flooding in Banjar, 12 January 2021

On 12 January 2021, significant heavy rain, which started in the first week of January caused Martapura and Riam rivers to overflow, flooding seven sub-districts in Banjar. As of 19 January, seven sub-districts; Karang Intan, East Martapura, Martapura, Astambul, Sungai Pinang, Pengaron, and Tabuk River were inundated with water level ranging from 20 - 100cm.

Based on PMI Situation Report no. 7 dated 19 January 2021, PMI estimated that 27,368 housing units inundated, and 4 bridges have been destroyed. Approximately 30,778 families and 120,416 people are affected by the floods. Over 32,113 people have been evacuated to several temporary shelters that are using school buildings, village halls, mosques, and a football stadium.A more detailed information regarding current evacuation centres is still unavailable.

Flooding in Tanah Laut, 12 January 2021

In Tanah Laut, on 12 January 2021, heavy rainfall which started in the prior week caused severe flooding. In this region, the ongoing high tide further deteriorates the flooding situation. Flooding impacts nine sub-districts; Pelaihari, Bati-bati,

Kurau, Bumi Makmur, Tambang Ulang, Bajuin, Takisung, Jorong, and Kintap were affected. In some areas the water level reaches 150 - 200cm.

The impacts of flooding in Tanah Laut are severe. About 8,506 houses are inundated. Several public facilities such as schools, places of worship, hospitals, and markets have also been impacted. Several roads are also completely submerged in water, including the Trans Kalimantan Access Route. Approximately 8,870 families and 27,815 people are affected by the floods. There have been 10 reported fatalities as a result of being swept away by current and buried by landslide. So far, 13,062 people have sought safety in several temporary shelters. The displaced persons are taking shelter in school buildings and relatives’ homes.

Flooding in Tapin, 14 January 2021

Excessive rainfall on 14 January caused the flooding to spread to wider areas. Flooding in Tapin Regency was observed at 01:00 local time, occurred in Binuang sub-district, Raya Belanti Village. As of 16 January, 515 households and 1,492 people have been affected. As of 19 January, 328 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in Hulu Sungai Tengah, 14 January 2021

In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, flooding occurred on 13 January 2021, at 23.00 local time. Two sub-districts were inundated, namely Barabai and Hantakan. In some areas, the water level was reaching 200cm. As of 19 January 2021, 16,100 households and 64,400 people have been affected by the floods. There have been 3 reported fatalities in the district. Thus far, 11,200 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in other regions (Balangan, Banjarbaru,Hulu Selatan, and Hulu Sungai Utara), 14 January 2021 In Balangan district, floods occurred because of the overflowing of the Balangan and Pitap Rivers, affecting Tebing Tinggi sub-district (Mayanau Village, Gunung Batu, Sungsum, Ju'uh, Bumbu'an Simpang, Simpang Nadung and Tebing Tinggi), and Awayan sub-district (Putat Basiun Village, Awayan Market, Badalungga, Badalungga Hilir, Pulantan and Muara Jaya). In this district, 3,941 houses inundated and 6,235 families or 19,100 people have been affected.

In Banjarbaru, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed the Kemuning River. Flooding was observed at around 01:10 local time with a water level of 50 - 90cm. Two sub-districts affected are Kemuning Village (Banjarbaru sub-district) and Guntung Payung Village (Landasan Ulin sub-district). As of 19 January 2021, 2,116 households and 5,752 people have been affected by the flood. There has been one reported fatality.

Flooding also occurred in Hulu Sungai Selatan district, inundated six sub-districts: Loksado, Padang Batung,

Kandangan, Angkinang, Telaga Langsat and Sungai Raya, with water levels reaching 150cm. In this district, 1,000 housing units submerged in water, affecting about 3,138 families and 6,690 people. As of 19 January 2021, the water has receded.

In Hulu Sungai Utara, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed Balangan and Tabalong rivers, flooding 4 sub-districts. According to PMI’s situation report dated 19 January 2021, 7,865 households and 25,189 people have been affected by the flood. A total of 6,804 housing units were inundated.

As of 19 January 2021, in PMI’s targeted areas approximately 39,874 houses have been inundated. About 56,263 families and 214,123 people are affected by the floods. Indonesia’s meteorological agency has warned that heavy rainfall with thunderstorm and wind is still expected to occur over the next few days in almost all districts in South Kalimantan.

Although this flooding event is only impacting one province, it is impacting over 300,000 people and all districts within the province and has the potential to worsen further in the coming weeks as heavy rains continue. Furthermore, the flood response and evacuation efforts face considerable complications due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 also poses great risk in South Kalimantan since there have been a total of 16,505 cases detected in the province as of 15 January 2021, with 1,250 active cases.

Due to these complexities the disaster has been classified as a category orange.","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1552569-MDRID021do%20%281%29.png?itok=rUtHVyfT,"['2021', 'south', 'floods', 'water', 'subdistricts', 'indonesia', 'areas', 'kalimantan', '19', 'epoa', 'emergency', 'affected', 'hulu', 'sungai', 'inundated', 'flooding', 'plan', 'mdrid021', 'operation', 'dref']",

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than a dozen have been killed in recent days in flooding on Indonesia's Borneo island, officials said Sunday.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati said floods brought by intense rains caused floodwaters as high as 3 meters (10 feet).

As of Sunday, 39,549 people had been evacuated and at least 15 had been killed due to floods that affected 10 districts and cities in South Kalimantan province on Borneo island.

Separately, five people were killed and 500 others were evacuated after floods and landslides in Manado city in North Sulawesi province on Saturday. One other person was missing.

The data begs to differ - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/01/plantations-mines-south-kalimantan-indonesia-borneo-flood-environment-minister-denies/,"Indonesia’s environment minister claims deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines had nothing to do with a recent deadly flood in southern Borneo.

But the ministry’s own data, and statements by a senior minister, attribute the intensity of the flooding on the massive loss of forest cover across the Barito River’s watershed.

Environmental activists say the deforestation has compromised the natural function of the watershed to absorb the heavy rains that caused the Barito and its tributaries to overflow following heavy rains.

The coordinating minister for human development has called for a more sustainable management of natural resources in the region, warning against unbridled exploitation.

JAKARTA — The Indonesian government has denied that deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines contributed to a recent deadly flood in southern Borneo.

At least 21 people died and more than 256,000 were affected in what President Joko Widodo has called the worst flooding in South Kalimantan province in 50 years. Environmental activists say the massive loss of forest cover across the region exacerbated the disaster, compromising the natural function of the Barito River watershed to absorb the heavy rains that caused the river and its tributaries to overflow.

But Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar has denounced this as “misinformation,” saying the high volume of rain — nine times the average amount from Jan. 9-13 — was to blame for the disaster.

“There has been misinformation, especially [because] there’s a lot of invalid data deliberately pushed by some parties,” she wrote in Indonesian on Twitter on Jan. 20. “The cause of flooding in South Kalimantan [is] weather anomaly, and not about the size of forests in the Barito River’s watershed area in South Kalimantan.”

Yet her ministry’s own data, among other references, clearly show rapid deforestation in the river’s watershed. In the past three decades, the 1.8-million-hectare (4.4-million-acre) water catchment area in South Kalimantan lost nearly two-thirds of its natural forest, or an area three times the size of London, according to the data.

Other government sources show a similar trend. According to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN, an area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover.

Siti said that while the Barito’s catchment area has been largely deforested, the upstream areas still have significant forest cover.

“Using data from 2019, as much as 83.3% of the Barito’s watershed is covered with natural forests, and the rest of 1.3% is plantation forests,” she said. “In this case, the upstream area of the Barito River’s watershed is still well protected.”

Saparis Soedarjanto, the ministry’s director of watershed planning and management, said no amount of forest cover could help the region withstand the amount of rainfall that occurred there during that period, and that flooding was therefore inevitable.

“No matter how dense the forests are in the upstream area, if the hills are steep and the downstream area is flat, then [the region] will be inundated [when there are heavy rains],” Saparis said.

Lana Saria, the environmental director at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said mining activity in the region, for which large areas are deforested, makes a positive contribution to the forests.

“It in fact improves the capability of the watershed to become a water catchment area,” she said.

Not functioning well

A top government official, Muhadjir Effendy, the coordinating minister for human development and culture, has taken the opposite stance, saying the flood is evidence that the natural environment in South Kalimantan has become degraded to the point that it can no longer mitigate against natural phenomena like heavy rains.

If the environment were still in good condition, he said, then the extreme rainfall brought by the La Niña weather pattern would not have caused such severe floods.

Baharuddin, an oceanographer at Lambung Mangkurat University in South Kalimantan, backed this view, saying the rapid loss of forest cover in the watershed area contributed to the flooding. When the area was still largely forested, it could handle rainfall of as much as 4,000 millimeters (157 inches) per year, or nearly double the national average for Indonesia, Baharuddin said.

The environment ministry’s own data again supports this point.

“If we look at the environmental service of water management [of the Barito watershed], it’s not 100% functioning well, only 34.2%,” M.S. Karliansyah, the ministry’s head of environmental degradation mitigation and control, said in a televised interview. “Or 65.8% of it is problematic.”

Using data from the country’s geospatial agency, Baharuddin said it’s clear how the watershed area’s forested landscape has been altered beyond recognition by industrial expansion from 1997 to 2019.

“The latest data show the existence of mining activities and monoculture plantations, such as oil palm and rubber, and they’re quite massive and rapid in the Barito watershed,” he said. “Rainfall is the main trigger [of the floods], but land condition that has been deforested can’t be ignored.”

Coal mining concessions account for more than half a million hectares (1.2 million acres) of land throughout South Kalimantan, according to data from the environmental NGO Auriga Nusantara. Almost of all them lie in the Barito watershed, with four-fifths located in areas that serve as water catchment in the watershed.

“It means that almost all the mines in South Kalimantan are located in the upstream area of the Barito watershed, which functions as water catchment,” Auriga Nusantara data director Dedi Pratama Sukmara said as quoted by the Tempo newspaper.

These mines have left trail of destruction, with abandoned mining pits dotted throughout the watershed area, according to Karliansyah.

“We found former mining areas that haven’t been rehabilitated,” he said. “They contribute [to the environmental degradation] in the form of [river] sedimentation that is quite significant.”

Plantations have also come under the spotlight in the wake of the flood. Satellite imagery analysis shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres).

The Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020.

The environment ministry says most of the non-forested area in the Barito watershed comprises small-scale farms, not plantations.

Muhadjir said the unbridled exploitation of natural resources had damaged the environment in South Kalimantan and brought disasters like the recent flooding. He called for a more sustainable management of natural resources in the region.

“Let’s use nature wisely by fully calculating the benefits and the risks,” he said in a press release. “Don’t let the benefits turn out to be smaller than the risks. Don’t let [a few] reap too much benefits [from the environment], while others bear too high of a risk.”

Situation Updates

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts the peak of La Nina to occur in December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina coincides with the peak of rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The agency also states that this phenomenon could increase precipitation which triggers heavy rainfall across the country. During this period, Indonesia frequently suffers flood and landslides. As of January 14, 2021, several provinces in the country had reported floods and landslides since the beginning of the year.

Flooding in Lhokseumawe and Langsa, Aceh province, 4 January 2021

Excessive rainfall since Saturday, 2 January 2021, caused Kareung Pase river to overflow, flooding several areas in Lhokseumawe and Langsa. The flood had caused four sub-districts namely Blang Mangat, Banda Sakti, Muara Dua, and Muara Satu to be inundated with floodwater ranging from 60-70 cm. As a result, hundreds of people from 171 households were temporarily displaced. Flooding also inundated hundreds of houses in the affected areas. In Langsa, flooding inundated four sub-districts namely Langsa Barat, Langsa Lama, Langsa Baro, and Langsa Timur. Approximately 9,448 people who reside in the four sub-districts were affected. The flood has receded, however, several Langsa areas inundated again on 12 January 2021.

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts rain is still going to occur on 13-15 January 2021. The agency also categorizes several districts in the province —Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan,

Aceh Tenggara, and Gayo Lues— as high-risk flood areas. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation lists several districts in the province —Aceh Tamiang, Aceh Selatan, Aceh Timur, and Gayo Lues, and Nagan Raya— as high-risk landslides areas.","Sat, 16 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1551996-IBIDFL160121.png?itok=bm-NCobc,"['flooding', '2021', 'bulletin', 'flood', 'information', 'langsa', 'agency', 'province', 'aceh', 'areas', 'subdistricts', 'red', 'inundated', 'landslides', 'indonesia']",

An analysis by Indonesia’s space agency shows an area of forest twice the size of London was cleared in the past decade in the watershed area of the Barito River in South Kalimantan province.

During the same period, plantations spanning twice the size of Los Angeles have been established in the watershed area.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of licenses as well as rehabilitation of degraded areas in the region.

JAKARTA — Recent floods that inundated large areas of the southern part of Indonesian Borneo might have been exacerbated by massive deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines, activists say.

Heavy rains over the course of several days in early January battered the province of South Kalimantan, causing the Barito and other rivers to overflow. Floodwaters, in some areas as high as 3 meters (10 feet), forced the displacement of more than 112,000 people and claimed at least 21 lives. Nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) have been affected.

President Joko Widodo, during a visit to the affected district of Banjar, attributed the disaster to the heavy and sustained rainfall. But environmentalists say the rapid loss of forest in the region in recent decades contributed to the scale of the flooding.

An area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years, according to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover, while the watershed of another river in the province, the Maluka, has less than 1% of its forest cover remaining.

“It shows the carrying capacity of the forests in that region has drastically decreased,” Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Arie Rompas said.

Trees hold the soil in place, preventing erosion that results in heavy silting of rivers during rains. Silting makes rivers shallower, decreasing their water flow rate and making it more likely that they will overflow in the event of heavy rains.

The country’s disaster mitigation agency, the BNPB, has called for further studies to determine the cause of the South Kalimantan flooding.

“We also need to involve the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in [analyzing] the management of river areas and spatial planning,” BNPB disaster data, information and communications department head Raditya Jati said.

Palm oil

LAPAN analysis of satellite imagery shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito River’s watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres), according to LAPAN’s remote-sensing division head, Rokhis Khomarudin.

He said the analysis could provide an explanation of the possible cause of the recent flooding.

“We understand that plantations are related to the economy, but the environmental aspect has to be paid attention to,” Rokhis said.

However, the analysis hasn’t identified the type of the crops being cultivated in the area.

“Because the data is from mid-resolution satellite data, [we] haven’t been able to determine [whether the plantations are] oil palm or other plantations,” Rokhis said.

There’s conflicting data on the true extent of oil palm plantations in South Kalimantan. The Agriculture Ministry identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020. The Central Statistics Agency, BPS, lists 424,932 hectares (1.05 million acres) as of 2018.

Half of the plantation area, 227,791 hectares (562,884 acres), is owned or controlled by the 25 largest agribusiness conglomerates in Indonesia, according to a 2019 report by TuK Indonesia, an NGO that advocates for social justice in the agribusiness sector.

Among these conglomerates are Jardine Matheson Group, Triputra Group and Sinar Mas Group, which control 61,932 hectares (153,037 acres), 49,500 hectares (122,300 acres) and 48,741 hectares (120,442 acres) of oil palm concessions respectively, the report shows.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), the country’s largest green group, says it’s clear that South Kalimantan is in an ecological crisis driven by unbridled deforestation.

Half of South Kalimantan’s total area of 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) has been parceled off to the palm oil industry and the mining industry.

“Indeed, these floods are strongly suspected to be caused by the ecosystems that have lost their carrying capacity,” Walhi executive director Nur Hidayati said. “So when there is extreme weather, the carrying capacity collapses and causes disasters.”

Walhi South Kalimantan chapter head Kisworo Dwi Cahyono said the destruction of natural ecosystems in the upstream areas of the province’s rivers leads to flooding downstream.

“So this is [caused by] a disarray in the management of the environment and natural resources, and then the degradation of environmental carrying capacity,” he said.

Data from Global Forest Watch show that oil palm is not the only crop that might have contributed to deforestation in the region. In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, where 64,400 people were affected by the flooding, mixed fruit plantations occupy the largest span of plantation area, at 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres), while oil palms occupy only 200 hectares (500 acres).

In Banjar district, where floods displaced more than 51,000 people, rubber trees are the dominant crop, covering 38,500 hectares (95,100 acres), followed by oil palms at 27,900 hectares (68,900 acres).

But in Balangan district, where nearly 12,000 people have been displaced, mixed oil palm plantations cover the largest area, 19,800 hectares (48,900 acres).

While the dominant crops differ, all three districts have one thing in common: all have experienced massive deforestation. In 2000, lush natural forests in all three districts were still largely intact, occupying from 50% to 78% of the total area. By 2016, almost all of them were gone.

Mining

Besides oil palm plantations, environmentalists have also attributed the flooding to the proliferation of mines in the region. Walhi data show 814 coal mining pits left by 157 companies after they finished digging.

The Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) says there are 177 mining concessions dotted throughout the flooded districts.

According to data from the South Kalimantan provincial government, there were 13 coal companies with mining contracts and 160 firms with mining permits in the province as of 2013.

Combined, concessions for mining and oil palm plantations occupy half of South Kalimantan’s total area; 33% of the land falls under mining concessions and 17% under oil palm concessions, Walhi says.

“The biggest cause of deforestation in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo] right now is palm oil and coal,” Greenpeace Indonesia climate campaigner Hindun Mulaika said.

This is not the first time a major natural disaster in Indonesia has been linked to environmental destruction wrought by the plantation and the mining industries. In 2019, the hilly district of North Konawe on the island of Sulawesi was struck by floods that displaced thousands of people.

A report by the ombudsman of Southeast Sulawesi province said that “generally the cause [of the flooding] was land conversion for plantations, mining and illegal logging.” An analysis of the floods by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry cited “river silting” and “oil palm plantations” as among the causes of the disaster.

Extensive mining along North Konawe’s coast might also have been a factor. The mining exacerbated silting near the mouth of the Lasolo River, resulting in a “backwater effect” that intensified the flooding, the ministry’s report says.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of plantation and mining licenses in South Kalimantan as well as a moratorium on new mining permits in the wake of the recent floods.

“The current condition shows that the environmental carrying capacity [in South Kalimantan] is no longer capable [of mitigating disasters],” Hindun said.

Jatam campaign head Melky Nahar said it’s also important for the government to enforce the law by revoking mining and plantation permits in areas that play a crucial role in protecting the environment and the people who live there. He added the government should also start rehabilitating degraded areas in South Kalimantan.

“Without that, similar incidents will happen again [in the future] and we will listen to [rhetorical] statements from President Joko Widodo again,” Melky said.

Jefri Raharja, a campaigner at Walhi South Kalimantan, said the widespread deforestation in the region has also exacerbated global climate change.

“Kalimantan was once proud of its forests, but now the forests have been replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations and coal mines,” he said.

Based on the results of coordination with the local BPBD on January 16, 2021, the Human Initiative was directed to assist disaster management in Hantakan sub district, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency.

Initiated by disaster management support in this area, sequential disaster management is very important. Because when the Human Initiative team was there, the local residents were still not properly coordinated in the flow of disaster management, starting from data collection on affected residents, affected houses, Human Initative also provided direction and input.

Hantakan District has 12 villages, with 7 affected villages and 2 isolated villages because the bridge was disconnected The number of population is 122,689 in 12 villages, consisting of 6,424 men and 6,265 women, with around 1800 families affected. It was recorded that the number of houses affected by the flood were around 1,363 including heavily damaged houses, missing houses, and slightly damaged houses. The most heavily damaged houses are at Alat village with 284 families, Hantakan village with 221 families, and Batu Tunggal village with 137 families.

The Human Initiative volunteer team is still on guard since 16 to 21 January 2021. At present the team is staying at aHsntakan Village, Hantakan Subdistrict. The Human Initiative post is at coordinates 2 ° 38'22.0 ""S 115 ° 27'17.8"" e, a quite strategic location to reach villages located in the watershed of Hantakan sub district. Human Initiative continues to coordinate with the local government, and conduct field assessments, logistics distribution, to basic health services.

On 19/1/21 the assistance started to enter the village, but there are still some areas that are quite far away and are still difficult to get logistical access and other assistance. With a distance of 7 km to 19 km, the location of the newly isolated village can be accessed. With this condition, the field team is still conducting further assessment on the isolated village as the 4-wheeled vehicles cannot reach 2 isolated villages.

The village still has difficulties to have clean water facilities. The residents still rely on rivers around them for public toilets and daily water consumption. On the other hand in health facilities, the Community Health Center (Puskesmas) at the village is located relatively far away from the village, and until.now there has not been any health service provided at the village.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1552766-04-Sitrep-4-Banjir-KalSel-English-Version.png?itok=FUD9GpXh,"['2021', 'houses', 'south', 'initiative', 'kalimantan', 'floods', 'human', 'village', 'disaster', 'villages', '21', 'regency', 'sitrep', 'hulu', 'sungai', 'indonesia']",

Earthquake death toll climbs

On Sunday, the death toll from a 6.2-magnitude earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi island rose to 84, as rescue workers continued the search for survivors trapped in rubble while aftershocks rattled the island.

Seventy-three people died in Friday's quake in the city of Mamuju, to the north of the epicenter, while another 11 were killed in Majene, a city about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mamuju. Thousands of residents fled their homes to seek safety, but many are still trapped under collapsed buildings, according to local search and rescue teams.

At least 253 people were seriously hurt and another 679 suffered minor injuries, said Raditya Jati, from Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management. The quake also triggered a power outage and caused three landslides along the main road connecting Majene and Mamuju.

The quake has created an additional headache for a nation already battling a serious coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia has reported at least 907,929 Covid-19 cases and nearly 26,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The head of Indonesia's disaster management agency, Doni Monardo, said Sunday that rapid antigen test kits were being provided to evacuation centers to check and trace for potential Covid-19 transmission among the 19,435 people displaced by the earthquake.

""Later there will be an antigen swab process, to ensure that refugees are not exposed to Covid-19,"" Doni said. He added that displacement centers have been asked to separate vulnerable groups from young people to prevent the virus spreading.

Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency cautioned that aftershocks could still occur and urged those living in hilly areas to be aware of landslides. People living near the coast were also warned to stay away from the beach in case of tsunamis.

Meanwhile, rescue teams were continuing to free people trapped under collapsed buildings in multiple locations across Mamuju -- including two hotels and a hospital. ""People are reporting that their family members are trapped under collapsed houses and asking for our help,"" Ariyanto Ardi, section head of the local disaster management department, told CNN on Saturday.

""We still have no details how many people are buried under those flattened buildings,"" he added.

In this picture taken on January 16, 2021, lava is seen during an eruption of Mount Semeru in Lumajang, East Java.

Straddling the so-called Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" Indonesia -- a nation of high tectonic activity -- is regularly hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2018, a 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands of people.

Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano, began erupting again on January 4. Since then, 500 people living on or close to its fertile slopes have been evacuated, according to the local Disaster Management of Magelang District.

On Monday, Merapi continued to spew lava as hot clouds and ash rose 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) into the air, according to the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. The agency said six lava flows could be seen, descending 600 meters down its southwestern slope.

Also on Java Island, Indonesia's highest volcano Mount Semeru began spewing lava, ash and smoke on Saturday.

Flooding and landslides

Floods brought on by heavy rain in South Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo this week have killed at least 15 people and displaced more than 100,000.

Waters as high as 1.5 meters (5 feet) inundated more than 20,000 homes across 10 districts in the province, according to Raditya from the disaster management agency.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the flood-hit areas on Monday as rescue teams distributed aid including food, tarpaulins and blankets, to those in need.

Separately, at least six people were killed in flooding and landslides in Manado City, in North Sulawesi on Saturday.

Rescuers evacuate people from a flooded residential area in Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan, Borneo Island, on 17 January 2021.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warned that more rain could follow, saying the region was in the middle of the rainy season, which will last until February.

Meanwhile, rescue workers continue to search through mud and debris for victims 10 days after a landslide, brought on by heavy rains and unstable soil conditions, tore through Cihanjuang village in West Java province. On Monday, four bodies were pulled from the mud, raising the death toll to 33. Rescue workers are searching for four people still missing, according to the West Java Search and Rescue Agency.

Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands, often suffers floods and landslides, particularly during the rainy season from November to March. In December 2019 and January 2020, severe flooding in Jakarta triggered by the worst rainfall on record, left swaths of the capital underwater and affected more than 400,000 people.

Experts have voiced concern that such extreme weather could become a new norm due to the climate crisis.

Rescue teams search for victims buried by the landslides in Cihanjuang Village, West Java.

Sriwijaya Air crash

In another disaster that rocked the Southeast Asian nation, divers continue their search of the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air flight 182 while authorities push on in their investigation into the cause of the crash.

On Friday, search teams located the plane's cockpit voice recorder but the memory unit was not with the case, Soerjanto Tjahjono, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee, told CNN.

Despite the missing crash memory unit, Soerjanto said they believed they would still be able to retrieve data.

The flight data recorder of Sriwijaya Air flight 182 retrieved from the Java Sea where the passenger jet crashed on January 12, 2021.

Also on Friday, the committee successfully downloaded information contained in the recovered flight data recorder, which was found by divers and a remotely operated underwater vehicle last week.

""There are 330 parameters and all are in good condition. We are currently studying it,"" Soerjanto said.

The findings from the flight data recorder data have so far confirmed earlier reports that the two engines were still operating when the plane hit the water.

Efforts to find and identify those who perished on board also continue. On Sunday, divers retrieved 10 bags of human remains as well as pieces and debris from the plane itself.","Mon, 18 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210118003347-04-indonesia-disasters-earthquake-floods-intl-hnk-restricted-super-tease.jpg,"['flooding', 'fallout', 'crash', 'search', 'sriwijaya', '27', 'air', 'rescue', 'photos', 'mamuju', 'collapsed', 'hide', 'caption', 'grapples', 'landslides', 'building', 'earthquake', 'indonesia']",

The South Kalimantan administration has declared a state of emergency as flooding in multiple regencies has forced more than 20,000 people to flee their homes.

Heavy rainfall has drenched the province since Jan. 3, causing rivers in the regencies of Tanah Laut and Balangan to overflow. These areas were the most affected by flooding.

A river in Palaihari, Tanah Laut, rose 2 meters above typical levels, submerging at least 6,346 houses in the two regencies.

According to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), at least 21,990 residents of Tanah Laut have been displaced because of the floods. They are being accommodated at five shelters across the regency.

The floodwaters cut off the road between Palaihari district and the provincial capital of Banjarmasin.","Sat, 16 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/01/16/2021_01_16_109924_1610790841._large.jpg,"['flooding', 'displaces', 'state', 'submerging', 'south', 'tanah', 'whatsappfacebooktwitterlinkedin', 'kalimantan', 'jakarta', 's', 'emergency', 'declares', 'regencies', 'laut', 'palaihari', '20000', 'typical']",

JAKARTA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Three people died and one was missing in the floods that have submerged eight sub-districts in Manado City, North Sulawesi province, according to a local official on Saturday.

Head of the Manado City Disaster Management Agency Donald Sambuaga said that the eight subdistricts are Malalayang, Wanea, Sario, Paal Dua, Pikkala, Wenang, Tuminting, and Singkil.

""Rains with high intensity since Friday have caused the Sawangan and Tondano rivers, which run through Manado City, to overflow,"" Sambuaga said.

Floods as high as 50 to 400 centimeters also caused landslides in several points.

Currently, officers are still evacuating residents and calculating the number of material losses.

South Kalimantan on Borneo island declared a state of emergency last week, after heavy rainfall and flooding since the start of the year displaced tens of thousands of people.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the worst-hit areas on Monday.

Yuyun Harmono, climate justice campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI), said the floods are “an indication that the government should have more ambition in their climate policies.”

The archipelago is already suffering the impacts of rising global temperatures, with its cities and coastal areas hit by regular flooding and rising sea levels.

“Indonesia is one of the countries that is very vulnerable to the climate crisis,” said Adila Isfandiari, climate and energy researcher at Greenpeace Indonesia.

“It is rooted in the position of the government that prioritizes economic growth over the environment,” she said.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, Indonesia — among the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters — committed to cut its emissions by 29% by 2030 versus business-as-usual levels, a target it said could rise to 41% with international support.

Earlier this month, a climate official at Indonesia’s environment and forestry ministry told the Antara news agency the country would not increase its emissions reduction goals further in an updated climate action plan due to be submitted ahead of a U.N. climate summit in November, as nations are expected to do.

Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, director general of climate change control, said Indonesia would instead focus on implementation and steps to meet its existing commitments.

Home to the world’s third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is the biggest global producer of palm oil and a major source of timber, which many green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations.

According to analysis by research coalition Climate Action Tracker, Indonesia’s current climate policies are “highly insufficient” and emissions are still climbing.

Indonesia was one of only five countries that started new coal-power plant construction in 2020, it noted.

“The government must introduce policy to reduce total emissions in order to meet the Paris climate goals, but the emissions in Indonesia are on an upwards trajectory,” said Sisilia Nurmala Dewi, Indonesia team leader at climate campaign group 350.org.

The government has, nonetheless, worked in recent years to stop illegal logging, protect its carbon-storing forests and meet its international pledges to tackle climate change.

Besides introducing a moratorium on new forest clearance, in the past five years it has allocated on average nearly 90 trillion rupiah ($6.4 billion) per year to tackle climate change, although that dropped to around 80 trillion rupiah in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

New laws to cut red tape and boost investment and mining, introduced last year, were criticized by environmentalists who said they would fuel more forest-clearing and fires.

WALHI’s Harmono called on the government to stop issuing new permits for coal mining, ban coal-power plants, cease oil exploration and prepare green energy transition policies for the next 10-15 years that prioritise renewables.

Early 2021 was one of the most hectic months in recent times for natural disasters in Indonesia, with earthquakes hitting West Sulawesi, (Mamuju and Majene), floods in South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi (Manado and its surrounding areas) and landslides in Sumedang, West Java.

The disasters taking place in several areas almost at the same time caused damage to public infrastructure and forced people to flee from their homes, exacerbating the unfavorable situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such disaster victims are in dire need of assistance.

In response to the disasters, PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) continually provides aid to the victims of natural disasters.

BRI Group, whose subsidiaries include BRI Agro, BRI Syariah, BRI Life, BRI Finance, BRI Insurance, BRI Danareksa Sekuritas, BRI Ventures, BRI Remittance, YBM BRI and PT Prima Karya Sarana Sejahtera (PKSS), has played an active role in providing aid to disaster-affected communities.

The actions that BRI Group has taken constitute the group’s caring and sincere endeavors to help the people and the country to arise and recover from the difficult times.

BRI corporate secretary Aestika Oryza Gunarto expressed a deep concern over the various disasters and said that BRI would continue to actively participate in helping the victims.

“BRI will continue to collaborate and coordinate with various parties to build a synergy in distributing the aid to the victims of the earthquakes in Majene and Mamuju, floods in several areas in South Kalimantan, in Kota Manado and its surrounding areas [North Sulawesi] and the landslides in Sumedang, West Java. This is a corporate endeavor to help relieve the burden of the people and accelerate the recovery [of the victims] in the post-disaster,” Aestika said.

. (./.)

BRI’s people engagement

The disasters have led to restricted transportation access and many people fleeing, which prompted employees of BRI Group in West Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi to go on site to directly engage in distributing thousands of ready-to-eat food packages to the victims.

The thousands of distributed food packages were the early phase of aid, especially in the first several days after the disasters, in which the ready-to-eat food packages were desperately needed by the affected residents.

“Ready-to-eat foods are highly needed because an adequate number of public kitchens and emergency facilities are not available yet and besides, the electricity is cut off, leading to power outages. In distributing [the food packages], we engaged BRI Group people by adhering to the health protocols and keeping the victims safe,” said Aestika.

After rapidly distributing thousands of the food packages to victims of the disaster in the wake of the earthquakes in West Sulawesi and the floods in South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi, BRI also channeled natural disaster emergency response aid in the form of staple food packages, blankets, tents, medicines and other evacuation needs to the victims.

For the landslide victims in Cimanggung, Sumedang, West Java, BRI also distributed staple food packages and medicines. To accelerate the distribution of the aid from BRI Group, and also to improve the service to the victims and the refugees affected by the disaster, BRI Group built BRI Peduli posts in South Sulawesi (Mamuju and Majene).

. (./.)

Meanwhile in West Kalimantan and North Sulawesi, BRI group set up synergy with other state-owned enterprises (BUMN) and other relevant parties through the formation of BUMN Disaster Taskforce Teams in the respective areas.

“We continue to build synergy with local provincial administrations and other state-owned enterprises to work hand-in-hand to help alleviate the burden of the people affected by the earthquakes,” Aestika added.

In several areas where transportation access and infrastructure/facilities are severely affected by the disaster, BRI keeps operating and providing services in a normal manner.

BRI also provides mobile serves like E-Buzz and Mobile BRI Teras in particular areas that need banking services. Apart from that, the public can also still make transactions normally through BRI e-channels, such as ATMs and CRMs up to BRILink agents. Even in a number of affected areas, BRI is the only bank that provides service for the public.

Kisworo said that the area's Walhi branch office had repeatedly warned about South Kalimantan’s emergency regarding land mass and potential ecological disasters.

“South Kalimantan stretches 3.7 million hectares that has 13 regencies and cities, but is burdened by 50 percent mining permits, 33 percent are palm oil fields,” Kisworo asserted on Sunday, January 17.

He explained that it leaves only 17 percent without South Kalimantan’s land masses free from any industrial or business land-use permits. The majority of areas are facing impending ecological disasters as the disastrous flooding that hit the region had been predicted by the BMKG weather forecasts all along.

To prevent similar natural disasters from ruining Kalimantan in the future, the Walhi executive called for the government to evaluate and rethink issuing permits for extractive industries, stopping newly granted permits, and better enforcement of the law on environmental blighters in preventing another future ecological disaster.

“The government is yet again ill-prepared. The people are once again who must bear the consequences,” said Kisworo.

The waves, along with the massive floods and landslides, claimed the lives of six people, causing some 40,000 people to be evacuated.

The tragedy struck following heavy rain on January 16, 2021.

Dramatic.

Many have taken to social media to show just how scary the entire incident was.

One video on Instagram reveals how the massive waves hit a coast, causing people fleeing for their lives.

Here's what caused the tidal waves.

According to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), the 4 meter high waves were caused due to low air pressure over the Celebes Sea located north of the city.

The unusually strong winds also caused the extreme weather.

BKMG has urged people to remain cautious as the area is set to experience tumultuous weather conditions with possibly even higher waves.

“We have acknowledged the flood mitigation. We have implemented various flood handling programs,” said Riza after inspecting the implementation of health protocols at Ciputra Mall, South Jakarta, Wednesday, Jan. 13.

Several programs carried out by the government to prevent flooding include building vertical drainage systems, normalizing lakes and rivers, and preparing water pumps.

Riza said that flooding in Jakarta could be caused by heavy rain, high sea tides, or heavy downpour from upland areas such as Depok and Bogor flowing to the city areas. “So we have to deal with it comprehensively along with other regions and the central government.”

BMKG predicted that the peak of the rainy season would occur in January and February 2021. ""Most parts of Indonesia or 94 percent of the 342 seasonal zones have now entered the rainy season,"" said the agency head Dwikorita Karnawati in a written statement.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) is pushing for COVID-19 safety compliance during disaster response and among people taking shelter following a string of fatal disasters that struck several regions across the archipelago over the last two weeks.

Agency spokesperson Raditya said health protocols would continue to be enforced amid the ongoing emergency in the wake of earthquakes in West Sulawesi, major flooding in South Kalimantan and deadly landslides in West Java.

“All health protocols must be implemented,” he told an online press conference on Sunday.

Raditya went on to say that a joint team comprising his office, the Health Ministry and local health agencies had committed to providing the provisions and amenities required to maintain health and safety among evacuees.

29,29,FL-2021-000004-IDN,How can Indonesia break its vicious cycle of cheap imports? - World Economic Forum,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/indonesia-local-entrepreneurs-small-medium-business/,"Pak Iyus is a hijab producer in Bandung, Indonesia. At the height of his business between 2015 and 2017, he was able to produce 150,000 garments per day; however, his production has declined by 80%, resulting in a massive reduction in income for his employees. His change in fortunes comes as a by-product of imports flooding the market, sometimes illegally. According to officials at Tanah Abang wholesale market in Jakarta, the biggest in south-east Asia, the share of local products sold there has reduced from 80% in the early 2000s to 50% now.

Trade practices affect people like Pak Iyus disproportionately; big fluctuations in sales correspond closely with the amount of imported products circulating in the market. He has also noticed that foreign manufacturers observe which products in Indonesia are in high demand, and within six months, flood the market with similar but cheaper products. To compete, he must then come up with a new winning product to increase his sales, and when that happens he only has up to six months to capitalize. He accepts that his global counterparts use market intelligence to gain an unfair advantage to shorten his winning product life-cycle, yet he has no strategic plan to respond. Because of the limited time to capitalize on any investment or innovation, he is very reluctant to expand his business.

This process is the start of a vicious cycle typical among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia: cheaper imported products on the market result in SMEs’ reluctance to invest into medium- to long-term initiatives, which in turn results in low productivity and production inefficiency (limiting growth) and makes them unable to compete with global players. This vicious cycle at SME level creates another, smaller, vicious cycle for the individual employee: Low productivity of the SME decreases household income, which in turn results in a reduction of spending by the household for their children’s education, creating more low-skilled workers who later on will rely heavily on SMEs to provide income.

The current system discourages small Indonesian businesses from investing in growth. Image: Evermos

Moreover, imports also have a real impact in terms of loss of potential earnings to the community. One container of hijab imports typically has 250,000-450,000 hijabs per container. To produce 150,000 hijabs a month, Pak Iyus employed a network of 3,600 households across the city. The total income for each household was $235, equal to three times the minimum wage. Because of declining production because of imports, the potential total loss of earnings to the community is $678,000 a month. In the meantime, one container is taxed by the government between $44,000-93,000. When we buy local, the circulation of money is faster and can be used more efficiently to keep the local economy alive.

Without local consumption of local products, SMEs will lose more and more in competition with the global value chain. Even though a survey of local customer preferences shows preferability of local brands over foreign brands for clothing products, in reality it does not automatically translate into higher sales for local producers. Yet there is so much at stake when customers don’t buy local. SMEs make up 97% of employment in Indonesia, absorbing the majority of the country’s low-skilled workers. They also contribute 60% of Indonesia’s GDP, and have resulted in mass-scale improvement of the quality of life, and elevated millions out of poverty. The opportunities of extending the benefit of local production are immense because Indonesia has a large, growing market hungry for greater quantities and varieties of products. But we have not yet been able to translate this into a prosperous reality.

Change can come at one or many points Image: Evermos

The current question is: How can we break the vicious cycle that many Indonesians are in? It works like a continuous chain and to break it, we must focus on single parts of the chain by doing one or all of the following:

1. Go local or go home. Inspire Indonesians to buy local products even when there are other cheaper alternative products

2. Invest for the long run. Stimulate SMEs to invest in medium- to long-term initiatives despite getting bombarded by global products

3. Productivity as the engine of growth. Focus on skills training and technology adoption to drive productivity up

4. Defense is the best offense. Create a local ecosystem with effective trade policies that can protect SMEs and employ a more data-driven, market intelligent approach

A reformed system could lead to higher productivity and profits. Image: Evermos

If we can successfully break any part of the chain, we would kickstart a virtuous cycle where Indonesian products are desirable, and in which SMEs would be more willing to invest in medium- and long-term growth. This would result in higher productivity, efficiency and profit and in turn make local products can compete with global products. Another approach is to have a giant leap by breaking the cycle of our heavy reliance on SMEs and focusing on improving our skilled workforce, converting them from low-skill to high-skill workers.

JAKARTA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Most of Indonesia's territories have entered the peak of the rainy season, the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said on Wednesday.

""Currently, 94 percent of the 342 zones in Indonesia have entered the peak of extreme weather,"" the agency's head Dwikorita Karnawati said.

Areas that have entered the peak of the rainy season are mainly those in Java, Bali, South Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara.

The agency estimated that the peak will occur from January to February.

Karnawati said that the extreme weather in Indonesia happens due to the strengthening of the Asian monsoon which could be accompanied by cross-equatorial wind flows in the Karimata Strait.

The extreme weather, Karnawati continued, also occurred due to the tropical equatorial atmosphere waves including Madden-Julian Oscillation waves, Rossby waves, and cyclonic circulation in southern Indonesia and northern Australia.

""Extreme weather can cause hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, flash floods, landslides, high waves that can endanger shipping, and aviation (activities),"" added Karnawati.

The agency also predicted four to six meters high waves in the Natuna waters, Riau Islands province.

There is also the potential for the formation of Cumulonimbus clouds that could endanger aviation activities. Enditem","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['season', 'rainy', 'waves', 'enter', 'weather', 'xinhua', 'peak', 'extreme', 'agency', 'entered', 'indonesias', 'indonesia', 'territories']",

The miners produce thermal coal with calorific values from 3,000-5,200 kcal/kg NAR, the sources said.

""The flood has slowed down the production of coal, creating delay to some shipments,"" a South Kalimantan miner said. ""We have stopped offering to the market amid tightening supply.""

Miners in East Kalimantan were also experiencing loading delays and slower production, with Multi Hara Utama and Insani Baraperkasahas having declared force majeure on Jan. 5 and Jan. 17, respectively, sources said.

That has led to expectations of a supply crunch, buoying the Indonesian coal market at a time of solid demand from China.

Linkedin Patrick Galey (Agence France-Presse) Paris ● Sun, January 17, 2021 19:33 135 0920e6703081f028872405a5260c2e9d 2 World climate-change,environment,UN,adaptation,agriculture Free

The world is falling short of promises made under the Paris climate deal to help the most vulnerable nations deal with the increasingly devastating impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations.

Adaptation -- reducing the fallout among communities and increasing their capacity to deal with climate-related disasters such as floods and drought -- is a pillar of the landmark 2015 accord, which aims to chart a path away from catastrophic warming.

The deal requires signatories to implement adaptation measures through national planning, but also through funding to at-risk countries.

The UN Environment Programme Adaptation Gap report found that the current finance levels of around $30 billion annually for adaptation fell far short of the annual cost in developing nations of $70 billion.

It said the true cost of adapting to climate impacts in these nations could be as high as $300 billion every year by the end of the decade and $500 billion by mid-century.

""The hard truth is that climate change is upon us,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.

""Its impacts will intensify and hit vulnerable countries and communities the hardest -- even if we meet the Paris Agreement goals of holding global warming this century to well below 2C.""

UNEP called for a drastic scale-up of public and private finance for adaptation, as well as increased investment in nature-based solutions such as protecting and sustainably restoring ecosystems.

With just over 1C of warming since the start of the industrial era, Earth is already experiencing more intense and frequent extreme weather such as droughts and flooding, as well as storms supercharged by rising seas.

Much of the devastation wrought by climate-linked disasters falls on developing nations, and despite promises to help out financially, richer countries still aren't hitting their adaptation funding targets.

UNEP said funding for adaptation currently represented just five percent of all climate finance.

With the cost of natural disasters set to skyrocket this century, hard-hit nations are finding it difficult to secure the finance to rebuild after extreme events.

Mozambique, which was battered by twin cyclones in early 2019, said that one year since the disasters it had received less than a quarter of the estimated $3 billion it needed to recover.

The UN report found that cutting greenhouse gas emissions will provide a long-term economic benefit by reducing the costs associated with climate change.

Achieving the 2C Paris Agreement temperature rise limit could curb losses in annual growth to 1.6 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for 3C of warming -- the current trajectory if nations' current Paris pledges are upheld.

Under the deal's ""ratchet"" mechanism, countries are supposed to file new emissions reduction plans -- known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs -- every five years.

The deadline for the first round of new NDC submissions was December 31, 2020. However just 71 countries representing under a third of global emissions have done so.

UNEP says global emissions must fall 7.6 percent annually this decade to keep the more ambitious Paris temperature target of 1.5C in play.","Sun, 17 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/09/25/2020_09_25_104834_1601026456._large.jpg,"['climate', 'nations', 'deal', 'paris', 'fund', 'emissions', 'disasters', 'adaptation', 'countries', 'failing', 'billion', 'warming']",

""We look forward to expanding imports from Indonesia and the Chinese investments in Indonesia so that we could bring about more healthy and balanced growth of trade between our two countries,"" visiting State Councillor Wang Yi said in a joint statement with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi.

China is Indonesia's biggest trade partner and an important source of investment, but the large trade deficit with China has often been a source of concern in Indonesia.

The deficit shrunk considerably between January to November 2020, falling to $7 billion from $15.4 billion in the same period in 2019, as Indonesia's demand for imported products plunged amid a coronavirus epidemic and its first recession in 22 years.

Indonesian minister Retno urged China to remove trade barriers for the country's top products, such as palm oil, fisheries, fruits and bird's nest, as a way to address the trade imbalance.

""Efforts should be made to pursue an improving and more balanced trade,"" she said.

Retno said Indonesia also agreed to a Chinese study over the Lambakan dam project in East Kalimantan. The dam is one of Indonesia's main projects to control floods and is worth around $400 million, according to local media reports.

Wang did not mention the dam, but said China and Indonesia should have synergy with their respective infrastructure programmes - the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Maritime Fulcrum programme.

Wang also said he supported Indonesia's plan to become a regional hub for the production of vaccines.

The government is aiming at vaccinating two-thirds of the population to reach herd immunity, and Mr Widodo has set a deadline of 15 months for the programme to be completed.

But the sheer size of the population and its geographical extent - with 270 million citizens spreading across more than 17,000 islands - make the vaccination task a very challenging one.

Logistics aside, feedback from the ground also highlighted data mismatch error and vaccine scepticism, the latter of which is blamed on the lack of effective policy communication on the government's part.



Indonesia said it has secured more than 300 million doses of vaccines from various producers, and has so far received 3 million ready-to-use vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech and raw materials to produce 15 million doses of vaccines.

This Chinese-made vaccine works by using inactivated viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus. The jab must be stored in a cooler with a temperature of 2 to 8 degree Celsius and the vaccine requires two doses to be effective.

Indonesia has also said that it has secured 50 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech, which require storage at minus 70 Celsius.



According to the government's plan, about 1.48 million health workers are first in line to receive the jab produced by China’s Sinovac Biotech.

Out of the total, 560,000 health workers in about 90 provincial capitals and regencies are expected to be vaccinated this month, while the remaining 900,000 are scheduled to receive the jab in February.

About 17.4 million public officers in the high-risk category will be next in line, followed by 21.5 million elderly in April and then workers between 18 and 59 years old. In total, more than 180 million people will be vaccinated.



For the initial rounds of inoculation, the government has distributed 1.2 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac to around 90 provincial capitals and regencies.



While the first week of vaccination has gone relatively smoothly, Dr Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia warned that many challenges lie ahead.

“When the vaccination enters the phase for the general population, then obstacles will appear,” he said.



LOGISTICAL HURDLE TO BE ANTICIPATED

Logistics will be a major issue in vaccinating the general public, experts have pointed out.



Dr Riono said currently, only a small number of vaccines are sent to be distributed in areas that are more developed, so the problem is not apparent yet.



“But later, once the general population needs to be inoculated, a massive storage and distribution system is needed. We can’t use the existing distribution system,” he said.

Mr Yanuar Nugroho, a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, expressed concern that the programme would not run smoothly in areas where healthcare infrastructure and supporting infrastructure such as cold chain and storage are not readily available.

“For example, (there are) health centres where electricity is still limited. Vaccines need a refrigerator. (There are also) areas where health workers are not distributed evenly,"" he said.



Mr Nugroho, who is also the former deputy chief of staff to the president in Mr Widodo’s first term, suggested the government to work together with the private sector on the distribution and storage of the vaccines.



Dr Riono believed this could be a solution, but stressed that valid and reliable data is needed or it would not work.



DATA DISCREPANCIES

While it has been reported in local media that the vaccination is running smoothly in capital Jakarta and Bali’s capital Denpasar, there are places that are grappling with data discrepancies.



Mr Edward Sihotang, the health department secretary in Papua's Jayapura regency, said about 1,300 health workers are expected to be vaccinated and they have already received 2,730 doses of vaccine.

Empty vials of the Sinovac's vaccine are seen inside a dustbin at a district health facility as Indonesia drives mass vaccination for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Jakarta, Indonesia, January 19, 2021. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan

However, only about 400 health workers are listed on the government app used for the vaccination programme.

Mr Sihotang believed that this happened because the data has not been updated.

“In my opinion, actually, if we encourage the relevant parties to input their data accurately, there won't be any problem. It's just because everything is rushed, it’s not satisfactory,"" he told CNA.

He said the solution is for the health workers to proactively register themselves if they are not listed in the database.

Meanwhile, in North Kalimantan province, secretary of the provincial health department Andarias Baso told CNA they have a vaccine oversupply because there are health workers who cannot be vaccinated due to their health conditions, which have not been reflected in the database.



In response, the government’s spokeswoman for COVID-19 handling and vaccination Siti Nadia Tarmizi told CNA that overall the vaccination has been smooth. However, she acknowledged there have been some minor shortcomings.

""We have a few obstacles related to the registration process which we previously did with the application PeduliLindungi. There were a few problems, also related to the recording and reporting system.

""They are still not well connected, so there are still little hiccups in the vaccination process but we have anticipated this,"" she said.

To overcome this issue, the government has asked all health workers, regardless of whether they have received an electronic ticket or not, to go to their respective health facilities to get vaccinated, she said.

Mdm Tarmizi added that the vaccination programme is on hold for now in regions which are currently dealing with disasters, such as West Sulawesi which is grappling with the aftermath of a quake and South Kalimantan with floods.

However, Dr Riono, the epidemiologist, said the mismatch in data is hindering the speed of the vaccination programme.

“This can’t be tolerated. Why? Because we knew since a long time ago that the medical workers are first in line. But the database has never been fixed,” he said.



VACCINE FEARS NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED

Even though the vaccination programme has kicked off officially, there are health workers who remain wary of the effectiveness of the new vaccines.

Indonesia's late-stage clinical trial on the Sinovac vaccine showed an efficacy of 65.3 per cent but some medical staff are not convinced. Some are also cautious of the side effects.

The hoaxes that have been circulating on social media do not help either.

In Indonesia’s westernmost province Aceh, Dr Edi Gunawan, the director of regional public health facility Dr Zubir Mahmud Hospital, told CNA there have been mixed responses among his staff.

“There are those who prefer to believe in hoax ... But I keep guiding them, including how to respond (to hoax),” he said.



The hospital's health workers are scheduled to receive the jabs in February and Dr Gunawan is currently focusing on counselling them and assuring them that they should not be afraid of the vaccine.



In January alone, the West Java provincial government's team of ""hoax busters"" has debunked 51 hoaxes on COVID-19 vaccination.



Among the hoaxes included chips being implanted in the vaccine doses, and claims of the vaccines being non-halal and dangerous.

Senior fact-checker JSH Alfianto Yustinova said hoaxes about COVID-19 vaccination spread quickly because they circulate on social media and messaging apps.

“There’s a video that purportedly showed a student fainting after being injected with COVID-19 vaccine. But that video has actually been around since 2018,” he said.



Mr Sihotang, the health department secretary of Jayapura, said these counterproductive news and hoaxes have affected the public and also health workers.



""Our challenge is not in implementing the vaccination, not from the health side but from the social and cultural side. There has been no risk communication,” he said.

Dr Riono, the epidemiologist, opined that the government’s vaccine communication has been far from ideal.

“We are not just injecting vaccines but we are also injecting knowledge prior to the vaccination. And some are rejecting it, not all … they should be left alone but do not let them spread hoaxes.

“But then there are others who are doubtful. And there are many of these. And this can only be overcome if there is truthful and accurate information,” he said, adding that the efficacy and side effects of the vaccines have not been communicated clearly to the general public.

Dr Riono said the government’s tactic of using a celebrity with many followers but does not have relevant medical knowledge as a role model for vaccination is wrong.

Raffi Ahmad was one of the first people to receive the jab last week along with Mr Widodo at the Jakarta palace. He shared his experience with about 50 million followers on his Instagram, but hours later pictures of him gathering with friends at a party without wearing a mask surfaced and sparked a backlash.

Mr Nugroho, the visiting senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told CNA that policy communication during the pandemic should be open and honest.

“So that the public has the appropriate risk perception. This perception is important so the public knows the risks they are facing.”

At the end of the day, both experts believe vaccination is not a silver bullet.

“Vaccination does not mean that once we are vaccinated we are free from the virus. But vaccination is important to be done together along with other measures such as washing hands, wearing a mask, maintaining a safe distance from one another, testing, tracing and treatment.

“This means that both the community and the government have obligations,” said Mr Nugroho.

As of Thursday (Jan 21), there have been over 900,000 COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.

National Covid-19 Task Force Head Doni Monardo confirmed on Saturday he has tested positive for coronavirus following week-long trips to Sulawesi and Kalimantan.

Doni, who also chairs the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, or BNPB, has spent the past week in West Sulawesi to coordinate responses after a devastating earthquake and in South Kalimantan where massive flooding paralyzed several districts.

“The result from my PCR [polymerase chain reaction]-based test last night came back positive this morning. I didn’t feel any mild symptom as I had my morning routine -- going for an eight-kilometer walk,” Doni said in a statement.

He said he is now self-quarantining at home while continuing to work remotely.

Doni returned from South Sulawesi on Friday afternoon and took diagnostic test for coronavirus test along with the entire staff members accompanying him in the trip.

A member also tested positive.

An aide said Doni arrived in the West Sulawesi town of Mamuju on Jan. 15, a day after the earthquake that killed at least 88 people. Two days later, he went to inspect flooding in South Kalimantan and spent three days there, before returning to West Sulawesi.

Doni speculated he may have caught the virus during meal time because that’s when he had to remove his mask.

“My advice is that we should keep a distance from others when having a meal to prevent the transmission,” Doni said.","Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2020/05/1589429789.jpg,"['national', 'head', 'south', 'task', 'covid', 'sulawesi', 'west', 'tested', 'morning', 'force', 'doni', 'tests', 'coronavirus', 'indonesian', 'positive', 'spent', 'test']",

The first quarter is “very tough,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on Saturday. “We hope in February and March we can still catch up despite the January which is going to be very tough because of Covid and natural disasters.”

She expects the full-year 5% growth target to still be achievable as the mass vaccination program gives “hope and optimism.”

President Joko Widodo expected the economy to rebound as soon as the start of this year, calling 2021 as the year when the country can see a turnaround after last year plunging into its first recession in two decades. But surging numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths prompted the government to limit people’s movement in key economic centers of Java and Bali.

The government also had to contend with a string of natural disasters, including recent floods in Kalimantan, earthquakes in Sulawesi and erupting volcanoes in Java, though the impact on the budget so far is still manageable, Indrawati said.

The country is grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak in Southeast Asia and is still reporting record-high numbers every few days. It’s banking on a mass inoculation program that’s been slow to pick up. Since Jokowi kicked off the campaign on Jan. 13, more than 132,000 people have received their first doses as of Friday, about 22% of the government’s target for January. Indonesia aims to vaccinate more than 180 million people by the end of the year.

Government’s Homework

Indonesia had to boost its budget deficit to 6.09% of gross domestic product last year, double the regulated ceiling of 3%, to afford stimulus packages including cash handouts, free electricity and credit guarantees to buffer the impact of the pandemic. This year, the government expects to be able to narrow the gap to 5.7% as it can draw on unspent money from last year to buy vaccines and reallocate spending toward more urgent needs, Indrawati said.

After approving a massive overhaul of investment rules through the so-called omnibus law in 2020, the government now seeks to reform the financial sector. Many existing rules for banks and capital markets are outdated as they were set up in the early 2000s, after the Asian financial crisis, the finance minister said.

She is also focused on raising tax ratios, while improving the way capital flows toward actual investments in the country, such as through the new wealth fund.

Indonesia has a lot of potential to offer, “at the same time we also recognize we have a lot of homework to do to improve our investment climate,” Indrawati said. “In this very extraordinary situation we also communicate very clearly in the most credible way how we respond to that extraordinary situation with extraordinary policy.”

""China and Indonesia will work together to defeat this virus… China is prepared to continue (vaccine) production cooperation with Indonesia… and will support Indonesia to become a regional production hub of vaccines,"" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said in a joint press briefing with Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta.

Mr Wang added that China, working with the Asean countries, is also ready to increase crisis response capacity against Covid-19.

After the pandemic broke out, China and Indonesia have supported each other and engaged in effective anti-Covid-19 cooperation, the Chinese minister said. ""We have supported each other with needed medical supplies.""

Mr Wang's visit to Indonesia over Tuesday and Wednesday (Jan 13) is part of his trip to Asean countries between Jan 11 and Jan 16. The first leg of his trip took him to Myanmar and he is going on to Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines.

On Tuesday, Mr Wang met Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan and discussed further cooperation plans on trade and investment, including on tourism and electric vehicle battery projects.

""China is prepared to tap into the strength of our markets and domestic demand between our two countries. We look forward to expanding imports from Indonesia and Chinese investment in Indonesia so that we can bring about a more healthy and balanced growth of trade between our two countries,"" Mr Wang said.

He noted that trade and investment cooperation between the two countries grew despite the Covid-19 challenge and this would be the foundation for economic recovery after the pandemic.

After meeting Ms Retno, Mr Wang paid a courtesy call on President Joko Widodo, who had just received Chinese company Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine shot.

Indonesia, the worst hit by the pandemic in South-east Asia, is beginning a vaccination drive in its 34 provinces as part of efforts to curb surging infections and deaths.

Indonesia is relying on Sinovac for the first tens of millions of vaccine shots before it receives more vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca in the coming months. The world's fourth most populous nation received the first 3 million doses of CoronaVac in December and another 15 million on Tuesday.

""Despite a sharp increase in demand for vaccines, we overcame our difficulty and did not hesitate to respond to Indonesia's needs to provide vaccines (to its citizens). This shows brotherly relations between our two countries,"" Mr Wang told reporters after meeting Ms Retno.

Sinovac and Indonesia's state owned drug company Bio Farma have been working together since mid-August to conduct phase 3 clinical trials, the last stage before a vaccine can be distributed and administered to the public. Earlier this week, Indonesia's food and drug regulatory body BPOM issued emergency use approval for CoronaVac, indicating the vaccine was 65 per cent effective against Covid-19.

The two foreign ministers also witnessed the signing of a document that paves the way for China to do a feasibility study to build the Lambakan dam in East Kalimantan province, helping to irrigate local farmland and mitigate floods.

Ms Retno said that during the meeting she expressed appreciation for a 10 per cent increase in Indonesian exports to China last year and touched on other issues such as greater protection for Indonesian seafarers working for Chinese boats.

She also stressed the importance of keeping stability and peace in the region, including in the South China Sea. ""To achieve this, it takes only one thing, that is all nations respect and comply with the international laws, including the Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) 1982,"" Ms Retno said at the joint press briefing.","Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2021/01/13/ak_chvax2_1301.jpg?itok=uRmhuDD7,"['investment', 'wang', 'trade', 'vaccines', 'production', 'hub', 'china', 'countries', 'vaccine', 'regional', 'covid19', 'cooperation', 'chinese', 'pledges', 'indonesia']",

Last month, reports emerged that the Trump administration was willing to offer Indonesia a hefty financial inducement in exchange for formally recognizing the nation of Israel.

In an interview with Bloomberg published on December 22, Adam Boehler, CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, said that Indonesia could get up to $2 billion more in development aid if it formalized the already considerable ties it has with Tel Aviv.

“We’re talking to them about it,” Boehler said. “If they’re ready, they’re ready, and if they are then we’ll be happy to even support more financially than what we do.”

Like many of the world’s Muslim-majority states, and much of the Middle East, Indonesia has never had diplomatic ties with Israel, owing to the nation’s long opposition to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.

But over the past six months, the Trump administration has embarked a push to have Arab and Muslim countries openly recognize Israel, and has so far succeeded in convincing the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan to do so.

Each recognition has been purchased by significant material inducement: the UAE has been promised a fleet of stealth fighter jets and Morocco gained long-sought formal U.S. recognition of its occupation of Western Sahara. Meanwhile, Sudan was removed from the U.S. list of state supporters of terrorism.

Boehler’s suggestion came a week after reports in the Israeli press that Indonesia, along with Oman, were the next likely nations to recognize the Israeli government – reopening a question that has existed for as long as Israel and Indonesia have been independent nations.

The Indonesian government quickly moved to deny the reports. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi asserted that Indonesia had “no intention to open diplomatic ties with Israel,” adding, “Indonesia will continue to exercise support for Palestinian independence based on the two-state solution and other agreed international parameters.”

This position is also backed by Islamic organizations spanning the Indonesian political spectrum, who have long protested Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories and frequently solicit donations for Palestinian causes.

In 2018, thousands of protesters flooded central Jakarta to protest President Donald Trump’s controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Speaking in opposition to recognizing the Israeli state, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the highest clerical body in the nation, stated recently that Indonesia “must remain consistent in its identity as a nation that rejects colonizers.”

This strident public opposition ensures that any move by the government of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to recognize Israel would bear a heavy domestic political cost.

This is especially the case at present, as Jokowi moves to restrict the activities of more radical Islamist groups and to push back against the country’s growing Islamic exclusivism and prejudice. Late last month, the government announced that it was banning the Islamic Defenders Front, which has been at the forefront of Islamist street agitations.

Any decision to extent diplomatic recognition to Israel at this juncture would likely further inflame radical Islamist sentiment, as well as prompting opposition from influential national Islamic organizations like Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah. As Syed Huzaifah Bin Othman Alkaff of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU) commented in a paper this week, “domestic radical Islamist elements will feature strongly in Indonesia’s decision-making processes on issues pertaining to relations with Israel.”

Given the costs, it is also questionable whether formal recognition would be worth it. Despite having no formal diplomatic relations, Indonesia and Israel quietly maintain a range of ties in trade, security, and tourism.

Although a lot of trade between Jakarta and Tel Aviv is routed through third countries, making the volume hard to verify, it reached an estimated $400-500 million in 2013, most of which was Indonesian exports. In 2016, an Israeli official put the total at “hundreds of millions of dollars a year.” An Israel-Indonesia Chamber of Commerce has been based in Tel Aviv since 2009.

Similarly, an estimated 30,000 Indonesian Christian pilgrims visit Israel each year, in addition to a not inconsiderable number of Israeli backpackers and tourists moving in the other direction.

As Alkaff of NTU argued, for Indonesia to recognize Israel “would likely require a deal that would grant strategic political, economic or military advantage which would not only appease nationalists but also be worth the trouble with Islamist groups.”

It’s hard to see what offer would tip that balance. For now, Jokowi’s government will content itself with continuing the proven formula: rhetorical opposition to Israel, alongside sub rosa economic and political interactions.","Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2021-01-14-1.jpg,"['tel', 'islamist', 'israel', 'political', 'recognize', 'ties', 'wont', 'opposition', 'indonesian', 'indonesia', 'israeli']",

Opened on the mighty Nile on January 15, 1971 with the help of the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, the dam was to generate electricity for the whole region, increase agricultural land and reduce flooding.

However, its construction led to the expulsion of tens of thousands of indigenous Nubians for the creation of a huge artificial lake, that also threatened hundreds of ancient monuments.

A picture taken on January 4, 2021 shows the Nefertari complex at the ancient Egyptian temple of Abu Simbel, some 1120 kilometres south of the Egyptian capital Cairo. Egypt's inauguration of the Aswan High Dam 50 years ago necessitated one of the world's biggest archaeological rescue operations ever, with the massive Abu Simbel ancient temple complex dismantled and hoisted to higher ground to prevent it being swamped by the rising waters. The original site is today completely submerged by Lake Nasser. (Agence France-Presse/Khaled Desouki)

Pharaonic and Greco-Roman temples, including those of Rameses II at Abu Simbel, risked being submerged.

Opponents also complained that the project reduced both the amount of Nile silt that fertilised the land when the river flooded and the size of the fertile Nile Delta, the country's breadbasket.

Nasser's dream

Since seizing power in 1954 after ousting General Mohamed Naguib, Nasser had dreamt of a mega-project to make a dam on the Nile, which would allow him to increase Egypt's cultivable land by a third.

The British had already built a dam at Aswan during the colonial era in 1902, but the country's rocketing population had outgrown it.

But in 1956, the United States and Britain withdrew a pledge to fund the construction of the Aswan High Dam after Egypt moved closer to the Soviet bloc.

In retaliation, Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal, sparking a crisis in which Britain, France and Israel united to attack Egypt, before being forced to pull out in humiliation after 10 days of fighting under pressure from Washington.

But Moscow stepped in to finance the dam.

On January 9, 1960, Nasser launched the building work, setting off a 10-ton dynamite explosion.

Four years later, Nasser and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev together officiated over the flooding of the dam, with Nasser pointing to ""a lasting symbol of friendship"" with the USSR.

Nubian exodus

But the project necessitated one of the world's biggest archaeological rescue operations ever, with a massive ancient Egyptian temple complex dismantled and hoisted to higher ground to prevent it being swamped by the rising waters.

The original site is today completely submerged by Lake Nasser, and the Nubian population was forced to flee its ""Garden of Eden"" along the fertile Nile for the arid south or the cities.

The two Abu Simbel temples -- named after their village location -- were carved out of cliffs overlooking the Nile from 1298 BC to 1235 BC.

The groundbreaking UNESCO-led project to relocate around 20 gigantic monuments ended in the autumn of 1968, after an eight-year international effort involving hundreds of workers.

Half Egypt's power

On January 15, 1971, three months after Nasser's death, his successor Anwar al-Sadat inaugurated the High Dam at a ceremony, which took place under an enormous triumphal arch.

Portraits of Nasser hung on each side of the dam, which also houses a giant hydro-electric plant with 12 turbines.

The dam can hold more than 160 billion cubic metres (5,650 billion cubic feet) of water per year in Lake Nasser.

Its turbines produce 10 billion kilowatts of electricity, to this day around half of the country's power supply.

For 11 years, 36,000 Egyptian workers and more than 2,000 Soviet experts toiled on the dam. The USSR paid 40 percent of the building cost, while the remainder was paid with Egyptian cotton.","Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/01/13/2021_01_13_109832_1610518043._large.jpg,"['aswan', 'nassers', 'high', 'egyptian', 'egypts', 'dream', 'simbel', 'soviet', 'nasser', 'lake', 'nile', 'nubian', 'dam', 'nightmare']",

The activities aimed to assess COVID-19 preparedness in fifteen provinces based on the status of their pandemic risk.

The assessment covered provincial command centres, provincial health offices, port health offices, hospitals, laboratories, district health offices, public health centres, and community health centres.

All assessed provinces had a functioning command and control structure for pandemic management. However, not all of them has established Emergency Operations Centres (EOC). Contingency plans for pandemic response were in place in several locations, but there remains a need for joint contingency plans with neighbouring countries.

Key areas of improvement were case reporting and analysis for pandemic severity, budget allocation for response in points of entry, personal protective equipment stockpiling, and exit screening of passengers. The assessment further identified health system gaps in provinces, such as availability of ICU and other facilities in the event of rising COVID-19 cases.

Laboratories for COVID-19 testing are facing challenges. One of the solutions is to develop a laboratory referral system to avoid specimen accumulations. Meanwhile, the biggest gaps in the surveillance system in all provinces were the low level of isolation of suspected cases and the challenge to confirm COVID-19 status within 48 hours. Contact tracing, contact quarantine and case isolation need to be strengthened.

The results of the field assessment will be used to inform key stakeholders of the strengths and gaps in each province in responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, they will be useful in preparing the country for future outbreaks.

WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response.

If we look back on our previous year, which was filled with uncertainty, one of the most notable shifts was the kind of content posted and consumed online. You rarely saw photos of sunny Bali vacations or selfie videos of people watching concerts, unless they were nostalgic posts. Instead, digital platforms were flooded with feeds of people in pajamas, wearing no makeup and mostly at home doing virtual things or trying to stay entertained by posting simply and candidly.

There been a shift in the culture away from inauthenticity on social media – because people have gotten a little tired of that. Especially in 2020, interestingly, people came back to themselves and wanted to share their authenticity. People are looking around, and they're seeing everybody is in the same boat. Seeing more people in similar situations, even virtually, has apparently created a normalizing and calming effect.

The desire for more authentic content is not new. For years, campaigns championing untouched photos of models have gained popularity in advertisements and magazines. As the pandemic has reshaped our lives, we have been exposed to even more unfiltered content, with everyone from celebrities and news anchors to television hosts broadcasting from home.

That authenticity is now extending deeper into social media, as people flock to platforms that embrace posts by anyone, even unknown people out of their circle.

Overall internet consumption has increased during the pandemic, with a surge of 200 million users, as reported by the Association of Internet Service Providers of Indonesia (APJII).More than 50 percent use it for social media and to watch online videos.

The main appeal of TikTok is its focus on humor, with videos ranging from memes and embarrassing moments to videos of surreal visualizations of post-COVID-19 lives. These can be a coping mechanism for the stresses of the pandemic. The look of the creator, or even the quality of the video, is not the top priority. People are more compelled by the content itself, rather than the overall aesthetic.

This is a very important shift. The platform reveals the creativity of raw potential rather than nice backgrounds. Remember the popcorn duet craze? It was entertaining, relatable to many generations and showcased new talent. So much content enables people to be entertained during the crisis by simply using their raw talent.

This has triggered a post-demographic trend in the case of TikTok, where more and more generations have started using the app. When you visit TikTok, you will see millions of users adding to the diversity of content and range of human expression. Being real is the new cultural currency, as today's influence comes from the authentic ideas and imagination of everyday people.

This authenticity has driven brands to change their marketing strategy. TikTok recently conducted a study with Nielsen and found that more than 60 percent of TikTok’s users felt that advertising on TikTok was unique. They found it more authentic, fun, genuine, honest, real and trustworthy than other channels. Brands also engage with the top creators or TikTok users with outstanding views and followers to help their marketing posts become more relatable.

COVID-19 has surely changed the type of content that's being created. We crave connection online because the real-life kind has largely been taken away from us. Authentic creativity is at an all-time high. People and brands are so starving for human interaction that the content we're seeing now is a little more honest, direct and, most importantly, more personal and human.

47,47,FL-2021-000004-IDN,Indonesian aircraft that crashed went from zero flights to 132 in less than a month - Firstpost,https://www.firstpost.com/world/indonesian-aircraft-that-crashed-went-from-zero-flights-to-132-in-less-than-a-month-9200921.html,"Like most commercial airlines, Sriwijaya Air was forced to scale back operations in the pandemic. At one point it was down to operating just five of its 18 planes

The aging plane flew during a heavy storm in a country with a long history of flight disasters. It had also been out of service for nine months.

According to Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation, Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which plunged into the Java Sea on Saturday afternoon, killing all 62 passengers and crew members on board, had been in a hangar for most of last year after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of commercial flight.

The effect such a hiatus may have had on the 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 is still unclear, but experts have warned that the continuing collapse of air travel could pose potential safety risks from mothballed planes.

“There’s a major problem starting to raise its head in terms of restoring these aircraft because while out of service for nine or 10 months, they need to be kept operating, otherwise they deteriorate,” said Hugh Ritchie, chief executive of Aviation Analysts International, an Australian air safety consulting firm.

The period of dormancy creates extra burdens for inspections and maintenance to repair parts that may have deteriorated. In addition, pilots who may not have been flying actively during the downturn need time to get back up to speed, Ritchie said.

“All of these aircraft have to be brought slowly back into service,” he added. “The same can be said about pilots.”

For pilots, flight simulator training is a key way to maintain proficiency after lost flying time.

Like most commercial airlines, Sriwijaya Air was forced to scale back operations in the pandemic. At one point it was down to operating just five of its 18 planes. The Boeing 737-500 that crashed was put in a hangar on 23 March and did not operate again until the end of the year, according to the Ministry of Transportation.

The airlines’ pilots also faced long periods on the ground. Captain Afwan, the pilot in command of Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, spent much of his time last year in flight simulator sessions to maintain his skills.

The Ministry of Transportation said it inspected the plane on Dec. 14 and issued a new certificate of airworthiness on 17 December.

After the plane resumed service last month, it was flown from storage in Surabaya to Jakarta, the capital, on 19 December. It resumed passenger service the next day, according to data from the tracking site Flightradar24.

The plane had conducted 132 flights since it left storage, said Ian Petchenik, a Flightradar24 spokesperson.

“We can’t speak to whether or not storage may have been a factor in the crash, but investigators will certainly be looking at all possible scenarios,” Petchenik said in an email. “The readout of the flight data recorder will hopefully prove helpful in determining the cause.”

Navy divers recovered the plane’s flight data recorder on Tuesday, one of two so-called black boxes investigators will use to find out what happened.

Officials believe the location of the second black box — a cockpit voice recorder — has been pinpointed about 50 feet away from the flight data recorder that was recovered on Tuesday.

Treacherous weather conditions and wreckage scattered in mud roughly 75 feet underwater made finding the devices difficult. The first recorder was recovered by divers moving large pieces of debris and digging by hand in the mud, said Adm. Yudo Margono, chief of staff of the Indonesian navy.

The pattern of debris suggested the plane hit the water relatively intact. Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee said Tuesday that it did not explode before crashing.

The search between the small islands of Lancang and Laki was suspended on Wednesday as waves reached a height of eight feet.

Sriwijaya Air had undergone an independent audit last March that assessed licenses, operation manuals, spare parts, safety- and quality-system management, crew training and aircraft supervision, said Jefferson Irwin Jauwena, Sriwijaya Air’s chief executive.

The audit was carried out through the Basic Aviation Risk Standard program run by the Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit based in Alexandria, Virginia.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators from the United States to help look into the crash. The team will be joined by experts from the Federal Aviation Administration, General Electric and Boeing, the board said.

Indonesia waived its coronavirus travel restrictions for the investigators.

Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 crashed just four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, plunging more than 10,000 feet in under a minute. Officials have identified the remains of six victims so far.

The plane was bound for the city of Pontianak, on the island of Borneo. The quick trip was scheduled to last a little over 90 minutes. The plane had completed four other flights earlier in the day.

48,48,FL-2021-000004-IDN,The next Philippines natural disaster is coming - Nikkei Asia,https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/The-next-Philippines-natural-disaster-is-coming2,"Robert Kaufman heads the Philippines country office for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Imagine getting hit by six typhoons during a deadly pandemic. For millions of people in the Philippines, this was their reality as 2020 came crashing to a close. Predictions of the increasing severity and frequency of emergencies have come true.

It is heartbreaking, exhausting and scary. But most of all it is frustrating as much of this human and economic toll can be prevented.

We have known about the brutal effects of climate change for a long time, yet we have not been doing enough to fix it. Debates about the effects of climate change or whether partners should support more preparedness are failing people. If your roof blows off three times in one month and this extreme weather happens with relentless certainty, there is nothing to debate. It is time to prepare more for what is coming.

We know that the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, topping the charts with the most disasters of all countries the past two years. It is number two for the past decade just behind China.

We know the number of climate-related disasters has risen almost 35% since the 1990s. The stuff of Hollywood movies has become a reality for tens of millions of people around the world, as they face bigger, more violent storms and more disease outbreaks.

For decades we anticipated another pandemic. Hollywood blockbusters told horror stories of contagious diseases. Since 2008, we have seen fantasy become reality with several pandemics, the H1N1 flu virus, SARS and now COVID-19. Yet somehow, the world has been taken by surprise.

Let's make no mistake, we have made inroads. Governments, humanitarian agencies and countless communities deserve credit for helping to save lives. Just seven years ago, the most destructive typhoon to hit the Philippines on record, Haiyan, killed close to 7,000 people. When Typhoon Goni hit in 2020, a storm as strong as Haiyan, less than 70 lives were lost. Still, I am frustrated.

Early on in management, I learned that when you spend significant time and money on something, it is a priority. Most of the time and money in the aid sector is still spent on response, as if we do not know what is coming; neither the humanitarian community, the policymakers, nor the big donors.

Why are we not using our extraordinary capacity to anticipate crises to prioritize our time and money? What price do we need to place on the lives of people who have died or had their livelihoods ripped apart by disease and disaster before we change our priorities?

Today, we largely know the types of risks we are going to face, where they are going to hit and even in many cases, when. Many of the answers are as clear as day. Typhoons strike the Philippines every November and December. Floods always follow drought in East Africa.

We know the risks and we know what to do about it. The latest study on the value of preparedness confirms what we already knew. Every dollar invested in reducing risks from climate-related disasters saves us $6 when we are fixing up the mess, according to the United States Institute of Building Sciences and the United Nations.

Super Typhoon Goni packed the most powerful winds of any storm in the world last year. Together with Typhoon Vamco and other major storms, they came at a huge cost, seriously affecting the lives of more than 8.1 million people. More than 425,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.

Among the millions whose livelihoods were disrupted, at least 200,000 farmers and fishermen lost their only source of income. The cost of agricultural damages totaled more than 12.3 billion pesos ($256 million) according to the Philippines Department of Agriculture.

Together, the storms were considered the second most expensive typhoons on record, costing more than $1 billion. Money normally reserved for responding after disasters strike needs to be made available earlier and for longer-term solutions.

We need to stop soil erosion, plant trees and improve drainage. We need to avoid crop wastage with better grain storage and irrigation. We need to build safer houses with stronger and more permanent foundations. We need to protect land rights and strengthen economic development and social protection programs so that people are not dependent on aid when disaster strikes.

There needs to be a public accounting of how well resource allocation aligns with scientific prediction and the lessons we have learned. We must put our money where our mouth is. Failing is a dereliction of our responsibility to those most at risk and to ourselves.

This past year, millions have faced often insurmountable hardships and heartache. We have a duty to protect the hope and dignity of those we pledge to support by ensuring everyone has a fair chance of a decent life. There just cannot be any more excuses.","Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F3%252F0%252F4%252F31914039-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1611228104R20210121%2520Typhoon%2520Vamco%2520Rodriguez.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['typhoon', 'need', 'money', 'natural', 'disaster', 'disasters', 'millions', 'world', 'hit', 'coming', 'lives', 'know', 'philippines']",

This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As California’s Economy skyrocketed during the 20th century, its land headed in the opposite direction. A booming agricultural industry in the state’s San Joaquin Valley, combined with punishing droughts, led to the over-extraction of water from aquifers. Like huge, empty water bottles, the aquifers crumpled, a phenomenon geologists call subsidence. By 1970, the land had sunk as much as 28 feet in the valley, with less-than-ideal consequences for the humans and infrastructure above the aquifers.

The San Joaquin Valley was geologically primed for collapse, but its plight is not unique. All over the world—from the Netherlands to Indonesia to Mexico City—geology is conspiring with climate change to sink the ground under humanity’s feet. More punishing droughts mean the increased draining of aquifers, and rising seas make sinking land all the more vulnerable to flooding. According to a recent study published in the journal Science, in the next two decades, 1.6 billion people could be affected by subsidence, with potential loses in the trillions of dollars.

“Subsidence has been neglected in a lot of ways because it is slow moving. You don’t recognize it until you start seeing damage,” says Michelle Sneed, a land subsidence specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper. “The land sinking itself is not a problem. But if you’re on the coast, it’s a big problem. If you have infrastructure that crosses long areas, it’s a big problem. If you have deep wells, they’re collapsing because of subsidence. That’s a problem.”

The situation in Indonesia is so dire that officials plan to relocate the nation’s capital.

For subsidence to become a problem, you need two things: The right kind of land, and an over-exploited aquifer. Aquifers hold water in between bits of sand, gravel, or clay. When the amount of clay in an aquifer is particularly high, the grains arrange themselves like plates thrown haphazardly in a sink—they’ve basically got random orientations, and the water fills in the spaces between the grains. But if you start extracting water from an aquifer, those spaces collapse and the grains draw closer together. “Those plates rearrange themselves into more like a stack of dinner plates that you put in your cupboard,” says Sneed. “It takes a lot less space, obviously, to stack the plates that way. And so that’s the compaction of the aquifer system that then results in land subsidence at the surface.”

But wouldn’t pumping more water back into the aquifer force the clay plates back to their random, spacey orientations? Unfortunately, no. “It’ll press those grains apart a little bit—you’ll get a little bit of expansion in the aquifer system represented as uplift on the land surface. But it’s a tiny amount,” says Sneed. We’re talking maybe three quarters of an inch of movement. “They’re still stacked like the plates in your cupboard,” she continues.

So at this point you’ve got a double-barreled problem: The land has sunk and it won’t reinflate, and the aquifers won’t hold as much water as they once did, because they’ve compressed. “And that’s an important point,” says Sneed. “As places around the world, including California, are starting to use aquifer systems as managed reservoirs, the compaction of them prior to now has reduced their ability to store water.”

As the growing human population and more intense droughts brought on by climate change are putting ever more stress on water supplies, land is subsiding all over the world. Some parts of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, for instance, are sinking as much as 10 inches a year, all while the seas are rising around it. Models estimate that in just three decades, 95 percent of North Jakarta could be underwater. The situation is so dire, Indonesia is planning to move its capital. But scientists haven’t modeled global risks of subsidence—until now. To build their model, Sneed and her colleagues scoured the existing literature on land subsidence in 200 locations worldwide. They considered those geological factors (high clay content), as well as topology, as subsidence is more likely to happen on flat land. They factored in population and economic growth, data on water use, and climate variables. The researchers found that, planet-wide, subsidence could threaten 4.6 million square miles of land in the next two decades. While that’s just 8 percent of Earth’s land, humanity tends to build big cities in coastal areas, which are prone to subsidence. So they estimate that, in the end, 1.6 billion people could be affected. The modeling further found that worldwide, subsidence exposes assets totaling a gross domestic product of $8.19 trillion, or 12 percent of global GDP. True, gradual subsidence isn’t as destructive as a sudden earthquake or volcanic eruption. “But it will cause these indirect effects or impacts that, in the long term, can produce either damages to structures or infrastructure, or increase floodable areas in these river basins or coastal areas,” says geoscientist Gerardo Herrera-García of the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, lead author on the paper.

Subsidence is uniquely sensitive to climate change—at least indirectly. On a warmer planet, droughts are longer and more intense. “This is very important,” says Herrera-García. “Because no matter the amount of annual rainfall you have, the most important issue is that you have a prolonged drought period.” Dry reservoirs will lead cities to pump even more water out of their aquifers, and once you collapse the structure of an aquifer by neatly stacking those plates of clay grains, there’s no going back. For the 1.6 billion people potentially affected by subsidence—and that’s just by the year 2040—the consequences could be dire, leading to both water shortages and the flooding of low-lying land.

“It’s definitely very startling results,” says USGS coastal geologist Patrick Barnard, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. “Especially coastal megacities—most of the megacities are, in fact, coastal. So it really highlights the issue in relation to coastal flooding.” And urban populations are booming: According to the United Nations, nearly 70 percent of humans will live in cities by 2050, up from 50 percent currently.

Humanity has tended to construct its cities where rivers empty into the sea, where the conditions for subsidence are ideal. Long ago, these rivers deposited sediments loaded with the clay, which humans then built upon. “The areas that are at high risk are in those kinds of settings near the outlets of river deltas, and where you have low-lying, flat sedimentary basins near coasts,” says University of California, Berkeley geophysicist Roland Burgmann, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. But you can actually find this problem inland, too, for instance in Mexico City, which is built on top of the sediments of a former lake, and is accordingly suffering from subsidence.

Cities built on landfill are also sinking as that material settles. In the Bay Area megalopolis, for instance, some areas are sinking as much as a third of an inch a year. Modeling estimates from researchers at Arizona State University and UC Berkeley hold that by the end of the century, as much as 165 square miles of the Bay Area could be inundated as land sinks and the sea rises.

Subsidence gets even trickier because its effects can vary dramatically over short distances, depending on factors like local clay composition or which side of an earthquake fault the land happens to be on. So this new global study is great for determining risk on a large scale, but scientists will still have to investigate subsidence with a finer focus.","Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20210122_San-Joaquin-Valley-aerial.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['delta', 'subsidence', 'aquifer', 'jakarta', 'water', 'clay', 'problem', 'areas', 'collapsing', 'california', 'coastal', 'land', 'aquifers', 'plates', 'worlds']", 
52,52,FL-2021-000004-IDN,AmResearch sees minimal impact from floods on Sime Darby Plantation's operations - The Edge Markets MY,https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/amresearch-sees-minimal-impact-floods-sime-darby-plantations-operations,"KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 19): AmInvestment Bank Research (AmResearch) has maintained its “hold” rating of Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM5.55, as it expects the company to see minimal impact from the floods in Malaysia.

“We understand that the wet weather has only affected Sime Darby Plantation’s operations in Malaysia so far. Less than 10,000ha of Sime Darby Plantation’s oil palm estates in Malaysia were hit by the floods. These comprise only 3.3% of Sime Darby Plantation’s planted areas of 300,000ha in Malaysia,” said AmResearch in a note today.

Meanwhile, it added that the company’s oil palm estates in Kalimantan were not affected as they already experienced heavy rains in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2020 (3QFY20).

It also said the impact on PNG (Papua New Guinea) was not known yet as the wet season usually takes place only from February onwards.

About 51.3% of Sime Darby Plantation’s planted areas of oil palms were located in Malaysia as of the end of FY19, while another 33.2% were in Indonesia. The balance 15.5% of the company’s planted areas were in PNG/Solomon Islands.

Operationally, the research house now assumes the company’s fresh fruits bunch (FFB) production to grow 4% in FY21, underpinned by its Indonesian division. It anticipates the Indonesian unit to record an FFB output growth of 5% in FY21 after registering a 10% fall in FY20.

“On a group level, we believe that Sime Darby Plantation will achieve an average FFB yield of 20 tonnes/ha in FY21 versus 19.5 tonnes/ha in FY20,” said the research house.

The research house kept its earnings forecast for FY21 unchanged at RM955.8 million for Sime Darby Plantation.

However, it raised its FY20 net profit forecast by 5.9% to RM789.3 million, accounting for a higher plantation earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin and downstream earnings.

In line with the higher net profit, the research house forecast the company’s dividend per share (DPS) to increase to eight sen for FY20 and further grow to 8.5 sen for FY21, compared with one sen for FY19.

Meanwhile, it forecast the company’s net gearing (including RM2.2 billion perpetual sukuk) to decline to 67.2% as at end-FY20, from 72% as at end-FY19, due to higher cash flows from improved crude palm oil (CPO) prices.

Going forward, the research house believes that the company’s de-gearing exercise will take a breather in FY21.

“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we reckon that there is little appetite for land bank acquisition currently. Also, approvals of government agencies for any potential sale of land bank may take some time,” it pointed out.

“As at end-June 2020, Sime Darby Plantation had sold about 58.1% or 1,350 acres out of the 2,324 acres of land bank targeted for disposal. We think that Sime Darby Plantation recognised gains of RM450 million from the disposal of land bank and non-performing assets in 9MFY20 (the cumulative first nine months ended Sept 30, 2020),” it added.

It noted that Sime Darby Plantation’s asset disposal programme involves selling 2,324 acres of land bank and its 50% stake in Emery Oleochemicals for a rough sum of more than RM1.5 billion in total.

At noon, the stock was traded 12 sen or 2.41% higher at RM5.10, bringing it a market value of RM35.1 billion. The stock had rebounded 27% from its March’s low of RM4.01.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Sime-Darby-Plantation_www.simedarbyplantation.com__24.jpg?R2UTrwJ9I8snwWjkzejcwtiNrHndSOJh,"['darby', 'minimal', 'sees', 'sime', 'floods', 'sen', 'research', 'companys', 'operations', 'plantations', 'fy21', 'impact', 'amresearch', 'plantation', 'land', 'bank']",

Nearly 10,000 people have been displaced in West Sulawesi, with over 1,150 houses destroyed as well as three hospitals. Mercy Corps is providing clean water, hygiene kits, shelter and food to local residents.



Piva Bell, Mercy Corps’ Indonesia Response Team Manager, says:

“Nearly 10,000 people have been forced from their homes by this earthquake, with many left in crowded makeshift evacuation shelters without access to basic sanitary and food supplies, or even clean water.

“Cases of COVID‑19 are rising in the Mamuju and Majene regencies, and both affected districts are Red Zones -- Indonesia’s highest COVID‑19 risk rating -- but hygiene supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer and facilities such as hand washing stations are not available in displacement shelters. Hospitals have been destroyed and the heavy rainfall has made it extremely difficult to reach those most affected because it caused landslides in several spots, blocking access to remote areas.

“Mercy Corps Indonesia’s emergency responders have themselves encountered heavy rain, landslides and power outages, as they work to reach the affected areas and the communications lines and internet are unstable. People have now gone days without the basic supplies they need to survive.

“We’re rushing support to the people of West Sulawesi as quickly as possible. The sheer number of disasters that this part of Indonesia has endured in recent weeks has reduced everyone’s ability to cope.”

Mercy Corps has worked in Indonesia for over 20 years. Our Indonesian Response Team was established in 2007 and has responded to over 20 disasters, including earthquakes, floods, landslides and tsunamis.

56,56,FL-2021-000004-IDN,Sabah on high alert for flash floods - The Star Online,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/01/19/sabah-on-high-alert-for-flash-floods,"KOTA KINABALU: Sabah remains on high alert after heavy rainfall over the weekend resulted in flash floods, landslips and damages to roads, properties and crops in nine districts.

Up to yesterday, some 691 people from 203 families in 223 villages were seeking temporary shelter at 15 relief centres.

While floodwaters in some areas started to recede, other parts were bracing for another round of floods as heavy rain was expected to lash down today.

Landslips along the main roads on the Crocker Range that links the state capital with interior Sabah have damaged several stretches.

As of late Sunday, Sabah Disaster Management Committee said 26 roads were affected, including 10 stretches which were damaged by landslips.

Penampang was the worst hit while some sections of roads in northern Kudat, Pitas, Tuaran and Kota Belud were damaged.

Landslips and cave-ins also occurred along roads in Kota Kinabalu, Kota Marudu, Pitas and Kudat.

The Civil Defence Force said they were monitoring closely the ground situation as the weather condition was unpredictable.

At around 9am yesterday, firemen responded to a distress call involving a car parked at an eco-farm in Signal Hill which tumbled 30m down a ravine after a landslip there.

No casualties were reported.

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who visited some of the flood-hit areas in his Sulaman constituency in Tuaran, as well as Penampang, have called on the people to heed instructions to evacuate if the need arises.

Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin also urged motorists to be cautious on the roads due to the floods and road cave-ins.

He said the Public Works Department (JKR) and the respective road maintenance concessionaires have been directed to take necessary steps to put warning signs along affected roads including Penampang-Tambunan road that saw a major cave-in.

The authorities also carried out urgent inspections on the Luyang flyover where a side barrier was dislocated, raising safety concerns.

State JKR director Ali Ahmad Hamid said an investigation was underway and safety measures have already been put in place.

For worst-hit Penampang, some residents have started to clean up their homes after facing two waves of floods.

Kapayan assemblyman Jannie Lasimbang said many areas including Kg Peringatan, Kobusak, Tunoh and Hungab, as well as housing areas in Taman Sahabat, Regency Park and Millenium Heights in Bundusan were badly flooded.

“There were also areas in Kg Koidupan hit by landslides as well as many roads left flooded and impassable, ” she said.

Some residents blamed the much-delayed flood mitigation programme for Penampang and clogged drains as among the key reasons for the district to be constantly hit by floods during heavy rains.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/01/19/1012829.jpg,"['kota', 'high', 'road', 'sabah', 'floods', 'flash', 'penampang', 'including', 'roads', 'heavy', 'hit', 'areas', 'alert']",

Amman – In a notable example of cross-regional collaboration, UN-Habitat kicked-off the implementation of the participatory City Resilience Action Planning tool (CityRAP), in its ‘light’ version in Amman, Jordan.

The tool has been modified to specifically address the issue of flashfloods in downtown Amman and was delivered through a hybrid virtual and in-person modality in compliance with COVID-19 rules for gatherings and social distancing.

The workshop, led by UN-Habitat Jordan Office and supported by UN-Habitat Regional Office for Africa (ROAF), included interactive sessions to introduce participants to the concepts of urban resilience and disaster risk management, discuss the issues and challenges in the city, and suggest potential solutions.

With over 40 attendees, the workshop saw participation from relevant departments at Greater Amman Municipality, youth, women, persons with disabilities, Municipal Council of Children, Syrian refugees and local community representatives.

CityRAP is a participatory planning process that uses a sequence of highly interactive workshops, exercises and activities to enable urban communities and stakeholders to determine their area’s most pressing resilience building needs through a fully inclusive effort. CityRAP was developed by the Regional Office for Africa together with the Technical Centre for Disaster Risk Management, Sustainability and Urban Resilience (DiMSUR).

Since 2016, CityRAP has been implemented in 30+ locations in 11 countries across Southern Africa. This is the first time CityRAP is being taken out of Africa and implemented in another region. This experience will be a test of the tool’s flexibility to adapt to different geographic, cultural and socioeconomic contexts, and can open up opportunities for further applications around the world.

This collaboration and CityRAP implementation comes as part of the project 'Strengthening the social stability and resilience of vulnerable Jordanian communities and Syrian refugees in Amman against flash floods', funded by the Japan Supplementary Fund (JSP) and implemented by UN-Habitat’s Regional Office for the Arab States. The project aims to improve urban resilience status in Amman, by strengthening the capacities of the government and community dwellers, to reduce the vulnerabilities of refugees and manage flood disasters better.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['resilience', 'vulnerable', 'unhabitat', 'cityrap', 'communities', 'office', 'amman', 'refugees', 'implemented', 'mitigate', 'africa', 'regional', 'protect', 'urban', 'flashfloods', 'jordan', 'strengthening']",

This means destructive floods will probably be more frequent than scientists have thought.

The concerns come amid reports of China’s and India’s plans to build large-scale hydropower projects on the river.

Improved data sharing on Brahmaputra’s discharge is needed between China, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.

Reconstruction of 700 years of the Brahmaputra river’s water flow in the monsoon season, based on tree-ring data, suggests that the transboundary river’s real flood risk is likely an underestimate as instrumental records were taken during a dry period, scientists warn in a study.

They call for improved data sharing between the basin states China, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The study comes amid reports of China’s and India’s plans to build large-scale hydropower projects on the river.

Many researchers agree that a warming climate will intensify the seasonal monsoon rains that drive the Brahmaputra, but the presumed baseline of previous natural variations in river flow rests mainly on discharge-gauge records dating only to the 1950s. However, data from rings of ancient trees in 28 different sites in Tibet, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan in the Brahmaputra River watershed reveal that most recent decades of discharge (1956–1986) are among the driest of the past 700 years.

“That should be of concern to us because, in the present day, high discharge years are usually associated with flooding. So this means that we are likely underestimating the true flood risk in the river as we have only taken records during a dry period,” study’s lead author Mukund Palat Rao, Tree Ring Laboratory, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, told Mongabay-India.

Anyone using the modern discharge record to estimate future flood hazards would be underestimating the danger by 24 to 38 percent, based solely on natural variations; human-driven warming would have to be added on top of that.

“If the instruments say we should expect flooding toward the end of the century to come about every four and a half years, we are saying we should really expect flooding to come about every three years,” said Rao. Discharge is the volume of water moving down a stream or river per unit of time.

The rings show that there have been much wetter periods in the past, driven by natural oscillations that took place over decades or centuries. The researchers found a good match for a high discharge in the year 1787 C.E. “We know from historical documents that there was a major flood in 1787 C.E. that caused the Teesta river to change its course eastward from flowing into the Ganga to the Brahmatpura instead. It was unclear if this shift was earthquake driven or monsoon driven,” Rao said.

“Obviously, we can’t say for sure, but our results suggest that 1787 was a very wet year. Though there still could have been an earthquake,” said Rao.

The study only talks about flood hazards, one of the three components of flood risk in terms of adaptation. Vulnerability and exposure are the other two. “In terms of policymaking, we can still reduce flood risk by reducing our vulnerability and exposure. So we need to continue to assess mitigation structures, e.g., embankments, polders, etc. to make sure they can withstand flooding both right now and into the future. Continuing to advance our early warning capabilities and flood action plans would serve us well,” said Rao.

This study’s primary motivation was to develop a longer discharge record to better understand the natural variability and high and low flow cycles seen in this river system. The researchers turned to dendrochronology — dating and interpreting past events based on tree rings.

As trees grow they incorporate information about the environmental conditions they are living in, in their annual growth rings. Trees in the region grow more and put on wide rings in wet monsoon years. Conversely, in dry monsoon years (or droughts) they grow less and put on narrow rings.

“Since some of these trees can live for a long time, by taking a small pencil thin tree-core from these trees and measuring their rings under a microscope, we can learn more about climate conditions for the past several centuries. These cores that we take are small and do not injure or harm the trees,” added Rao.

Chandan Mahanta, professor and head of the Civil Engineering Department at IIT-Guwahati who was not involved in the study agreed that longer observation records would help overcome the current constraints of making robust baseline estimation of natural climate variability in hydro-climatologically complex river basins like the Brahmaputra.

“Focus only upon recent observation will be inadequate for accurate assessment of flood risk. Since long observation records from the past are not adequately available, alternative attempts are needed for synthetically generating reliable data,” Mahanta said. However, seven-century tree ring reconstruction of monsoon discharge alone may not provide an equally reliable database as that of instrumental measurement. “Such data is of best use if it can be integrated with data generated by other simulation tools for a collective agreement,” he added.

Shahjahan Mondal, professor and Director of the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), who was not involved in the study, underscored the significance of data sharing by basin states. “This will help not only flood and erosion management but also water management during the dry season,” Mondal told Mongabay-India.

Flowing under a variety of names and braided routes some 2,900 miles through Tibet, northeast India, and Bangladesh, the river, often described as a “moving ocean”, contributes nearly half of the approximate 40,000 m3/s (cubic metre per second) mean annual discharge of the Ganga–Brahmaputra–Meghna river system.

This makes it the joint third largest river system globally (tied with the Río Orinoco, Venezuela) in terms of its mean annual discharge after the Amazon and Congo. Known as the Jamuna in Bangladesh, the high discharge rates of the Brahmaputra are caused, in part, by annual precipitation (rain and seasonal snow) over 3000 mm/year for much of the watershed.

Its basin in India is shared by six states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and West Bengal. Majuli Island, the largest inhabited river island, is located in the Brahmaputra in upper Assam. The floods in the Brahmaputra valley are a recurring phenomenon and have been causing large scale devastations every year. However, the erosion by the Brahmaputra is more dangerous than floods. As with the Nile, the flooding has a good side because the waters drop nutrient-rich sediment to replenish farmland, and some degree of flooding is essential for rice cultivation.

Better data sharing between the basin states China, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal is essential, especially since the larger upstream countries (China and India) have more control over the water resources (particularly in the context of Bangladesh).

According to reports, in November 2020, China announced plans to develop nearly 60 GW of hydropower in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (the Brahmaputra in India) amid apprehensions of diversion of water from the river to irrigate drier regions in northwest China. This was followed by reports of India’s announcement on December 1, 2020, to build a 10 GW on the Siang (the stretch of the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh).

Rao told Mongabay-India that the project may not have such a large impact on wet/monsoon season flows because most of the precipitation originates south of the Himalayas. But any diversion of flow would negatively impact dry season flow which is derived from snow and glacial melt (from the Tibetan Plateau).

A reduction in dry season flow by a dam would raise water security concerns (not so much of an issue in the wet season) and concerns about saltwater intrusion in the low-lying Sundarbans delta, where a high river discharge rate holds back the ocean’s saline waters. This is again a concern only in the dry season when flow levels are lower, he added.

An additional layer of worry is associated with dams triggering loss of sediment. The river has one of the highest sediment loads in the world. These sediments are crucial to sustaining the floodplain’s fertility (for agriculture) and maintaining the large riverine islands (chars). “Dams inevitably trap sediments and reduce their load. In the long run, this could threaten the integrity of chars (sandbars or small sandy islands), many of which are currently inhabited. On the Indian side in Assam, this also could interact with regional politics as there is already a lot of discrimination faced by communities who live on chars in Assam,” said Rao.

The region is active tectonically (earthquakes) and the Brahmaputra is a highly braided river that migrates its course quite often. Both of these are other large risk factors in addition to flood concerns. “The flood and river management measures adopted so far in the valley are area-specific and mostly of short-term structural measures such as the construction of embankments, permeable and impermeable spurs, revetments, etc. The poor maintenance of the flood management structures generally causes unexpected miseries to the people in their failure,” said Rao.

“The efficacy of these measures, especially in the Brahmaputra river system, which is highly aggrading/degrading in different reaches, is also debatable. As such, there is a need for constructing storage reservoirs in combination with other structural/non-structural measures after studying the river behavior using scientific tools,” he added.

Indonesian authorities have retrieved one of the black boxes from a Sriwijaya Air plane that crashed into the Java Sea at the weekend, a navy spokesman said.

The recording device was being transported to Jakarta's port, spokesman Fajar Tri Rohadi told Reuters news agency on Tuesday.

Local television footage had earlier showed a white plastic box holding the device aboard a speed boat.

It was not immediately clear if it was the plane's flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder that had been recovered.

Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi and other officials were due to hold a news conference later on Tuesday.

The Boeing 737-500 plane with 62 people on board plunged into the Java Sea on Saturday, four minutes after taking off from Jakarta's main airport.

Earlier on Tuesday, more human remains were found at the crash site, as well as personal effects such as wallets containing identification cards.

The plane was headed on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Borneo island, about 740 kilometres from Jakarta, before it disappeared from radar screens.

It was the second major air crash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX also plunged into the Java Sea soon after taking off from Jakarta.

The jet that crashed on Saturday is a largely different design.

Once the flight data and cockpit voice recorders are recovered, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee has said it expects to be able to read the information in three days.

With few immediate clues on what caused a catastrophic loss of control after take-off, investigators will rely heavily on the flight recorders to determine what went wrong.

The Sriwijaya Air plane was nearly 27 years old, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model.

Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.

The monsoon season has caused havoc on the Indonesian island of Bali, causing tonnes of plastic to wash up on beaches along Bali’s west coast, including the popular tourist beaches of Kuta and Seminyak.

One year ago, these beaches were flooded with tourists, now tonnes of plastic debris stand in their absence as community groups take on a colossal clean-up mission to remove the waste washed ashore.

Local sustainability blogger Laura in Waterland and ocean conservationist Emma Sparrow are reporting live from the beaches of Bali as hundreds of locals and ex-pats join the clean-up. However, the mess is too immense for human hands alone. Bulldozers, arranged by the local governor, join the mission by clearing mass piles of plastic to be removed.

Bali’s plastic problem is not a new issue. Since 2010, Indonesia has ranked second in a list of the world’s worst ocean polluters, followed by China. According to a 2017 survey by the Indonesia National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP), Indonesia produces about 6.8 million tonnes of plastic waste annually. According to Global Plastic Action, it is estimated 9% of that waste ends up in the ocean — the equivalent of roughly 620,000 tonnes of plastic waste entering the ocean each year.

Historically, in Indonesia’s popular tourist destination of Bali, critics have been quick to point the finger at foreigners and an unsustainable tourism industry which promotes the use of single-use plastics. However, with international border closures in effect since March 2020, the plastic calamity is much more than an issue of over-tourism.

Mismanagement of waste is a major concern in Indonesia, an island nation with a population of more than 273 million people. It is estimated 48% of waste is openly burned and 13% is dumped in poorly managed landfills, often leading to rivers and lakes.

As Laura explains:

“The monsoon rains flood inland rivers and waterways and they flow through to the beaches and oceans. Westerly winds then push ocean plastic back to the shore primarily effecting the West coast, near to the popular airport destination of Denpasar.”

In March 2019, Minister Luhut B Pandjaitan, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs and Investment, joined forces with the Global Plastic Action Partnership to launch NPAP as a way for leading changemakers from all sectors to collaborate and forge a collective path towards a plastic pollution-free Indonesia. Key objectives such as the increase in plastic waste collection, the reduction or substitution of plastic usage and the redesign of plastic products and packaging are some of the methods that hope to see Indonesia meet their goal of reducing marine plastic leakage by 70% by 2025.

Over the years, local initiatives have also started to join the fight against plastic. Indonesian sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen are cofounders of youth-led organisation Bye Bye Plastic Bags, which aims to encourage businesses and shoppers to replace single-use plastic items like bags.

Local woman Anggie Wayan runs an English language program for disadvantaged children in northern Bali, however, the children offer another currency in exchange for learning — plastic. Anggie’s aim is to teach children not only the English language but also how to respect the planet.

Back on Kuta beach, the fight against plastic is both local and global. Ex-pats and locals continue to clean the debris hoping for some monsoon respite come April.

RAD+ar‘s basic concept was to reduce the internal microclimate by 4°C while maintaining natural light and ventilation throughout the house. the first step in this passive design can be seen on the elevational treatment. the façades are designed to minimize direct sunlight and maximize privacy. however, views from inside are still ensured by controlling the angle of the openings.

floating concrete walls meet air pressure from the swimming pool

the secondary façade acts as the first layer against solar radiation. a buffer space between the concrete panels and large glass openings prevents heat from entering the habitable rooms. as well as function, the concrete panels also serve as a blank canvas for shadowplay from the surrounding vegetation, resulting in an ever-changing façade experience.

view of the double-height buffer space

the buffer space between the concrete panels and glass also acts as a transition area between public and private. residents can enjoy balconies and swimming pools that are contained within these parts of the building. this design strategy provides welcome shade and panoramic vantage points to the lush garden, all the while remaining cleverly concealed from the outside.

the main circulation also acts as a wind chimney

a green roof is applied to reduce heat gain and to maximize rainwater harvesting, which is recycled for irrigation. the roof is also integrated with a series of skylights to ensure that no artificial light is required during the daytime.

residents enter the house via a ramp

a ramp is designed at the entrance of the house, which also serves as a personal gallery for the owner. the ramp leads to an informal living area that opens up directly to the swimming pool and frames a view of the garden. the living room also acts as a space barrier between the privacy of two main bedrooms. breaking with traditional residential layouts, the placement of the living room benefits from two sources of natural light and the sense of sanctuary that is created by the adjacent garden.

thanks to the skylights, the circulation space doesn’t need artificial lighting during the day

‘passive design lab was meant to be a simple prototype of how one could apply a down to earth passive design approach in order to achieve comfort without relying much on artificial/active design for sustainability. in the ongoing unplanned urbanization, urban houses are gradually suffocating, isolating, and cutting off themselves from friendly relationships with the surrounding environment, RAD+ar introduced a solution to help awaken to the facing problem, thereby creating a haven within for majority to stay in a safe place while embracing biophilic and tropical approach with the contemporary house, from the perspective of living harmoniously with the environment.’ – RAD+ar

A new collaborative study led by researchers at the National Institute for Environmental Studies, the University of Tokyo, and Michigan State University exposes the role of dams for mitigating flood risk under climate change.

Flood is amongst the costliest natural disasters. Globally, flood risk is projected to increase in the future, driven by climate change and population growth. The role of dams in flood mitigation, previously unaccounted for, was found to decrease by approximately 15% the number of people globally exposed to historical once-in-100-year floods, downstream of dams during the 21st century.

Currently, about half of major river systems worldwide are regulated by dams and more than 3,700 major dams are planned or under construction. Consequently, to realistically assess population exposure to present and future floods, current and future dam landscapes must be integrated into existing flood modeling frameworks.

Accounting for dams in river flood simulations, the number of people exposed to the historical once-in-100-year flood below dams were 7.2 and 13.4 million on average over 2006-2099 given a low and a medium-high greenhouse gas emission trajectory (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, respectively). The populations exposed to flooding below dams decreased on average by 16.3% and 12.8% for the two trajectories compared to simulations not accounting for the flow regulations produced by dams. At the end of the 21st century, the decrease was further extended to 20.6% and 12.9% respectively.

To maintain the levels of flood protection that dams have provided, new dam operations will be required to offset the effect of climate change, possibly negatively affecting energy production and water storage. In addition, precise and reliable hydro-meteorological forecasts will be invaluable for enhancing flood protection and avoid excessive outflows. Given the many negative environmental and social impacts of dams, comprehensive assessments that consider both potential benefits and adverse effects are necessary for the sustainable development of water resources.

President Joko Widodo visited the command center at Jakarta’s international container terminal where tons of plane debris hauled by divers from seafloor were collected for an investigation into what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on Jan. 9.

He also witnessed the first three relatives of the victims receiving money from the compensation fund.

Sriwijaya Air offered relatives an insurance payout of 1.25 billion rupiah ($89,100), in line with the Indonesian law that stipulates compensation must be offered within 60 days of a crash. In addition, state-owned insurance company Jasa Raharja has provided 50 million rupiah ($3,560) to each family of the victims.

“I assure you that all compensation will be completed immediately for all victims,” Widodo said.

A search is still ongoing for the crucial memory unit of the cockpit voice recorder.

The device apparently broke loose from its exterior and officials have said the underwater locator beacons attached to both crash-proof black boxes became dislodged due to the impact.

The flight data recorded was recovered three days after the crash.

The 26-year-old Boeing had been out of service for almost nine months last year because of flight cutbacks caused by the pandemic.

As floods yet again devastate Shrewsbury, Craig Jackson has urged the public to be vigilant and not to cause avoidable incidents.

Teams at Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service have been working through the day and night to rescue people stranded in cars across the county after they drove into flood water.

The impact of the floods has put more strain on the fire service as new Covid-19 regulations require firefighters to self-isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with some who test positive – this could mean a whole team off at once.

Mr Jackson said that people should be vigilant and not to drive through flood water or even walk through it as there so many dangers.

""One of the main things at the moment is the impact of incidents that are avoidable,"" he said. ""We appreciate there are incidents that are accidental. But people driving into flood water is an incident that can be avoided.

""The general public have to help us. We are in a challenging situation, trying to maintain our availability and remain Covid-safe. The pandemic is having a huge impact on our staffing.

""When an appliance is out on a job, if one person in that appliance tests positive, the whole team has to self-isolate for 10 days. This puts a massive strain on us. The public have to remain vigilant.""

Overnight on Thursday, water rescue crews were active in the Oswestry area rescuing people from vehicles, said Mr Jackson.

""The night before we had lots of incidents where cars had come to rise in water and crews had to rescue them using our boat,"" he said.

""Our main advice is to look at the Government website, and the Environment Agency which provide really good information about flooding. Definitely don't drive into flood water, don't ignore road closure signs.

""As little as 30cm of water can raise a car and start to float away. A lot of the rescues we do are vans and 4x4s as they think they can make it through because they're taller but unfortunately they get stuck too.

""Don't walk through flood water as some people like to have a paddle in their wellies but don't do it. Drain covers can be lifted and so people can get trapped in drains that they can't see. When the water level is also rising, this can be a very dangerous situation.""

Mr Jackson said that everyone at Shropshire Fire and Rescue has put in a lot of work over the past few months.

""I would say a massive thank you to our crews and the teams at fire control. We have had less amount of firefighters through isolation periods. So we have had crews coming in on their rest days to maintain fire cover for the region.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/nNQIVVB1jpukVBmMn_W8F01u2ak=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/DEOWB4WJ4NF6POQYLWOFI3OZQI.jpg,"['plea', 'extra', 'flood', 'jackson', 'covid', 'floods', 'avoid', 'water', 'rescue', 'public', 'dont', 'stretched', 'strain', 'impact', 'service', 'incidents', 'crews']",

74,74,FL-2021-000004-IDN,"Storm Christoph: UK flood response improving, but lockdown confused the messaging - The Conversation UK",https://theconversation.com/storm-christoph-uk-flood-response-improving-but-lockdown-confused-the-messaging-153802,"Overlapping disasters struck parts of England and Wales in January as Storm Christoph battered communities which were already suffering from the effects of a prolonged period under lockdown. It was the first time in recent memory that the UK authorities were required to address two such huge events at the same time.

The storm wreaked havoc, threatening thousands of homes and leading to evacuations in some areas. The costs of yet another major storm will be felt by the affected communities for months to come.

The response to Storm Christoph has revealed the UK’s strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, the authorities are now well versed in handling major floods – learning from previous disasters in Somerset in 2014 and Storm Dennis in 2020.

Extensive early warning, planning, procedures and flood mapping are now in place. Over 300 flood alerts were issued by the Environment Agency in the three days leading up to the storm hitting. This gave communities due warning of the potential of severe flooding. In some instances, prior evacuation by citizens and communities was recommended and indeed required.

So in this sense, crisis communication was good. For the most part, UK emergency planning has become astute at dealing with single hazard emergencies. Incidents that are restricted to geographical areas where local emergency flooding plans can be enacted with more ease.

‘Conflicting advice’

Yet despite a commitment to an “all hazard approach” – planning to meet differing types of shocks and threats – the floods have revealed that the UK is not, in practice, very successful in dealing with overlapping disasters. Multi-hazard threats require agile decision making.

In the case of Storm Christoph, initial indications suggest that there was a lack of joined-up crisis communication which linked flood advice – even evacuation guidance – with the requirements of also meeting COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

People were, in many instances, not clearly informed about how they were supposed to evacuate their homes and meet the requirements of staying within COVID-19 bubbles. There was confusion over what people should do if they were forced to leave their homes. Could they stay with friends? Or would that put them in danger of COVID-19? As Didsbury West councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the BBC:

You have a situation where, for the last year, people have been repeatedly told to stay at home for their safety suddenly getting this conflicting advice.

Nor was it entirely clear how emergency responders would be able to provide flood-related support without making them further vulnerable to COVID-19 contagion.

Key advice was eventually forthcoming – at least in north-west England – where residents were informed that they were exempt from COVID-19 legislation in this scenario and they should not hesitate to evacuate. But the clarity of this advice was far from uniform across the country and was issued at differing times.

Effective crisis communication relies on a clear and timely framing of the challenge – in this case the overlapping disasters. It is also important to outline what the local capabilities and requirements are. And clear information about how the local population can respond to the crisis is crucial. This applies across the world, from the UK to Africa.

My own research, with colleagues at Bournemouth University, shows that poor framing (such as weak communication) can lead to a lack of compliance. This in turn leads to citizens blaming emergency managers for any failures.

People must have trust and confidence that they are both heeding critical flooding advice and staying compliant with pandemic restrictions. This cannot be ignored: flooding is here to stay and lockdowns may be something we all have to learn to live with for the foreseeable future.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/380159/original/file-20210122-19-1fs1r0o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=7%2C838%2C4970%2C2485&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['lockdown', 'flood', 'storm', 'flooding', 'confused', 'communities', 'advice', 'uk', 'improving', 'emergency', 'disasters', 'communication', 'covid19', 'messaging', 'response', 'crisis', 'christoph']", 
75,75,FL-2021-000004-IDN,Earthquake hits already devastated Indonesia | WORLD - WORLD News Group,https://wng.org/roundups/earthquake-hits-already-devastated-indonesia-1617220292,"Corrugated sheets, twisted windowpanes, and concrete rubble littered streets where many buildings once stood in the city of Mamuju on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island. A shallow 6.2-magnitude earthquake rattled the island just after midnight on Friday as many people slept.

Nurwardi, manager of operations at Mamuju’s West Sulawesi General Hospital—the only clinic that survived the earthquake—said people steadily flocked to makeshift tents to receive care. “Many patients do not want to be treated inside the hospital because they’re worried about another quake,” he told the AFP news agency. “Many need surgery but we have limited resources and medicine.”

The earthquake killed at least 90 people, the majority of them in Mamuju, and nearly 300 others sustained serious injuries. Aid workers this week continued to search for survivors and try to access cut-off villages. The quake came in the wake of several other disasters in the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

The earthquake destroyed more than 1,000 homes and other buildings, including the governor’s office and a shopping mall in Mamuju. Thousands of people slept outdoors this week for fear of aftershocks. Nearly 30,000 displaced people moved to shelters in Mamuju and its neighboring district of Majene.

A father of three who identified himself as Robert told the Associated Press he was at Mamuju’s Mitra Manakarra hospital when the earthquake began. The rattling bed woke him up, and he pulled out the drip from his hand before running out. “I cried when I saw the hospital where I was being treated collapse with people still inside,” he said. “I could have died if I got out late.”

Didi Hamzar, the disaster agency’s director of preparedness, said rescuers have pulled at least 18 survivors from collapsed buildings. The region set up a navy hospital ship and field health centers to bolster the medical response. The International Red Cross deployed seven ambulances and first-aid teams to the region. Mark Baker, the director of disaster response with Water Mission, told me his team also sent in a mobile unit to deliver clean water to affected communities. The aid group is also assessing the needs before setting up permanent water treatment systems.

Doni Monardo, Indonesia’s disaster agency chief, said authorities would set up COVID-19 testing sites at the camps. Indonesia has recorded more than 927,000 infections and more than 26,000 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia. Security officers patrolling with loudspeakers reminded people to observe health protocols as markets and gas stations slowly reopened this week.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo mobilized the military and police to aid the rescue and relief operations and pledged more government support during a Tuesday visit to Mamuju: “Soon the central government will rebuild, then for collapsed houses, the government will help for those that were heavily damaged.”

The archipelago nation sits on the “Ring of Fire,” an arch of fault lines in the Pacific Basin, and experiences frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.

Other disasters have struck the country as well. On Monday, Widodo visited southern regions on Borneo island, where flooding last week killed at least 15 people and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. On Jan. 9, a deadly landslide on Java island buried about 40 people. The same day, a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 62 people on board.

“The people of Indonesia inspire the world community as an example of extraordinary resilience,” said Dr. Vlatko Uzevski, emergency response leader for the nonprofit Project HOPE, which is also responding in Sulawesi.

Young Tunisians have gathered on the streets of the capital city of Tunis and other cities since Friday, throwing Molotov cocktails at security forces and holding posters that read, “Employment is a right, not a favor.” The demonstrations began after the government imposed a nationwide coronavirus lockdown on Thursday, the 10th anniversary of the ouster of authoritarian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali during the Arab Spring. Authorities have arrested more than 600 people and deployed troops across several cities, defense ministry spokesman Mohamed Zikri said.

One-third of Tunisia’s youth remain unemployed, and the pandemic has worsened the country’s economic crisis. Tunisia has recorded more than 177,000 COVID-19 infections and more than 5,600 deaths. Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi acknowledged the growing frustration but condemned the looting and violence: “Your voice is heard, and your anger is legitimate, and it is my role and the role of the government to work to realize your demands and to make the dream of Tunisia to become true.”

Amnesty International urged security forces to refrain from using excessive force. —O.O.

Gunmen killed two women Supreme Court judges in Afghanistan last week, the latest in a string of assassinations targeting civilians. The women were driving to their office in the capital city of Kabul when gunmen riding motorcycles opened fire on their car, said Ahmad Fahim Qaweem, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court. Police launched an investigation.

Attacks in recent months have targeted government officials, activists, journalists, and prosecutors. The Taliban denied any involvement. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a November attack on Kabul University that left 22 people dead and 22 others wounded.

The latest violence came two days after the United States said the U.S. troop level in Afghanistan reduced to a record low of 2,500, a stipulation in the U.S.-brokered peace talks. —O.O.

Defense forces in Mozambique’s terrorism-ridden northern province last week rescued 21 hostages abducted by extremists. Authorities said the insurgents captured the 15 women and six children from Matemo island and used them to transport looted goods.

One of the women, Maisha Ambasse, counted up to 30 insurgents and said they planned to take the captives to a Koranic school. Bernardino Rafael, general commander of the police force, said the defense forces knew the terrorists’ location and launched a “smart attack” to rescue the hostages.

A local rebel group called Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama started attacking the port town of Mocímboa da Praia in October 2017. Insurgent attacks in the oil-rich region have killed more than 1,000 civilians and displaced more than 500,000 people.

Indonesia has pursued a strategy of aggressive arrests and violence against peaceful demonstrations for independence since the announcement of a provisional government of West Papua and rejection of Jakarta’s “Special Autonomy” renewal last month, reports the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP).

ULMWP chair Benny Wenda was named interim President of the provisional government on 1 December 2020 as the Papuan people roundly rejected renewal of the failed 2001 Special Autonomy law.

Highlighting the vast resources the Indonesian state is dedicating to crushing dissent over renewal of Special Autonomy status across West Papua, a large convoy of heavily-armed police vehicles was photographed heading toward demonstrations in Manokwari last week on January 11.

On January 7, West Papuan activist Alvarez Kapisa was arrested by Indonesian security forces.

Kapisa helped organise meetings where West Papuan’s overwhelmingly asserted their rejection of the colonial special autonomy law, calling for their legal right to self-determination, decolonisation and independence.

Nine more Papuans were arrested in Biak and Supiori between January 4-7 by joint Indonesian military and police patrols for questioning over their support for Benny Wenda’s provisional government and rejection of special autonomy.

In Biak, they include Yusup Daimboa, Soleman Rumayomi and Yermias Rabrageri, as well as five villagers in Supirori.

In Serui, Frans Kapisa, Yonathan Ruwayari and Yuliana Rumbara have also been detained. The International Lawyers for West Papua has released a statement condemning their treating.

KNPB leader abducted

On January 4, at 5pm, popular activist and National Committee for West Papua (KNPB) leader Naftall Tipagau was abducted by police intelligence agents, alleged ULMWP.

The husband and father was attacked and dragged into a black van in front of his family, in Intan Jaya, where military operations have displaced over 13,000 people.

He is yet to be released and no charges have been made by police.

Tipagau actively reported in Intan Jaya, where the Indonesian military has recently killed Papuan priests.

The recently discovered Wabu Bloc of gold reserves is planned for extraction by Freeport McMoran, the mining company responsible for decades of environmental destruction and human rights abuses at the Grasberg gold and copper mine in West Papua.

Papuans and political leaders around the world were horrified on January 6 as plans for a complete “ethnic cleansing” of Papuans were revealed by Indonesian General Hendropriyono.

Plan to remove Papuans

The retired Kopassus general and former head of the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (BIN) declared his proposal to forcibly remove two million Papuans from their homeland and replace them with Indonesians.

He stated his plans for Indonesia to “transmigrate these two million people to Manado and move two million Manadonese over to Papua. What for? So that we could racially separate them from Papuans in PNG, so that they could feel more like Indonesians instead of foreigners”.

This plan for ethnic cleansing matches the history of Indonesian population management, described as settler colonialism by a recent study.

In 1985, the head of the Indonesian “Transmigration” policy of population resettlement described the aim of the programme thus: “The different ethnic groups will in the long run disappear because of integration, and there will be one kind of man.”

That same day, on January 6, Indonesian forces tortured and killed Mispo Gwijangge, a Papuan who was only 14 years old when he was first arrested in 2018. The 16-year-old boy was falsely charged with the killing of 17 Indonesian soldiers in Nduga, and was imprisoned and tortured for 333 days.

In Serui, Papuan elder and chairman of West Papua National Authority (WPNA) Waropen regency, Jeremias Rabrageri, was arrested by colonial Indonesian forces on December 30 along with his son, Reiner Rabrageri, after declaring his support for Benny Wenda’s provisional West Papuan government.

In the week before Christmas, 4850 TNI soldiers were deployed to West Papua to assist the Indonesian police. TNI soldiers were placed throughout West Papua to shut down the peaceful demonstrations marking two decades of failed special autonomy that ended on January 1 and the displays of support for Benny Wenda’s provisional government.

Confession to torture

This deployment comes alongside a confession on December 23 by an Indonesian military chief that TNI soldiers tortured, murdered and burned two West Papuan brothers in their custody, alleges ULMWP.

The bodies of Luther and Apinus Zanambani were then thrown into a river in April 2020.

This is not the only recent execution carried out. On 26 October 2020, Catholic Catechist Rufinus Tigau was also murdered by the TNI in a village raid.

On the anniversary of Indonesia’s 1961 attempted invasion of West Papua, on December 19, Indonesian police arrested both Indonesians and Papuans who came together to peacefully protest 59 years of human rights abuses.

Lombok was the signing place of a notorious treaty between Indonesia and Australia, in which the latter promised to avoid upsetting Indonesia’s occupation of West Papua.

Indonesian police attacked West Papuan students peacefully protesting against Indonesian human rights abuses, arresting 18 students in Nabire on 10 December 2020.

Fourteen members of the National Committee for West Papua (KNPB) were also arrested in Merauke and accused of treason on December 12, including chairman of the Merauke branch Charles Sraun, by Indonesian police, who also destroyed the KNPB office. They remain incarcerated and their families have been denied visitation rights.

Media investigate Indonesian propaganda

In December, Australian and British media began investigating the Indonesian government’s use of propaganda and fake social media accounts.

Indonesian intelligence has been running a coordinated social media campaign to discredit the West Papuan independence movement, attributing online posts supporting Indonesia’s colonisation to UK politicians and Australian officials.

This followed a Bellingcat investigation exposing Indonesia’s creation of fake profiles to disseminate pro-occupation propaganda that have flooded Facebook and Twitter in the past 12 months.

On 12 January 2021, the Netherlands became the 83rd international state calling for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to be allowed into West Papua.

This comes after similar calls by the UK government on November 11 following a declaration of concern over killings of Papuans by Indonesian forces by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://asiapacificreport.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Militarised-police-convoy-at-Manokwari-ULMWP-680wide.png,"['special', 'provisional', 'rights', 'arrested', 'papua', 'human', 'papuan', 'west', 'ulmwp', 'papuans', 'accuses', 'ethnic', 'indonesian', 'cleansing', 'indonesia', 'aggression']",

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who visited evacuees at Dewan Datuk Sri Panglima Mohd Dun Banir relief centre yesterday, said this would include proposed measures to deepen the Padas River and realigning its riverbanks, among other measures.

“On the part of the state government, we will take into consideration all proposals because we are not going to relent in our efforts to address the flood problem in Beaufort, ” he said.

Beaufort is one of the districts that experienced serious flooding following downpour and the high tide phenomenon last week. The district is also known to be flood-prone, especially if heavy rains occurred in the interior divisions of Tenom and Keningau, causing the river passing by the town to overflow.

Hajiji presented flood evacuees with cash assistance and food baskets, which were also given to flood victims in other districts.

He assured that the state government would do its best to assist the flood victims.

The Chief Minister said while it was unfortunate that flood had been a problem in Beaufort for quite some time, causing much hardship to the people there, it was vital that the residents comply with directives, particularly when it comes to evacuating and moving to higher ground.

In general, he said those at the temporary shelters statewide were advised to always observe the Covid-19 SOP set by the government.

“We don’t want them to be victims of flood and Covid-19 too, ” he said.

Meanwhile, Hajiji also visited the Padas Bridge and Kampung Pimping Paddy Cluster area in Membakut which were flooded.

the first courtyard is located at the front of the residence. it acts as a soft transition between the busy main road and the house and as an entrance foyer to greet guests. unlike most internalized foyers, the front courtyard makes entering a special experience. it’s also a place for the owner to enjoy his beloved koi fish.

the living room is the heart of the home and is positioned in between the front and central courtyard. in this double-height space, residents can enjoy a feeling of openness from both sides. screens to the front courtyard ensure privacy at all times while the glass to the central courtyard slides fully to bring a semi-outdoor feel to the living room. additionally, the sound of water blocks external noise and establishes a serene atmosphere inside the house.

the central courtyard, which connects to the living and dining room, also becomes the main place for the family to hang out and exercise in the swimming pool. they often bring drinks from the pantry and sit by the pool to enjoy the day. this courtyard has a lush vertical garden, which provides the main view of the house and the main internal view to two bedrooms. the master bedroom is located at the front of the house and is visually connected to the front courtyard below.

the timber screens on the front elevation work threefold: to block heat from the sun, to dramatize sun rays that come inside the house, and to enhance privacy. with these screens, residents can freely open the window without being afraid of someone outside seeing directly into the house. and then at night, the screens become a lantern, giving the architecture a special, distinguishing feature.

tamara wibowo architects decided to re-present one of these two retaining walls, turning it into an important element that establishes the meaning of the inner courtyard. this private yard is further defined by the ‘floating’ volume of the second floor that provides shelter to the back of the residence, creating a comfortable outdoor area that feels like an indoor space at the same time.

the residence takes the shape of a steeply angled roof creating an A-frame with a secondary skin made out of custom-designed cement breeze blocks. the facade is completed with a series of protruded corten elements that frame the opening of the residence.besides acting as a passive cooling strategy, the breeze blocks also serve to reduce visual connection from outside to inside, maintaining privacy within the house.

natural elements also play an important role when it comes to the facade, with the design incorporating treewithin the in-between spaces of the dwelling, so that the branches and leaves emerge through the breeze blocks’ small openings. in this way, the facade is formed to be ever-changing, growing along with the surrounding vegetation. the trees are physically intertwined with the architecture, in order to give a dynamic character, as well as a fresh energy to the house.

a spiral staircase was placed in the middle of the house unifying the spaces in the house, rather than breaking them apart. it appears as a sculptural element of the house that creates a sense of movement throughout the interior. facilitating the occupants’ circulation, the distinct staircase makes the house more flexible, convenient and energetic.

There were even up to eight quakes in a day.

“Indonesia is experiencing a significant increase in quake activity, the shock is felt by the people,” said the BMKG quake and tsunami mitigation coordinator, Daryono.

He explained via a written statement today, Jan. 20, that the natural disaster occurred almost every day except on Jan. 10 and 17. On January 14, Indonesian regions were hit by eight strong quakes that were felt by many.

The current condition, according to Daryono, is abnormal. Compared to the quake data in January 2020, there were 54 occurrences in a month. Besides, the cause of the rising activity of powerful quakes had not been discovered yet.

The BMKG suspected that it was attributable to the change in the stress pattern globally, regionally, or even locally, which led to an increase in strong earthquakes. However, Daryono argued that the most important thing is to recognize and differentiate the various kinds of quakes for disaster mitigation purposes.

Text description provided by the architects. Arti Design Studio, in collaboration with Studio Laurencia, has renovated Lei Lo, an Asian fusion restaurant located in Senopati, South Jakarta. In this project, the architects rethink customer journey using transparency design.

The long entrance pathway introduces the customers to Asian fusion concept, starting with a few of its elements: wood and brass tapestry. Here, the customer get a glimpse and a feel to the world inside Lei Lo. nAside from serving as a transition, the area acts as a waiting area (with wooden seats for comfort and standing tables to place coffee) and a shelter from Jakarta’s weathers, be it scorching sun or heavy rainfall. A touch of nature, long grass grows inside a row of planter pots which protects the building from the occasional rainy season floods. The plants also acts as view buffer from dining to parking area.

When it comes to the word Asian, generally, the masses think of ornaments, such as red lanterns. Instead of going with it, Arti Design Studio dig deeper to the roots, researching down to the specific materials. The combination of dark wood and stone makes the entire restaurant feels homy, not only looks Asian. This leaves a deeper impression.

Observing customer behavior, upon entering the room, the customers would choose the best seat—the one with the best view. However, the existing spot were deemed undesirable as it faces parking area and basks in Jakarta sun heat. For that reason, the architects design buffers (brass tapestry structure and planter box) hence resulted in attractive view and unique shadow play. Seeing from business point of view, the design increases capacity efficiency.

The VIP room was secluded yet lively. Its rattan door allows the VIP costumers to see the silhouette movements from the other side of the restaurant, giving the customers a sense of privacy and belonging at the same time. Arti Design Studio makes sure its design gives the best experience. Aside from giving touches of nature, planter boxes that surround the tables also acts as view buffers to the waiters passing by. The plants also hide service station behind the blue box. This way, the customers’ experience won’t be disturbed by the service scenes.

One of the problems to tackle in the renovation is the existing floor to floor height. To create a taller illusion, the architects designed open plafond with squares to hide air conditioner and exhaust. These squares are repetitions from the brass tapestry outside and ceramic tiles inside. Its overall cohesiveness helps create a strong visual brand identity that is memorable for the customers.","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/6007/0069/63c0/1724/cf00/01d0/large_jpg/Jonathan_Raditya_-_01_FI.jpg?1611071575,"['leilo', 'inside', 'tapestry', 'view', 'customers', 'asian', 'planter', 'design', 'restaurant', 'arti', 'studio', 'architects']",

Incessant rain caused flash floods in several low-lying neighbourhoods in Kuching.

The rain is expected to continue for several more days.

The Salvation Army distributed noodles, rice, eggs, Milo, towels, biscuits, packet drinks and face masks.

Children at the hall were also given snacks to cheer them up.

According to the Welfare Department’s records, 207 people or 58 families are seeking temporary shelter at the location.

The families also required food as cooking was not allowed at the evacuation centres in compliance with the department’s standard operating procedures.

The kitchen crew cooking and packing chicken porridge for distribution.



So The Salvation Army returned the next day with chicken porridge for the evacuees’ lunch and dinner.

Food aid was also distributed in the flooded Kampung Kudei, a village on Green Road.

Villagers said they were unable to evacuate due to the Covid-19 pandemic and were advised to remain on the top floors of their houses, while they waited for further assistance and for the floodwaters to subside.

They were also unable to buy groceries as the floodwaters prevented them from heading outside.

The Salvation Army Kuching Corps officer Captain Raymond Rubi Aloba said evacuation centres could not accommodate too many people because of the pandemic risks.

“In addition to food and water, people seeking temporary shelter at the centres also require face masks and hand sanitisers to ensure they protect themselves from the virus.

“They are also at risk of water-borne diseases such as typhoid and cholera as the floodwaters may carry those diseases, so cleanliness is essential, ” he said.

The Salvation Army hopes that individuals and corporations will donate essentials to lighten the load of the flood victims when they return to their respective homes.

Among the essentials needed are cleaning tools (bleach, cleaning detergent, mop, broom, shovel and rubber gloves), stationery, school uniforms, school bags and shoes (for primary and secondary school students), groceries (rice, noodles, cooking oil, canned food and biscuits), mineral water, disposable face masks (for children and adults) and hand sanitisers.

All items must be in good condition and delivered to The Salvation Army Kuching Corps & Community Services at Sekama Road.

Cash donations can be made via direct banking to The Salvation Army, Maybank account number 500511960365.

Meanwhile, government sources said there were ""concerns around vaccine deployment"".

Ministers had already warned that the target of vaccinating all over-70s by Feb 15 would be ""tight"" following recent supply issues, and any suspension of the programme in some areas would mean NHS workers having to deploy vaccines faster, to catch up. A source said: ""At the moment, the vaccination centres remain open and we are telling people they should still attend appointments. But if they are unable to get there or if the centres have to be closed, we will reschedule their jabs.""

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the Government was ""alive"" to the issue of people needing Covid-secure accommodation.

An Environment Agency spokesman said another option for those shielding would be to stay with family or friends temporarily, which would not breach lockdown laws as leaving home to escape risk of harm was permitted.

Mr Johnson urged people to heed warnings if advised to leave their homes.

He said: ""There are some times where I have been to scenes where, alas, people have decided not to obey the advice and not evacuated. It is their right not to do so if they choose - but it really is ­advisable - follow the advice.""

Army placed on standby

The Army has been placed on standby to help with potential flooding.

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs: ""Our sympathies also go out to those affected by the latest floods.

""I want to thank the Environment Agency and our emergency services for the work they're doing to support those communities, and I'll be chairing a Cobra meeting later on to co-ordinate the national response.""

The average rainfall in West Yorkshire for the entire month of January is 90mm, while in Greater Manchester it is 103mm.

But this week, over 100 mm of rain is expected across the higher ground with the potential for 150-200 mm of rain in the most exposed areas.

More than 120mm of rain has already fallen in parts of the country, with 123.4mm at Honister Pass in Cumbria in the 24 hours up to 6am on Wednesday.

Nearby Seathwaite saw the second highest total, with 107.2mm, and some isolated spots could see up to 200mm, the Met Office said.","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.youtube.com/vi/w-5qqP-4ROA/maxresdefault.jpg,"['rain', 'storm', 'environment', 'johnson', 'come', 'spokesman', 'mm', 'prime', 'placed', 'worse', 'evacuated', 'thousands', 'potential', 'boris', 'warns', 'ministers', 'centres', 'christoph']",

The green leafy vegetables like spinach are more badly affected because they spoil easily in water.""A 45-year-old vegetable stallholder at Geylang Serai Market, who runs the business with her husband and wanted to be known only as Madam Rashidah, said: ""I had to get vegetables from Thailand and Vietnam, which are flown in. This method is more expensive, causing my prices to go up as well.""Severe flooding in Malaysia over the past few weeks has resulted in tens of thousands being evacuated from their homes. More than 48,000 people in six states were sheltering in 400 relief centres on Friday (Jan 8).At the Pasir Ris and Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre, the price of tomatoes has almost doubled, from $2 per kilogram to $3 per kilogram.A market vendor in Tekka Centre said his cost price for tomatoes has more than doubled from $12 per 10kg to $28, while a vendor in Pasir Ris said his supplies for the vegetable now cost $32 per 10kg, up from about $10.The vice-secretary of the Singapore Fruits & Vegetables Importers & Exporters Association, Mr Jerry Tan, noted that prices usually tended to tick upwards towards the end of the year because of the monsoon season, but this year has been exceptional.He said: ""Usually, some areas in Cameron Highlands that still get some sun will be able to supply tomatoes. But this year, the entire area has been raining for the past few weeks. When this happens, the tomatoes cannot ripen and the supply will be affected.""He said that compared with the past week, the price of tomatoes from Malaysia had skyrocketed by up to 150 per cent.He said: ""We've never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time before. But suppliers are trying to get their stocks from Thailand and Vietnam, so prices should start to drop and will stabilise soon.""He added that the supply for spinach has also been badly affected as it is easily perishable, and thus not easy to get from farther afield, like from Thailand.Prices for seafood, such as fish and prawns, have also crept upwards.Goh Thiam Chwee, the chairman of the Singapore Fish Merchants' General Association, told ST that the prices of popular items , such as Chinese pomfret and red snapper, have jumped by about 20 per cent, and may possibly increase to 30 per cent as Chinese New Year approaches.Goh said: ""Every year, the prices will increase towards the monsoon season because of the fluctuating sea conditions. But seafood is not so badly affected because we also get our supply from other countries, and if needed, we can replace with frozen fish in the interim.""At Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre and Tekka Centre, Chinese pomfret and white pomfret were costing at least 20 per cent more.""The Chinese pomfret and white pomfret are the two most popular types of fishes during the Chinese New Year season. Due to the monsoon season, the supply of them are very low and that caused the price to escalate,"" said Mrs Niam Leng Hwa, a fishmonger at Ghim Moh Road Market & Food Centre.Some consumers took the price rises in their stride.Office worker Liu Shao Ai, 44, who frequents Chinatown Wet Market, said: ""I'm not particularly shocked or surprised (by the higher prices), after all the monsoon season cannot be helped.

92,92,FL-2021-000004-IDN,Hunt for buried survivors after Indonesia earthquake - Gulf Times,https://m.gulf-times.com/story/682614/Hunt-for-buried-survivors-after-Indonesia-earthquake,"Rescuers scrambled to find buried survivors yesterday after a powerful earthquake on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island killed dozens, injured hundreds and left more feared trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, as monsoon rains lashed the disaster-struck region.

At least 46 people died after the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Friday, triggering panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.

Body bags were filled with corpses hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins. Others were killed south of the city.

Grieving relatives began burying the dead yesterday and it remained unclear how many more victims could still be under mounds of twisted metal and chunks of concrete strewn across the seaside community. Planes and boats packed with food and other emergency supplies flowed in, as the navy reportedly sent a ship equipped with mobile medical services to take pressure off Mamuju’s still-standing hospitals, which have been flooded with hundreds of injured.

Rescuers said a shortage of heavy equipment was slowing the search effort. Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters - many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with families - that were lashed by heavy downpours.

“We’re running out of food. There hasn’t been any aid from the government yet,” 24-year-old survivor Desti told AFP from hard-hit Majene. “Some people are using coconut leaves as mats,” she added. Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or too scared to go back fearing more quakes or a tsunami.

Worried about an outbreak of Covid-19 in the crowded camps, authorities said they are trying to separate high and lower-risk groups. Mamuju resident Ice said he and his family were buried under rubble when they heard the voices of children searching for those still alive. “They were shouting ‘Who’s alive?’ and after hearing that I said ‘Yes, I’m alive’ and then me and my family were able to crawl out from under the rubble,” said the man, who sustained a broken arm.

James, a construction supply seller taking refuge at a bus depot, said he leapt from the second storey of his home just before the violent tremor flattened the building. “After shaking a few times, the house collapsed,” he said, adding that his parents and sister also managed to escape. A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.

But the news was more grim for many, as eight corpses were plucked from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.","Sun, 17 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://m.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/slider/1202117043915574015.jpg,"['sulawesi', 'gulftimes', 'killed', 'buried', 'family', 'rubble', 'yesterday', 'quake', 'plucked', 'collapsed', 'alive', 'survivors', 'hunt', 'earthquake', 'indonesia']", 
93,93,FL-2021-000004-IDN,Archeologists Have Found the World’s Oldest Known Cave Painting in Indonesia - Prestige Online,https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/pursuits/art-culture/archeologists-have-found-the-worlds-oldest-known-cave-painting-in-indonesia/,"The world’s oldest known cave painting is a life-sized picture of a wild pig that was made at least 45,500 years ago in Indonesia.

The finding described in the journal Science Advances provides the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. Co-author Maxime Aubert of Australia’s Griffith University told AFP it was found on the island of Sulawesi in 2017 by doctoral student Basran Burhan, as part of surveys the team was carrying out with Indonesian authorities.

The Leang Tedongnge cave is located in a remote valley enclosed by sheer limestone cliffs, about an hour’s walk from the nearest road. It is only accessible during the dry season because of flooding during the wet season — and members of the isolated Bugis community told the team it had never before been seen by Westerners.

Measuring 136 by 54 centimetres, the Sulawesi warty pig was painted using dark red ochre pigment and has a short crest of upright hair, as well as a pair of horn-like facial warts characteristic of adult males of the species. There are two hand prints above the pig’s hindquarters, and it appears to be facing two other pigs that are only partially preserved, as part of a narrative scene.

“The pig appears to be observing a fight or social interaction between two other warty pigs,” said co-author Adam Brumm.

Humans have hunted Sulawesi warty pigs for tens of thousands of years, and they are a key feature of the region’s prehistoric artwork, particularly during the Ice Age.

Early human migration

Aubert, a dating specialist, identified a calcite deposit that had formed on top of the painting, then used Uranium-series isotope dating to confidently say the deposit was 45,500 years old. This makes the painting at least that age, “but it could be much older because the dating that we’re using only dates the calcite on top of it,” he explained.

“The people who made it were fully modern, they were just like us, they had all of the capacity and the tools to do any painting that they liked,” he added.

The previously oldest dated rock art painting was found by the same team in Sulawesi. It depicted a group of part-human, part-animal figures hunting mammals, and was found to be at least 43,900 years old. Cave paintings such as these also help fill in gaps about our understanding of early human migrations.

It’s known that people reached Australia 65,000 years ago, but they would probably have had to cross the islands of Indonesia, known as “Wallacea.” This site now represents the oldest evidence of humans in Wallacea, but it’s hoped further research will help show people were in the region much earlier, which would resolve the Australia settlement puzzle.

The team believes the artwork was made by Homo sapiens, as opposed to now extinct human species like Denisovans, but cannot say this for certain. To make handprints, the artists would have had to place their hands on a surface then spit pigment over it, and the team are hoping to try to extract DNA samples from residual saliva.
