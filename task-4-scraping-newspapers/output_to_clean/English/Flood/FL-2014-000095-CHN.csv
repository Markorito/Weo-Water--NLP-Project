Forget the future. The world already is nearly five times as dangerous and disaster prone as it was in the 1970s, because of the increasing risks brought by climate change, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization.

The first decade of the 21st century saw 3,496 natural disasters from floods, storms, droughts and heat waves. That was nearly five times as many disasters as the 743 catastrophes reported during the 1970s—and all of those weather events are influenced by climate change.

The bottom line: natural disasters are occurring nearly five times as often as they were in the 1970s. But some disasters—such as floods and storms—pose a bigger threat than others. Flooding and storms are also taking a bigger bite out of the economy. But heat waves are an emerging killer.

1) We’re going to need a bigger boat—or flood defenses

Flooding and mega-storms were by far the leading cause of disaster from 2000-2010. About 80 percent of the 3,496 disasters of the last decade were due to flooding and storms. Seas are rising because of climate change. So are extreme rain storms. There is growing evidence that warming temperatures are increasing the destructive force of hurricanes.



2) Heat waves are the new killer

Heat waves didn’t even register as a threat in the 1970s. By 2010, they were one of the leading causes of deaths in natural disasters, along with storms. In Russia alone, more than 55,000 people died as a result of heat wave in 2010.



3) Floods are getting more costly

Disasters were about 5.5 times more expensive by 2010 than they were in the 1970s, and most of that was because of the rising losses due to floods. The cost of disasters rose to $864 billion in the last decade.



4) Nearly all of the 8,835 disasters—about 89 percent—were due to flooding and storms

5) But storms were by far the bigger threat to life, accounting for about 1.45 million of the 1.94 million global disaster deaths. Drought was the next big killer, mainly because of the horrific toll during the 1980s famine in Africa

6) About half of the $2390.7 billion cost of disasters over the last 40 years was due to storms, with hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy, both in the US, accounting for $196.9 billion of those damages

7) Droughts in East Africa in the 1970s and 1980s were the deadliest disasters of modern times, killing 600,000 in Ethiopia, Mozambique Somalia, and Sudan. But storms were also a big killer for Bangladesh

8) Hurricanes and other severe storms are taking an increasing toll on the US economy. Five of the costliest global disasters were in the US. All five were caused by storms, and caused a total of $294 billion in damage","Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/hurricane-sandy-630.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['charts', 'floods', 'nearly', '1970s', 'storms', 'times', 'waves', 'heat', 'making', 'change', 'disasters', 'billion', 'climate', 'world', 'dangerous']", 
2,2,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Flood Prediction in...Space? New Model Harnesses NASA Satellite Data - NBCNews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/flood-prediction-space-new-model-harnesses-nasa-satellite-data-n149846,"Researchers have figured out a new way to predict which rivers are most at risk of dangerous flooding.

To do so, they measured how much water was stored in a river basin months ahead of the spring flood season.

""Just like a bucket can only hold so much water, the same concept applies to river basins,"" said lead study author J.T. Reager, an earth scientist at the University of California, Irvine. When the ground is saturated, or filled to its brim, conditions are ripe for flooding. [Top 10 Deadliest Natural Disasters in History]

Reager and his colleagues looked back in time using satellite data, and measured how much water was soaking the ground before the 2011 Missouri River floods. The researchers found their statistical model strongly predicted this major flood event five months in advance. With less reliability, the prediction could be extended to 11 months in advance, the researchers said.

""This gives the background on what's on the ground before the rain even gets there,"" Reager said.

The findings were published July 6 in the journal Nature Geoscience.

The 2011 Missouri River floods lasted for months, closing interstates, shutting down nuclear plants and scouring farmland. The National Weather Service issued flood alerts in April, a month before flooding began.

Reager hopes his new method will eventually help forecasters prepare reliable flood warnings several months earlier. ""It would be amazing if this could have a positive effect and potentially save lives,"" he said.

The researchers relied on NASA's twin GRACE satellites to diagnose a region's flood potential. As the satellites circle the Earth, changes in gravity slightly perturb their orbit. These tugs are proportional to changes in mass, such as a buildup of water and snow. (GRACE was originally designed to track melting in the ice sheets.)

The team used GRACE to look at all potential water sources, including snow, surface water, soil moisture and groundwater.

3,3,FL-2014-000095-CHN,How a flood-prone village in the US moved to drier ground - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20140713090240-3s7nq/,"After the Great Flood of 1993, Valmeyer headed uphill - and is now a model for other low-lying communities

VALMEYER, Illinois (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Hidden among tracts of farmland here in the fertile Mississippi River floodplain are asphalt chunks of what was once a road. In the shadow of a steep hill lies the floor of an old school gymnasium.

There was once a village here, home to 900 people. But shortly after midnight on August 2, 1993, the swollen Mississippi River – normally a few miles to the west - burst through the levee protecting the community.

Residents had evacuated the village two days earlier, so no one was hurt. But within hours of the breach, parts of Valmeyer were under 6 feet (2 metres) of water. The flood level in the lowest-lying parts of the village peaked at 16 feet (nearly 5 metres), displacing 2,500 people from Valmeyer and nearby farms.

Valmeyer had for centuries suffered from floods, but the Great Flood of 1993 – as it came to be known – was one of the worst in recent history, inundating 20 million acres (80,000 square kilometres) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The flooding caused $15 billion in damage across nine U.S. Midwestern states, including Illinois, and destroyed 10,000 homes.

“Most people didn’t want to ever have to go through an event like this again, and they didn’t want their kids and grandkids and future generations to have to go through an event like this again,” said Dennis Knobloch, a county official who was the village mayor in 1993 and saw his community through the flood and its aftermath.

So Valmeyer did what many vulnerable, disaster-prone communities around the world have considered: It moved to safer ground.

Climate change, coupled with deforestation to make way for cities and farms and population growth that results in people living in increasingly vulnerable places, is leading to more severe and frequent natural disasters, scientists say. Those disasters are forcing millions to relocate temporarily or even permanently to safer areas. An estimated 31.7 million people were displaced by weather-related disasters in 2012 alone, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.

These migrants are on the move in some cases because of government mandates, and in other cases because their homes and property have vanished completely.

In Valmeyer, nine out of ten homes were irreparable following the 1993 floods. Under federal guidelines, a home built after a flood on the same plot of land must be a foot (30 cm) above the base flood elevation – which would have meant building on 12- to 15-foot-high (3.5- to 4.5m-high) stilts.

“The only way we’ll be able to keep the town intact is if we move it because if we don’t, a lot of the people are probably going to scatter to the winds, and Valmeyer would cease to exist,” Knobloch recalled telling residents.

Sixty percent voted to move to a new Valmeyer.

LOGISTICS OF MOVING A VILLAGE

Valmeyer lay at the foot of a steep 400-foot-high bluff, atop which lay vast swathes of farmland, so a move up to higher and drier land did not necessarily mean a move far away.

Village administrators set their sights on a 500-acre (200-hectare) piece of land, and the family that had been farming it for 150 years agreed to sell it for $6,000 per acre ($14,800 per hectare).

“Thing is, we didn’t have a dime at that point,” Knobloch said during an interview in his office in the neighbouring town of Waterloo. Most people had been staying with friends and family, renting homes or living in trailer homes provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Yet by Nov. 1, 1993, determined citizen committees had mapped out preliminary plans for everything from sewers to streetlights, including residential areas, the new school and Valmeyer’s Catholic, Protestant and Baptist churches.

Armed with the drafts, Knobloch met with government agencies in the state capital Springfield and with Congress in Washington, to see if their plans were feasible and to ask for support and advice.

In the second week of December, villagers held a groundbreaking ceremony on the new land, and hopped aboard a tractor to tour the grounds and pick their new plots, which were priced at half the market rate – 50 cents a square foot ($5 per square meter).

Over the next few months – to the relief of residents who had lost their homes and already paid for land in a village that did not yet exist – a government buyout program paid residents the pre-flood market value for their flooded homes, a total of $11.7 million for 334 plots of land.

BUILDING BACK BETTER

Word spread that Valmeyer was planning a move and even before floodwaters had receded experts were calling Knobloch with advice about how to build back the village in a sustainable way.

“I was on a cell phone, and I was up in my knees in water, standing out in town doing something... and I said, ‘What the hell is sustainable and who cares?’”

But after meeting with “a bunch of crazy-minded liberals” convened by President Bill Clinton’s Council on Sustainable Development, as well as Clinton himself and his cabinet, Valmeyer residents tweaked their plans.

They re-angled the homes on their blueprints to capture the maximum amount of sunlight; added superinsulated windows to capture light yet keep out the cold. Some homes added water-filled pipes buried deep underground to save energy and money on heating and cooling.

While the old Valmeyer sprawled across 600 acres (240 hectares), the post-flood village was tightly planned on 280 acres (110 hectares), with tidy homes walking distance from the town center.

A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT

The first people moved into the new Valmeyer in April 1995. The following year, the new school opened, bringing the village to life.

Nearly two decades later, Valmeyer is a case study for a community’s response to repeated natural disasters.

Its story has been told in a musical performed in New York City in 2001. The tale also is now on display in Washington, DC, at the National Building Museum’s Designing for Disaster exhibit, continuing through August 2015.

“Valmeyer’s story is a simple yet powerful one: If you’re frequently at risk for flooding, move out of harm’s way,” Christine Canabou, the associate curator for the exhibit, told Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.

“Rather than rebuild the same old way — dams and levees have been the historical given — the community, with support from local, state, and federal agencies, fundamentally questioned how and where to build. Rather than control nature, they decided to adapt to and accommodate the inevitability of more floods,” Canabou said, noting that Valmeyer was the first and largest of four communities to move after the 1993 flood.

Included in the exhibit are pieces of a 54-foot-long (16-meter-long) mural from Valmeyer’s public library.

Painted on a layer of plaster by students and residents with the assistance of visiting artist Olivia Gude, the mural shows Valmeyer’s history. A river was painted across its entire length, with the central theme being “a river runs through it”. It was dedicated in May 1993.

“Sixty-eight days later, the river ran through it. The mural was completely under water during the flood,” Knobloch said.

The plaster mural fell off the wall and shattered into pieces, which Knobloch collected into boxes and saved – just in case they, like the town, could one day be pieced together again.

The main airport on Okinawa reopened Wednesday, although some morning flights were canceled. Spokesman Takumi Higa said no damage had been reported.

Though it has weakened, Neoguri is still packing wind gusts of up to 162 kilometers per hour. But the main concern now is the slow-moving storm's heavy rainfall.

Authorities warned of record rainfall in Okinawa as rivers in some areas overflowed. More than 200,000 residents were told to leave their homes, down from over 500,000 on Tuesday.

Forecasters warn that the island of Kyushu could see at least 300 millimeters (12 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period through mid-day Thursday.

Airports in Kyushu were still open, but late flights were canceled.

Kyushu's Fukuoka Prefecture issued warnings for strong winds, high tides and heavy rains, and advised people to stay indoors as much as possible.

Satoshi Ebihara with Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that a serious disaster is still possible, including landslides and flooding.

""This is an abnormal situation with impending serious danger. This is a situation where it would not be surprising for a serious disaster to have happened by now,"" said Ebihara.

As flash floods return with a vengeance, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has cited the 22 most flood-prone areas that commuters and motorists should avoid during a downpour.

A list issued by the MMDA on Tuesday identified them as follows:

España-Antipolo-Maceda in Manila

P. Burgos-Manila City Hall vicinity

Osmeña-Skyway (northbound) in Makati City

Osmeña-Skyway (southbound)

Edsa-North Avenue in Quezon City

Don Bosco, Makati

Buendia-South Superhighway (southbound and northbound)

Quezon Avenue-Victory Avenue/Biak na Bato

C-5-BCDA in Taguig City

R. Papa-Rizal Avenue in Manila

C-5-McKinley Road

C-5-Bayani Road

Philcoa area, Quezon City

Emerson Carlos, MMDA assistant general manager for operations, said flood-control crews equipped with mobile pumps and other equipment are ready for deployment in these areas.

MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the agency would train at least 10 barangay tanod (village watchmen) in each flood-prone area to assist MMDA traffic marshals in easing the resulting gridlock or rerouting vehicles.

The watchmen to be tapped for traffic management duties will be provided uniforms and allowances, he said.

Carlos explained that the recent street floods and resulting traffic jams were largely caused by the 77 ongoing road projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways around the metropolis. Of the 77 projects, 49 involve road diggings and drainage works.

The public could expect “a big relief” once these projects are finished, he said.

But he maintained that flooding was no longer as bad as in previous years in some cities. “Take the case of San Juan City, which was perennially a flood-prone area. With the completion of three local pumping stations, flooding there has almost become nonexistent.”

The celebrity journalist, CCTV’s Rui Chenggang, was taken away by prosecutors before his appearance on the nightly newscast — his absence was conspicuous, as a second microphone remained on the set. The show is usually anchored by two people.

His arrest came less than two months after his boss was detained on suspicion of taking bribes during an ongoing investigation into high-level corruption at China's biggest state-run network. In May, CCTV's financial news director Guo Zhenxi was detained. A few months earlier, a former CCTV vice president also has come under corruption investigation.

It wasn't immediately clear why Chenggang — who has more than 10 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, and is seen as a face of modern China — was arrested. But on Monday, the Twitter account for People's Daily, the official newspaper of the government of China, alleged that Chenggang held shares in a Beijing subsidiary of Edelman PR, a public relations firm that provides services for CCTV, suggesting the detainment could be related to a wider corruption probe at the broadcaster.

According to one local Beijing outlet, Chenggang’s family allegedly ran a pay-to-play PR firm that charged people to appear on air.

Rui has interviewed many world leaders and business magnates and is known for his nationalistic streak. He has more than 10 million followers on his Twitter-like microblog page.

“As a result of rising imports, United States Steel has suffered mightily — orders have been reduced, mills have been idled and jobs have been lost,” Mr. Longhi said in a statement. “Our only recourse against such actions was with the U.S. Department of Commerce and their ability to support the rule of law and create a level playing field for American manufacturing.”

The South Korean Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The action by the United States to impose duties on the steel imports is part of a larger international battle over the manufacture of steel, which is critical in most construction.

And the decision on steel tubes from South Korea and the other exporters is a smaller-scale version of the efforts by American companies to combat what they claim is unfair competition by Chinese companies. American executives say the subsidization of manufacturing by the Chinese government, along with currency manipulation and other factors, gives the Chinese competitors an unfair advantage.

The dumping allegations are a factor in the often tense relationship between the United States and China as the world’s two largest economies vie for power and influence in Asia and around the globe. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Beijing this week as part of an effort called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, aimed at improving relations between the two countries.

In recent months, those relations have been strained by China’s assertion of dominance in waters contested by the Japanese and Vietnamese, and by allegations that American government computers have been hacked by people with Chinese connections.

The current case involving steel tubing was focused primarily on South Korea, which the American companies contended was dumping virtually all of its steel tubing on the American market. A preliminary decision in February by the Commerce Department found that Korean companies were not dumping.","Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/12/business/Steel/Steel-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=852977338946b7878c0c066c598c78bb76cdc6a89b51e795b8c2b48c672e60d0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['chinese', 'states', 'steel', 'korea', 'american', 'south', 'decision', 'targets', 'dumping', 'united', 'companies', 'unfair']", 
14,14,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Seller: eBay Contributes to Decline of Native American Jewelry - EcommerceBytes,https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/letters/blog.pl?/pl/2014/7/1404908338.html,"Dear Ina,



Re: Mad Men and Indians Set Off eBay Alarms



Our company sells Native American jewelry which is protected under the Indians Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. Among other things, selling foreign made or non Native American made jewelry or artifacts as Native American is a federal crime with substantial fines if caught.



For many years, eBay has allowed sellers to illegally list foreign made items made in China, The Philippines, other Pacific Rim countries, and Mexico as Native American. Their price points were and remain significantly lower, and the damage done to the industry and Native American artists has been enormous. EBay was and probably still is the largest single venue for the sale of Native American jewelry and artifacts, and they bear much of the responsibility for the industry's decline.



Many concerned sellers and buyers have complained to eBay and to independent organizations interested in the preservation of these Native arts. EBay's predictable lackluster response was to begin including caveats every time anything was listed in any of the Native American categories as well as items being listed whose titles or descriptions contain certain words or phrases whether the warning was relevant to the listing or not.



Unfortunately, eBay has done nothing else to protect this indigenous art form and comply with federal law, and yet another agency of the federal government seems distinctly disinterested in enforcing the law with eBay.



EBay's jewelry managers refuse to learn much if anything about this jewelry sub genre and won't listen to sellers like us who sell only authentic items. The counterfeit problem continues, consequently, but unfortunately the majority buyers lack the expertise to distinguish between authentic and counterfeit or foreign made.



Further, most Native American silversmiths lack the resources or the will to file VeRo complaints when applicable, and many of the foreign made counterfeits, when signed at all, are signed or hallmarked by nonexistent people or fabricated names. In some cases hallmarks are being copied or even removed not only by foreign silversmiths but a few unscrupulous businesses in the southwest.



The second major problem in the Native American jewelry categories is new items made to look old using a variety of creative techniques that are being sold as pawn, estate, and vintage jewelry which buyers view as desirable when, in fact, not only are most of what's being sold using these descriptors are new items, and most of them have little or no value collector value regardless of their age. In some instances this so-called ""vintage"" jewelry isn't even sterling silver and some stones are sometimes low grade stones, plastic, or glass. Most buyers will never discover what they've actually bought.



In our opinion, eBay is the principal reason why the once thriving southwest Native American jewelry industry has declined at least 40% in the last ten years. EBay's attitude across their venue is that committing fraud is acceptable unless the victims can file a VeRo or the buyer files a case. Profit before ethics. Profits before the law. Profit before integrity.



To compound these problems, eBay has intentionally made it far too easy for buyers to make false accusations of misrepresentation in order to extort free merchandise and refunds, and sellers have no recourse whatsoever.



There are so few products made in the USA, but Native American jewelry and artifacts are two of them. The scope of eBay sanctioned fraud over the years drove many really good buyers away for good and their encouragement and facilitation of buyer fraud has driven away many honest sellers with many more who'll be leaving by choice in August.



Ironically, one of the worst misrepresentation offenders on eBay now primarily sells on their web site and on Amazon while Amazon rejected us three years ago with our perfect feedback and perfect stars. With Amazon's alleged high standards, we laughed at the irony of Amazon selecting a likely less than forthcoming with the facts seller and not even knowing it.



Sadly most Amazon buyers (or eBay for that matter) will never know they bought a counterfeit or foreign made item because the country of origin tags and labels have been illegally removed and because far too many buyers don't understand that you get what you pay for in most cases.



Is any of this surprising? Hardly. EBay and the mad men who run it are digging eBay's grave one shovel at a time. They're a major force in another economic maltreatment of Native Americans and those honest eBay businesses that comply with the law.



Mssrs. Donahoe and Wenig no doubt high five one another each time a niche or small seller leaves eBay. What they clearly fail to understand is when they ruin a non big box seller with a following, that following also leaves eBay.

15,15,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Food & Culture Chinese barbecue is all about the sauce By J.C. Reid - Houston Chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/restaurants-bars/bbq/article/Chinese-barbecue-is-all-about-the-sauce-5609298.php,"I recently wrote that the origins of Texas barbecue can be traced back to the traditions of the Old South. But what about ""barbecue"" before that? Expanding our definition of barbecue to include any technique that involves cooking over open flames, you can travel back almost to the beginning of humanity.

Every culture can claim some tradition of cooking meat over fire. And some cultures have traditions that are still celebrated to this day. Chinese barbecue is a perfect - and delicious - example.

Chinese barbecue - ""char siu,"" which loosely translates to ""fork roast"" - involves skewers of meat that are hung over open flames to cook. Archetypal images of Chinese restaurants with red-tinged meats hanging in the window are ""char siu.""

Contemporary Chinese cooking, however, often forgoes the open flame for roasting over a gas grill or in a gas oven.

What's the difference between Texas barbecue and Chinese barbecue? The main difference is in the flavoring technique: Texas barbecue uses heat and smoke to cook and flavor the meat, while Chinese barbecue is primarily flavored by a marinade or ""mop"" applied to the meat before and during cooking. Thus, ""char siu"" instead has a sweet-salty flavor that embellishes the taste of the meat.

If beef brisket is the canonical dish of Texas barbecue, then ""char siu pork"" is its Chinese counterpart. It is often listed as ""BBQ pork"" on menus. Pork loin or shoulder are cut into thin strips and then soaked in a marinade of honey (sweet), soy sauce (salty), and hoisin sauce (spicy). Other ingredients include fermented tofu paste, rice wine, and Chinese five spice powder. Red food coloring gives the meat its distinctive red color. After marinating, the pork is skewered and roasted.

Of all these ingredients, hoisin sauce is perhaps the most important. Often referred to as ""Chinese barbecue sauce,"" it is used as part of the marinade for char siu but also as a condiment. You can buy it in any supermarket. Hoisin sauce is thick and viscous, with a deep mahogany color, and flavored with chili peppers and garlic.

There are a few other Chinese barbecue dishes to be aware of. You will often see ""BBQ ribs"" on a menu. These are pork ribs that have been chopped into bite-sized chunks, marinated and roasted. In various American barbecue styles, these are called ""riblets.""

If you see a dish labeled ""roast pork,"" it's really just a slab of pork belly with the skin attached on one side. It's marinated - without the red food coloring - and then roasted so that the skin becomes as crispy as chicharrónnes.

After pork, the most prominent dish you will find at Chinese barbecue stands is roast duck. Whole roast duck, bright orange-red and glazed with sauce, is always seen hanging from the window or glassed-in cabinet. Your order will usually be several slices of skin-on duck breast. Do not discard the skin; its crunchy saltiness combines perfectly with the richness of the duck meat. You'll also receive a small container of savory ""duck sauce"" to pour over the duck and the rice or noodles that come with it.

Ordering Chinese barbecue in Houston isn't that different from ordering Texas barbecue. Step up to the counter and order your plate by what and how many meats and sides you want. My standard order is a two-meat plate of roast duck and barbecue pork. I prefer plain rice and one vegetable, usually bok choy. After ordering, the attendant will assemble the order right in front of you by cutting the pork and duck into pieces and placing them on the bed of rice.

In Houston, Chinese barbecue is usually served from booths inside Chinese restaurants or supermarkets. Two worth trying are Sinh Sinh and Hong Kong Food Street, in the same shopping center on far-west Bellaire near the Sam Houston Tollway in Asiatown. Both are sit-down restaurants with separate barbecue booths. You can sit at a table and order barbecue to eat there, or go straight to the booth and order it to-go.

For a quick, inexpensive lunch you can look for barbecue booths in Chinese supermarkets. One of the best is Dynasty Chinese BBQ, in the Dynasty Supermarket, a block away on Bellaire. For about $8 you will get a huge to-go container with rice, duck and pork.

It's a great taste of a culture that has been making its own version of barbecue for centuries.

He replaces Jean-Pierre Leoni, who will return to Paris to lead the firm’s client management group from September 1 in a newly created role.

Flood’s most recent role was as chief investment officer of Singapore-based Lion Global Investors, but he left the firm in June 2013. Chief executive Gerard Lee assumed the CIO post in addition to his existing responsibilities. Axa IM could not give details by press time of what Flood has been doing since in the past year.

He is due to take up the post in Hong Kong on August 1, reporting to Laurent Seyer, global head of Axa IM’s client group.

Axa IM said it is focusing on growing third-party assets through geographical expansion, client segmentation and further strengthening of its product offering. For example, last month it registered 20 new funds for retail sale across Hong Kong and Singapore and added a client service executive in the latter city.

Prior to Lion Global, he was executive director at Imprimatur Capital in Hong Kong for two years.

From 1990 to 2006, he held investment roles covering listed and equity markets at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, including as head of Asia Pacific ex Japan.

A New Zealander, Flood spent 15 years in London, then five in Hong Kong before moving to Singapore in 2009.

Leoni will have spent nearly five years in Asia, having become head of Asia Pacific in late 2009, replacing Anthony Fasso, who is now with AMP Capital Investors. Leoni has been responsible for the development of the firm’s presence in Asia, including Australia. He joined Axa IM in 1998 as head of credit.

Much of the province's oil patch is in the same area, inundated with water from heavy rain and overland flooding that hit during the Canada Day weekend.

Kevin Dekeyser is going on eight weeks without work or a paycheque due to the impact of flooding in Manitoba's oilfields. (Jill Coubrough/CBC) The ground is too wet to drill. The majority of wells were shut down during the flooding and roads are still too damaged for trucks transporting oil and equipment.

""It's pretty sad. It's really sad because a lot of us in the area depend on it,"" said Kevin Dekeyser, who works in the oil-service industry preparing drill sites.

According to the province, in the Waskada-Pierson area, 75 to 85 per cent of the wells were impacted by flooding. Tundra Oil and Gas had 90 per cent of their production shut down over the flood period and Corex Resources had 40 per cent.

At Melita Resources, a Manitoba oil company, $6 million worth of rig equipment is collecting cobwebs and each well sitting idle costs the company $50,000 daily.

""Every minute we stand here, somebody's losing revenue, equipment is not working and it's costing; contractors aren't working. Every rain is another shutdown,"" said company president Greg Barrows. ""So it's very significant.""

""It's going to be some time before activity resumes to normal.""

Exactly when production and drilling will resume depends on weather, and ground and road conditions, and that will all be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the province.

It will take at least two months to calculate the financial impact the shutdown will have, provincial officials said.

Greg Barrows, president of Melita Resources, stands at a drill site where $6 million worth of equipment sits idle. (Jill Coubrough/CBC) Some in the oil business estimate the losses could be as much as $5 million per day for the province.

Flooding causes oil spills

Among those in the industry that are keeping busy are environmental remediation teams.

Jill Caldwell, co-owner of Goodlands Environmental Inc., said that between Manitoba and Saskatchewan, her company has dealt with at least three small oil spills.

""Over the last few days, we've discovered some spills that have happened during the flood event that nobody was able to find because the operators have been so cut off from lots of the wells and were unable to see what things were like underneath the water,"" she said.

Small spills aren't uncommon and teams typically respond within two hours, but high water and road closures meant it was days before teams could reach the spills, she said.

""What happened was really a result of how quickly [the water] came,"" Caldwell said.

""It's really important that our infrastructure is maintained and that the roads are maintained and we can safely get where we need to get and we can get equipment where we need to get equipment to look after these sites.""","Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.2706098.1405337302!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kevin-dekeyser.jpg,"['waters', 'flood', 'wells', 'company', 'rain', 'wet', 'bad', 'industry', 'water', 'really', 'oil', 'sick', 'equipment', 'manitoba', 'shut', 'flooding']",

The province says the river reached its high-water mark on Saturday morning at Brandon, and that it surpassed the level reached during the record-breaking flood that hit the province back in 2011.

A severe thunderstorm warning was also issued Saturday for Brandon, bringing the possibility of damaging wind, hail and intense rain.

Steve Topping with the province's water stewardship department says there likely won't be enough precipitation or wind to increase the flood threat on the Assinboine.

Topping says the intense winds could generate big waves on the province's lakes, which is where the floodwater has been going.

But Emergency Measures Minister Steve Ashton says the current water level on Lake Manitoba is still close to a metre less than it was in 2011.

The province says it has sent 2,000 super-sandbags to the area to prepare for possible flooding.

""These communities have invested, in some cases, in permanent dikes, but there are some properties that are not protected by these permanent dikes,"" Premier Greg Selinger told a media briefing Saturday.

""We're meeting with these communities as we speak and we are dispatching super-sandbags and support as rapidly as possible.""

Topping says the new crest is only expected to raise the water level on Lake Manitoba a few centimetres, but he says that forecast will be reviewed.

On Friday, Selinger thanked the more than 500 military and reserve members who were deployed after he declared a state of emergency a week ago. They set up hundreds of thousands of sandbags, shored up dikes and monitored them for leaks.

The military has begun to pull out of the region now that Assiniboine is falling in most areas and are returning to their bases.

The province said Saturday that the flood forecast on the Assiniboine downstream at the Portage Diversion, which funnels water from the Assiniboine River into Lake Manitoba, called for a crest similar to one earlier this month.

The river rose suddenly last week due to heavy rainfall upstream in Saskatchewan that fell on ground that was already saturated.","Sat, 12 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1901931.1404735452!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['assiniboine', 'reached', 'flood', 'level', 'dikes', 'brandon', 'province', 'water', 'river', 'storm', 'crests', 'lake', 'manitoba', 'threatens', 'flooding', 'hold']",

The Hong Kong-based Wing Lung Bank, which was established in 1933 and is now a subsidiary of China Merchants Bank, celebrated the grand opening of its San Francisco office at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco on Tuesday.

As the second overseas branch of Wing Lung, the San Francisco branch will team up with the Los Angeles office, which was opened in 1984, to play an important role in developing business in California and the US for its parent company.

In 2008 amid the international financial crisis, China Merchants Bank (CMB), China's sixth largest bank, decided to buy the 81-year-old Wing Lung Bank given its strength and capability, and is using it as a strategic platform for overseas expansion, according to bank senior management.

After six years of integration, Wing Lung currently is in good shape, said Ma Weihua, chairman of Wing Lung Bank, adding that opening the San Francisco branch is an important step of CMB for its globalization move as Chinese banks have to embrace the international financial market. ""This is irresistible,"" Ma said.

Ed Lee, mayor of San Francisco, applauded Wing Lung's decision of setting up an office in the Bay Area and beyond.

Wing Lung Bank made the correct and important strategic decision by setting up the San Francisco branch, said Yuan Nansheng, Chinese consul general in San Francisco.

As more Chinese enterprises expand to the US, Chinese banks are eager to follow.

In 2011, Bank of Communications (BOCOM) announced the opening of its San Francisco branch. Currently about 70 percent of its customers are Chinese enterprises operating in the US. Different from other banks, BOCOM offers its unique renminbi(RMB) services which include deposit, wire, loans, and holding RMB accounts at the bank which enable individuals outside of China to have better control over their RMB investment.

In 2012, the US Federal Reserve approved the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd's (ICBC) acquisition of a majority stake in the American arm of Bank of East Asia. China's biggest bank became the first Beijing-controlled financial institution to acquire retail bank branches in the US. ICBC now has 10 branches in California.

21,21,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Damage assessment of runaway barges at Marseilles lock and dam - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2014-07-runaway-barges-marseilles.html,"Marseilles barge accident is shown. Credit: Major General John W. Peabody, Commander of the Mississippi Valley Division, United States Army Corps of Engineers and President of the Mississippi River Commission.

It takes a synchronized lock and dam system—operating like a motorized flight of stairs on the Illinois River, using gravity to move the water—to maintain a minimum depth for boat traffic. A disastrous domino effect occurred on April 19, 2013, when heavy rain and runoff, strong winds, and river currents resulted in seven unmoored barges crashing into the dam at Marseilles. University of Illinois soil scientist Ken Olson studied the extensive repercussions of the incident.

""Four of the seven barges partially sank, blocking the southernmost submersible spillway gates that maintain the 9-foot navigation channel,"" Olson said. ""The other three barges blocked the water flow, which backed it up for many miles and flooded adjacent Illinois River bottomlands, including the town of Marseilles.""

On the human level, Olson said that approximately 1,500 residents had to be evacuated from the low-lying areas, more than 3 feet of floodwater surrounded 200 buildings, and at least 24 homes were destroyed.

""The greatest agricultural impact was that, because this important waterway transportation system was out of commission, shipments of fertilizers and grains were delayed,"" Olson said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) created a temporary rock dike dam after the accident to permit repairs to the three most severely damaged gates. The temporary dike was able to hold enough water to elevate the navigation pool, but it was not until May 15, four weeks later, that boat traffic was restored.

""The northern stretch of the Illinois River is a main artery for shipping bulk commodities to terminals at the Gulf of Mexico,"" Olson said. ""The interruption affected delivery of shipments of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizer and lime material, and outputs, including grain. The torrential rains that moved through the upper Midwest in April and May of 2013 resulted in the Coast Guard declaring the Illinois River to be unnavigable; any transport required Coast Guard permission.""

Olson said that a safety zone was created in order to protect salvage operations from impediment by the vessel traffic above the damaged Marseilles Dam. It extended between the Marseilles Lock and Dam and Seneca, Ill.

""An additional section between Alton, Illinois, and Brendon Road lock at Joliet remained closed for weeks due to high water and excessive river debris,"" Olson said. ""Heavy rains in late May extended the shipping restrictions.""

According to Olson, the system of locks and dams on the Illinois River managed by USACE is vulnerable to changing climate and weather extremes. These more frequent and unpredictable conditions can cause shipping accidents, damage to lock and dam systems, streambank erosion, shipping accidents, and local flooding.

22,22,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Why Elon Musk Released Tesla's Patents - CKGSB Knowledge,https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledges/why-elon-musk-released-teslas-patents/,"Overnight the maverick electric car company became an evangelist of the Open Source philosophy. Why is releasing Tesla’s patents such a big deal?

In the traditional business playbook, one way companies win is to create something useful, patent it, and then make money on their exclusive right to use that intellectual property (IP).

Most companies still operate this way today. Amazon.com, for example, guards its IP fiercely. Similarly, Apple and Samsung have both built huge patent armories, and use patent litigation as an offensive and defensive weapon. Some companies, referred to disparagingly as “patent trolls”, have built entire businesses around extracting license fees from companies they claim are infringing on their parents.

Until recently, Tesla Motors had played a traditional IP game, amassing more than 1,400 patents over the past 11 years. But on June 12, the electric car pioneer changed direction and released its patents. An announcement by Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the company would not challenge infringements on most of its patents.

Some traditionalists said that Musk was making a dangerous strategic error in deciding to give its competitors access to its IP and predicted that his company would suffer as a result. Over the next two weeks, however, something odd happened: Tesla’s stock went up. It climbed more than 10% over the next two weeks, from $205 per share to $230.

Why would investors reward a company for giving away some of its most valuable knowhow–particularly a company that sold fewer than 20,000 cars in 2013? The key, say some intellectual property experts, is to understand how the rules of the game in business are changing. These days, when it comes to intellectual property, it is often the giving hand that gets.

The company’s stated aim is to encourage more rapid development in an industry that has so far dragged its feet in developing electric vehicles. As Musk put it in an article published on the Tesla website, “Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.”

Jaideep Prabhu, a professor of entrepreneurship at Judge Business School at Cambridge University and an innovation expert, agrees that releasing the patents should spur advances in the industry. “There is this argument that having intellectual property laws actually facilitates innovation… but it’s frequently used to prevent others from getting their hands on intellectual property,” he says.

One case in point: the one-click buying patent held by Amazon gave it a leg up on many of its competitors, who were stuck with two and three-step processes.

Winner Gives All

Not enforcing the patents may make sense for Tesla in even more directly self-interested terms as well, IP experts say. Particularly in technology-driven 21st Century businesses, you’re Facebook or no one.

“In the digital economy, the winner takes all. What matters is to be at the center of an ecosystem. For this, you need to let others build upon your platform, and reduce transaction costs to nil (this means: no license, or no license fees),” writes one intellectual property expert, who chose to withhold his name. Releasing patents is one way to keep transaction costs down.

Beyond simply building scale, sharing IP is also a good way to corner the competition, according to Benn Konsynski, a professor of information systems at Goizueta Business School at Emory University.

“If I share areas that are not the key basis of competition, then I stimulate the market in my direction and permit myself to compete in other areas,” explains Konsynski, “so I share to compete.”

Musk’s gift forces competitors to compete on his terms, or as Konsynski puts it, “I know where you stand if I make it free to stand where I want you to stand.”

The Tesla move also fits in with a larger trend toward business development in which the IP is shared rather than hoarded. In the automobile industry, for instance, the traditional automakers already incorporate a great deal of Open Source software into their systems. Ford Motor Company, GM, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW, for example, are all reportedly working toward a Linux-driven operating system to operate their vehicle entertainment systems.

One automotive start-up is trying to push Open Source collaboration even further: Local Motors is a Chandler, Arizona-based company whose online development platform links developers, micro-manufacturers, and some traditional automakers to create and even build vehicles based on Open Source technologies.

Companies in other industries have played the Open Source card as well in recent years. Google, for instance, has opened dozens of its patents to developers for free. Lego, the Danish toy block maker, has also adopted an Open Source approach, a move that some market watchers claim was one reason the company’s revenue has quadrupled over the past 10 years.

All You Need is Love?

The changing nature of innovation may also be leading Tesla and some of its peers toward greater openness. “I think in the last 100 years the trajectory has been very much [about] controlling R&D within the firm,” Prabhu says.

But thanks to digitalization, that’s changed, according to Prabhu. Large-scale company-owned labs are increasingly the exception, not the rule. Small Lennon-McCartney scale collaborations are now possible in a way that they weren’t just a few years ago, he adds.

Open Source takes advantage of the power of these small teams, by giving more teams more building blocks to play with. Lego executives came to their decision to adopt Open Source after watching how, just three weeks after the release of the Mindstorm robotic Lego line in the 1990s, a group of more than 1000 programmers had hacked the code, reconfigured it, and improved it in completely unforeseen ways, opening an entirely new market of adult hobbyists for what had been considered simply a high-tech children’s toy.

Finally, staying out of the patent game reduces the legal costs of guarding against infringement claims. Musk wrote that at the time of his first start-up, Zip2, a city guide he founded with his brother Kimbal in 1997, he was a big believer in patents. But not for long: “After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible,” he writes.

These days, Musk no longer sees IP as a source of competitive advantage, but the wizards behind it. “Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers,” he says. “We believe that applying the Open Source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.”

At least for now: Konsynski notes that Tesla is not actually tearing up its patents, but merely giving serious competitors free use for the moment, and reserves the right to change its strategy down the line. He notes that patents still make sense in a mature industry, when players start to want to try to defend their turf.

Other industry bloggers have noted that although the knowhow behind the patents is open, the company’s other secret sauce is not: how the Palo Alto wizards put them together to make their award-winning cars.","Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Patent-Sharing-In-story-Photo.jpg,"['property', 'intellectual', 'patents', 'way', 'ip', 'source', 'company', 'released', 'open', 'patent', 'elon', 'teslas', 'tesla', 'musk']",

In 2004, Paul Martin's Liberals chose to drop Jean Chrétien's policy and tack in a more pro-Israel direction. The change became public when Canada voted alongside the U.S. against a motion at the United Nations that affirmed the right of Palestinians ""to mobilize support for their cause."" Although Stephen Harper and his Conservatives would continue to claim to be better friends of Israel, it was clear from 2004 on that the differences between the parties amounted to only a matter of degree. Differences shrank further in 2012 when Tom Mulcair, a self-described ""ardent supporter of Israel in all instances and circumstances,"" won the leadership of the New Democratic Party. That consensus of party leaderships began to dissolve with Jagmeet Singh's election as NDP leader in October 2017. The latest Gaza war has shaken things up again. ""I don't think Canadian politics on this particular issue is the same as it was a month ago,"" said Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. ""And I don't know that it ever will be the same."" Today, Paul Manly represents Nanaimo-Ladysmith for the Greens, but until 2014, he was a New Democrat. ""I was one of 14 candidates that were rejected by the NDP for having said anything about Israel and Palestine,"" he told CBC News. Former New Democrat MP Jim Manly makes a statement in a pre-recorded video released on YouTube on Oct. 20, 2012, after the ship Estelle was commandeered by Israeli troops.(Canadian Press) In 2012 Manly's father, Jim, himself a former NDP MP and United Church minister, was detained by Israeli commandos who boarded a vessel that was attempting to break Israel's naval blockade and deliver supplies to Gaza. ""When my father was in detention in Israel, no NDP MP would speak out for him, and my own member of Parliament was told that she couldn't speak about the issue,"" Manly said. ""So to not be able to speak up for a constituent stuck in an international situation when other countries are speaking for their citizens really lays bare the hard line that was taken by Tom Mulcair at the time."" Greens divided But Manly's new party has also experienced friction in the wake of recent events. A statement by Green Party Leader Annamie Paul calling for a ceasefire and condemning both Palestinian rocket attacks and excessive Israeli military force appeared to be an attempt to put forward a moderate position close to that of the Trudeau government. Green MP Jenica Atwin responded on Twitter: ""It is a totally inadequate statement.... End Apartheid."" Green MP Jenica Atwin blasted her own leader's statement on Gaza as ""totally inadequate.""(Twitter) Paul, who converted to Judaism 20 years ago, has spoken in Israeli media about the prejudice she faced when running for the Green Party leadership. ""It started out as innuendo, with veiled suggestions and attacks against me as a Zionist,"" she said. ""And then because neither we nor others responded to it, people became more emboldened and more explicit. ""I was accused of the usual tropes, including being in the pocket of foreign agents, being embedded in a political party to further the goals of those foreign agents, and the usual things related to money."" Green Leader Annamie Paul, a convert to Judaism, says she's faced prejudice in politics.(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) The recriminations fly This month, as tensions in the Middle East flared, it was Paul's senior adviser, Noah Zatzman, who charged that ""a range of political actors"" were disseminating ""appalling antisemitism and discrimination ... beginning with Jagmeet Singh and [former Green leadership candidate] Dimitri Lascaris and many Liberal, NDP and sadly, Green MPs."" (The entire Green caucus has only three members.) Zatzman told CBC News he wanted to be clear that his comments about Green MPs did not refer to Elizabeth May, whom he called ""a great friend of the Jewish community."" He said he has suffered ongoing harassment as a result of the position he took within the party, to the extent that his parents felt compelled to delist their address. A Facebook post by Noah Zatzman, senior adviser to Green Party leader Annamie Paul, accused the party's own MPs of antisemitic behaviour.(Facebook) ""I think using accusations of antisemitism to shut down legitimate criticism of human rights abuses is offensive and dangerous, and it dilutes the weight that word carries when it's used to identify real antisemitism,"" Manly told CBC News. Manly responded to Zatzman's claims by publishing an article by his friend and chief of staff, former Israeli soldier Ilan Goldenblatt, entitled ""Criticizing Human Rights Abuses Is Not Anti-Semitism."" NDP position shifting Paul Manly would not be disqualified from today's NDP. Singh hasn't moved the party as far or as fast as his critics on the left would like. But the party has moved beneath his feet. Delegates to the NDP's April convention supported motions calling for ""an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian land"" and an end to ""all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements in Israel-Palestine."" When similar motions were proposed at the NDP convention in 2018, they failed even to come to a vote. The NDP's approach to Middle East policy seems to be shifting under leader Jagmeet Singh.(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) The motions led the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) to accuse the NDP of harbouring ""a toxic obsession with Israel."" It said Singh's comments on the recent conflict — by focusing on Palestinian victims while overlooking deaths and injuries from Hamas rockets — were ""cold-hearted, morally reprehensible and inconsistent with his previous statements on the matter."" But Singh has continued to recalibrate his position. ""If we want to achieve peace, we need to apply pressure to achieve it,"" he said this week, making it clear that pressure should be on Israel. Trudeau: Harper-era policy on autopilot Conservative Foreign Affairs critic Michael Chong gave CBC News a restrained statement just before the ceasefire: ""Canada's Conservatives have been clear that Israel is one of Canada's closest allies and we support Israel's right to defend itself. Dialogue and peaceful negotiation are the only path forward towards a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians and an eventual two-state solution. We urge calm and sincerely hope that hostilities cease."" While the Conservatives haven't changed their position on the topic, they have dialed back the volume. Support for Israel is no longer a staple of party fundraisers and the foreign policy focus has clearly shifted to China. The Conservative Party isn't really seeking to highlight differences with Trudeau's Liberals on the conflict — partly because there really aren't any big ones. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintained, without fanfare, Stephen Harper's pro-Israel voting record at the UN and, a few months after becoming prime minister, voted in Parliament to condemn BDS (the movement to boycott Israel) ""both here at home and abroad."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has largely maintained the Harper government policy on UN votes related to Israel.(Amr Alfiky/Reuters) When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trudeau to intercede to discourage the International Criminal Court at The Hague from investigating the 2014 Israel-Gaza War, Trudeau wrote to the court that Palestinians, as stateless people, had no right to bring cases for war crimes. But some in his party no longer seem willing to go along with that approach. Splits in Liberal ranks Liberal MP Erskine-Smith said the government is too tolerant of Israeli settlements. ""For as long as I've followed politics, we haven't seen Canadian governments that have acted vocally consistent with Canadian foreign policy, which is that settlement expansion is contrary to international law,"" he said. In April, Erskine-Smith presented a petition calling on Canada to oppose the pending evictions of Palestinian families from homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, an issue that helped trigger the recent deadly conflict. Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith says his government should take a harder line on Israeli settlement expansion.(CBC) ""There's an asymmetry to the conflict between Palestine and Israel,"" he told CBC News. ""And pressure needs to be brought to bear upon Israel to ensure that we don't see continued settlement expansion and we do see greater concern around human rights."" The Trudeau government has voted against dozens of UN resolutions that affirm existing tenets of Canadian policy — such as UN resolution 17/96, guaranteeing the protections of the Geneva Convention to Palestinian civilians. Like the Harper government, it says it does that to protest what it calls the singling out of Israel. Friendly criticism Erksine-Smith said he agrees that ""there are many other countries deserving of criticism on human rights bases as well. And so the singling out of Israel, I think, can be problematic. ""My overall view, though, is that for the very reason that we hold up Israel as an ally, as a democracy with an independent judiciary that shares our values in relation to human rights, it's on those grounds that we ought to criticize as a friend."" Both Liberal MP Erskine-Smith and Green MP Manly said they have been deluged with mail about events in Gaza, and both say they believe that strong reaction was conditioned by a year of protests over racial justice in North America. Changing times Erskine-Smith described a recent friendly conversation with an Israeli diplomat. ""My message to him was: I've not seen this level of correspondence from people who don't follow politics and aren't seized with this really complex issue,"" he said. ""And I think those who represent the Israeli government and Canada need to know that."" The MP said he told the diplomat that current Israeli policies are ""undermining Canadian support for our continued friendship."" If currents are shifting in Canada, Israeli politics are in turmoil. There is a strong chance that the Netanyahu era is drawing to an end. For those whose task it is to argue Israel's cause in Canada, a new Israeli government could make life easier. Israel's longest-running prime minister is too much of a known quantity to change many minds on either side of the debate in Canada. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.(Sebastian Scheiner/The Associated Press) While the NDP says it wants to halt Canada's arms sales to Israel (which are negligible anyway), what really matters to Israel is Canada's diplomatic support. Without it, Israel's guaranteed votes at the UN could shrink to only the U.S. and the handful of small Pacific Island states that vote with U.S. foreign policy. And even Washington's support — the cornerstone of Israel's security, along with its nuclear deterrent — is looking much less certain in these changed times.","Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7xFZ5HOPB8bL1uG7mV_LVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMTky/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o74HbNku3VhYkMEkIwnpyw--~B/aD0xNDc0O3c9MjQ3NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-07-10T183428Z_269292810_TM3EA7A14DH01_RTRMADP_3_USA-SEALEVEL-FLOOD.JPG,"['endeavour', 'ndp', 'policy', 'floods', 'trudeau', 'paul', 'green', 'scientists', 'mp', 'locations', 'minister', 'impact', 'israeli', 'israel', 'better', 'predict', 'party']", 
25,25,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Makati Mayor Binay: Flooding still a problem - Inquirer.net,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/617452/makati-mayor-binay-flooding-still-a-problem,"MANILA, Philippines–After several major streets and intersections in Makati City became impassable due to floods caused by heavy downpours last week, Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay reiterated his call for the national government to intensify its unclogging and drainage improvement operations.

At the same time, he asked the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Department of Public Works and Highways to implement measures to prevent flooding on major roads, resulting in heavy traffic.

“The floods were even worse especially on Thursday, and many commuters had to wade through waist-deep [water] when traffic came to a standstill in many parts of Makati and the metropolis,” Binay said.

According to him, it is the national government’s responsibility to take “drastic measures to spare long-suffering motorists from the bane of traffic gridlock often occurring during heavy rains.”

Earlier, Makati’s engineering and public works department reported that it had finished the repair and improvement of the city’s dredging system. In particular, it cited the installation of new concrete pipes and the completion of road reblocking projects in 16 barangays (villages).

The city government noted that during heavy rains, the streets in Makati’s low-lying barangays end up submerged in floodwaters that would

take more than an hour to recede.

But Binay said that with the use of a modern monitoring system, the city was able to reduce this in some areas to about 10 to 15 minutes.

He added, however, that the flood-mitigation efforts in the city seemed futile because of heavy flooding on national roads like President Osmeña Highway, Gil Puyat Avenue, Edsa-Magallanes and the Edsa-Chino Roces Extension.

A man, frowning, headed for the door of the church with a young girl in tow. So did several women clutching children, looking dazed when a large group of volunteers suddenly stopped what they were doing and raised their hands in applause. “Bienvenidos,” said one. Welcome. The new arrivals were ushered inside.

“This is the first experience a lot of people here have of meeting an American,” explained Cesar Riojas, 50, one of hundreds of south Texas residents who have transformed the squat brick church hall here into a bustling support center for the hundreds of new immigrants now crossing into the U.S. from Mexico each week.

“I put myself in their position,” Riojas said. “How would I want to be treated?”

The surge of about 57,000 unaccompanied youths since October and large numbers of immigrating parents with children has thrown the Obama administration’s immigration policy into disarray and sparked new demands across the U.S. for heightened border security. But in the Rio Grande Valley, a porous frontier traveled by illicit wayfarers throughout history, the new influx of children and parents from Central America has been most immediately a reason to get to work.

The estimated 800 volunteers at the hastily organized immigrant relief center are retirees and businessmen, stay-at-home moms and students from nearby University of Texas-Pan American. Organizers from Catholic Charities have been joined by the Salvation Army, by Baptists, Methodists and Episcopalians. Teachers have brought their classes. An evangelical radio host summoned followers. In a region where many residents live in shacks and trailers without electricity, the center has received so much donated food that much of it is being stored offsite.

“The more you have, the more you separate yourself from those who have nothing,” said Riojas, a self-described conservative Republican from nearby Harlingen who is taking time off from his job as a consultant.

Valley residents started the relief center about a month ago with the help of a local nun after meeting immigrant families by chance at the bus station. They began organizing on Facebook and persuaded the church to let them use the hall.

Since then, the facility has served more than 3,000 immigrants, at times 200 a day. There are a few paid staffers, and volunteers work in shifts with assigned duties. Small teams lead immigrants through the process of getting bathed, clothed and bused to destinations around the U.S. where they will remain with friends or family until their immigration cases are heard in court. With many too traumatized and exhausted to hold down food, the newest are offered chicken soup and bottles of Pedialyte.

Massive tents in the parking lot have been set up as sleeping quarters for up to 60 adults awaiting buses, with portable showers and toilets nearby, donated by Hidalgo County. A local Baptist church brought a portable laundry.

“The community here have been very welcoming,” said Sarita Fritzler, the Washington-based team leader for the charity Save the Children, who recently arrived from running a similar effort for Syrian refugees in Iraq.

Jose Luis Zelaya, 27, a doctoral student at Texas A&M University, about 380 miles north, who is studying to become a teacher, also volunteers. He was an immigrant himself under similar circumstances when he arrived in the valley 14 years ago as an unaccompanied minor from the gang-plagued Honduran city of San Pedro Sula.

Zelaya said he was familiar with the tales of violence and trauma many of the new immigrants tell — before leaving his home to join his mother and his 9-year-old sister in Texas, he said, he’d been threatened by a gang, shot in each arm while he was playing soccer.

Just 13 years old at the time, Zelaya memorized his mother’s phone number in Texas and boarded the train through Mexico that has ferried thousands of Central American immigrants on similar journeys over the years. He saw children raped, he said, and a man who fell from atop the hurtling train to his death. When he made it to the Rio Grande, he swam across alone and fell asleep in some bushes, where the Border Patrol found him.

Zelaya went on to graduate from high school and Texas A&M, and is now staying in the country under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

“I understand what they’re going through,” he said of his decision to come help the newest arrivals. “I understand the journey, what it is to be in a detention center and what they can have if they’re reunited” with families, he said. “I know our country is grappling with this. If we send them back, they’re being sent back to death.”

Ofelia De Los Santos, a native of nearby Edinburg who is coordinating volunteers, said she can’t help but think of her 18-year-old grandson.

“He’s never had to run for his life, to be thirsty or hungry,” she said, her voice catching as she removed her glasses. “You go home and think: What would I do if my children were being recruited by those gangs? Would I sell my house and send my children north?”

In the early days of the relief effort, volunteers were walking families from the bus station at all hours, mothers leading children by the hand through a series of back alleys where drifters lurked and broken glass glittered underfoot. Those with longer layovers they took into their homes, providing food and a place to rest.

Now the process is more formal. Arrivals are announced by loudspeaker and ushered through.

“Who’s my volunteer with this family?” called out Hermi Forshage, handling intake last week at a table marked “Catholic Charities Disaster Response.”

Forshage, 54, was working with a Guatemalan mother and her teenage son, reviewing their immigration paperwork and bus itinerary to Mobile, Ala.

“They’re very, very scared,” she told the volunteers before handing them off. “They don’t speak Spanish. She knows ‘si’ very well, though, right?” Forshage said.

The woman, who spoke an indigenous language, nodded. “Si.”

They shared a fragile smile. The woman looked relieved.

“She likes to cry,” Forshage said. “She’s already made me cry once.”

A volunteer named Sandy in a red San Antonio Spurs cap moved the pair to pick new outfits from the dozens of folding tables stacked with clothes, toiletries and other supplies, sorted by age, sex and size.

A new pair took their place in front of Forshage — this time a Salvadoran father and his small daughter, clutching a stuffed purple hedgehog labeled “Kiss me.”

Forshage brightened. “How old are you?” she asked.

The girl held up three fingers.

“This is hard,” Forshage sighed, reviewing the pair’s bus tickets to Indiana and handing them a sign that read, “Please help me, I do not speak English, what bus do I need to take?”

Some of the new arrivals have been pregnant women; a few were women who gave birth after crossing and showed up with babies in their arms.

Carmen Garza, 46, a mother of four from nearby Mission, said some skeptical friends had asked why the immigrants kept coming, and whether they carried diseases. She said she tried not to judge the immigrants. She grew up just over the border in Mexico, where she has relatives and her husband still works.

“Who are we to judge them? We’ve led a privileged life,” she said.

Forshage said she had stayed in touch with some of those she has helped.

“I talk to them and reassure them that the worst is over. Of course, when they go before the judge for deportation proceedings, who knows?” she said. “But will they ever show up?”

She is touched by the immigrants’ stories, she said, but also pained. Parents tell her about extortion by smugglers, about children kidnapped with guns to their heads, about youngsters who fell ill and almost died during the journey.

Still, she said, she planned to keep volunteering.

“If my neighbor is in trouble, I help my neighbor,” she said. “And these people are our neighbors.”

The flooding experienced by many parts of the country over the last year may be partly behind changes to the Ontario Building Code, changes designed to prevent the contamination of Ontario's water supply system. The costs of complying with the new provisions have once again raised an issue of importance to landlords and tenants in commercial leases; who bears the responsibility and cost of an installation, change or upgrade to a property that does not fall into the category of maintenance, repair or replacement?

Buildings are increasingly subject to regulations requiring installation of new features, alterations or upgrades on the grounds of health and safety or public policy. When a new or revised legal requirement necessitates a new installation or a change or upgrade to a building, who should be responsible for paying the costs of complying with such regulations? Many leases are silent on the point, leaving the parties in limbo as to the responsibility and cost of compliance and at the risk of being in breach of the relevant law unless the issue is addressed. In some cases, on widely-known issues, like the introduction of the Ontarians With Disabilities Act, the parties often negotiate responsibility for new costs that may arise, but typically fail to negotiate the subject generally rather than to address one known issue, which leaves uncertainty when other issues arise.

Regulation 332/12, of the Ontario Building Code Act came into force on January 1, 2014. The provisions significantly expand the regulation of plumbing systems with the aim of preventing contamination of potable water supplies. Flooding increases the possibility of ""backflow"", which is the reversal of the flow of potable water through a pipe, often taking contaminants or non-treated water with it. Backflow is far more likely where there are large amounts of standing surface water. The regulations aim to combat this problem by requiring the installation of backflow prevention devices in all buildings in Ontario that have been rated as being at ""moderate"" or ""severe"" risk of water contamination. Many municipalities have also enacted by-laws requiring buildings to be surveyed, permits to be obtained and plumbing systems to be inspected periodically, all with the aim of preventing contamination and requiring installation of backflow prevention devices where appropriate.

In many single tenant buildings, the tenant bears the responsibility for maintenance, repair and some or all replacements to the property. Rarely does a commercial lease allocate to a tenant the responsibility to perform any installations, changes or upgrades necessary as a result of any new or changing legislation, regulations or building codes. Leases often require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws, but the general clause is of course trumped by the specific requirements in a lease and maintenance, repair and replacement obligations will be more specific. So unless the tenant's obligations are drafted to include the requirement to perform any installations, changes or upgrades required by law, regulation or code, (depending on the wording of the lease) a tenant may have no responsibility to do so.

In multi-tenant buildings where the landlord is performing the operating obligations or repairs, additional rent provisions in a net lease are usually drafted to allow a landlord to pass the costs of maintaining, repairing, and replacing parts of the building, building systems and commons areas on to the tenants. But it is questionable whether a new installation such as a backflow prevention device would be included in the list of items known as operating costs, which are recoverable from tenants. Some leases will include an operating costs definition broad enough to include ""upgrades"" to a building, or upgrades or installations required to keep the building up to the requirements of applicable laws. That is usually the exception as a tenant will traditionally negotiate to exclude the cost of any upgrades when the tenant has the bargaining power to do so.

Case law has made clear that labeling a lease ""net"" (or any derivation of that wording) is not necessarily sufficient on its own to require the tenant to pay for costs that are not specifically addressed in the lease. It is in the interests of both the landlord and the tenant to make the lease clear on what items can be recovered from the tenant as an operating cost. If the landlord expects to be able to recover the cost of items that are not traditionally seen as within the scope of maintenance, repair or replacement, then this should be expressly provided for in the lease.

In Riocan Holdings Inc. v. Metro Ontario Real Estate Ltd., the court considered whether resurfacing a parking lot was either a repair or a replacement and a capital item and the court concluded that ""the dividing line between a capital expense/betterment and a repair/maintenance expense is not black and white. Indeed it is decidedly grey"". This just further shows the need to set out specifically in a commercial lease, the responsibilities of each party in order to avoid ambiguity or non-allocation.

The parties and their counsel should firstly seek agreement in principle on which party should be responsible for complying with new or changed governmental requirements regarding the property and secondly, reflect that understanding with clear and unambiguous language in the lease. Riocan and other cases have shown that reliance on general phrases such as ""capital expenditure"" to demarcate responsibility for costs between the landlord and tenant is inexact and can potentially lead to expensive litigation. Ideally, the lease should specify which classes of expenditure are to be recoverable from the tenant.

If the tenant is to be responsible for paying a portion of the cost of an item that would normally be considered a capital expense, a well advised tenant would ensure the landlord has the requirement to amortize such cost over the useful life of the item and charge through only the amortized portion each year of the lease term. This is best practice whether the capital expenditure relates to costs incurred in repair, maintenance or replacement, as well as installations and upgrades (whether the work is required by law or not).

While the new regulations regarding backflow prevention devices may not represent the biggest potential for unwanted costs for landlords and tenants, they do act as a reminder of the importance of clear drafting in order to manage future unforeseen expenditure.

28,28,FL-2014-000095-CHN,11 traditional Chinese therapies that will weird you out - Shanghaiist,https://shanghaiist.com/2014/07/11/11-traditional-chinese-therapies-that-will-weird-you-out/,"

A number of mysterious therapies have surfaced in recent years as people have strayed from the typical herbal remedies and cupping procedures to seek out alternative “cure-all” treatments. We’ve taken a look at some of the more baffling out-of-the-box remedies across China that have proven, for the most part, to be pretty ineffective.

1. Urine therapy



On August 8, 2004, around 30 elderly folk gathered at a hotel in Guangzhou to share their experiences in urine drinking and toasted one another with a fresh glass of the stuff.

Since then, it’s been reported that chugging down one’s own urine could cure illnesses such as hyperthyroidism. Founded in Hong Kong in 2008, the China Urine Therapy Association claims to have gathered more than 100,000 followers who’ve turned to urine therapy, even though medical experts pointed out that the practice is likely more harmful than effective.



These two people claim to have been using urine therapy for over 10 years and swear by it (June 24, 2014 in Chongqing).

2. Ant-eating therapy



In 2001, a Hangzhou hotel hosted a free event for live ant tasting, inviting “experts” from ant farms to demonstrate ant-eating to the public. Claiming that the critters are rich in protein, the eating of ants is believed to have anti-aging effects.

3. Fire therapy



It’s believed that fire therapy has various advantages, including stimulating blood circulation. In 2005, authorities issued a notice regarding the management of Chinese medicine massage, Gua sha (scraping sha-bruises), cupping and so on. Fire therapy, somehow, was not mentioned.

4. Apitherapy



Apitherapy, a folk therapy using bee venom, is claimed to be effective in curing rheumatism, arthritis, migraine headaches, stomach pains, high blood cholesterol and other ailments, although the state has not approved Apitherapy as a useful Chinese medical treatment. Experts say the biggest risk is allergies, which could be deadly. This picture taken in August 2013 shows a very unpleasant-looking patient in Beijing undergoing the treatment.

5. Sand therapy



On 30 October, 2013 a new health concept called “Western Yusha (sand) therapy” was introduced in Nanjing. The idea is basically to bury your body in sand until you begin to sweat. The treatment claims to be a combination of “magnetic therapy”, “hyperthermia”, “light therapy” and “massage”. On the plus side, you could probably go to the nearest beach and do it for free.

6. Plant therapy



On July 12, 2008, the summer that Beijing hosted the Olympic games, an artist drew an Olympic Fuwa (the mascot of the games) on the back of two women with the essence of flowers and grass. The artist said that the plant “juice” had skin revitalizing effects.

7. “Stretch and Beat therapy”



On April 11, 2011, Xiao Hong-ci, the author of a book introducing the idea of muscle-stretching and body-slapping, spoke at a press conference in Taipei to boast benefits of the therapy that he said could cure hundreds of diseases. Since 2009, the “stretch and beat therapy” has become increasingly popular in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and other cities that offer lessons, workshops and books promoting the treatment.

8. Green bean therapy



In 2010, “miracle doctor” Zhang Wu promoted the idea in his best-selling book that by simply eating green beans, one could cure diseases of all sorts. Ironically, in February 2014, Zhang was diagnosed with cerebral infarction. In an interview, he admitted that his green beat diet wasn’t working and had to cease the treatment.

9. “Electricity” treatment



Li Yi, who was dubbed a “fairy priest”, claimed he had found a way to “master 220 volt electricity,” allowing him to cure patients’ cancer with electrical current. A paraplegic patient of his was able to have conscious control of the body after the treatment, and medical experts have strongly questioned it.

10. “Holy water” therapy



Images from October 5, 2012 show nearly a hundred people fighting over the so-called “holy water” from a creek in Zhejiang. It was believed by residents that the water could cure ailments, although medical tests showed that it was no more special than the tap water in their kitchen.

11. Dietary supplement therapy



On December 5, 2005, a group of businessmen visited a remote village in Hunan, boasting a health care supplement which they claimed could cure illnesses. One of the buyers happily showed off her “achievement”, which cost her 160 yuan, although she was completely unaware that the supplements had a value of only 10 yuan.

Not only are they overpriced and ineffective, sometimes the supplements can prove dangerous. Earlier this month, supplements meant to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were blacklisted after they were found to have damaging impurities inside the liquid.

29,29,FL-2014-000095-CHN,The Faulty 'Mental Models' That Lead to Poor Disaster Preparation - Knowledge@Wharton,https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/wind-rain-worse/,"As Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy were bearing down on the South and East Coasts of the United States, respectively, in the summer and fall of 2012, Wharton marketing professor Robert Meyer and his research team took to the phone lines to survey people in the storms’ crosshairs about what they perceived the greatest threats to be, and how they were preparing to face them.

Through this and several other studies, Meyer — who is also co-director of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center — and his colleagues find that most people fail to adequately understand the threats they face as a result of natural and other disasters, and often those poor “mental models” lead to insufficient preparation. The findings are outlined in “The Dynamics of Hurricane Risk Perception: Real Time Evidence from the 2012 Atlantic Hurricane Season,” by Meyer, Jay Baker of Florida State University, Kenneth Broad of the University of Miami and Ben Orlove of Columbia University, which will appear in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Association; “Dynamic Simulation as an Approach to Understanding Hurricane Risk Response: Insights from the Stormview Lab,” by Meyer, Broad, Orlove and Nada Petrovic of Columbia, which appeared in Risk Analysis, and Meyer’s article, “Why We Fail to Learn from Disasters,” which appeared in the book, The Irrational Economist: Overcoming Irrational Decisions in a Dangerous World.

In an interview with Knowledge@Wharton, Meyer discusses these findings and offers several suggestions for changing the way both authorities and private citizens think about, and react to, such hazards. He also identifies the next great challenge facing the risk management world — climate change.

An edited transcript of the conversation appears below.

On the three biases that impact disaster preparation:

A lot of the work that I do and a lot of the work that we do at the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center involves how people make decisions to prepare for hazards — whether it’s an earthquake or a hurricane or, for example, a possible terrorist attack and so forth. And a lot of the work that I’ve done is focused on figuring out why people often make mistakes when making these preparations.

[Often] when we have disasters, people come in after the fact and say, “Well, if they had only done this” or “Why did people leave their cars in a flood zone when they were given all these warnings that floods were going to come in?” Basically, what we found over a number of years and using a combination of field surveys and working with people in laboratories, is that effectively, people are subject to three major biases. One is, simply put, that there is a tendency to under-appreciate the future or under-consider the future, or future consequences. A second thing is that people are too quick to forget the past, or too slow to remember the negative events that have happened in the past. The third one is that if in doubt, what often happens is that people will follow the advice of other people who are no less prone to those sorts of mistakes than they are.

“Only 23% of people who were located right along the immediate coast — the people who were most in harm’s way from Sandy — made plans for what they would do if they had to evacuate.”

On the causes (and consequences) of “bad mental models”:

We’re really interested in studying why people make these mistakes. Why is it that they don’t consider the future enough? Why is it that they too quickly forget the past? And why is it they just turn to other people if in doubt? The main thing that we find is that often, for a lot of hazards, people have really bad mental models of how things are going to unfold.

For example, if a hurricane is coming, in order for you to make a decision about how to prepare for it, how many packs of batteries to get, or even whether or not you should evacuate, what you have to do is mentally reconstruct how this is event going to unfold. For example: How high is the water going to get? When the wind comes, how strong will it be? And what is it going to do to my house? Then people have to mentally simulate how this thing is going to unfold — and then, based on that, make a decision about the right preparations, such as estimating how many days they are going to need to be prepared for possibly being without power.

People often have very bad mental models, so they do that process very poorly. What they think is going to happen is often very different from what actually does happen. One of the things we found out from surveys we did of [people impacted by] Hurricane Sandy was when it was approaching the East Coast, people grossly underestimated a couple of things — one of which is how long the after-effects of the storm were going to be.

Often in media coverage of such events, you would [hear], “Well, a hurricane is coming, a hurricane is coming tonight,” and people draw from that [and think] the thing that they have to worry about is getting through the night. They have these images of sitting in their homes and winds swirling all around, the roof blowing off and so forth. In the case of Sandy that was never really in the cards for most people. What was in the cards, particularly for people living inland, was [potentially] being without power for two weeks. And in that particular case, people were all set to survive the night — they had enough beer and they had enough pizza and they had enough snacks to get them through the storm event, but they weren’t really prepared for the two weeks afterward.

[Before the storm hit,] we asked people, “Do you have plans for where you would go if you have to evacuate?” We found out that only 23% of people who were located right along the immediate coast — the people who were most in harm’s way from Sandy — made plans for what they would do if they had to evacuate.

On the dangers of water vs. wind:

One of the conclusions that we made from a lot of the Sandy work, for example, was just underscoring how bad people’s mental models were. People who lived right along the coast really underestimated the impacts that they had to worry about.

What they should have been worried about was floods, or water damage, not necessarily wind damage…. In some sense, flooding is the thing that kills people in hurricanes, not wind. Flooding is worse. Yet, when we talked to people [during Sandy] who lived as close as one half block from the water and asked them, “What are you most worried about?” what they said is, “Wind, I’m worried about wind” — when in fact, water was the thing that they really had to worry about. And in fact, most of the deaths in New York City [as a result of Sandy] were due to people drowning from floods, and something like 250,000 cars were lost due to flooding. These were all avoidable losses; people simply had to move inland a little bit; people just had to move their cars to higher ground.

But if you’re thinking that what you should worry about is wind, the proper thing to do is stay where you are. There is an adage in hurricane preparation that you should flee from water and hide against the wind. The idea is that you should shelter in place, given a windstorm. So, what people were doing was sort of correct — if you think that wind is the one thing you have to worry about, you shouldn’t leave. You should stay in your home, not go anywhere and keep your car right there. But what they were really facing was a big flood or a water disaster and they were prepared completely for the wrong thing. What they should have done is left, but they stayed.

On helping people better prepare for risks:

The basic problem is how do you get people to have a better mental model, or to be able to better mentally simulate what’s going to happen to them so that they can line up what’s going to happen to them with how they’re going to prepare for it. Right now, the real problem is that people aren’t getting very specific information about what is going to happen to them at their house.

When hurricanes approach, people tend to sit down and watch television — even people who normally spend a lot of time on the Internet and get all of their information from Twitter feeds and Facebook. They watch the Weather Channel, they watch CNN, and what they’re getting is a very monolithic view of what is going to happen during the storm. In particular, if you’re living in coastal New Jersey, you will see a broadcaster sitting in Central Park in New York, or the Battery in New York — so you’re not getting a real clear sense as to what’s happening to you, personally.

“If you’ve been living in a place for a long time and you’ve never seen rising water, the idea that your house might be underwater someday is very, very difficult to imagine.”

One of the challenges is — and I know that the National Hurricane Center … is trying to [address] this — is finding ways of communicating to people at specific locations the actual experience that they are going to get. Another challenge, which is also really tough to overcome, is how to get people to appreciate the threat that water poses. We find that people tend not to buy flood insurance — even people that live in a flood area don’t buy it. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a real tough time trying to convince people to buy flood insurance because it’s something that they have a difficult time imagining. If you’ve been living in a place for a long time and you’ve never seen rising water, the idea that your house might be underwater someday is very, very difficult to imagine.

Usually, when we talk about hurricanes, you naturally think of a wind storm, and in fact, the National Hurricane Center grades the severity of storms based on category, and the category is tied to wind speed. So when people think of hurricanes, they naturally think hurricanes mean wind, and they don’t really think much about water effects. One of the real challenges is how do you get that across to people and how do you try to correct for that? For example, a lot of the forecasts will say something like, “When this storm comes in, there could be a ten foot storm surge.” But, then you have to ask — how many people know how high up over sea level their house is? No one knows that. It’s hard to make the connection between that and what their personal impacts are going to be. One of the things to do … is try to de-emphasize in forecasts the tension that is given to the damage that is caused by wind, and really focus a whole lot more on the personal damage that can happen through flooding.

When people are unsure of what to do in a situation and they don’t know which of several actions to take, often they fall back to what psychologists call “default biases” — that is, if you don’t know what to do, just do the thing that is easiest, or the thing that you’re used to doing. If you think about it in the context of preparations, the default bias is to do nothing. It’s just to stay at home; it’s not to go out and buy extra supplies and things like that.

Often people worry about what happens if they take precautions and nothing happens. If [authorities] say I should fill up my whole house with water, and I should get five cases of water to last me for two weeks, people are thinking, “Well, how long am I going to be without water? They tell me two weeks, but it could be two days, and I remember a time in the past when the storm came in and nothing happened.” And after a while, you just can’t make a decision, and people end up doing nothing. So another of the possibilities is to think about ways of making preparation or taking precautions to be the default action rather than the effortful action.

For example, one of my colleagues at the Risk Center is advocating that one way to make sure people renew their flood insurance is that when someone buys a home in a flood-prone area, make insurance part of the mortgage. That way, every year, you naturally have to renew it — it’s not a decision you have to consciously make. One idea that I’ve had is that as part of your property taxes in a given year, you automatically pay for a hurricane protection kit. In hurricane prone areas, the community would come by and drop off a protection kit for you, and they will give you your money back if you don’t want it. Therefore, you have to consciously think — rather than the default being whether to take action, the default is whether to not take action, and I think that people are more inclined to safety under that circumstance.

On why our ‘mental models’ don’t just fail us during hurricanes:

Though much of our work tends to be focused on hurricane preparation, a lot of the biases that we observe in the context of why people make mistakes preparing for hurricanes are really observed in a wide variety of other contexts.

For example, consider protection against terrorism. There is a great image going back to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — there is a famous picture of Mohamed Atta walking by security at the … airport, and you see … an attendant who is at the counter basically letting this person go through. It epitomizes one of the real problems in trying to prepare for events that happen with very, very low frequency, but, when they do happen, have incredibly dramatic consequences: Most of the time, we’re reinforced for not doing anything. The number of times we’re taking a lot of effortful action to protect against something, the number of times that you are ever actually going to encounter a disaster is very, very rare. For example, for someone who is an airport screener, how often do they actually see a terrorist coming through? It almost never happens.

We learn by trial and error; when you put out a little effort to work harder, think harder, put up more protection and prepare for a storm, or become more vigilant against a possible terrorist attack, most of the time, it’s not going to be rewarded. Most of the time, it’s going to be effort for nothing. And that is often why people, for instance, will cancel their flood insurance. Most of the time when they buy flood insurance, they write out a big check for it, and there is no flood. The next year, they write out another big check — and, again, no flood. All of a sudden, they’re thinking, “Wow, I could have used that money to buy a good TV … and I’m wasting it on flood insurance.” After Hurricane Katrina, which was very vivid in the press in terms of all the flooding that happened in New Orleans, there was a significant increase in the number of people nationwide who bought flood insurance. What was interesting is one year after Hurricane Katrina, all of a sudden a large proportion of those people cancelled their flood insurance because they didn’t see a reward associated with it. And that’s the type of thing that occurs all over the place.

Another bias that occurs is that people tend to suffer what psychologists call an “optimistic bias.” An optimistic bias means that you recognize that there is some hazard out there and there is a really good chance that it can occur, but the tendency is to think that when it does occur, the real harm is going to be to somebody else; it’s not going to be to you. I think every parent who has had their teenager start to drive has given them a stern warning, “Never text and drive.” But you kind of know that the teenager is going to — they understand what the dangers are, but there is an instinct that says, “Yeah, that’s going to happen, but it’s not going to happen to me. I’m going to be the careful one; it’s going to happen to someone else.” Then, all of a sudden, you have an accident — and hopefully, it’s not a tragic consequence.

We see this robustly across a wide variety of different areas, for things like terrorist attacks and wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, you name the disaster. I think the research has also reinforced for me … how people learn the consequences of these things. They don’t learn them from things that have personally happened to them; they learn about them from seeing images of these things happening in other places. For example, when a hurricane is coming, or if I’m worried about an earthquake, I’ve never seen an earthquake at my house, but I’ve seen [news footage of] earthquakes in Chile; I’ve seen footage of a lot of earthquakes in China, and [I think] that’s where earthquakes occur. Therefore, I’m worried about earthquakes, but [I think] it’s not going to happen at my house. It’s going to be in the [San Francisco Bay] area; it’s going to happen in Chile; it’s going to happen in Japan or in China.

On the possibility of block-by-block forecasting:

I think we’re actually a lot closer to that than it might seem. Certainly, right now, there is high resolution satellite elevation data available, and block-by-block information that emergency planners do know — for example, if a tide was to come up to a certain level, they know what will happen at a particular house; they really have that information.

We have an awful lot of data like that. But one of the problems is how do you get that information to an individual in a way so that they could understand the personal relevance. Using apps and smartphone technology, I think that we’re not that far away from that. I think that often people may not respond to a generic message that says, “Everyone in West Philadelphia should do this,” because when you’re thinking, “Well, it’s not me in West Philadelphia; it’s this other person in West Philadelphia; their house is the one that is going be in danger.” But, on the other hand, if I get a message that basically says, “Robert Meyer, this is a dedicated message for you that this is what’s going to happen to your house at your particular address,” suddenly I can identify with that information a whole lot more and I understand it’s not a generic message, but it’s speaking to me directly.

On the importance of real-life examples and simulations:

I think the real challenge in trying to figure out how do you get better communication messages and how do you study how people make preparations for disasters is that there are not a lot of opportunities to study that in the real world. Fortunately, we’re not into a situation where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is going to run a controlled experiment of “Let’s not warn some people [about a disaster] and let’s warn some other people and see what happens.” We obviously can’t do that.

A research group that I’m involved in is developing very realistic simulations in which a person is put into a virtual living room and has the opportunity to turn on the television, check the web, or leave the house and talk to neighbors. The goal is that in the context of simulations, they can experience, for example, a virtual hurricane coming in over a period of time and they get to watch the news feeds as they change, all done hypothetically. The great thing about that is we can use that as a natural laboratory for testing how people’s decisions in this simulated environment would be altered if we gave them different kinds of messages. Or if the tone of the TV broadcast was a little bit different? Or what happens if the people that they talk to are experts vs. novices with respect to hurricanes?

“As hard as it is to get people to take actions, to prepare against immediate threats like hurricanes … getting people to see the benefits in taking protections against sea level rise or global warming is much, much harder.”

We can’t run these controlled experiments in the in the field. One of the natural reservations that you might have [about simulations] is that there is a real difference between sitting at a computer lab and responding to a hypothetical hurricane threat vs. actually experiencing a hurricane or experiencing a real earthquake. But, what we find surprisingly, is that the way in which people behave in these two environments is remarkably similar — that if you design these simulations realistically enough, all of people’s natural instincts for what they would do when these things happen in real life kick in.

For example, when we had the simulation where you were put into this virtual living room, our worry was that people would try things in the living room that they wouldn’t naturally do, just because it’s a simulation. What we found, however, was that in these hurricane simulations people tended to turn on the TV. And that’s exactly what they do in real life…. When we correlate the utilization of media in the simulation with the utilization in the field that we observe in our hurricane studies, there is a remarkable parallel. We see a lot of the same biases coming up in one or the other. So, that gives us a lot of optimism that, in fact, we can start testing of communication vehicles and so forth in the lab, which means hopefully, we can [eventually] take them into the real world. You gave the example of can we do better individual targeting of the impacts of disasters — one of the things we can do in our simulations is [participants in the studies] have a table that they can look at and there is a cell phone sitting on the table, and one of the things we can do is manipulate the type of message that appears on that cell phone.

On what comes next:

One of the things that we’re actually interested in lately, which is a front-burner item for a lot of people — not only for people in hazard preparation, but also for people in business is — is how to respond to climate change. Scientists are really uncertain as to how this will affect, for example, hurricane impacts, frequency of tornados and droughts and so forth. But I think there is a general feeling that things will be different in the future than they are now. And a lot of this mitigation against climate change is something that requires both individuals and communities to make very large, long-term investments in protection.

For example, New York City after Sandy is thinking about, “Well, what can we do to protect against sea level rise?” The problem with sea level rise is [that] in order to protect against it, you’re talking about not just putting up some sand bags, but major, multi-billion dollar investments in infrastructure, which is something that communities don’t like to do. And unfortunately, it’s the type of thing that when you look at [a government] budget in a given year, you say, “Well, we want to do it, we want to be safe, but in some sense, we don’t really have the money to do it this year. We’ll put it off to next year.” And then, next year becomes the year after and the next year becomes after that, and then, eventually, suddenly, there’s another Sandy that comes in, and there’s another flood.

One of the things we were interested in studying is how communities will adapt to climate change — in particular, sea level rise. And what are types of messages and types of things that you can do to get people to see the benefits of investments today against something that is really long-term — where in fact, you may never even see the benefits of [the investment] in your life-time.

In six charts - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/whats-your-city-doing-to-protect-you-from-climate-change-in-six-charts,"From London to Sao Paulo, half the world’s population resides in huge urban metropolises. But living in some cities will be worse for your health than others. New research pinpoints more than 200 cities leading the way in tackling climate, protecting citizens and businesses along the way.

Is yours one of them?

Cities under pressure

Cities are hubs of economic and human activity. They house at least 50 per cent of the world’s population and produce more than 80 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP).

But the concentration of people and assets make cities vulnerable when disaster strikes. In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned of an increasing risk to cities from climate change, through rising temperatures, increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves, and greater risk of flooding. Coastal cities also have to deal with rising sea level rise.

But cities are taking the initiative in tackling climate change, according to a new report from the Cities Climate Leadership Group ( C40). It looked at what 207 cities across the world are doing to alleviate climate change’s impacts.

Waking up to climate change threats

The concentration of people and industry means cities are responsible for per cent of global greenhouse emissions. But there’s some good news on that front.

Together, emissions reductions in Denver, London, Madrid, Durban and Taipei add up to 12 per cent compared to 2009 levels – a total saving of 13.1 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

On top of mitigation efforts, cities are waking up to the risks posed by climate change. Of the 207 cities surveyed, 76 per cent recognised that climate change could impact business.

What are the risks?

The potential impacts on cities are far-ranging, affecting food supply and distribution, disruption to supply chains, transport, tourism and the health and well-being of the resident workforce.

In the 76 per cent of cities that recognised climate change risks, the most common concerns were damage to property and capital, as the figure below show. Next were impacts on residents, availability of raw materials, and infrastructure.

Feeling the heat

Rising temperatures in cities exacerbates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This where the design and density in a city means surface temperatures are higher than the surrounding countryside.

The map below from a new paper also out yesterday looked at different cities across America, concluding the UHI effect – and its impacts of heat stress on residents – is worse in wet climates.

Cities in the wetter eastern part of the country fare rather less well than those in the west – with the UHI effect raising temperatures by more than six degrees Celsius in some places.

Small circles mean a small UHI effect, big circles the biggest. Red dots are cities with low annual rainfall, blue dots have high annual rainfall. Green is in the middle. Source: Zhao et al., ( 2014)

Cities face other direct risks on top of temperature changes. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation (OECD) recently concluded more than $3 trillion in assets is at risk from climate change impacts on ports – which make up more than 50 per cent of the world’s largest cities.

In Cleveland in the US, the $6.5 billion shipping industry in Lake Erie is at risk from as combination of more frequent large storms and lower lake levels, says the report.

Cities taking action

Businesses are likely to be particularly vulnerable to changing climate, as the recent “Risky Business” report highlighted in the US. But perceptions of climate risk in the businesses community aren’t necessarily aligned with those of the city itself, the new report says.

But as the chart below shows, there’s fairly broad agreement – only 31 per cent of the risks identified by businesses weren’t also recognised by the city government, the report finds.

For the most serious physical risks, the figure is lower at 25 per cent. The strongest agreement between cities and businesses is in temperature related impacts, like the impact of heat stress.

Source: CDP Global Cities Report 2014

Where cities and businesses have identified the same risks, they’re taking action against them in 96 per cent of cases, the report notes.

Who’s doing what to adapt?

Cities are making significant efforts to make themselves more resilient to climate change’s impacts, says the report. In total, 102 of the 207 cities surveyed have climate adaptation plans – that’s a total of 757 separate adaptation measures.

There are a number of ways cities can increase its resilience to climate change. They can direct invest in flood management plans, emergency response systems and infrastructure. Local governments can also regulate for businesses to manage their own risks, or create incentives.

Take the city of London. As the chart below shows, the biggest risk expected by businesses is from storms and floods (red), followed by the effects of rising temperatures and sea level rise.

Source: CDP Global Cities Report 2014

Energy efficiency in London is prioritised through building design, says the report. The Greater London Authority invests $188,000 a year to support businesses to create green roofs, for example. This is intended to reduce both energy consumption and the need for air conditioning.

This makes particularly interesting reading this week as there’s been concern in the UK media that the part of government responsible for adaptation isn’t taking climate change seriously.

A new report from the Committee on Climate Change warned our roads, railways and water companies are ill-equipped to face the consequences of climate change.

A tailored approach

Other cities are taking different approaches, tailored to their own vulnerabilities. Sao Paulo is a huge megacity – the largest city by population in the southern hemisphere. As an emerging economy, climate change exacerbates the challenges the city already faces, the report notes.

Managing land use, building flood defences and better water management are key priorities. Drought is the biggest concern for businesses from climate change, as the chart below shows. The city is also investing $22 billion to improve its transport infrastructure, the report notes.

Source: CDP Global Cities Report 2014

There are co-benefits to adaptation, says the report. Future-proofing cities makes them more attractive to new business, which brings in jobs, tax revenue and services. 97 per cent of cities recognise climate change adaptation can create new economic opportunities, the report notes.

For example, Portland in the United States reports that it saves $5.5 million each year through its City Energy Challenge, which invests in energy, water and communication networks.

Business is where it all begins, is the message of the report. Beginning by embedding local adaptation measures in their own day-to-day operations will help reduce climate change risks across the city, the report concludes. What’s more, it’s often local businesses that will be the first to highlight climate change risks to society and the wider economy, which cities can follow up on.

Traffic gridlocks, eight car crashes in just two hours and more than 100 roads flooded marked the start of Cape Town’s big storm weekend.

Emergency Services brought in more staff amid warnings that more rain and plunging temperatures were expected on Saturday.

City authorities issued warnings of flooding in low-lying areas as rain and strong winds began lashing the metropole at about 3.30pm on Friday. Within hours there were reports that 103 roads were flooded.

Traffic out of the city and in several suburbs was gridlocked for hours.

Cape Town traffic services spokeswoman Maxine Jordaan said there were eight accidents from 4pm-6pm on Friday.

No deaths were reported.

City disaster risk management acting head Wilfred Solomons-Johannes said yesterday he had received reports of 103 flooded roads, and that this number was expected to increase overnight.

According to reports on social media, roads were flooded in Ravensmead, Paarden Eiland, Khayelitsha, Belgravia, Durbanville, Heideveld, Wynberg, the city centre, Pinelands and the Strand.

Solomons-Johannes said disaster response teams would work throughout the night, on the alert for residents needing evacuation.

At the time of going to print last night there were confirmed reports the Diep River in Plumstead had burst its banks, while social media users tweeted that the Liesbeek River could also overflow.

The rain brought flooding to parts of the Civic Centre, where mayor Patricia de Lille has her offices.

Chapman’s Peak Drive and the Table Mountain Cableway, meanwhile, were closed for safety reasons before the storm hit yesterday.

The Cape Town Weather Office said there was an 80 percent chance of showers and thundershowers today, with a maximum temperature of 12°C.

The bad weather is expected to continue overnight into Sunday morning, before clearing during the day.

Cold conditions are forecast into next week, with maximum temperatures below 15°C.

Provincial Emergency Medical Services spokesman Robert Daniels said that 65 ambulance crews and three rescue crews were on duty this weekend.

The city has warned of localised flooding in various areas of the Cape Metropole, Overberg, Cape Winelands and South-Western Cape District.

EMS crews from outlying areas have also been put on standby.

Daniels said the province’s non-emergency health transport fleet would help evacuate Capetonians from low-lying areas in the event of flooding.

Last month, nearly 2 000 shacks in low-lying areas were flooded after heavy rain, with Khayelitsha’s TR section, the Phola Park informal settlement in Gugulethu and New Village in Nomzamo hardest hit.

The city handed out thousands of flood kits, blankets and food packs. The disaster risk management centre asked residents to report blocked drains, intakes and illegal dumping.

These blockages can cause water to dam up and increase the risk of flooding in low-lying areas.

As rain caused traffic to come to a standstill yesterday, motorists took to Twitter to air their frustration and warn about areas to avoid.

“Severe flooding on St John’s road in Durbanville Cape Town. Use alternate route,” tweeted @LeeSmeed.

“No one can get out of capetown CBD. Weather has created havoc... done 0 kms in 15 mins,” tweeted city centre worker @byroncpt.

Rough seas with wave heights of 6-7.5m are expected between Cape Point and Plettenberg Bay this afternoon, but are expected to subside tonight.

The cold front will also bring the chance of snowfalls to most of the Western Cape’s mountains, the weather office said, including Table Mountain, an unusual occurrence in the mother city.

Killed: Zhang Tai, eight, was beaten to death by a gang of boys near Zhangjiakou in China, police said today

Tai was taken to hospital with bruises and severe head injuries, but was later declared dead.



Today, police said the gang had confessed to killing their classmate after deciding they were bored and looking for something interesting to do.



Police spokesman, Cong Lu, said the idea had been apparently suggested by a ringleader, who had been seen with Tai and the other boys in the minutes leading up to the attack.



'We are interviewing all of the boys now to try to find out the extent to which each was involved,' she said.

Tai's grandfather, Zhang Kuo, 67, said he had left the young boy playing in the yard, but when he went out later to see him there was no sign of the child.

He said another boy had told him that Tai had gone off with a group of boys because 'they promised not to beat him any more if he agreed to go with them.'

'I was instantly worried because I know that one of them is a bully,' said Kuo.

'My grandson told me that he had to call the boy ""Big Brother"" and that whenever he wanted someone to follow him he would either threaten them, or if he couldn't threaten them would provide them with food from his father's shop.

'He didn't like my grandson because he had refused to hand over his pocket money and later complained to his mother.'

Tai's father Zhang Han, who works as a bricklayer, said his son had often been the victim of local bullies.

'I have to go to the local town to work so my son is being raised here by my grandfather, and without parents he was often the victim of local bullies,' said the 42-year-old.



'He told me that the pocket money I gave him was often stolen by local boys and he didn't like going to school because he was picked on. But I never realised things had got this bad.'

He added that he and Kuo are are suing both the local school for failing to stop the bullying and the parents of those involved in the alleged murder.

'When my wife left me and our son two years ago it was hard to find the strength to go on, but knowing that Tai was healthy and well helped me keep going,' he said.","Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/11/article-2688771-1F91C08900000578-171_636x382.jpg,"['13', 'gang', 'confess', 'aged', 'local', 'classmate', 'beat', 'zhang', 'later', 'eightyearold', 'tai', 'killing', 'bruised', 'boys', 'china']",

World leaders must dig deep now to set in motion near-term actions that support low-carbon economic growth and deliver a climate deal strong enough to prevent catastrophic climate change.

The science has never been clearer. Countries must take action now to reduce heat-trapping pollution over the next decades; only then can they avoid the crushing costs of more severe floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and other extreme weather events driven by steadily rising global temperatures. A new report from the Risky Business Project estimates that the costs of climate change could rise to hundreds of billions of dollars by 2100. The study reveals the wide-ranging financial risks of climate inaction, including the more than $50 billion worth of coastal assets likely to be underwater by 2050 as sea levels continue to rise, and the expected 50 percent to 70 percent drop in crop yields over the next decade alone. The latter will cost corn and wheat farmers in the American Southeast, Great Plains, and Midwest tens of billions of dollars.

Right now, nations are set to achieve less than half of the carbon-pollution reductions needed by 2020 to prevent catastrophic climate change. Fortunately, with smart policies—such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s new carbon-pollution standards—and existing technologies, leaders can put the world on track for low-carbon economic growth and safeguard the climate for future generations.

On September 23, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will convene a Climate Leaders Summit in New York City. At the summit, he expects world leaders to announce “bold pledges” and “concrete action” to close the emissions gap and lay the groundwork for an ambitious 2015 global climate agreement. The timing of the summit is hardly ideal for some leaders to make courageous new climate commitments; there are both U.S. midterm elections and Brazilian elections coming up in the fall, and India has a new leader who may be hesitant to enact dramatic policy changes so early in his term. Yet there are a number of achievable actions world leaders can embrace to set a cost-effective course toward low-carbon development. Four possible actions are discussed below.

1. Improve building energy efficiency

Energy efficiency drives economic growth while lowering energy bills, pollution, health care costs, and the need for costly investments in new power plants. According to the International Energy Agency, or IEA, improving energy efficiency is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon pollution. Indeed, it could deliver 44 percent of the carbon-pollution reductions needed to meet the global goal to limit warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the IEA calculates that, by 2035, energy-efficiency improvements could increase global economic output by $18 trillion.

Recognizing energy efficiency as a win-win strategy, the MEF has been working to secure country-level initiatives to increase energy efficiency in buildings. In the United States, buildings are responsible for 41 percent of energy use and 40 percent of domestic carbon pollution. Together, the major economies emit 80 percent of the world’s carbon pollution, making the MEF a powerful forum for leadership and transformative action.

President Barack Obama launched the MEF in 2009 to create a small, agile forum to accelerate progress in the slow-moving and much larger U.N. climate negotiations and advance concrete clean energy initiatives. To minimize the mounting financial and public health risks linked to climate change, MEF countries should double down during their meetings in July and September to come to an agreement on the building energy-efficiency commitments they have been debating for the past year.

The United States is in a strong position to lead the charge on building efficiency. In 2011, President Obama announced the Better Buildings Initiative to improve the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial buildings by 20 percent over the next 10 years.

The IEA offers a number of building-efficiency recommendations, including a net-zero energy consumption goal for all new buildings by 2020. A net-zero energy building produces as much energy as it uses over the course of a year. It can do this through design innovations that reduce energy demand and renewable energy that meets building occupants’ reduced needs. While only a relatively small number of net-zero energy buildings have been constructed to date, technological advances and rapidly dropping renewable energy system costs are making these innovative building designs more feasible every year. Since the net-zero energy goal may not be achievable for tall commercial buildings—which have higher energy demands to power elevators—countries could aim to meet it for building groups rather than individual buildings.

China and other rapidly emerging economies are spending more on new construction than are developed countries. Therefore, MEF countries should also commit to improving the efficiency of existing buildings. At a minimum, they should commit to doubling the rate of energy-efficiency improvements for buildings by 2030—echoing the goal backed by Sustainable Energy for All, a multistakeholder partnership between governments, the private sector, and civil society led by the U.N. secretary-general.

Solidifying strong energy-efficiency goals for buildings at the July and September MEF meetings would allow MEF country leaders to announce these goals at the September Climate Leaders Summit and to recruit other leaders for similar commitments. This would send a strong market signal to increase energy-efficiency investments, lower energy costs for industry and consumers, and build momentum to secure a strong global climate agreement in 2015. If the MEF is not able to broker building-efficiency goals by September, its leaders should look quickly to other forums, such as the G-20, to seal the deal. The G-20, led by finance ministers and heads of state from the world’s 20 largest economies, has already committed to advancing energy efficiency and increasing sustainable energy development. To help achieve the goal of supporting economic growth and innovation, G-20 leaders should lock in strong energy efficiency goals at the November G-20 Summit.

2. Make climate change the focus of the Arctic Council

The Arctic is warming two times faster than any other region on earth. Arctic sea ice has shrunk by 75 percent over the past few decades, making it likely that summers in the region will be ice free by the 2050s or sooner. The effects of Arctic climate change will be felt around the world as melting sea ice in the Greenland Arctic speeds up global sea-level rise and increases flood risks. It will also endanger infrastructure and communities in coastal cities around the globe, including in major U.S. metropolitan areas, such as Miami and New York. For these reasons, a recent Center for American Progress report called on Secretary of State John Kerry to make climate change the main theme of the Arctic Council agenda when he takes over the council’s chairmanship next year.

The Arctic Council was launched in 1994 by the eight Arctic nations—Canada; Denmark, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands; Finland; Iceland; Norway; Russia; Sweden; and the United States—to peacefully manage its fragile environment, risks, and commercial opportunities. Arctic Council members, along with observer nations, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, and others, produce at least 30 percent of global black carbon emissions and 42 percent of global methane emissions. Reducing these super pollutants—both powerful drivers of regional and global warming—would help prevent global temperatures from spiking above the 2 degree Celsius threshold.

At the Climate Leaders Summit, President Obama and the leaders of the seven other Arctic Council nations should commit to focusing the 2015–2017 Arctic Council agenda on climate change. President Obama should also pledge to host a Presidential Arctic Summit in 2016 to make near-term progress on the initiatives described above. These commitments would build momentum for a strong 2015 climate deal and directly support the September summit’s aims to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy, reduce short-lived climate pollutants, and improve community resilience.

3. Reduce global poverty through climate action

Climate change jeopardizes economic progress and threatens to undo decades of successful poverty alleviation efforts around the globe. From floods, infrastructure damage, and migration caused by sea-level rise to food security threatened by falling crop yields and struggling fisheries, the burden of climate change will fall largely on the most vulnerable populations. Well-designed actions to cut carbon pollution and build resilience can support sustainable economic growth and fight poverty in meaningful and measurable ways.

Country representatives are designing a new global development agenda that will take effect when the Millennium Development Goals—eight voluntary goals adopted in 2000 by leaders from 191 countries—expire in 2015. Once agreed upon, the post-2015 goals will serve as a road map through 2030 for countries, local governments, development institutions, and the private sector to stamp out poverty and support sustainable development. While the new global development agenda will not be finalized until September 2015, world leaders should use this year’s Climate Leaders Summit to commit to incorporating strong climate actions into it. As a recent CAP and Climate Advisers report shows, countries can drive sustainable, low-carbon economic development with well-designed development goals and targets, including those that support resilient infrastructure; climate-smart agriculture; the maintenance of coastal wetlands and forests; access to more efficient, clean energy; and improved air quality. By committing to making climate change part of the post-2015 development agenda, world leaders would support climate-smart development through 2030 and advance the summit’s goals of accelerating cities’ climate action, building community resilience, and reducing disaster risks.

4. Phase down heat-trapping HFCs under the Montreal Protocol

The production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, has steadily increased for the past two decades. HFCs are a common substitute for ozone-depleting substances, which were banned under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone. Although HFCs are ozone-safe, they nevertheless endanger the global climate. HFCs are hundreds to tens of thousands of times more potent than carbon pollution as drivers of global warming and could account for as much as 20 percent of global heat-trapping emissions by 2050. Fortunately, phasing down HFCs supports innovation and efficiency improvements and buys countries time to reduce carbon pollution and hold warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

In September 2013, leaders from the United States, China, India, and other G-20 nations agreed to work together to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. These efforts stalled one month later when India blocked discussion on the amendment during a meeting in Bangkok. Now that India’s elections have ushered in new leadership, the United States should accelerate diplomatic outreach to India in order to reinvigorate action to phase down HFCs. The United States and other nations must also convince Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the summit, something to which he has not yet committed. At the September summit, G-20 leaders should reaffirm their September 2013 commitment to use “the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs” and pledge to amend the protocol by the end of 2015. If Prime Minister Modi does not attend the summit, leaders should renew their HFC phasedown commitment during the U.N. General Assembly—a forum where world leaders can discuss pressing international issues—which will occur immediately after the summit.

Conclusion

In the coming months, world leaders have the opportunity to deliver cost-effective actions that will drive low-carbon economic growth and build momentum for an ambitious international climate agreement. By committing to the four goals discussed above, these leaders can help boost the economy and deliver a strong 2015 global climate agreement that will ensure a healthy, safe planet for future generations.

35,35,FL-2014-000095-CHN,"Dominion: ""The Flood"" Review - IGN",https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/dominion-the-flood-review,"Warning: full episode spoilers follow.

Dominion hasn't been what I'd call a great series so far, but it's shown a lot of potential, and its strengths have definitely outweighed its flaws. Unfortunately, ""The Flood"" proved to be the first episode where that wasn't necessarily the case. With too much focus on characters and conflicts that just didn't seem to matter (the minor soldier characters, for one), as well as a weirdly compressed character arc for Alex, this episode just didn't satisfy.

Alex dealt with the fallout of going AWOL and abandoning Vega for all of one episode. I can't say I was expecting him to immediately be thrown in jail. But this did create an immediate sense of danger, as Alex had to concoct some way of keeping his tattoos hidden from the guards and inmates. As always, headbutting a guard is a surefire way to get thrown in solitary. This wasn't a bad start to Alex's storyline this week. If anything, I would have liked to see ""The Flood"" focus more on Alex's struggles in the slammer. The writers could have played out his ongoing attempts to stay under the radar, maybe even over the course of multiple episodes. And a deeper focus on the prison might have offered an interesting glimpse of how the other half lives in Vega.Instead, the focus this week was on a hostage crisis as Senator Frost (David Weogh doing a bang-up impression of Jim Broadbent) snapped and held both General Reisen and David Whele at gunpoint. This plotline was pretty much flawed from the start. Hostage crises only make for good drama when you're emotionally invested in the characters and fear for their well-being. Sure, Whele is one of the show's more compelling characters so far, but I haven't grown attached to him yet to the point where I'm going to be especially saddened at his death. Certainly not Reisen. Moreover, I'm surprised that Reisen's congestive heart failure wasn't brought to bear. For a man who could drop dead from a bum heart at any moment, you'd think that might become an issue when facing death by gunshot or drowning is imminent. Instead, Whele took a bullet to the leg.

Katrine de Candoli debuts as Uriel.

This plotline also suffered because of the lack of prior development with Senator Frost. A ""blink and you'll miss him"" character from a prior episode, Frost suddenly appeared in the spotlight as a man driven by faith and tragedy to force the government's hand. Again, if the show had built to this moment more methodically and in due course, it might have worked. But I didn't care about Frost. The reference to his dead daughter seemed like a lazy way of forcing viewers to connect with him. Nor did I buy his transition from being violently skeptical of Alex's status as the Chosen One to utterly convinced simply because Alex repeated ""She died for you"" a few times. There was some good interplay between Frost and Whele as the former poked fun at the latter's former career, but that was about it.I mentioned how Alex's character arc feels compressed, and the resolution t this conflict illustrates why. In the course of these four episode, he's gone from being an ordinary soldier to discovering his greater destiny to rebelling against said destiny to coming full circle and accepting it. It's strange that the show is generally slow-moving but seems to have a bad case of A.D.D. with this one character. That said, I do look forward to seeing how Alex's training with Michael plays out.There was a lot that didn't work about this episode, but some elements did satisfy. It was interesting to see another Higher Angel come into play in the form of Michael and Gabriel's sister Uriel (Katrine de Candole). We're slowly getting a sense of how this prolonged war has effected the rest of the angelic family. Uriel is a great addition to the mix because she's such a wild card. De Candole sold Uriel as a doting sister who misses her father and merely wants to help Michael set things right. Then she turned around and played a convincing backstabber who really wants to aid Gabriel in destroying the humans. Uriel's true motivations remain a mystery, but I'm definitely looking forward to seeing her play the two brothers against one another.The elder Whele also had some stand-out moments in the climax of this episode. Here we saw to what lengths Whele will stoop to maintain order and prevent word of the Chosen One's existence from spreading out across the city. First, he shot Senator Frost before Frost could spread the news among the people. Then, he killed Bixby for leaking the secret in the first place. I suppose we're supposed to be appalled at the sight of Whele murdering a child. But as Bixby has been both intensely annoying and a walking plot device in these first four episodes, I can't say I'm sad to see the character go. And I'm eager to see how Alex and Claire respond to her death. If anything, Bixby's murder should have been the tragedy that inspired Alex to embrace his destiny.","Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/06/17/dominion0614141280jpg-b689be_160w.jpg?width=1280,"['flood', 'dominion', 'im', 'review', 'alexs', 'didnt', 'episode', 'character', 'whele', 'frost', 'focus', 'characters', 'alex']",

Removal surgery was undertaken by team of nine doctors, took 16 hours and required 5,000ml of blood

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT



Doctors have removed what is believed to be the world’s largest tumour from a man’s leg – after it grew to more than 17 stone.



Yang Jianbin, 37, from Shanxi Province, China was born with a dark birthmark on the right side of his lower back – and noticed it getting larger when he was nine.



By the time he was 12, it had increased to the size of a fist and he had surgery to remove it.

Yang Jianbin is pictured in hospital in Beijing, China before having the 'world's largest' tumour removed

Yang Jianbin goes under the knife at the hospital in Beijing. He first noticed his birthmark getting bigger at primary school when he was nine

But despite medical intervention, it started to grow again and a recent hospital check in Beijing revealed that the tumour had increased to an enormous 110kg – more than 17 stone.



Chief surgeon Chen Minliang said Yang suffered from Neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the normal growth and development of cell tissue.



‘We have seen neurofibromatosis patients before, but this is the biggest nerve tumour we ever saw,’ he said.



The 37-year-old had surgery to remove the tumour when he was 12, but it started to grow rapidly again in recent years

Before it was removed, the tumour was so big, Yang Jianbin, pictured in hospital, was only able to lie down or sit in bed all day

Chief surgeon Chen Minliang said the patient suffered from Neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the normal growth and development of cell tissue

Yang had said previously that the huge tumour was so big he could only lie down or sit on bed all day.



He was given two hospital beds to accommodate the 1.2m tumour, which made up two-thirds of his total body weight.



Removal surgery involved nine doctors and lasted 16 hours. During the procedure, the patient received 5,000ml of blood, which is more than the entire amount an adult's body holds.



But he is said to be recovering well and is expected to be discharged from hospital in Beijing later this month.

LIFE-SAVING SURGERY TO REMOVE TUMOURS THE SIZE OF WATERMELONS

A toddler in CHina with a tumour the size of a melon is set to receive life-changing surgery Last month, the world's biggest uterine tumour, weighing 30lbs and measuring 21 inches in diameter, was removed from an Indian woman. Doctors in the southern city of Chennai performed a complex operation on a 52-year-old woman identified as Latha. She had been suffering breathlessness and fatigue for several years but had no idea the giant tumour - similar to the size of a watermelon - was growing inside her. Latha has recovered and has since been discharged from hospital. Just days ago it was revealed that a toddler with a tumour the size of a melon growing from his bottom was set to receive life-changing surgery.

The tumour weighed in at almost as much as the young unnamed boy himself and medics in China were set to perform an operation to remove it, thanks to a flood of donations to help the youngster. According to the boy's grandmother, there was no indication during the pregnancy that there was a anything unusual about the baby. But when he was born, it became clear that he had a tumour the size of a grapefruit on his bottom. The family sought help at many hospitals, most of which were unable to help, and all the while the tumour continued to grow, reaching the size of a melon. The family’s plight was picked up by local media and a hospital stepped forward, agreeing to treat the boy, while donations flooded in from the public to pay for the treatment. Experts at Quanzhou Children’s Hospital, who have accepted the child for an operation, say that the tumour can almost certainly be safely removed so that the boy can make a full recovery.

44,44,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Tech Center neighbors renovate to prepare for new business from development - Daily Press,https://www.dailypress.com/business/dp-xpm-20140709-2014-07-09-dp-nws-oysterpoint-0703-20140702-story.html,"John Franklin, owner of Newport News-based Franklin Management Co., which owns and operates the Warwick Mobile Home Park along the 12000 block of Jefferson Avenue, knew the densely wooded 100-acre parcel at the apex of Jefferson Avenue and Oyster Point Road wasn't going to stay an urban forest for long.

""You knew something was going to go in there,"" Franklin said of the property that sits roughly perpendicular from his mobile home park, and nets some of the highest traffic counts in Newport News.

He was right.

Newport News-based contractor W.M. Jordan Co. and Georgia-based retail developer S.J. Collins Enterprises announced nearly a year ago plans for Tech Center at Oyster Point, a $250 million mixed-use development currently under construction.

Plans call for the once wooded site to be transformed into a mix of commercial and residential spaces, including 230,000 square feet of retail in the Marketplace at Tech Center component, 290 luxury apartments and 30,000 square feet of specialty office space.

The development has already landed a number of first-to-the-market retailers and restaurants, including Whole Foods, DSW Shoe Warehouse, P.F. Chang's China Bistro and BJ's Brewhouse.

It's the largest development currently under construction on the Peninsula, prompting nearby businesses to prepare for a flood of new retail tenants, residents and increased visibility because of their proximity to the massive project.

""It's exciting to see new retail expansion in the area,"" said Brett Johnson , director of sales and marketing for Virginia Beach-based Grand Furniture. ""It's something we haven't seen in a while because of the recession, and it's a refreshing change to see.""

The 67-year-old Hampton Roads furniture company is currently renovating its 40,000-square-foot store at 12097 Jefferson Ave., which sits right across the roadway from the Tech Center development.

Plans call for its Newport News showroom to increase by 20 percent to allow for a high quantity of furniture brands to be showcased in the store, Johnson said. He added the exterior will also change significantly when Virginia Beach-based Independence Construction Co. of Virginia adds a two-story glass entryway to the store.

""We're bringing the same store prototype that we have at our Virginia Beach store to Newport News,"" Johnson said.

The store remains open despite the renovation, with officials targeting a Labor Day completion for its interior work and a mid-September completion date for its exterior work.

Johnson said other renovations are pending at their other locations, including its Hampton store on Mercury Boulevard.

But Grand Furniture officials focused on Newport News because of the current fervent pace of commercial activity occurring in the greater Oyster Point area.

""Jefferson Avenue is the street you want to be on as far as furniture and retail in Newport News,"" Johnson said. ""With the completion of Tech Center, the Peninsula will be served with a phenomenal retail experience, and we're glad to be a part of it.""

It's the same synergy that's prompted Philadelphia-based owners of the Jefferson Point apartments, located near the corner of South Jefferson Avenue and Oyster Point Road, to pump up to $3 million into its property for extensive renovations.

And it comes with a name change, too.

Effective Tuesday, Jefferson Point is now Tech Center Square.

Jenna Strobl, marketing manager for Resource Residential which owns and manages Tech Center Square, said all the units will eventually be upgraded to include new flooring, upgraded General Electric appliances, and new faucet and lighting fixtures. She added new community amenities would include a new dog park, a saltwater pool with new outdoor deck furniture and a fire pit, an expanded 24-hour fitness center, and a business center with computer stations.

Company officials hope to complete the renovations to the nearly 30-year-old complex by mid-July, Strobl said.

""Rebranding gives us the opportunity to reposition the property to new and existing residents,"" Strobl said. ""We believe that Newport News is a viable rental market due to its convenient location to many businesses in high growth industries, dining, entertainment and shopping establishments, and a strong employment growth outlook.""

Franklin agrees, calling the new development a possible boon for his mobile home park and the nearby land he owns that fronts Jefferson Avenue.

It may already be occurring.

Wawa has placed Franklin's 5-acre property at 12095 Jefferson Ave. under contract for a new gas station and convenience store. He said a neighboring vacant parcel next door to the proposed Wawa has also gained the interest of banks, a car wash and a small grocery store.

""It's definitely an advantage for me,"" Franklin said of the pending development in the area. ""It's going to help me with sales at the [mobile] park and be positive for more growth in the area.""

ICR Research By

Published 09 July 2014

Global seaborne cement and clinker trade is controlled by the owners of the exporting and distributing cement plants, and (even more so) by the owners of the receiving bulk cement terminals and grinding facilities. Following the recent publication of The ICR Handbook on Global Cement Trade and Distribution, the authors provide key statistics and an insight into ownership and market control with a more detailed focus on the upcoming LafargeHolcim merger. By Ad Ligthart and Marcia Ligthart, Cement Distribution Consultants, The Netherlands.

Seaborne trade and distribution is an important part of the cement industry. It is not just the volume and price of the materials moved, but also a strategic tool in running a profitable cement company. The key issue is that cement shortages in one area are levelled out with excess capacity in another. This means that the companies that have this capability can bring the utilisation of their plants to a higher level. The cost savings of this higher plant utilisation are often larger than the margins made on the actual trade and distribution.

However, cement trade and distribution is not a simple open market. A waterside cement plant with ship loading capabilities appears to be in an excellent position to export or distribute its surplus capacity, but without a trading network and firm receiving destinations it cannot ship anything. Seaborne transportation can consist of clinker in bulk, cement in bulk and cement in bags or big bags. Clinker and cement in bulk makes up the vast majority of seaborne trade (83 per cent) and domestic distribution (86 per cent). The owners of the receiving facilities (ie the grinding plants and bulk terminals) control the cement and clinker trade and distribution.

Who are the facility owners?

In respect to global cement plants there are several directories available, such as The Global Cement Report 10th Edition. For coastal plants, grinding facilities and especially bulk terminals no such reference work was previously available. This has now changed. ICR recently published The ICR Handbook on Global Cement Trade and Distribution, authored by Cement Distribution Consultants (CDC). This extensive report covers over 1250 waterside plants, grinding facilities and bulk terminals, shown in more than 90 maps as well as a complete directory of facilities. The maps and tables show global, regional and domestic trade flows and volumes while the report also features sections on ship loading and discharge facilities, trading networks and the economics behind trade and distribution. Based on this handbook, this article gives a global overview of the parties controlling trade and distribution.

Global trade and distribution flows

As can be seen in Figure 1, seaborne global cement and clinker trade in 2013 was around 100Mt, up from 98Mt in 2012. This figure is still substantially below 2007 pre-crisis figures when global seaborne trade was about 130Mt. The lost volume almost entirely consisted of bulk cement (traded to the USA and within Europe). This has been partly compensated for by increased clinker and bagged cement imports in Africa and increased regional trade and domestic distribution in Asia. Seaborne domestic distribution in 2013 was 110Mt, up from 106Mt in 2012, and future forecasts for seaborne trade and distribution are good. The US is expected to raise seaborne imports in 2014 and then will move towards pre-crisis import levels. The trade of cementitious materials (G)GBS and fly ash is also growing rapidly.

Table 1: clinker and cement trade by water, 2013 Seaborne trade/distribution Inland waterways International Domestic Domestic Clinker (Mt) 38.6 8.6 4.5 Cement bulk (Mt) 43.9 71.3 10.2 Cement bags (Mt) 17.5 11.9 3.5 Total (Mt) 100.0 91.8 18.2

Table 2 makes a subdivision of the commodities relating to ship size and type used. It shows coastal bulk carriers (≤10,000dwt), large bulk carriers (> 10,000dwt), self-discharging cement carriers and vessels used for domestic distribution on inland waterways. The fleet of cement carriers is clearly overstretched. Including small coastal vessels between 500 and 2000dwt, their total number is about 325. With an average ship size of 7500dwt and an average annual tonnage transported of close to 300,000t/vessel, round-trip times are about a week. Japan and Indonesia are responsible for the near-full utilisation of the global fleet. As a result, there has been a move of these vessels from the Atlantic and especially the Mediterranean to Asia, which has also meant a switch from international trade to domestic distribution. The lower availability of self-discharging vessels in international trade has resulted in growing shipments in bagged cement and clinker in bulk carriers. Currently there are a number of new-builds and conversions taking place to increase the fleet of cement carriers.

Table 2: clinker and cement trade by vessel type, 2013 Cement/clinker Bulk carriers Self-discharging cement carriers Inland ships and barges Large Coastal Clinker (Mt) 36.8 10.4 0 4.5 Cement bulk (Mt) 8.1 0.5 96.6 10.2 Cement bags (Mt) 20.1 9.3 0 3.5 Total (Mt) 65.0 30.2 96.6 18.2

Self-discharging ships are mostly used for domestic distribution and short-distance regional trade. Regional trade often is also part of a distribution network where the cement plant has the same owner as the terminals. This is reflected in the ownership of cement carriers. Approximately, 31 per cent of the global fleet is directly owned by cement producers and 37 per cent by a shipping company related to the cement producer.

A closer look at cement and clinker export plants

When preparing The ICR Handbook on Global Cement Trade and Distribution, CDC located 1269 cement plants, grinding stations and terminals involved in seaborne and inland water trade and distribution. This figure included 217 integrated works. An analysis of these cement facilities shows the methods by which these plants arrange for their ship loading:

• 91 works have their own port or dock.

• Eight units are located away from the port but have a direct conveying belt supplying a loading facility (including storage) in the port.

• 15 facilities rail cement and/or clinker to a loading facility in the port.

• Four plants rail cement to the port and load ships directly from railcars.

• 22 works truck cement to a loading facility in the port.

• 51 plants truck cement or clinker to the port for direct ship loading.

• Nine cement facilities use inland barges to bring cement/clinker to a port for direct transshipment to seagoing ships (as well as using barges for domestic distribution)

• 17 cement plants use barges solely for domestic distribution on the inland waterways.

Of these 217 plants, 134 can load up to handysize and handymax bulkers. A total of 61 can load up to coastal size vessels (≤10.000dwt), five plants load Great Lakes vessels and 17 works load barges for domestic distribution.

It should be noted that this is a snapshot. The number of cement plants, terminals and grinding plants involved in sea and waterborne trade and distribution changes gradually. Some plants have been active in exports and distribution for many decades. Other works only export when they are in a domestic oversupply situation. Technically, loading ships with cement and clinker is not difficult. A cement plant located not too far from a general port can send its bulk trucks with cement to the port and blow the cement directly into the holds of a ship (using a proper dedusting system). However, successful exporting is mostly dependent on a good trading network and customers with a receiving terminal that want to buy cement.

Bulk cement terminals and coastal grinding plants

There are 857 cement terminals receiving their cement by sea or inland water. Of this number, 169 are equipped with a shipunloader and can receive general bulk carriers. These terminals are generally used for international trade. A total of 688 terminals are served by self-discharging ships. Most of the terminals served by self-discharging ships are for domestic distribution or regional trade. Japan has the most dense seaborne distribution network with over 200 terminals and about 77 self-discharging vessels to supply these. Indonesia has a rapidly-growing series of networks with 36 terminals and 50 cement carriers.

Of the 857 terminals, 140 are suitable to receive handysize or handymax size vessels. Of these 79 have a shipunloader and almost all of them are used for international trade. A total of 61 are served by larger cement carriers and mostly used for distribution and regional trade purposes.

As many as 717 terminals can receive coastal-size vessels, 615 of which are serviced by cement carriers and 102 have a shipunloading system. While the terminals that are served by self-discharging ship are generally part of distribution networks, their counterparts with shipunloaders are almost all used in international trade.

A total of 195 grinding plants receive their clinker (and/or (G)GBFS) by sea or inland waterways. Of these 163 receive their raw materials by vessels in the handysize and handymax bulk carrier range, 19 receive coastal vessels, eight receive Great Lakes vessels and five receive inland barges.

China

Although China is a large exporter of cement and clinker, it is not an influential country in global cement trade as it does not own any overseas cement terminals or coastal grinding plants. It exports because there is a shortage in other markets and its cement is being purchased, but when that ceases to be the case, Chinese exports are expected to drop. Financial analysts fret that an economic downturn in China will flood the world with cheap cement and spoil mature markets. There is no such risk, however. Chinese cement producers simply do not have the required large bulk import terminals in these mature markets.

So who controls seaborne trade and distribution?

As discussed earlier, the owners of the facilities involved in seaborne cement and clinker trade and distribution (and especially the ones that own the receiving grinding plants and bulk cement import terminals) are the ones in control. So who owns these facilities? As can be seen from Table 3, the top five multinationals own about 40 per cent of the facilities involved in seaborne trade and distribution.

Table 3: overview of facilities of the top five multinationals involved in waterborne trade and distribution, 2013 Company Cement plants Grinding plants Terminals Total Lafarge 23 16 89 128 HeidelbergCement 11 19 88 118 Holcim 20 20 77 117 Cemex 19 3 71 93 Italcementi 10 7 21 38 83 (38%) 65 (33%) 34 (40%) 494 (39%)

Holcim and Lafarge

Given their planned merger, it is of course timely to look at Lafarge and Holcim. Both companies combined have 43 cement plants, 36 grinding plants and 166 terminals involved in seaborne/waterborne trade and distribution. This total of 245 facilities represent 19 per cent of the global total. This is more-or-less in balance with the volumes that are being traded and distributed. Both companies have trade volumes of about 11Mt of seaborne cement and clinker, representing 22 per cent of global trade. Holcim distributes about 9Mt domestically by sea and inland waterways, and Lafarge about 10Mt, making up around 17 per cent of the global total.

It is remarkable that when considering the merger and possible disposals required by antitrust authorities, financial analysts only look at production capacity and completely forget about the trading networks. To bring trading networks into the picture, Figures 2 and 3 show the trading networks of Lafarge and Holcim, respectively.

An important area to start with is the east side of the US and Canada. The combined Lafarge and Holcim networks account for 63 per cent of the seaside facilities on the northeast US and east Canada coastline. These include a number of large import terminals (many idle at present). On the Great Lakes the merged entity would own 55 per cent of waterside facilities (most of US imports from Canada go through the Great Lakes) while 40 per cent of facilities on the inland waterways system would be owned by LafargeHolcim. At this moment almost all these facilities are used for domestic distribution and as such might escape large divestments. However, look at the import capability. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the US has reduced seaborne imports with more than 20Mt, of which 4.5Mt were imported via New Orleans (transshipped from bulk carrier to inland barges and then to the inland waterways, effectively turning barge terminals into import facilities). The general forecast is that within five years the US will be back to pre-crisis import levels. Within 10-15 years overall seaborne imports might be in the 40Mt range. When one adds the potential combined import capability of Lafarge and Holcim to their production capacity, the new company will be quite dominant on the whole North American east side (see The ICR Handbook on Global Cement Trade and Distribution).

Moving to the UK, financial analysts expect that no divestments in cement capacity are required as Holcim has no cement production capacity in the country. However, when the combined production capacity plus import capability is considered, the picture changes significantly. Apart from its cement plants, Lafarge has five terminals in the UK, which can be supplied from the Lafarge Aberthaw plant, but just as easily act as import terminals supplied by Lafarge's Le Havre works in France. Holcim has four import terminals in the UK and is a significant cement supplier there. This means that the merged company has a far larger influence on the UK cement industry than just the Lafarge UK production capacity would suggest

In the Indian Ocean, south of India, the combination would have a near-total monopoly on all the islands. In southeast Asia the merged entity would also have a much stronger presence than reflected by the addition of production facilities only. The combined seaborne trading and distribution capabilities in Malaysia, Indonesia (Sumatra), Vietnam and the Philippines illustrate this.

Like most companies with seaborne trading networks, both Lafarge and Holcim have a far larger import capability than export capability. This has two advantages. The first advantage is that if a country where a company owns both cement production and import facilities has a downturn in cement consumption, it can reduce imports (ie buying less from others) but keep its own cement plants running at a decent utilisation rate. When cement consumption picks up again, it increases the imports (ie buying more from others but making most of the profits in its own market), which means that it not only buys cement but also influence (second advantage). The cement exporter that supplies the company, out of politeness of course, will not export to the company's competition in other markets.

Returning to the global ownership overview, now consider the companies that have over 20 facilities. Table 4 shows that 13 companies own 64 per cent of the global total. However, there are large differences between these firms.

Table 4: cement companies with 20 or more facilities, 2013 Cement Terminals Grinding Total Lafarge 23 16 89 128 HeidelbergCement 11 19 88 118 Holcim 20 20 77 117 Cemex 19 71 3 93 Taiheiyo 12 78 2 92 UBE/Mitsubishi 5 58 0 63 Sumitomo/Osaka/Nippon Steel 4 47 0 51 Italcementi 10 21 7 38 Tokuyama 1 27 1 29 Buzzi Unicem 5 16 2 23 CRH 4 17 2 23 Semen Indonesia 3 19 0 22 Votorantim 4 10 6 20 13 owners controlling 121 (56%) 618 (72%) 78 (40%) 817 (64%)

The top five multinationals have a global presence and are both involved in trade and domestic distribution. Of the other eight companies, UBE/Mitsubishi, Sumito/Osaka/Nippon Steel, Tokuyama and Semen Indonesia have networks that are largely or entirely based on domestic distribution. The remaining four companies have both international trading and domestic distribution networks but are regionally oriented.

In addition, there are the companies with less than 20 facilities. These share 36 per cent of the global total. Here a division can be made between companies that have multiple facilities (ie, a network) and companies that have only one facility. Table 5 shows that there are 59 owners which have multiple facilities, sharing a total of 298 facilities and 141 owners with only one facility.

Table 5: owners with single or multiple facilities, 2013 No facilities 19 16 13 11 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 No cement plant owners 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 3 6 5 9 22 141

Conclusion

At first glance, Table 6 indicates that the market looks highly controlled with just 13 companies overseeing 64 per cent of all facilities involved in global trade and distribution. The very dominant position of the combined Lafarge and Holcim networks with close to 20 per cent of all global facilities would also point in that direction.

Table 6: summary of global cement trade & distribution facility ownership, 2013 No owners Facilities No Share (%) 13 817 64 59 298 22 141 1 11 213 1256

However, the enormous fragmented bottom segment of 34 per cent of global facilities with 200 companies gives a more or less sufficient counter balance. Especially the 141 owners with only one facility (22 cement plants, 53 terminals, 64 grinding plants) show that independent ready-mix and concrete producers are still able to secure their own cement supply if needed (although this varies by region). Compared to the late 1990s when the top 10 multinationals controlled 80 per cent of global seaborne cement and clinker trade this is remarkable.

For a full and detailed picture of this important segment of the cement industry, The ICR Handbook on Global Cement Trade and Distribution is the most comprehensive publication available.","Wed, 09 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.cemnet.com/favicon.ico,"['global', 'clinker', 'plants', 'facilities', 'trade', 'terminals', 'seaborne', 'bulk', 'cement', 'distribution', 'controls']",

The Yellow River’s Sanmenxia Dam officially opened its gates on July 4 around 10:00 p.m. to release its sediment load, giving way to a fluid rush of glistening water captured beautifully in photographs.





Sediment-speckled water gushing from the reservoir rushed down the river to move silt downstream. Reports described the scene as looking like a fast moving ‘dragon fly’ made of water.







The dam soon became a tourist attraction as people swarmed around the river to watch the water do water what water does.

The storm has been called a ""once in decades"" event, with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour.

The Japan Meteorological Agency said the system, which is already producing winds up to 150 mph, may develop into an ""extremely intense"" storm by Tuesday as it moves north.

""I can't stress enough how dangerous this typhoon may be when it hits Okinawa,"" wrote Brigadier General James Hecker on the base's Facebook page on Sunday. ""This is not just another typhoon.""

A typhoon is a Pacific Ocean cyclone and the same meteorological event as a hurricane, just leaving the tropics toward the Pacific instead of the Atlantic and making landfall in a different part of the world. These storms are more frequent and more intense than Atlantic hurricanes.

Like hurricanes, typhoons form from warm surface water in the ocean, high atmospheric instability, high humidity, the creation of a low pressure center from the Coriolis effect, and a low vertical wind shear.

wikipedia

They have the same seasonality as hurricanes — mainly forming between June and November. They pose the same dangers as hurricanes:

1. High winds — typhoons have sustained winds greater than 70 miles per hour. Super typhoons aren't officially on Japan's scale, but colloquially are known to have 120 mile-per-hour sustained winds — similar to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane.

2. Lots of rain — record-breaking Typhoon Morakot landed in Taiwan in 2009 and dumped more than 90 inches of rain in the Southern regions.

3. They can cause storm surges that ravage beaches and coastal areas with an inundation of water, similar to what happened to New Jersey and New York when Hurricane Sandy struck last year.

Here's a map of tracks from all the tropical depressions, storms, and typhoons in the pacific from 1980 to 2005:

Most typhoons hit the Philippines, but typhoons are at their deadliest when they strike China because of the country's high population density. These tropical storms and typhoons hit the Philippines so frequently that they are responsible for 30% of the country's northern rainfall.The most intense storm on record occurred in 1979 and was named Typhoon Tip , a category 5 super typhoon, which had sustained winds of 190 miles per hour.

The deadliest was in 1975 when Typhoon Nina caused a flood and 12 reservoirs failed, killing 100,000 in China alone.

[10:13] Xi said:

History is history; facts are facts. If any people attempt to deny history, the Chinese people and the people in the world will not allow it.

[10:10] Xi said:

Regrettably, after nearly 70 years of the Chinese People’s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the world’s anti-fascist war, there are still some people who neglect the historical fact and millions of innocent lives lost in the wars, go against the tide of history and repeatedly deny or even whitewash the aggression history, damage international mutual trust and create regional tension, which trigger strong condemnation from peace-loving people of all countries including the Chinese people.

[10:09] Xi continued:

In order to remember those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the Japanese aggression, we will forever cherish that and rembmer them.

[10:06] Xi said:

In the most dangerous moment, China’s Communist Party upheld national interestes. Patriots used their blood and life to fight against the invasion.”

[10:03] Xi first looks back the history of Japanese invasion in his speech.

[10:02] Xi Jinping now address the commemoration.

[10:00] The commemoration begins. General secretary Xi Jinping and representatives unveil the commemoration.

[09:53] China will release the videos of Japanese surrender to China for the first time, according to a curator of a war memorial in Hunan.

[09:50]

[09:47] On July 6, 2014, Nosuke Sasaki’s confession was released.

[09:46] On July 5, 2014, Kamisaka Katsu’s confession was released.

[09:41] On July 4, 2014, Fujita Shigeru’s confession was released.

[09:37] China announced in February that it had designated December 13 as the national memorial day for the Nanjing Massacre victims, with the aim of preserving the memory of the Chinese murdered by the Japanese invaders, and educating people about the wartime crimes committed by Imperial Japan.

[09:24] On July 3, 2014, Suzuki Keiku’s confession was released.

[09:22] China’s State Archives Administration announced on Thursday that it will put full texts of confessions by 45 Japanese war criminals online from Thursday: one a day, over 45 days.

[09:19] The National Memorial website (http://www.cngongji.cn/) was unveiled by Xinhuanet and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, and it includes editions in three languages: Chinese, Japanese and English.

[09:15] China launched a national memorial website on Sunday with the aim of allowing the public to commemorate victims of the Nanjing Massacre committed by Japanese troops during World War II.

[09:13] The move follows Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and right-wing politicians’ stubborn denial of war crimes in China.

[09:11] China’s State Archives Administration announced on July 3 that it will put full texts of confessions by 45 Japanese war criminals online from Thursday: one a day, over 45 days.

[09:07] The War of Resistance Against Japan was a turning point in modern Chinese history. It ended the divided situation in which China found itself since the Opium War of 1840. It aroused the Chinese people, filled them with a common hatred against the enemy, and enhanced their traditional national spirit as never before.

[09:05] China’s War of Resistance Against Japan was a righteous struggle against a war of aggression provoked by Japanese militarists against the will of the Japanese people. As for the Chinese, it was an anti-aggression war to defend state sovereignty and vindicate national honor.

[09:04] People will never forget August 15, 1945, the date on which the Japanese government issued a note to the Allied countries, announcing its unconditional surrender. Japanese militarism, the No.2 war criminal in World War II, collapsed. The Chinese people won the final victory in the anti-Japanese national liberation war through their bitter struggles.

[09:02] China was the first country to fight the Fascist aggressor, experiencing the longest period of struggle, and suffering great sacrifices and heavy losses. An important part of the international anti Fascist war, the Chinese people’s War of Resistance Against Japan was closely bound up with it.

[09:01] The anti-Fascist war between the 1930s and 1940s was the first just war of a global scale in human history. It ended in the Axis’ unconditional surrender in 1945, 60 years ago. Over 2 billion people in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania (exceeding four-fifths of the world population at that time) were involved in the war. People who had experienced that unheard-of calamity will never forget those days when flames of battle raged everywhere.

[09:00] The July 7 Incident, or the Lugouqiao Incident, in 1937 marked the beginning of China’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, which lasted eight years.

[08:44] The Japanese aggression caused 35 million deaths and casualties of Chinese people and US$600 billion of economic losses in China.

[08:43] On July 8, the Communist Party of China published an open telegram to the whole nation, calling upon the people of the whole country to rise in resistance against the Japanese aggression. On the initiative of the CPC, the Anti-Japanese National United Front formally established on the basis of the KMT-CPC cooperation.

[08:42] The local Chinese troops fight heroically back and thus started Japan’s all-out aggression against China and China’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.

[08:39] On the night of July 7, 1937, Japanese troops stationed near Lugou Bridge (also called Marco Polo Bridge) in the southwest of Beijing demanded to enter the nearby Wanping county seat on the pretext of searching for a missing solider. The Chinese troops rejected the demand and the Japanese troops then bombarded the county seat and Lugou Bridge.","Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://live.china.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/favicon.ico,"['chinese', 'live', 'japanese', 'china', 'history', 'resistance', 'chinas', 'major', 'aggression', 'national', 'chinaorgcn', 'war', 'marking', 'events', 'ceremony', 'xi', 'updates']",

Dried fungi bought from a Chinese supermarket found to contain THREE unnamed species

Experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south west London, sequenced the DNA of the mushrooms in the bag

They discovered three types of porcini new to science



Relatively little is known about the various types of cooking ingredient

The product was purchased in a small Chinese supermarket in London

Few people pop to the supermarket and discover a new species.



But DNA testing has revealed that three unnamed species of mushroom that are new to science have been found in a bag of dried porcini that came off a shop shelf in London.



While porcini mushrooms are served in many restaurants, relatively little is known about them scientifically.



Discovery in the bag: DNA testing has revealed that three unnamed species of mushroom have been found in a bag dried porcini (pictured) that came off a shop shelf in London

WHAT ARE PORCINI MUSHROOMS? The porcini mushroom is a type of fungus in the genus Bolestus.

They can be found in Europe, Asia and North America and have only been introduced to the southern hemisphere relatively recently.

The mushrooms grow in deciduous and coniferous forests, typically enveloping a tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue.

Porcini are popular in cooking - despite species unknown to science being traded internationally.

The mushrooms are low in fat and carbohydrates and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and fibre.

Because they are quite difficult to cultivate all your round, they are often dried and packaged.

To explore the nature of the popular cooking ingredient, mycologists Bryn Dentinger and Laura Martinez-Suz of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south west London, sequenced the DNA of a bag of dried Chinese porcini.



There were 15 pieces of mushroom in the bag and all them belonged to three unnamed species, indicating that experts know relatively little about the vast group of fungi.



Boletus is one of the most traded wild and edible mushroom in the world and many types are exported from China.



They can come from remote regions without any reliable identification, raising the spectre that some less palatable or even dangerous types could possibly slip through the net undetected.



Scientists have previously proved that unknown species of the edible mushroom are sold, but the experts from Kew said they were surprised that they found some so easily.



‘The finding demonstrates the ubiquity of unknown fungal diversity, even in traded products and the recognition of these species will enable better regulations to improve food safety and enable countries to adhere to international agreements on the exploitation of wild species,’ experts at Kew said.



Mysterious mushrooms: There were 15 pieces of mushroom in the bag and all them belonged to three unnamed species, indicating that experts know little about the vast group of fungi, even if they are widely used in cooking. A pasta dish is pictured

While mushrooms are most commonly used in cooking, some scientists think that they have the potential to save the world.



IS FUNGUS THE FUTURE? Ascocoryne sarcoides can be used to make biofuel. Its volatile compounds are similar to those found in diesel and can turn dead leaf matter into fuel.

Laricifomes officinalis could be used to make a 'universal insecticide'.

Mycelium from various mushrooms is a flexible polymer similar to plastic and can be used to make biodegradable materials.

Most of a mushroom’s power lies beneath the soil in a bundle of filaments called that mycelium that secrete enzymes capable of breaking down soil and rocks. They also produce potent chemicals to defend their territory, and release nutrients into the soil.



And it is this mycelium that is of predominant interest to mycologists, who believe mushrooms could be used to produce superior drugs and green materials of the future, New Scientist reported.



One microbiologist has developed a biofuel after discovering that a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides contains volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels.



And Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, has created a flexible polymer-like plastic from fungus that is biodegradable and can be persuaded to grow in different densities to produce a variety of materials and properties. It is already used to make packaging and could be harnessed to make more permanent products in the future.

A nickel-plated Glock 9-mm automatic pistol. The drawer was the typical shallow top-drawer below the desk surface, where ordinarily a working writer keeps pencils and pens and paper clips; but in Don’s case the gun was the only thing in there.

This was the only time I was ever in his apartment. I forget the reason. It might have been that he needed a ride to the doctor; it might have even been to pick up the early manuscript of this book, Fridays at Enrico’s,” printed in dot-matrix, on 8½ by 11 stationery. That 8½ by 11 stationery will perhaps soon go the way of dot-matrix printers, as those white rectangles—and their crisp rattle in the hand, their tendency to spill, or flip away in a breeze—will be replaced by pixels on screens, in editorial offices everywhere. Anyway, that was the medium, then, for transmitting prose: a stack of loose pages. Maybe nobody will miss paper when it’s gone. In any case, the bright flood of pixels is something Don hasn’t been here for.

This was the one-room studio in Mill Valley, California near The Depot. He used to say that men should be ashamed before women, because they don’t make their own beds, and they don’t do the dishes; and they ought to; and they know they ought to. And looking around his room, I noticed that the narrow bed was made up in taut military style; and by the sink, his teaspoon was drying in a rubber dish rack.

Don was hardly a saint or monk, exactly, but he did have a code. It was a writer’s code, and it was really a kind of knight-errantry, knight-errantry being a peculiar element in male psychology, but also an element in every real writer’s conduct. The purpose of the gun was always to take himself out, never to hurt anybody else. He said you want an automatic pistol in order to be able to get off another shot fast, in case your first shot is inefficient. I found it remarkable that for years he’d done his work with that tool lying directly under his writing surface, one inch away.

Don’s particular shtick was, he told the truth. That was his angle: writers are people who tell the truth, at their own peril. He had X-ray vision, which amounted to an analytic harsh beam upon the true venality of human motives. I remember being worried by his view of human nature, in A Blade of Light and Hard Rain Falling. Later his work became more forgiving—in From a Distant Place and of course in this last milestone. But early on, his fictional people so often took the easy diagonal cut for betrayal.

Don himself was bottomlessly generous and vulnerable and forgiving. When I was having some good luck at the start of a literary career, he was a great guide through the world of publishing I was entering. He’d had his share of good luck. Been on the best-seller list back when it meant something. Made a movie (Payday). His x-ray vision lit my path, somewhat, and I often worked it out so that my daily quitting-time would coincide with his—late morning—as did a few other people at that small circular marble-top table in The Depot, the one immediately next to the high-traffic zone, center-of-the-room, where he sat up straight keeping an eye on the plaza outside, and where he played the role of village Diogenes.

While he had sharp opinions, he was also mighty self-effacing and even humble—he’d been humbled, in a few different ways, as I think he’d also once, as a young man, been arrogant (at least that’s how he advertised himself)—and he was able to see himself in an absurd light, too.

One time, he’d had some luck and been hired by a Japanese production company to do a first-draft feature-length screenplay about The Life of the Buddha. A “bio-pic.” He was delighted with the semi-absurd project. And the money was good. He had to go meet the producers, and with his new money he bought himself an expensive leather jacket, in the old bomber-squadron style. This he wore to meet the Japanese movie executives, not noticing until it was too late that the jacket’s shoulder patch said “Enola Gay.” Which was the plane that carried the bomb over Hiroshima in 1945. The movie never got made, as movies often don’t. But Don was happy with the money and the funny story.

It’s a commonplace that feelings of guilt are part of mourning any death, and that feelings of guilt strike everybody who ever cared about the one who died. Well, I’ve had some of that. Part of my re-reading of Fridays at Enrico’s was personally a diagnostic one: here was the portrait of a writing life, of writing friendships. On the day when he pulled open the drawer to show me the gun, I wonder, what I was thinking? Honestly, I think I must have thought he was always the one giving me pointers, and I must have thought he knew what he was talking about. I’m not sure I should have remarked, complacently, that when the time comes, I personally plan on sticking it out until something else kills me, no matter the misery. Because that is only an attitude, not necessarily any real wisdom. And a namby pamby thing to say, anyway, to a man who had clearly thought more deeply and consequentially about this than I. Don was giving me another tip. As he’d always done.

In his own case, he was pretty ill. As for his career, he used to say he “couldn’t get arrested,” though he went on all his life subscribing to the show-biz periodical Variety, watching the trends. Also, his vision was going—I think it was macular degeneration—and a brilliant man who can’t get ready access to words is really sunk.

The view out his window, above the writing desk, was of a gravel parking lot (yes, Mill Valley used to be a town where non-productive real estate lived and thrived at its very heart: plantain and wild fennel and crabgrass). And he looked over the flat roof of Varney’s Hardware. Varney’s is gone. Its place was taken by a Wilkes Bashford, where a shirt could cost you $300; and then after some walls were knocked out the place was enlarged to become a big Banana Republic flagship store. I don’t know what it is today. I do know that the Enrico’s location in North Beach—after a long period of decline when the terrazzo floor was breaking up—has been revived as a place called “Naked Lunch,” as a lure for tourists. The Mill Valley Market has grown and offers a deluxe delicatessen. On Miller Avenue a really heavenly Whole Foods store exists where once Jerry’s Meats was, creating a parking problem Jerry’s Meats never had. Jerry’s Meats housed a pokey little post office, from which sometimes I mailed out manuscripts, in a hopeful state of mind.

As for The Depot, it used to be just a “depot,” for buses. The architecture has been reconfigured. Where now the outdoor café tables are, right there, buses used to pull up and flush their air-brakes. In the pouring rain. It always rained then. The building had a smaller footprint, and inside the only effort at hospitality was a candy rack; and some enterprising person sold wrapped muffins, and coffee from hotplate carafes. But there were racks of paperbacks. It was already the seed of a literary place. Thursday nights were poetry open-reading nights. I once asked if I could lower the tone and be allowed to read a short story. It was the first form of publication I ever had.

All that is gone, now, and the world is arguably a much better place with Banana Republic and Whole Foods, and wi-fi at the Depot, and the good sandwiches at the Mill Valley Market. Don is missing out on that. When we, today here in this room, have all kicked off, the world will presumably go on improving in our absence. That’s a good thing, if strange to think of. What will remain of us is just the work we did. In Don’s case—and for much of it, his editor, Jack Shoemaker, gets credit, too—we’ve got these sharp, dispassionate, sometimes unforgiving, hard-wrought novels A Blade of Light, Hard Rain Falling, The Dispossessed, A Couple of Comedians, From a Distant Place, Class of 49, The True Life Story of Jody McKeegan, Turnaround, and now this book, Fridays at Enrico’s, which is partly a portrait of a writing community. Of friendships going on, through good times and bad. A last novel that is really all about forgiveness.

Wuhan promoted a new competitive kissing game to welcome World Kiss Day, which apparently is a thing and happened yesterday.





According to China News, 10 couples competed in the underwater kissing competition held in Maya Water Park in Wuhan, although they didn’t seem to fight for the championship as much as just show off their kissing skills.



Kissing competition in Jilin



Jilin, a city in northeast China, also celebrated World Kissing Day via a lip-lock competition in which 18 pairs of couples and “close friends” joined. A couple finally won after a 30-minute-long kiss in this contorted position, earning them a reward of 500 RMB.

Apparently it’s not a slur to paint an entire people as tall, blond and briskly self-sufficient. So there is something to be gained by making fun of the land of the midnight sun — Swedish Americans are unlikely to picket NBC about its new show “Welcome to Sweden” or flood the Federal Communications Commission with mass emails. But there are also limits to how piquant the cultural collision can be between a blue-eyed, pancake-fed accountant from the Midwest and a blue-eyed, potato pancake-fed Swedish banker.

“Welcome to Sweden,” which begins Thursday, is pleasant, inoffensive and quite charming. It was commissioned by Swedish television and was shown there in March. For American viewers, the 10-episode series has an unusually Continental flair, with much of the dialogue spoken in Swedish and rendered in subtitles.

Thanks to ever-expanding horizons on cable and the Internet, American viewers have become more open to a crime genre known as Nordic noir. “Welcome to Sweden” is Scandinavian blanc.

When the show is funny, and it can be, the humor is mild and slyly understated. It’s much better than another new show that follows it, “Working the Engels,” which is quite the opposite and not funny at all.","Wed, 09 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/10/arts/welcome/welcome-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=573&w=600&s=5bb5874144f55c373da72c21ffe5b49e92ff9fb68a08524295dde12e7459d99c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['swedish', 'american', 'pancakefed', 'blueeyed', 'nbc', 'welcome', 'quite', 'engels', 'funny', 'working', 'viewers', 'sweden']",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in China yesterday at the invite of Premier Li Keqiang and her very first stop was in Chengdu, where she learned how to cook kungpao chicken from a Sichuan chef.



According to China News, Merkel showed great interest in the recipe behind kungpao chicken, a traditional Chinese dish in the region (and a favorite among laowai). She bought her own ingredients from an agriculture trade market in the city and learned how to cook the dish at the Chengdu Yinxiang Restaurant, where Chef Zhang introduced the “secret” to concocting the perfect sauce.



“The main seasonings are Chinese prickly ash, hot pepper and bean flour. The flavor is sour-sweet,” Chef Zhang explained to Merkel with the help of an interpreter.

Zhang told reporters that “She was very interested in Chinese prickly ash and how the ‘sour-sweet’ flavor was made. When I told her that I put Chinese prickly ash in the dish, she seemed suddenly enlightened. I’m sure she loved this lychee-flavored kungpao chicken, the essence of Chuan dishes.”

Merkel’s proficiency in using the chopsticks impressed Chef Zhang. “It’s very fluent and it looks like she has learned the skill for a long time,” he complimented.

Merkel seemed to win over a lot of Chinese fans online as well.

“(She is) a kind DA MA,” user 贰两包子 said.

Web user fafafge added, “After she goes back to Germany, she can make a German style of Kung Pao Chicken!”

火星养小强 joked, “Merkel Da Ma is also a foodie?!”

“We should learn the drainage skills from Germany,” said 学府文化.

真裁缝 seriously pondered “I wonder if kungpao chicken is really a Sichuan dish. Why do we put sugar in the dish? After putting sugar in it, why does it taste worst than without putting sugar in it?”

跟帖局CEO said, “Congratulations! Germany wins the champion of World Cup 2014.”

This is Merkel’s 7th visit to China since she took office as Chancellor in 2005, although it’s her first time to Chengdu, where she was scheduled to meet participants of 2014 Sino-Germany Dialogue Forum, unveil for the Urbanization Forum, and visit an assistance project for children of migrant workers, according to CRIEnglish.

The Chancellor reportedly left for Beijing last night, where she’s due to meet with President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and top legislator Zhang Dejiang. Probably not quite as much fun as kungpao chicken.

Well this is terrifying. A fire that broke out in an illegal warehouse built under the elevated railway engulfed the noise barrier of the aboveground section of Beijing subway line 13.

The fire reportedly broke out at around 8:00 p.m. yesterday as thick grey smoke was seen quickly flowing skyward from the warehouse beneath the elevated railway linking up Xizhimen Station and Dazhongsi Station. Firemen rushed to the site and extinguished the fire at 8:26 pm.



The cover and noise shields on both sides of the railway were severely burnt and collapsed due to the fire. No casualties were found.



It was reported by People’s Daily that the warehouse was filled with large bottles of water and drinks along with burnt books and magazines.

The subway service of line 13 was suspended, while the Zhichunlu to Dongzhimen section continued. Workers are checking the possibility of resuming the services.



The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

67,67,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Everything You Need to Know About the Air Force's New Bomber - Popular Mechanics,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a10863/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-air-forces-new-bomber-16976993/,"The U.S. Air Force this week made it official: They are officially in the market for a new bomber. In wonk speak, the service sent a formal Request for Proposals to defense contractors who will vie for the (at least) $55 billion program.

Like any massive, classified national security effort, few things about the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) are exactly what they appear to be. So here's a cheat sheet.

1. Our Bomber Fleet is Old—Very Old

The average B-52 Stratofortress is 50 years old, and the B-1 Lancer fleet has a mean age of 28. Now, there are plenty of things you can do with a B-52; you can fly over undefended terrain and drop bombs, or launch missiles from longer, safer ranges. But you can't fly a B-52 anywhere that is guarded by the kind of top-notch, integrated air defense radar and anti-aircraft missiles that Russia sells and that China, Iran, Syria, and others use. Only the B-2 stealth bomber can breach those defenses.

2. These Planes May Not Carry Nukes. Ever.

Here's a question that's not getting much attention: Will the LRS-B be designed to deliver nukes? The Air Force has indicated that the priority for America's new bomber is not an ability to drop nuclear bombs but to deliver other weapons. In 2011, officials announced that the new aircraft will first be readied for nonnuclear missions—precision bombs, missiles, and even electronic/cyber warfare pids, before it would be readied for nukes. In contrast, the Pentagon readied the B-2 for nuclear bombs years before conventional munitions. If funding for nukes is not approved in the future, this could be a quiet way in which the Pentagon changes America's triad nuclear deterrent. (subs, aircraft and missiles)

3. Actually, the Program Has Already Started

Normally, reports of triangular craft zipping through the air come from UFO nuts. But there have been sightings recently that speak to a classified government development program that has been under way for years. Then again, they do look a lot like B-2s and it makes sense that they'd be flying on training missions.

No matter the truth of these sightings, we know that a funding program is already under way. A recent Congressional Research Service report, posted online by the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, says ""significant LRS-B development has already been completed, presumably in classified budgets. Such prior development would also help explain how the Air Force intends to get the system from a Request for Proposals to initial operational capability in about 10 years, when equally or less-complicated systems like the F-22 and F-35 have taken more than 20.""

As Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group, once told PM, incremental funding is not unusual as a way to get a project started despite fiscal constraints and changing technology and geopolitics. In fact, it's a popular Pentagon strategy for advancing expensive programs.

""You start funding a research and development program, but you don't move forward too aggressively,"" he said. ""You fund it a billion or two a year so that you can get a running start as the strategic situation evolves.""

That funding trickle will turn into a flood, according to the CRS report. The budget for LRS rises from $258.7 million in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2019.

68,68,FL-2014-000095-CHN,The nastiest deluge of all - The Australian,http://www.theaustralian.com.au/50th-birthday/the-nastiest-deluge-of-all/story-fnlk0fie-1226982723053,"IT had rained for weeks and much of Queensland was saturated before an unremarkable, short-lived tropical cyclone known as Tasha moved across the state. It did little damage, but brought even more rain.

2011

That was Christmas Eve. As Tasha’s remnants dawdled around southeast Queensland they dumped more water on land that could no longer absorb it. Then that water started to travel.

While Queenslanders had been warned of the menace and were prepared for steadily rising waters, localised torrential downpours caused sudden, killer floods. Toowoomba was taken by surprise on January 10, and Australians were shocked to see on that night’s television news vision of cars cascading down a main street many of them knew well.

Four lives were lost there, including Jordan Rice, 13, and his mum, Donna, 43. Rescuers made their way to the pair and Jordan’s 10-year-old brother trapped on their car in the torrent. “Save my brother,” Jordan shouted to rescuers above the water’s deafening roar. Jordan and his mum were swept away.

As of late last month there were almost 200,000 signatures on a petition for the boy to receive a posthumous Cross of Valour.

Floodwaters raced down the Lockyer Valley, taking the town of Withcott with them in an event Queensland premier Anna Bligh described as “an inland tsunami”.

A source said he was convinced Brisbane’s floods could have been largely avoided had the dam operators acted earlier.

The following day the Brisbane River broke its banks and the first of thousands of the capital’s homes flooded.

About 40km upstream the Wivenhoe Dam, built after the city was devastated by floods in 1974, and designed for just such a scenario, was approaching 191 per cent capacity.

By then, 30 people were believed dead in what The Australian was reporting as the nation’s worst flood disaster. There was worse to come, as that day’s page one headline made clear: “Deadly wave heads for capital”.

On February 6, 1974, days after that year’s record floods, The Australian had warned in an editorial that there were parts of Brisbane that should never have been developed. It urged the local and state governments to replan the city, noting that the losses of 1974 were sure to recur.

The Wivenhoe Dam had been functioning for almost 20 years, but it was kept from the city’s residents that many of them were still endangered. And now, Wivenhoe’s massive releases of water would become the problem.

Killer floods Thirty people were believed dead in what The Australian was reporting as the nation’s worst flood disaster.

The newspaper called for an inquiry on the day it reported that more than 33,000 Brisbane properties had been flooded, and days later Bligh announced a judicial probe.

Hours after that, The Australian’s national chief correspondent, Hedley Thomas, was leaked emails written by a Wivenhoe Dam engineering officer claiming the dam had held on to water for too long. A source said he was convinced Brisbane’s floods could have been largely avoided had the dam operators acted earlier.

The weather wasn’t finished with Queensland; just after midnight on February 3, Cyclone Yasi, the first category 5 cyclone since 1918, made landfall near Mission Beach. In what The Australian described as the “north’s darkest hour”, Yasi devastated the towns of Tully and Cardwell, smashed most boats in the harbour at Point Hinchinbrook, and buried the Dunk Island resort under sand while stripping its palm trees bare.

Malaysian Solution

After prime minister Julia Gillard announced an asylum-seeker swap with Malaysia, The Australian sent reporters Rory Callinan and Peter Alford to Indonesia for a month to examine the people-smuggling trade. The pair discovered at least four well-organised syndicates, led in the main by former Afghan and Pakistani asylum-seekers, brazenly arranging boats and captains, and filling them with “customers” paying between $3000 and $10,000 each — with discounts for children.

It was a cut-throat business, but sometimes the gangs would co-operate to fill vacant spaces on a boat. The organisers appeared to operate with impunity and, if ever jailed, spent little time there.

Legendary among the people-smugglers were those who had made so much money from the trade that they had retired — several of them to Australia.

At home, the so-called Malaysian Solution proved to be anything but, and sank without trace when the High Court — including its three Labor appointees — found the agreement invalid in a six-to-one decision. It found that, against advice, immigration minister Chris Bowen had overstepped the mark in declaring Malaysia a safe country to send asylum-seekers.

The Australian called the decision a body blow to the Gillard government. Foreign editor Greg Sheridan described it as a disaster for our standing in Asia: “The government has produced an astonishing trifecta: an inability to deter boatpeople by processing them in Malaysia; an agreement that still requires Australia to take 4000 extra people from Malaysia; and an official Australian court ­declaration that Malaysia is not a fit place to send boatpeople ­for processing.”

Rose and Beetson

We lost perhaps our two greatest Aboriginal sportsmen this year: Lionel Rose and Arthur Beetson.

Rose was just a 19-year-old boxer, and very much the underdog, when he went to Tokyo and defeated Masahiko “Fighting” Harada for the world bantamweight title in 1968. The Australian’s obituary suggested that it might be the “most significant bout in Australian boxing history”. Rose became the first indigenous person to be named Australian of the Year.

Two years later, having lost his title to the Mexican Ruben Olivares and in need of money, Rose refused a big payday in apartheid South Africa for which the authorities would have declared him nominally white.

Artie Beetson was credited by the newspaper with kick-starting the legend of state of origin with a single punch thrown at that first encounter on July 8, 1980. Beetson “landed a punch on Parramatta teammate Mick Cronin, setting the tone and spirit for what is now the code’s premier showpiece”.

Like Rose, Beetson had come from a poor, country background and risen to the pinnacle of his sport. He played 221 club games between 1964 and 1981 and led Easts to premierships in 1974 and 1975. He was the first indigenous Australian to captain a major sporting team and led Australia to World Cup wins in 1975 and 1977.

Beetson died cycling on the day he was to chaperone hundreds of indigenous children through a theme park.

It may have been Gillard’s finest hour. A week later it was forgotten.

Obama visits

The Australian hailed a recast Australia-US alliance during the November visit of President Barack Obama when, standing alongside Gillard, he announced plans to station 2500 marines in the Northern Territory, confirming “Australia’s strategic importance in an Asia-Pacific century dominated by the growing power of China and India”.

In a speech marking the 60th anniversary of the ANZUS treaty, Obama said: “In some of our darkest moments, when our two countries have been threatened, when we’ve needed a friend to count on, we’ve always been there for each other — at Darwin, at Midway, after 9/11 and after Bali.”

It may have been Gillard’s finest hour. A week later it was forgotten as, in an effort to secure another vote for her precariously balanced minority government, she persuaded renegade Liberal Peter Slipper to take over as Speaker of the House of Representatives. His Labor predecessor Harry Jenkins would join his colleagues on the government benches as an additional vote.

Slipper said he considered himself a “colourful” character. Others, including former staffers — calling themselves the SOS, the Survivors of Slipper — thought him odd and his office dysfunctional.

For his part, Slipper admitted to not being perfect. “I’ve made some mistakes,” he said.

We would soon be reading about them.

In May, the TSA discovered a record 65 firearms on passengers in one week, including 45 loaded guns.

The TSA is now seeing a surge in a new, harder-to-detect weapon: credit card knives.

The weapon looks like a thick credit card but becomes a knife with a steel blade once the blade is folded out. The remaining section of the card snaps together in the shape of a handle.

So far this year, the TSA has discovered 491 credit card knives on passengers, through the use of metal detectors and full-body scanners, said Ross Feinstein, spokesman for the TSA.

That averages to about 20 card knives per week.

TSA officials declined to guess why the knives are showing up at airports.

The knives are sold online for $4 to $15 from various retailers. Iain Sinclair, a British manufacturer of one of the most popular devices, describes them as “lightweight surgical knives” that can cut through seat belts in case of emergency. The company could not be reached for comment.

70,70,FL-2014-000095-CHN,American Girl Makes Controversial Decision to Discontinue Asian American Doll - Asian Fortune,https://www.asianfortunenews.com/2014/07/american-girl-makes-controversial-decision-to-discontinue-asian-american-doll/,"By Heidi Zheng

American Girl announced last month that they will archive their first and only Asian American model, Ivy Ling, this September.

A San Francisco native of Chinese descent from the 70s, Ivy Ling belongs to American Girl’s historical collection that aims to “bring to life important times for America.” Also pulled from the line is Cecile Rey, a mixed-raced New Orleans girl growing up in the 1850s.

This decision was met with considerable public backlash. With both “retirees” being colored, some parents question whether American Girl endorses a very specific and limited image of girls that fails to properly represent the current demographics.

According to U.S. Census Bureau’s population estimates in 2011, the majority of children under age 10 are minorities. Washington D.C. has the second highest percentage – 76.5% – of minority children in the country, ranking only below Hawaii. Maryland comes in #9.

Blogger Lisa Owen, mother of two enthusiastic American Girl fans, asked in her open letter to the company on BlogHer, “is it not desirable that we would encourage our girls to expand their knowledge of people of different ethnicities? To embrace our differences rather than focus only on those who look just like us? My children have dolls of more than one race because it reflects their immediate social circle and the country that we live in.”

Senior PR Associate Susan Jevens insists that race is not taken into consideration when American Girls discontinue products; in fact, the first seven dolls American Girl had archived were all Caucasian. The main reason to archive Ivy and Cecile is part of their decision to “move away from our friend-character strategy within the historical line.”

Another spokesperson confirmed with NBC News that Ivy and Cecile’s companions, Ruthie and Marie-Grace, would also be archived alongside.

“Certainly we know that whenever we announce that a character is archiving, it will cause some level of disappointment, especially among our most ardent fans,” Jevens responds to the flood of criticism American Girls has received on their Facebook page, “but the responses from this announcement are not beyond anything we anticipated.”

Jevens also reminds the readers that Asian American doll options are still available in their Bitty Baby line and My American Girl line. The former gears toward younger girls from ages 3 and up; the latter features 18-inch dolls in a contemporary setting. Products of both lines can be customized with over 40 combinations of skin tone, eye and hair color. “American Girl is proud of its positive reputation for diversity and inclusiveness, and it’s an area in which we remain committed to exploring and expanding.”

71,71,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Europe Considers Fracking to Cut Russian Gas Imports - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/europe/europe-considers-fracking-cut-russian-gas-imports,"WASHINGTON - The political crisis in Ukraine, including its dispute with Moscow over the flow of Russian natural gas, has forced many European nations to reconsider their reliance on Russia for energy. Some nations are looking at new options for extracting natural gas at home, including the controversial process of hydraulic fracking.

Although much of Europe is dependent on Russian energy imports, the continent is believed to be sitting on 13 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, a significant reserve.

France, Poland and Ukraine share the largest amounts of shale gas, but reserves have been found in Romania, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom.

The presence of large shale gas reserves and the current crisis in Ukraine have sharpened the focus on Europe’s shale gas potential, according to Lucia Seybert, at the Wilson Center in Washington.

“With energy security it’s not just a matter of supply, it’s also a question of reliability. And one thing this thing may do, what might happen is, it may expedite some of these explorations of shale gas within the European Union,” Seybert said.

Still, Europe is believed to be years away from commercially exploiting shale gas. Poland, the United Kingdom and Romania are the farthest along - and expect to start exploration by 2020.

But extracting shale gas - using a technique called hydraulic fracking, is controversial. Most drilling sites in Europe are near populated areas and environmental groups have raised concerns about water and air pollution.

There also are political issues. European taxes on the industry and strict regulations create a challenge for extraction companies.

“It is much more complex extracting the gas in places like Poland and Central Europe than it is in the U.S. So we really need to better understand how much is there and how easily we can actually get it out of the ground,” said Eric Stewart, president of the Romanian-American and Polish-American Business Councils.

Energy companies also must battle a strong environmental movement and public opposition.

The process can help meet Europe’s energy needs if it complements conventional and renewable sources of energy like solar and wind, said

Keith Smith, a former U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, now a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and an expert on fracking technology.

“I think hydraulic fracturing is one element that can help bring energy security to Europe, but it will take a long time. I think it can happen but it’s only one factor. There are a lot of other things that need to be done,"" he said.

Much of Europe’s gas flows through a pipeline that runs from Russia across Ukraine. But Ukraine has had trouble paying its gas bill to Russia’s Gazprom energy company. And earlier this year, Ukrainian protesters ousted the country’s pro-Russia president. The new government has signed economic agreements with the European Union, over Moscow’s objections. Moscow has signaled it may cut off gas to Kyiv, and thus to much of Europe.

With winter approaching, the current dispute looks similar to the crisis in 2009, when Russia stopped the natural gas flow to Europe in January, leaving millions of homes and businesses in the cold.

""The European Union has got burned - or, frozen, I should say - with the 2009 crisis so they really worked hard to prevent something like that from reccurring, and there has been much talk about the interconnection of pipelines, alternative sources and reverse flow mechanism, so we will see,” Seybert said.

Shale gas exploration will not achieve complete energy independence from Russian imports, but will lessen that dependence long-term.

That would be beneficial for both Europe and Russia, a country that needs a more diversified economy and less dependence on energy exports, she said.","Sat, 12 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/10DA20C0-7C62-4C58-99A7-A5700C533F6A.jpg,"['russian', 'fracking', 'union', 'russia', 'seybert', 'ukraine', 'energy', 'gas', 'considers', 'europe', 'shale', 'european', 'cut', 'crisis', 'imports']",

We'd love to hear your responses to these stories and any others you've read recently, both at Guardian Cities and elsewhere: share your thoughts in the comments below.

Canals for New York?

Rebuild by Design's winners of its competition for flood resilience in the wake of Hurricane Sandy included a flood barrier wrapped around lower Manhattan, called the ""Big U"", and a living breakwater. Last week, the scientist who had predicted the devastating impact of an event like Sandy on New York wrote in Next City that, although innovative designs like these would have a positive short-term effect, the city may have to radically change its infrastructure if it wants to truly sustain its future.

What Klaus Jacob suggests is eyebrow-raising: he believes New York needs to be ""submersible"", and to raise connections between buildings into a network of ""high-lines"". ""By 2100,"" Jacob writes, ""we need to have transformed many city streets into Venice-like canals so that businesses can continue to flourish; that goods, services, people and waste can get in and out unhindered using watertight subways, and where needed, barges, ferries and water taxis.""

Car-acas

Caracas needs to stop driving. Architect Tere Garcia, writing in This Big City, says the crowded, congested and polluted city is in need of an effective and cheap public transport system, to make trips easier, healthier and more convivial. Although the Venezuelan city is introducing new public rail infrastructure in the form of the Cabletren Bolivariano, this is not yet affordable or extensive enough to start changing the transportation habits of its citizens, Garcia argues. ""Although Venezuelan institutions have made a huge effort to implement new ways of transportation and mobilization, the city still needs to raise awareness of the importance of public transport and promote other alternatives.""

In a country that has some of the world's cheapest petrol, Garcia believes promotoing cycling – though expanded cycling education, initiatives and activity programmes – is one short-term solution to reducing the 1 million cars that rumble through Caracas each day.



Disaster planning in Tokyo

By contrast to Caracas, Tokyo is a city that has largely kicked the driving habit. Instead, most citizens rely on their urban rail network, the most extensive in the world. But what if all those trains suddenly just stopped? In a city with a significant earthquake risk, this is a grim but vital question: almost 4 million people would find themseves stranded.

Tokyo has introduced a law, the Metropolitan Tokyo Ordinance on Measures for Stranded Persons, that contains measures for stockpiling food and resources across the city and creating emergency support stations. The aim is to stop people having to walk home in a post-disaster landscape – though in times of crisis one imagines it would be difficult to change the natural homing instinct.

The lost city

Kowloon Walled City was an overcrowded settlement fraught with contention, its disputed governance and ambiguous legal status leading to problems of crime and a reputation as a haven of vice. In 1987, the Hong Kong government decided to demolish the labyrinthine city, which eventually took place in 1993 after lengthy evictions. In this remarkable Wall Street Journal interactive, we are invited into the world of the Walled City to meet the locals, explore the streets, discover its history and watch the myths it has created unfold.



From sick cities to slick cities

In their new Slicker City section, which explores urban challenges and innovative solutions, Fast Co Design report back on the American Institute of Architects convention, where design professor Thomas Fisher insisted that ""we have designed cities to make people ill"". Quoting the statistic that cars are the biggest killer of people under 34, Fisher argues that every time we design a building which can only be reached by car, we are endangering lives. Future urbanism, he says, should fuse health with architecture and design, so we can create cities that are less car-dependent and consequently healthier.

By Brett Walton, Circle of Blue

Lake Mead — America’s largest reservoir, Las Vegas’ main water source, and an important indicator for water supplies in the Southwest — will fall this week to its lowest level since 1937 when the manmade lake was first being filled, according to forecasts from the federal Bureau of Reclamation.

The record-setting low water mark — a surface elevation of 1,081.8 feet above sea level — will not trigger any restrictions for the seven states in the Colorado River Basin. Restrictions will most likely come in 2016 when the lake is projected to drop below 1,075 feet, a threshold that forces cuts in water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada, states at the head of the line for rationing.

But the steadily draining lake does signal an era of new risks and urgency for an iconic and ebbing watershed that provides up to 40 million people in the U.S. and Mexico with a portion of their drinking water. The rules governing the river are complex, but the risk equation is straightforward: less supply due to a changing climate, plus increasing demands from new development, leads to greater odds of shortages.

“We have mapped out how the remainder of our allocation can be used…We have a place for every drop.” –Eric Millis, director

Utah Division of Water Resources

No area is more vulnerable than Las Vegas, which draws 90 percent of its water from Lake Mead. Today, in the midst of the basin’s driest 14-year period in the historical record, the gambler’s paradise is completing an expensive triage. The regional water authority is spending at least $US 829 million of ratepayer money to dig two tunnels — one at the lake bottom that will be completed next spring and the other an emergency connection between existing intakes — to ensure that the 2 million residents of southern Nevada can still drink from Mead as more of the big lake reverts to desert.

Yet despite a shrinking lake, diminishing supplies, and ardent pleas from tour guides and environmental groups to preserve a canyon-cutting marvel, the four states in the basin upriver from Lake Mead intend to increase the amount of water they take out of the Colorado River. All of the states are updating or developing new state water strategies, most of which involve using more Colorado River water, not less.

“We have mapped out how the remainder of our allocation can be used,” Eric Millis, director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, told Circle of Blue. “It’s going to happen sooner rather than later. We have a place for every drop.”

Utah — like fellow upper basin states Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming — is not using all the Colorado River water it was granted by a 1922 interstate compact. The four states have the legal authority to increase their Colorado River diversions.

However, the water they seek may not be available. The calculations of availability stem from wetter hydrological conditions and supply forecasts made nearly a century ago. Under the 1922 compact, the upper basin is entitled to 7.5 million acre-feet. A later agreement apportioned each state a percentage of the available supply. The upper basin’s average annual use between 2007 and 2011, the most recent figures, was 4.6 million acre-feet.

The legal entitlement, granted at a time when the river’s hydrology was poorly understood, is surely too high. All the states acknowledge that fact. “We’re not pegging our hopes or analysis on the full 7.5,” said James Eklund, director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, the state water planning agency.

Still, the much dryer conditions that exist today means that supplies are tight enough to substantially raise the risk of water shortages with every additional water consumption project.

A River of Equations

By law and tradition, the Colorado River Basin is divided into two halves. The four upper basin states have different obligations, preoccupations, and goals than Arizona, California, and Nevada, the three lower basin states.

While the lower basin keeps an eye on Lake Mead, the upper basin is more concerned about water levels in Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir on the Colorado, 180 miles upstream (290 kilometers) from Mead.

The upper basin put forward a plan this spring to keep more water in Powell. The states would do this by paying farmers not to farm and by changing how smaller mountain reservoirs are managed. Three urban water utilities in the lower basin, along with Denver and the federal government, put up $US 11 million to develop a similar basin-wide program.

Powell helps the upper basin meet a legal requirement to send an average of 7.5 million acre-feet of water to the lower basin each year. (An acre-foot is 325,851 gallons, or enough to flood an acre of land in one foot of water.)

The two basins were brought closer together in 2007 when the seven states negotiated protocols for balancing water supplies in the two big reservoirs. Just 39 percent full today, Mead’s water level dropped quickly this year — by 7.6 meters (25 feet) — because Powell was low last year. As a result, more water is being impounded upstream this year. The reverse will happen if Mead drops below certain thresholds.

Upper Basin Allocations State Allocation (%) Colorado 51.75 New Mexico 11.25 Utah 23 Wyoming 14 A 1948 compact divided the upper basin’s allocation among the four states, granting each a percentage of the Colorado River’s average flow. States are now debating the number by which they should calculate their share.

In effect, the amount of water in Powell influences the amount of water in Mead and vice versa. The amount of water in Powell will in turn be determined by precipitation and upstream demand. Two general principles apply: the basin is getting drier and demands will increase.

Though the lower basin is using its entire allocation, the four upper basin states are not. They desire more water from the Colorado, yet exactly how much water is available is uncertain.

The only concrete number to emerge so far is 5.8 million acre-feet of water available for the upper basin, or three-quarters of what was granted. That figure, called the hydrological determination, was developed by New Mexico and the Department of the Interior in 2007 as part of a water supply study.

New Mexico is the only state using 5.8 million acre-feet as a firm number. Millis said Utah is using 6.5 million acre-feet of upper basin supply for its planning, and Colorado and Wyoming are looking at a range of values.

Eklund told Circle of Blue there is “vigorous debate” both within and between states over what number should be used to assess water availability and what the acceptable levels of risk are as water use increases.

“There’s a sliding scale of risk,” Eklund said. “The more water you develop, the more risk you take on. But that doesn’t necessarily counsel against a project.”

River flows over the last century averaged 15 million acre-feet annually. But future flows are expected to drop because of changes in precipitation due to global warming.

A 2012 Bureau of Reclamation study pegged the river’s average annual flow by 2060 to be 13.7 million acre-feet. Adding together the water consumed by the seven basin states and Mexico, plus the water that evaporates from reservoirs, the current total use is roughly 13.4 million acre-feet per year. Farming accounts for roughly 80 percent of the water consumption in the basin, and watering lawns take up more than half of municipal supplies.

Very clearly there is room for adjusting practices and conserving water. Without those steps the Colorado River basin may soon find itself in a state of perpetual shortage, and Lake Mead’s water level will sink further.","Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/©JGanter_LakeMead_G3_1102-1000.jpg?fit=1000%2C479&ssl=1,"['million', 'deepens', 'low', 'states', 'acrefeet', 'mead', 'drought', 'water', 'basin', 'river', 'record', 'lake', 'drains', 'colorado', 'upper', 'western']",

Surprisingly, no one has taken any action against the illegal constructions though the Lokayukta and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the government have questioned the legality of the constructions.

Narsapuram MP, Gokarajau Gangaraju, had built a guest house next to the nature cure hospital several years ago. The irrigation officials said they had issued notices on October 18, 2010 – file number 103/I – against the illegal guest house.

As the case was not properly followed up by the officials, now many VIPs are inquiring about the availability of land to build guesthouses since the area is now in the race for the new capital city.

AP irrigation minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao said that the government would take action against the illegal constructions and that officials of his ministry were collecting data of illegal constructions from the field level.

However, MP Mr Gangaraju said that he had constructed the building 20 years ago and never received any notices from the irrigation department. He also asked that when nearly 100 buildings had been built on the Krishna flood banks, why was he being singled out.","Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/sites/default/files/07VJNEWS22.jpg,"['officials', 'illegal', 'irrigation', 'krishna', 'notices', 'built', 'eye', 'mp', 'house', 'banks', 'river', 'constructions', 'storm', 'guest']",

84,84,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Rising tide: long-term ramifications of global warming on the country's coastline - The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/07/12/environment/rising-tide-long-term-ramifications-global-warming-countrys-coastline/,"It’s a scenario we’re all familiar with: Unequivocal climate change warms our oceans, which in turn causes ice sheets at either pole to melt and sea levels worldwide to increase. Citizens of low-lying nations such as Tuvalu, much of which is less than 1 meter above sea level, are forced to relocate as the land they live upon becomes uninhabitable.

It’s a scenario that has massive ramifications for Japan, a country with a coastline that is almost 30,000 km long.

In a 1996 research paper titled “Responses of Coastal Topography to Rising Sea Levels,” climate scholars Nobuo Mimura and Eiichi Kawaguchi forecast that a 1-meter rise in sea levels would cause 90.3 percent of the country’s sand beaches to erode.

Indeed, sea levels are already rising, albeit at a glacial pace. According to the Meteorological Agency, the country’s average sea levels rose by 1.1 mm per year from 1971 to 2010, increasing to an average of 2.8 mm per year from 1993 to 2010.

However, there is plenty of uncertainty about how quickly sea levels will rise in the future.

The most recent U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report forecasts that sea levels will rise by 1-3 feet (30-90 cm) by 2100. However, the “vast majority of these projections do not take into account the possibility of major ice loss in Antarctica,” NASA says — otherwise estimates would have to be revised upward.

Such a scenario could already be happening. New satellite images from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat taken between 2010 and 2013 show that the Antarctic ice sheet is retreating at twice the speed compared to when it was surveyed in the previous decade, losing 159 billion tons of ice every year.

Furthermore, two recent studies by NASA and the University of Washington using different methodologies came to broadly similar conclusions — that the melting of the western Antarctic ice sheet has begun and cannot be halted.

The NASA study looked at the retreat of six key glaciers in the Amundsen Sea, glaciers that contain enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet (1.2 meters).

The University of Washington study, meanwhile, focused on the Thwaites Glacier, which acts like a dam for other glaciers in the western region. Once the Thwaites Glacier collapses, the study said, the remaining ice in the sheet could melt, raising sea levels by another 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).

Alarming as this sounds, there’s no need to push the panic button just yet, University of Washington glaciologist Ian Joughin says, adding that the collapse was “likely to play out over a two- to 10-century range.”

Regardless of how long it is going to take for the glaciers to collapse, University of Leeds professor Andrew Shepherd, who led the CryoSat study, says the significance of the new findings have yet to be fully understood. “Joughin’s paper is a seminal study, as it is the first to demonstrate through a realistic model what glaciologists have suspected for some time — that the Thwaites Glacier is the biggest threat to future sea-level rise,” Shepherd says. “The new research adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet and will, I am sure, trigger a revision of global sea-level projections.”

In fact, even tiny increases in global sea levels can have worrying consequences on Japan’s coastline, and the damage doesn’t simply stop at the gradual erosion of sand beaches.

Increases in sea levels put stronger pressure on sea dikes by enforced wave action and also magnify the damage caused by extreme weather events. Torrential rain, storm surges, and typhoons, exacerbate the problem, especially if they coincide with a high tide.

Environmental researcher Masahiko Isobe calculated in a 2013 study titled “Impact of Global Warming on Coastal Structures in Shallow Water” that the height of waves hitting the coast would be three times larger in the event of a 60-cm rise in sea levels combined with a typhoon that is 10 percent stronger than average. As a result, inundation zones widen and concrete sea dikes can be breached by extra-large waves, which can cause subsequent damage.

Another consequence of rising sea levels is the elevated risk of liquefaction. Groundwater in coastal zones is directly linked to the height of the sea nearby. When sea levels rise, the groundwater table rises as well. The granular, sandy soil that is typically found in coastal areas can then become saturated, causing it to be vulnerable to liquefaction in the event of an earthquake.

Once liquefaction has occurred, there are broadly speaking two kinds of methods available to stabilize the soil again: an improvement of the soil, which is costly, or dewatering it.

However, extracting the water from the soil by pumping groundwater can prove counterproductive.

Kazuya Yasuhara, emeritus professor at Ibaraki University’s Institute for Global Change Adaptation Science, says pumping groundwater can cause a consolidation settlement that can occur unevenly, leading to an inclined surface that may leave structures constructed above such soil vulnerable to collapse.

Low-lying coastal areas are especially prone to the risk of flooding and liquefaction, with the coastlines around Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay and Ise Bay representing the highest risk.

Cost of protection

The economic consequences of a 1-meter rise in sea levels on the country’s coastline would be enormous, with about 80 percent of the country’s commercial sales and roughly half of its population and industrial production located in coastal areas.

Bloomberg reported in May 2013 that a tidal storm surge in Tokyo Bay would flood an area housing 1.4 million people, causing as many as 7,600 deaths. Government estimates, meanwhile, say the capital could face a damages bill worth as much as $322 billion (¥33 trillion) if the flood levees along the Arakawa River near Tokyo were to break.

An Asian Development Bank report in 2013 titled “Economics of Climate Change in East Asia” estimated that a 38-cm rise in sea levels between 2010 and 2050 would force 64,000 people in Japan to relocate due to erosion and inundation. The resulting corresponding cumulative economic losses of such a scenario would amount to ¥800 billion.

The country’s tourism industry, which is just beginning to show signs of rebounding after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami in 2011, would be significantly affected. In a 2008 study titled “Global Warming Impact on Japan,” environment researcher Eiji Ohno forecast that a 1-meter rise in sea levels would decrease the value sand beaches have in terms of recreational activities by ¥83.2 billion per year.

Increases in soil salinity that go hand in hand with a rise in sea levels are likely to negatively affect businesses such as rice farming, fisheries and aquaculture located along the country’s coastlines. Soil salinization has multiple implications: a degradation of freshwater resources, a reduced soil strength that makes it less able to support buildings, and changes in the ecosystems of estuaries, as for instance a depletion of biodiversity in the brackish zones.

Yasuhara says it is possible to adequately protect coastlines against a 1-meter rise in sea levels provided the country doesn’t experience a natural disaster that goes beyond one’s imagination, pointing to the March 11 disasters as an example. In particular, he says, an optimal mix of “reliable prediction, advanced techniques and necessary financial means” is essential if Japan wishes to protect its coasts.

However, coastal protection measures are expensive.

In 1993, the Environmental Agency estimated that ¥11.5 trillion was required to protect the country’s coasts against a 1-meter rise in sea levels: ¥7.8 trillion to elevate existing port facilities (quay sheds, wharves, breakwaters etc.) and ¥3.6 trillion to construct or remodel coastal structures (sea gates, groins, detached breakwaters, seawalls, embankments).

Compounding the issue, the budgets of many local governments don’t have much wiggle room, forcing engineers to consider new and less expensive ways to protect the coasts.

What’s more, 40 percent of the country’s existing coastal structures are more than half a century old. Concerned by this statistic, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has already started an initiative to increase their durability and life expectancy.

Recently, the government also announced plans to construct a massive 370-km network of anti-tsunami barriers for the northeastern coastline, which is expected to cost approximately ¥870 billion.

Extended forecast

Given the mammoth task of raising such financing, Yasuhara suggests that priority be placed on monitoring and prediction systems in order to identify areas that are most vulnerable. Funds can then be selectively invested in locations that are most in need, he says.

Such an approach is already being carried out at a governmental level, although it will take more than another year before it is completed.

The Ministry of the Environment has earmarked ¥350 million on a five-year research project titled “Comprehensive Research on Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Policies” that examines the growing impact of global warming on Japan and possible adaptation measures in order to understand whether a safe future can be ensured.

A team of 93 researchers published a report in March that introduced forecasts on the impact of global warming on coastal regions, water resources, forests, agriculture and human health in Japan. It also included supportive climate-adaptation tools for local authorities.

One tool are guidelines that provide local authorities with, for example, risk communication or consensus-building methods that should help facilitate effective decision-making on appropriate climate-change adaptation measures. Another tool is a downscaler that allows policymakers, technical staff and researchers to make local climate-change assessments and forecasts.

A smaller group within the team is examining past and future coastal disaster risks and will estimate related economic losses from municipal to national levels. Based on such analyses, the group plans to compile nationwide risk maps and will suggest adaptation measures. This will allow local governments to assess the risk of floods, landslides, storm surges, coastal erosion and the like in their regions, as well as adopt appropriate measures.

The Ministry of the Environment plans to define priority issues that should be addressed in the short term (up to 10 years), middle term (10-30 years) and long term (30-100 years) once the full impact of climate change has been studied in the beginning of 2015. After this has been discussed, a government-wide integrated effort is scheduled to be released during the summer of 2015.

And although that means it’s a little more than a year before the country is able to study comprehensive data on climate change at a local and national level, one nation can only do so much by itself.

For the country’s sand beaches to stave off erosion, global greenhouse gas emissions must be cut across the board and yet it’s not hard to name a number of nations still dragging their feet.

And even if humans are able to cut emissions and increases in average global temperatures by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, many Japanese researchers believe that some damage from climate change is inevitable.

What lies ahead for the coastlines that ring Japan if humans fail to achieve even that perhaps just doesn’t bear imagining.

Areas at risk of flooding during a typhoon that strikes at high tide after a 1-meter rise in sea levels

A gradual rise in sea levels puts greater pressure on flood protection systems that guard areas located in basins and coastal areas. When such increases coincide with high tides and extreme weather incidents such as typhoons, existing levees and tidal gates constructed around the country are less likely to be able to keep the water out, resulting in more frequent flooding or levee breaches. Low-lying areas, in particular, are at risk. In 2006, the Center for International Earth Science Information Network said that 24 percent of the population lives in coastal zones that are less than 10 meters above sea level.

Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay and Ise Bay are especially vulnerable to even incremental rises in sea levels because large tracts of land currently lie below sea level. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism’s River Bureau estimates that a 1-meter rise in sea-levels would exponentially increase the total below-sea-level area of the three bays and their corresponding populations by a factor of 1.6: the area at risk of flooding would increase from 577 sq. km to 923 sq. km, while the number of people at risk would jump from 404,000 to 646,000.

Tokyo Bay

Tokyo Bay’s low-lying areas are located in the region around east Arakawa and Edogawa. However, in a 2009 study titled “Estimation of Inundation Damage Caused by Global Warming in Three Major Bays and Western Parts of Japan,” Coastal, Marine and Disaster Prevention Department Director Takeshi Suzuki says the flood protection measures in place are of a comparatively high standard.

Osaka Bay

The areas in Osaka Bay that are prone to flooding are located behind the reclaimed land near the coast, stretching from the north to the center of Osaka. Yet, Suzuki says the area is less vulnerable to high tides as its coastal defenses are sound. However, he adds, this is not the case with the reclaimed land that stretches from the center to the south of Osaka Bay.

Ise Bay

There are many low-lying areas in Ise Bay along the coast between the mouth of the Kiso Three Rivers and Nagoya Port. However, Suzuki says the most vulnerable regions to high tides are limited to the areas along the estuaries of the Kiso Three Rivers and the interior of Nagoya Port.

The inundation height is expected to be especially large in the reclaimed zone of Nagoya Port and its surrounding areas, which were redeveloped much earlier than other areas. To take measures against the threat of global warming and upgrade coastal defenses, the ministry’s Ports and Harbours Bureau undertook a study based on the three aforementioned bays in 2011.

Furthermore, according to a Bloomberg article that was published in May 2013, Japan planned to spend ¥1 trillion on nationwide disaster prevention in the last fiscal year of 2013, a figure that includes strengthening the levees in Tokyo against a flood that happens once in every 200 years.","Sat, 12 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Waterline_slider-870x489.jpg,"['global', 'study', 'longterm', 'rising', 'coastline', 'areas', 'tide', 'countrys', 'ramifications', 'rise', 'sea', 'risk', 'japan', 'levels', 'warming', 'coastal']",

Farming is an inherently risky business: bad weather, pests, credit constraints, and unexpected policy changes threaten farmers of all sizes.

Helping farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, find better ways to manage risk is an important part of what food security programming is all about. But what if a very basic risk is being overlooked? What would happen to farmers’ productivity and the food security of families and communities?

Providing better-quality seeds, extension services, irrigation and other infrastructure will undoubtedly help small-scale farmers meet the challenge of feeding the world’s growing population. However, in some countries, farmers face a very basic risk that threatens their ability to feed themselves and others: Their rights to the land and the other natural resources they depend on to farm, herd livestock or collect forest products are not secure. For women, especially, the problem of insecure land rights contributes to a striking agricultural gender gap.

Over the past few years, a flood of news stories, policy reports and academic articles have drawn attention to the problem. Rising demand for land and water threatens local people with dispossession and loss of livelihoods.

A recent story in National Geographic exposed problems associated with commercial agricultural development in Mozambique, where people who live on and use land set aside for large-scale commercial agriculture ventures are being uprooted and moved to locations where they produce less and earn less. But the situation there is not unique. In countries where land governance systems are weak and demand for fertile land is rising, local people are increasingly at risk of losing access to, and rights over, critical natural resources. Women and other vulnerable groups, such as pastoralists, often face special risks because their rights and needs are easily overlooked or ignored.

Farmers manage some risks by planting in multiple fields or purchasing crop insurance. The problem is — how can they reduce the risks associated with insecure land rights? One way is to register and record rights, but the high costs associated with these processes have been a barrier for many people.

Fortunately, innovative approaches can help identify and record rights at a relatively low cost. Two approaches in particular show strong promise: deploying paraprofessionals to register and record rights, and using technology — high- and low-tech — to map and capture local knowledge about who holds rights and how and when resources are used.

Paraprofessionals, including paralegals and para-surveyors, are proving invaluable when it comes to building legal awareness and lowering the costs of registering land rights. Relying on these respected local providers has clear advantages: They understand local constraints and challenges, offer decentralized services, and charge minimal fees.

When people have access to affordable land services, it becomes feasible to navigate through the often cumbersome process of registering rights. With more secure rights, farmers may have stronger incentives to invest to improve productivity, as has happened in countries like China, Vietnam and Ethiopia. Securing land rights is a special help for women, who produce so much food. In Rwanda and Ethiopia, securing women’s land rights has helped to improve their voice in household decision-making and increased investments in soil conservation and other productivity-enhancing activities. Importantly, with legally recognized rights over their lands, local communities may be able to lease land directly to investors for a fee or for an equity share in an initiative — creating more and better economic opportunities.

Technology also holds real promise to effectively capture local knowledge and reduce the costs of registering and recording rights. Mobile technology has been underutilized by the land sector, but that is changing. New fit-for-purpose applications are being developed that will allow people to map and record a wide variety of land and resource rights information using existing cell phone networks. This data can be locally accessible, transferable over the Internet to cloud-based databases (with appropriate security protection) and used to issue formal documentation such as titles or certificates of use rights. Participatory mapping methods are certainly not new but harnessing the power of mobile technology to record local knowledge is. Coupling low-tech participatory mapping with geospatial data and mobile technology solutions can help smallholders gain the assurance they need to invest more and grow more.

Join the conversation with our LinkedIn group! How can efforts to formalize customary land rights balance local customs with international best practices?

One major impediment to securing land rights has been the high cost of documenting those rights. Cost-effective innovations like paraprofessionals and mobile technologies can help improve land governance by capturing local knowledge and delivering accessible and responsive services.

Agriculture may be an inherently risky business but securing land rights through the use of innovative, low-cost, fit-for-purpose technologies will help to reduce risk and improve the chances for millions of families to have a food-secure future.

89,89,FL-2014-000095-CHN,The key to England's economic growth: The rich outlived the poor - PBS NewsHour,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/key-englands-economic-growth-rich-outlived-poor,"Editor’s Note: Why do some societies get rich when others don’t? It’s one of the oldest intellectual puzzles, and one that economic historian Gregory Clark tackled in his 2007 book, “A Farewell to Alms.”

His thesis, which he develops in this third installment of his never-before published interview with Paul Solman, makes the controversial argument that, in England, the survival of the wealthiest had a lot to do with it.

In the beginning of economic history, we were all hunter-gatherers, and life was pretty good – better even, Clark argues in part one of this interview, than in pre-industrial England. That’s because the world conformed to a “Malthusian” view of economic history: population limited by the limited resources for keeping humans alive. With more violence and more death in hunter-gatherer society, the surviving hunter-gatherers had more of the bounty.

But, according to Clark, that economic view no longer holds with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution. Suddenly, steady growth made the West rich; material life became easier.

But why were the English open to this kind of rapid economic growth when other societies weren’t? In part two of his conversation with Paul, Clark dismissed prevailing theories that institutions – both market and political – distinguished the English and set them up for success. Instead, he explained how an evolutionary shift in psychology set them apart.

From hunter-gatherer society to 1800, he said, there was a change in people’s personalities: people became more envious and more patient.

He takes the Darwinian argument further in this third installment. Simply put, the takeoff of the Industrial Revolution in England can be explained by “the survival of the richest.”

— Simone Pathe, Making Sen$e Editor

Greg Clark: Now, why would something like that [people’s personalities] change? It turns out that another essential component of the Malthusian world is that if it’s Malthusian — if living standards are going to be driven down to a subsistence minimum by population — that world also has to be Darwinian. It has to be the case that those who somehow command more resources in these societies end up with more surviving children, and eventually take over the population, and those who don’t succeed in that competition for the resources are going to die out.

Paul Solman: And why?

Greg Clark: It has to be the case because if you get more income in the society, then people produce more children, and those children survive better. So you end up with more than your allotted two surviving children. If you can’t command that income, you can’t produce the children, and the children you produce are not going to make it, and you’ll end up with no children, and that’s quite common in this pre-industrial world.

In hunter-gather society, we can observe that competition, and it seems to be based in part on success in violence and aggression.

Paul Solman: So that if I can beat you, then I get the field, or the extra resources to feed my kids.

Greg Clark: Right.

Paul Solman: You’ve been beaten down, but my kids pass along either the tradition of violence or the violence gene that I have.

Greg Clark: Right. But in England, it’s the people who are commercially successful and also successful at farming, the people who did the ordinary, boring, middle class stuff, who had extraordinary reproductive success. Typically in the 17th century, instead of producing two surviving children, they were producing four to five surviving children. The poor, on the other hand, are actually dying out. You can observe their families disappearing, all the way back to the Middle Ages, again in the 17th century.

“If you’re descended from someone in medieval England, it’s not likely to be a landless peasant. It’s very likely to be someone who was in the commercial elite of that society.”

And so what’s happening in a commercial society like England, in this pre-industrial world, is that the economically successful are populating the entire society. They are becoming everyone in the society. If you’re descended from someone in medieval England, it’s not likely to be a landless peasant. It’s very likely to be someone who was in the commercial elite of that society.

We also can observe in pre-industrial England that if fathers were successful in this way, their sons followed them. They inherited the success of their fathers. And we can often say that it’s not just because they inherited the money from their fathers; they inherited something about the attitudes or ability, or even the genetics of their fathers.

The reason that people were more innovative, more commercially active, more alive to these possibilities in England was that we had a survival of those who were driven by material success, those who couldn’t be happy unless they were making more money. So again, in some sense, the envious have inherited the earth, and that’s why we’ve got modern growth.

This is not saying that these people were in any sense better, or smarter. It’s just that they had a set of attributes that go well with modern capitalism.

Paul Solman: So survival of the richest means survival of the most competitive, or most envious, or most bourgeois.

Greg Clark: Yes.

Paul Solman: Really?

Greg Clark: In the context of pre-industrial England, those are the people who made it through. And another competing explanation – other people have believed that cultural change is key to the Industrial Revolution. So if you look at the work of Joel Mokyr, he roots that cultural change in a kind of earlier scientific revolution, in a kind of intellectual movement. He thinks of this as a top down movement — intellectual discoveries that lead to a new kind of social structure.

This intellectual movement was actually grounded in very mundane economic activities — it had an economic foundation. But there’s actually an interconnection between cultural and intellectual movements and the basic economies of pre-industrial societies.

Paul Solman: Aren’t you being disingenuous, though, about those inherited traits not being smarts ? I mean, you’re talking about literacy, you’re talking about numerousy, you’re talking about ingenuity, at least by implication. That’s smarts. You use the word “intellectual.”

Greg Clark: I’ve read many anthropological studies of hunter-gatherer societies, and it’s very clear from those studies, and someone like Jared Diamond would absolutely emphasize this, that there’s no unique directional sense in which people in a society like England are going to be judged to be smarter than people in New Guinea or the Brazilian Amazon.

People in hunter-gatherer societies have amazing sets of abilities in terms of their ability to visualize and remember, and it’s just that modern commercial life, in part, depends on various formal calculating abilities, and that these are the kind of things that may have been rewarded in somewhere like pre-industrial England.

And so it’s just there’s many dimensions to people’s abilities, but it’s possible that in the pre-industrial world and the commercial world of England, a certain set of characteristics were actually being pooled out there that may not have resulted in a lot of good British art or music, but that did result in this strong commercial impulse.

Paul Solman: Well, what about the old British cliché, “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations”? Meaning the first generation works really hard (shirtsleeves), then builds a fortune for the second generation, then the third one lives off the fortune, and by the third generation, it’s back to shirtsleeves because they’ve blown all the money.

Greg Clark: Right. One of the bizarre features of pre-industrial England is that because it was this Malthusian economy with very slow growth, there’s only a certain number of land possibilities and only a certain number of commercial possibilities, so these abundant children of the rich were actually being forced systematically down the social scale.

If you were a laborer in 1750, chances were that your grandfather or great-grandfather had been a small land owner or a small petty capitalist. And so there is definitely this downward mobility, and it’s a strange feature of this world.

When we move to the modern world, mobility tends to be in the other direction. But the argument of the book is that that downward mobility meant that permeating all levels of British society in this period were people with certain types of attitudes — that the working classes of Britain and the Industrial Revolution are not the unthinking automatons later portrayals of the Industrial Revolution would suggest. These were people who, even at the lowest level, had a lot of energy, a lot of initiative, and who were often more literate than the upper classes of ancient Greece or ancient Rome.

Paul Solman: But now this had to be happening everywhere, right? Didn’t this happen in Russia? Didn’t this happen in France? I mean, rich people have more kids. If there’s only a certain number of people in the society, then the same thing is going to happen everywhere, right?

Greg Clark: Unfortunately, we don’t have this kind of data for a number of other societies. We do know in 19th century Sweden exactly the same kind of process is occurring, and what the book is emphasizing is that this was a general phenomena of settled agrarian pre-industrial societies. You can observe it in Japan in the pre-industrial era. You can observe it in China in the 18th and 19th century.

England, though, may have had certain peculiarities. One thing is that with English history, we have better data than almost any other society back to the middle ages. The reason for that is, tragically, that not much happened actually in England in the pre-industrial world, and so there’s very little internal violence; there’s very little insurrection. Most of the wars are fought somewhere else.

Paul Solman: So they didn’t burn the documents.

Greg Clark: Documents from the medieval period can survive untouched in a cupboard in the bishop’s palace for 600 years before someone decides to have a look at them again.

But that very kind of boringness to British history may have allowed this process to work more rapidly than in other societies where there was turmoil, insurrection, violence and fighting. And so that was one event that Britain had. And then the second thing has just been the nature of the demographic regime, where for whatever reason, rich men in Britain were able to produce many more children.

In other societies like China, there seems to have been more fertility limitation for reasons that we don’t know, whereas in England if you were rich, you produced children. And it just seems to have been the social characteristic of that society. And so there may well be systematic elements linked with what kind of institutions did this society have, where the more stable they are, the more favorable it is to these processes operating.

But all this book is saying is that we can observe this process in general. England may have gone ahead of other societies, but if you look at Japan in the Tokogawa period, it’s evolving in a similar way to England. It’s just several hundred years behind in terms of its social structure, or looking at things like interest rates. It looks more like medieval England, but it’s moving, it’s changing in similar ways.

Paul Solman: But that is survival of the richest.

Greg Clark: Right. That process is much weaker somehow in Japan. The Samurai, where we can observe their fertility, were producing surplus sons who couldn’t be accommodated in the Samurai ranks, but only very few, so there isn’t the same flood of these kind of upper classes into the lower commercial realm in somewhere like Japan that there is in somewhere like Britain.

Paul Solman: So this is happening world-wide, but it might be happening faster in England, and it any case, it would explain why at some point, these values have taken hold around the world.

Greg Clark: Yes. I mean, the argument of the book is that one of the big puzzles is, was an Industrial Revolution inevitable? Could we — given that we went 100,000 years with very slow rates of technological advance — could we have stayed stranded in the Malthusian era forever?

One of the ideas of the book here is that in some sense, eventually, a society was going to emerge which could have rapid economic growth. Why that society was England as opposed to China, which is not a very good candidate, may have depended then on accidental features of demography, location, geography and things like that.

But I think what you do see now is that once that growth process had started in China, China looked like it was just waiting all of these years to grow. It looks more capitalist than almost any other society we’ve seen, despite a generation of the attempt to impose this completely different ideology.

And so, there is this kind of worrying possibility, which is in the book and which, I must say, personally I don’t like, which is to say that the long history of societies might have left some mark in terms of the potential of those societies now for economic growth.

I recently went to Australia, and the plight of the Australian Aboriginals is terrible. The contact with Europeans has essentially brought them nothing but misery.

We really worry that the fact that Australian Aboriginals never went through this phase of settled, agrarian society actually means that culturally, it just may be very difficult for them to adapt to the demands of modern capitalism.","Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2014/07/London-21-1024x773.jpg,"['outlived', 'englands', 'world', 'england', 'societies', 'preindustrial', 'rich', 'growth', 'poor', 'economic', 'children', 'clark', 'key', 'kind', 'solman', 'society']",

Find out - Deccan Chronicle,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140713/technology-latest/article/who-created-barbie-doll-find-out,"Mumbai: ‘Barbie’ is a benchmark to the collection of dolls for all girls and brings in the importance of fashion right from your childhood. Did you know who created your Barbie doll? If you are confused and unaware of who is the person responsible to introduce the fashion concept, here is the answer.

Ruth Handler, Co-founder of Mattel Toys created your Barbie doll using her observation and imagination. One evening, Ruth Handler observed her daughter Barbara and friends play with paper dolls of grown-up women. At that very moment, she decided to make a doll with which girls could relate to and find their best friend. After three years, Ruth finally unveiled Barbie in 1959. Her historic debut took place at the New York Toy Fair.

Besides introducing the element of fashion, she even aimed in bringing out the fact that a woman also has choices. And so, that’s how the Barbie doll was introduced with different outfits and accessories.

What materials have been used in the manufacturing of Barbie doll?

Polyvinyl Chloride (Vinyl)

Barbie Dolls compose of polyvinyl chloride (vinyl or PVC), a thermoplastic polymer that is mixed with a plasticizer to make the dolls more flexible and less brittle than PVC alone.

Water-based paints

Previously, Barbies were made using solvent-based paints that were not as environmentally friendly. But Barbie's eyes has been created using a water-based paint.

Elastomer

Around 2000, as Mattel toys company decided that Barbie's stomach needed to be more elastic and flexible, it incorporated ‘ultra-soft’ elastomer into the mix. Elastomer allows Barbie a more realistic range of motions.

Synthetic Fiber

Barbie Dolls' hair is made of rooted synthetic fibers that are dyed in lots to fit the specific dolls.

93,93,FL-2014-000095-CHN,Houston's Korean Air nonstop called a valuable link - Houston Chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Nonstop-Korean-Air-flight-helps-Houston-compete-5613393.php,"Houston's business ties to South Korea will strengthen and the city's Korean population could even double thanks to the recently launched nonstop flight between Houston and Seoul, Ambassador Suk-bum Park, consul general of the Republic of Korea, said Thursday.

Park told Houston's Asian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday that the new nonstop flight will create more opportunities for connections between with the city and Asia.

""It's Houston's time now,"" Park said.

Korean Air has been flying to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for 20 years. American Airlines also offers nonstop service out of Dallas. But in May, the airline launched its first nonstop flight between Houston and Incheon International Airport near Seoul. Before the first flight took off, the airline decided to boost the flight from four days a week to daily.

Park, who is based in Houston, said before Korean Air added a nonstop flight to Dallas in 1994, Houston had a larger Korean population than its rival Texas city. Since, however, the Korean population in Dallas has tripled, while Houston's has remained at roughly 30,000. He predicted in the coming years Houston's Korean population will double to 60,000 thanks to the nonstop flight.

Park also said Dallas also monopolizes the air cargo business between Texas and South Korea. He said trade between South Korea and Houston has increased by 30 percent over the last decade, but that has been solely by sea. He predicted that air cargo trade would increase in Houston and Korean investors will soon invest in spas, entertainment and theme parks in Houston because of the nonstop flight.

Michael Kim, regional manager in Houston for Korean Air, said Incheon International Airport is a major hub and will be able to connect those flying through Bush Intercontinental to many cities in Asia easily.

This week, the airline announced it will add more than a dozen weekly flights to China and is improving its schedule from Beijing to Incheon. In all, the airline is increasing flights to six Chinese cities and adding 15 flights to China each week.

Kim said he has confidence in the Houston market because the first few months of service have been very successful.

Mayor Annise Parker is planning a trip to Seoul in September.

Houston Airport System director Mario Diaz told the group that Houston is poised to attract even more international carriers after the success of the three new nonstop flights to Asia announced last year between Houston and Istanbul, Beijing and Seoul, respectively.

He said many advised him at the beginning of his efforts to attract more international carriers that Korean Air would be a hard sell on Houston, as it had a strong relationship with Dallas. Once Turkish Airlines and Air China began offering nonstop daily flights, Diaz said he was able to attract the Korean airline.

He said that the airport hopes to announce four new nonstop flights from international carriers this year.

""Now we have connections to major economies in Asia,"" Diaz said. ""Houston is on the map internationally.""","Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/27/66/20/6251556/9/rawImage.jpg,"['flights', 'korean', 'houstons', 'houston', 'international', 'flight', 'link', 'valuable', 'dallas', 'airport', 'nonstop', 'called', 'air']",

Globally, those parks owners can attract a large nation by themselves.

PORTLAND, Ore. (TheStreet) -- All those roller coasters, spools of cotton candy and workers sweating it out in mascot costumes this summer aren't just U.S. roadside attractions, but vital pieces of the nation's nearly $15 billion amusement park industry.

The more than 400 parks and attractions that make up the U.S. amusement park circuit welcome roughly 300 million visitors through their gates each year, according to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in Alexandria, Va. The Top 20 amusement parks in North America that accounted for 131.5 million of those visitors last year have seen attendance rise 17% in the past decade, according to the Theme Entertainers Association amusement industry group in Burbank, Calif.

More importantly, they employ more than 100,000 year-round workers, plus upward of 500,000 seasonal workers each summer. It isn't exactly a bad gig, either, as a 2011 IAAPA survey found that 28% percent of Americans said they liked the idea of working for an amusement park company.

That's a quarter of the country that's willing to endure rides full of screaming patrons, extreme heat, musty costumes, interminable lines of disgruntled customer and lots of food made primarily with sugar or deep fryers just to get a little sun and a paycheck. Who can blame them? With few exceptions, it's fairly steady work. Roughly a quarter of Americans have visited an amusement park within the past year and 43% are planning to go within the next year.

Market research firm IBISWorld notes that even during the past five years since the recession, the U.S. amusement park industry has grown 4% each year. For the larger companies behind those rides, games, shows and other attractions, overseas growth during the U.S. downturn managed to minimize the damage while increasing their brand's global footprint. Worldwide, the Top 10 amusement park ownership groups alone welcomed 377 million visitors to their facilities, which was an increase of 5.4% from 2012.

A whole lot more are expected this year as parks add attractions and the economy picks up. The following five companies are not only behind most of the parks U.S. vacationers will be visiting this summer, but are some of the most successful entertainment companies in the world. They don't attract ""guests""; they draw the population of small countries on an annual basis:

SeaWorld

Locations: San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Antonio, Texas; Sesame Place in Langhorne, Pa.; Adventure Island in Tampa, Fla.; Water Country USA in Williamsburg, Va.

Number of visitors in 2013: 23.4 million

The bad news is that a whole lot of people saw the documentary Blackfish last year and have some serious questions about the treatment of orcas by SeaWorld and the ethics of animals as entertainment in general.

That helped drag down attendance at all SeaWorld parks by 4.1% in 2013 just after its parent company SeaWorld Entertainment went public. That includes a 5% drop at SeaWorld Orlando, the No. 19 amusement park in the world and 10th-largest in the U.S., with attendance of more than 5 million last year. That also hurt SeaWorld San Diego, which ranked No. 22 globally and No. 11 stateside in 2013 with 4.3 million visitors.

Worse for SeaWorld, it overshadowed what should have been a promising new penguin exhibit in Orlando and marred what was supposed to be its first year carrying its own weight after being sold off by Anheuser-Busch to the Blackstone Group in 2009. SeaWorld has gone on a public relations campaign refuting the documentary's claims and vouching for the safety of both its animals and their handlers, but is still waiting to see if its misfortune carries over to this summer.



Cedar Fair

Locations: California's Great America in Santa Clara, Calif.; Canada's Wonderland in Vaughn, Ont.; Carowinds in Charlotte, N.C.; Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio; Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pa.; Gilroy Gardens in Gilroy, Calif.; King's Dominion in Doswell, Va.; Kings Island in Mason, Ohio; Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif.; Michigan's Adventure in Muskegon, Mich.; Valley Fair in Shankopee, Minn.; Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Mo.

Number of visitors in 2013: 23.5 million

That downturn by SeaWorld allowed Cedar Fair and its enormous collection of North American amusement parks to leap into the No. 7 slot among amusement park companies worldwide. Its visitor base grew only 0.9% last year, but Cedar Fair will take that over a loss.

And why shouldn't it? Cedar Fair has four of the Top 20 amusement parks in the North American market, with No. 13 Knott's Berry Farm (3.7 million visitors, 5% growth in 2013), No. 14 Canada's Wonderland (3.6 million, 2% decline), No. 15 Cedar Point (3.4 million, 5% growth) and No. 16 Kings Island (3.2 million, flat growth). It also has five parks ranked among the Top 6 in the world for most roller coasters. It has 74 roller coasters in Cedar Point, Canada's Wonderland, Kings Island, Kings Dominion and Carowinds alone.

Adding former Disney exec Matt Ouimet has helped update the company's infrastructure and get all the parks under one umbrella, but his predecessor Dick Kinzel's purchase of Paramount's theme parks from CBS in 2006 and his refusal to sell to Apollo Global Management in 2009 helped Cedar Point retain its identity and grow into the continental powerhouse it is today.



Six Flags

Locations: Great Escape in Queensbury, N.Y.; America in Mitchellville, Md.; Discovery Kingdom in Viejo, Calif.; Fiesta Texas in San Antonio; Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J.; Great America in Gurnee, Ill.; Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif.; New England in Agawam, Mass.; Over Texas in Arlington, Texas; St. Louis in St. Louis, Mo.; Over Georgia in Austell, Ga.; Mexico in Mexico City; La Ronde in Montreal

Number of visitors in 2013: 26.1 million

Kind of hard to believe that this company was in bankruptcy as recently as 2009.

After selling off 10 properties between 2007 and 2010, selling its stake in Dick Clark Productions and cutting ties with licensed properties including The Terminator, Thomas The Tank Engine, The Wiggles and Tony Hawk, new Chief Executive Jim Reid-Anderson righted the ship and made the world's fifth-largest amusement park company fun again. Park attendance was up 1.4% last year, season passes sold at a brisk pace and new attractions including Magic Mountain's Full Throttle and Superman: Escape From Krypton brought in a flood of fresh faces.

Magic Mountain, the 18th-largest amusement park in North America, saw attendance increase 3.5%, to 2.9 million. No. 19 Great Adventure saw visitors increase 5% and push its total crowd to 2.8 million. Six Flags got some big help in Mexico as well, as Six Flags Mexico increased its number of visitors 1.7%, to 2.35 million thanks to its new Joker-themed ride.

Having three of the Top 20 water parks in North America during a rain-soaked summer didn't exactly hurt the cause, either. Still, despite all of its Warner Brothers and D.C. Comics tie-ins, Six Flags still has a long way to go if it wants to hang out in the top tier with the following chains ...



Universal Parks and Resorts

Locations: Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles; Universal Studios Orlando and Islands Of Adventure in Orlando, Fla.; Universal Studios Japan in Osaka; Universal Studios Singapore

Number of visitors in 2013: 36.4 million

Comcast-owned Universal has four of the Top 20 amusement parks in the world and three of the Top 10 in the U.S., but neither Universal Studios in Orlando (7 million visitors and 14% growth in 2013), its nearby Islands Of Adventure (8.1 million, 2% growth) or Universal Studios Hollywood (6.1 million, 4% growth) are any match for Osaka.

Universal Studios Japan is large beyond comprehension. It greeted 10.1 million visitors last year, increased foot traffic 2% from 2012 and was the only park in the global Top 10 not affiliated with a certain cartoon mouse. Orlando added a 3-D Transformers ride, tacked on an entire Springfield area dedicated to The Simpsons and grew a whopping 14% and still couldn't match Japan's enthusiasm. Osaka still hadn't received its version of Harry Potter's Wizarding World -- which just opened in Osaka this summer -- and it's still putting up huge numbers.

The scary part is that Universal isn't done. Its Singapore location just topped 3.6 million visitors and grew 5% with much of its most-awaited features still on the way. Meanwhile, Universal is planning locations in South Korea (2016), Beijing (2017) and Moscow (2018) and may yet revive a stalled project in Dubai. Considering two of the Top 15 amusement parks in the world are in South Korea (Lotte World and Everland, which took in 14.2 million visitors combined last year) and another two are in China (Ocean Park and Hong Kong Disneyland, with nearly 15 million visitors), this big-budget theme park chain is about to get even bigger.



Disney Parks

Locations: Disneyland and California Adventure in Anaheim, Calif.; Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.; Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Japan; Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallee, France; Hong Kong Disneyland; Disney Cruise Lines

Number of visitors in 2013: 132.5 million

Just look at that attendance figure. It's not only about four times as many people as Universal welcomed to its parks last year, but it's enough to make Disney Parks the 10th largest nation in the world -- just behind Russia (146 million) and ahead of Japan (127 million).

That's roughly 2% of the global population, and it's about to get a lot larger. Shanghai Disney is on track to open in 2015 and will be the second Disney Park in mainland China. The first, in Hong Kong, drew 7.4 million visitors last year and saw demand skyrocket 10.4% from 2012. Only Walt Disney Studios in the Disneyland Paris complex drew fewer visitors with 4.4 million in 2013.

Not that Disney's really hurting anywhere on the globe. Attendance dropped 7% at Disneyland Paris last year and it still managed to be the No. 6 theme park in the world with 11.2 million visitors. The Magic Kingdom in Orlando's Disney World increased admissions 6%, to 18.6 million people last year. That's more than double what the biggest park in the U.S. not owned by Disney -- Universal's Islands of Adventure with 8.1 million visitors -- was able to do during the same span. Its least-popular U.S. park, Disneyland's California Adventure Park (8.5 million visitors), still managed to outdraw any other non-Disney park in the country.

Even its unpopular Studios in Paris would be the biggest amusement park in the Six Flags or Cedar Fair portfolios if either had the great fortune of adding it. How do you compete with a foe of that size? You don't. You just try to be the closer, less expensive option.

Email Print Img No-img Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has stated that President Barack Obama should be impeached due to his handling of the most recent crisis on the United States' southern border.

In a column posted on Breitbart.com on Tuesday, Palin explained her reasons for wanting President Obama impeached.

""Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this. Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate,"" wrote Palin.

""Because of Obama's purposeful dereliction of duty an untold number of illegal immigrants will kick off their shoes and come on in, competing against Americans for our jobs and limited public services.""

Palin also wrote on the conservative website that she believes ""President Obama's rewarding of lawlessness, including his own, is the foundational problem here.""

""It's not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along, and, mark my words, will next meddle in the U.S. Court System,"" wrote Palin.

""It's time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment.""

Palin's comments come as the White House has asked Congress for an estimated $3.7 billion in emergency funds to help Central American minors who have crossed the border.

White House officials say the funds will be used to provide services to the minors, as well as build detention centers, provide immigration judges, and increase border security.

""President Obama has said he hopes such steps will speed deportations and discourage adults from sending children on a dangerous, sometimes deadly, trip north,"" reported The Washington Post.

""But GOP leaders, who have called on Obama to take stronger action, said they were reluctant to give the administration a 'blank check' without ­more-detailed plans to ensure that the money would help stem the crisis at the border.""

Obama has weathered demands for his impeachment in the past. In 2012, a petition at the ""We The People"" White House website called for Obama's removal from office.

Crafted by ""Stephen M."" and garnering over 49,000 signatories, the petition called for impeachment over claims that Obama declared war on Libya without congressional approval, forced ""Obamacare"" on Americans, his alleged disrespect for the Constitution, and appointing ""agency 'czars' without Senate approval.""

The White House replied, saying Obama did not officially declare war in Libya, the Affordable Care Act was declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the president does respect the Constitution. Regarding the ""czars"" claim, the White House wrote that ""many of those who have been called 'czars' have in fact been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as prescribed by federal law, and others hold policy jobs that have existed in Administrations stretching back decades.""

""So the short answer is that we won't be calling for the President's impeachment — and given the fact that you made your appeal to the White House itself, we doubt you were holding your breath waiting for our support,"" wrote the White House.
