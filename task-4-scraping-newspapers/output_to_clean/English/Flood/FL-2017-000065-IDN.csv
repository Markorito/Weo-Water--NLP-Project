Flooding has hit several areas of North Kayong regency in West Kalimantan following heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday. The city of Sukadana was the worst affected area with hundreds of homes as well dozens of public buildings including offices and schools inundated up to 1 meter in depth.

The boxing gym of former world lightweight champion Daud “Cino” Yordan was also forced to close because of the flooding, reported to be the most severe in the past 10 years.

“Many of our facilities and boxing equipment are damaged,” Damianus Yordan, Cino’s brother, told The Jakarta Post.

He added that some amateur boxers were training there for the upcoming West Kalimantan student sports week but they might not be able to resume training for several days.

A resident, Rafael Ase, whose house was inundated, said that locals were in fear because the flood waters carried scorpions and other dangerous creatures.

Rafael, who is also a high school teacher, said that schools in Sukadana had suspended lessons as a result of the floods.

More than 1,000 Indonesian Military (TNI) and National Police personnel taking part in Operation Tinombala in Poso, Central Sulawesi, will be deployed to help earthquake victims in Napu, North Lore district, Poso.

“The TNI is set to deploy 500 territorial operation personnel, while more than 500 others are TNI and National Police members who are part of the Operation Tinombala task force,” said Maj.Dedy Afrizal, the 132 Military Regional Command (Korem)/Tadulako spokesperson as quoted by Antara in Poso, on Thursday.

Part of the territorial operation team is scheduled to be dispatched to Poso by land on Friday while others will be deployed via helicopter. The police and military personnel will support the emergency response operation to help victims of a 6.6 Ritcher scale earthquake that occurred on May 29.

The Operation Tinombala task force is a joint TNI-National Police team established to hunt down the remaining members of the East Indonesia Mujahidin (MIT) terror group.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the emergency response operation was still under way.

Poso Regent Darmin Agustinus Sigilipu announced a seven-day emergency response period from May 30 to June 5 to facilitate people’s access to emergency treatment.

Four people sustained serious injuries during the earthquake, while 21 others sustained minor wounds. No deaths were reported.

The earthquake damaged 348 buildings, 168 out of which were residential homes. The earthquake also damaged churches, mosques, schools and offices. Meanwhile, 328 families have been evacuated from their homes.

Although they were allowed broad leverage to organize and demonstrate across Indonesia in the past year, an effort to replicate their success outside Jakarta fell flat, and the government has taken measures to hamper two major hard-line groups.

And a new survey suggests most Indonesians don’t know about some major Islamist groups, much less support them, both domestic ones and global organizations like the so-called Islamic State (IS).

Leader of Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Habib Rizi Leader of Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Habib Rizieq (center) talks to reporters at a court after the blasphemy trial of Jakarta's incumbent governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as Ahok, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Feb. 28, 2017. Leader of Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Habib Rizieq (center) talks to reporters at a court after the blasphemy trial of Jakarta's incumbent governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as Ahok, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Feb. 28, 2017.

?Federal crackdown

Indonesia’s government has taken a pointed stand against the Islamic Defenders’ Front (FPI), the hard-line group that organized last year’s anti-Ahok rallies and acts as Indonesia’s unofficial moral police by helping activities like recent anti-gay raids.

Jakarta police issued a warrant for the arrest of FPI leader Habib Rizieq Shihab, who is in Saudi Arabia, on a pornography charge linked to his sexting scandal with a female social activist.

Beyond FPI, Indonesian Security Minister Wiranto also announced that the state would ban the radical Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) because its goals run counter to the pluralistic state ideology known as Pancasila. After Wiranto’s announcement, Indonesia President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo repeated a promise to “clobber” radical groups that threaten Pancasila.

“The crackdown on Rizieq Shihab and Hizbut Tahrir … looks to me like a response from the government to the anti-Ahok mobilization,” said William Liddle, an Indonesian politics scholar at Ohio State University. Ahok was the Chinese Christian Jakarta governor who was the target of Islamist protests late last year, which played a role in his resounding defeat in his re-election bid last month.

The next Jakarta governor, Anies Baswedan, openly allied with FPI in his campaign, which seemed to give the group a newfound legitimacy. But FPI’s mandate may be narrowing. When FPI tried to organize a similar demonstration against the Christian governor of West Kalimantan, Cornelis, who vowed to ban extremists from his province, the result was anticlimactic, with just a few thousand people in attendance.

One reason is that FPI was up against a more formidable enemy than Chinese Indonesians, a long downtrodden minority; Cornelis is an indigenous Dayak person, a group with a history of using lethal violence in sectarian conflict.

So hard-line groups such as FPI are by no means all-powerful, or even broadly effective outside the specific Jakarta election context.

“The cynical support of secular elites was key to mobilizing opposition to Ahok. Without that support, FPI struggled,” said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute.

Indonesian attitudes on Islamist groups

A recent poll on extremist groups from the Jakarta-based Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting found that more than 66 percent of the 1,350 adults polled nationwide had heard of IS. Of the 66.4 percent who had heard of IS, 90 percent viewed IS as a threat to the country and even more, 92.9 percent, favored banning the group in Indonesia, according to the May 14-20 survey.

Two years ago, a Pew Research Center poll found 79 percent of Indonesians had unfavorable opinions of IS, and only 4 percent favored the group. That survey was conducted in 11 countries with significant Muslim populations, including several in the Middle East and Africa.

The new survey, however, showed that 10 percent of those who had heard of IS do not see IS as a threat to Indonesia, and many have never heard of the group.

So aside from hard-line groups, it remains to be seen exactly where Indonesians, who are 87 percent Muslim, stand on Islamist politics and Muslim leadership.

Last year, researchers Elizabeth Pisani and Michael Buehler analyzed the roughly 440 sharia-inspired bylaws across Indonesia, and found that Islamic legislation did not translate into re-election votes for the politicians that advocated them.

Extremism threat still small

Beyond perceptions of extremism, the threat of actual violent extremism in Indonesia remains low. There was a suicide bombing in an East Jakarta train station last month that killed three police officers, but it was perhaps most notable for the fact that it caused fatalities.

The current generation of Indonesian terrorists are neither many nor effective: three recent suicide attacks resulted in only the death of the bomber, according to a 2016 report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Indonesia also has a famously capable counterterrorism program, particularly the elite Detachment 88 squad formed after the 2002 Bali bombings.

Indonesian militants today largely “lack the capacity” to inflict much damage, said Nava Nuraniyah, of the Institute for Policy Analysis and Conflict. “Unlike the [Al Qaeda affiliated] Jemaah Islamiyah generation, they were never trained abroad … learning bomb making from the internet could only take them so far.”

It was the weekend Zoar celebrated the opening of its new art museum, and the dedication of the town as a National Historic Landmark.

Before the crowds could arrive though, the 77-year-old mayor had to clear some debris from the roads. That's actually pretty fitting for the leader of Zoar, a village that - from its founding through the end of the 19th century - operated as a communal society.

“There’s still only about 175 people here,"" Gordon says. ""Not that you don’t still get some complaints.”

Founded In Famine

Zoar was founded 200 years ago this year, when 150 members of The Society of Separatists of Zoar settled on a parcel of land in northeast Ohio. A German religious sect that had broken off from the Lutheran Church, the Zoarites were pushed to the bottom of society as Napoleon began to invade Germany in the early 1800s - in large part because of their nonviolent beliefs.

In 1817, Gordon says, the Zoarites fled their swamp town for the United States, where a group of Quakers took them in and sold them land. They came at a daunting moment: A volcanic explosion in Indonesia, two years earlier, had kicked off a global famine.

Due to a lack of sunlight and a drop in temperatures worldwide, crops were difficult to harvest.

“They were in like a survival mode when they came here, and they decided the only way they could survive was pull their resources and become a communal society,"" Gordon says.

Under the rules of the commune, Zoarites wouldn't have money or personal property; rather, Gordon says, all the crops and goods produced by the town would be distributed evenly among families.

(These rules were eventually affirmed by no other than the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1853 in favor of the town against a family that wanted to leave the commune and cash out their shares.)

The structures of the commune are still visible in the town today. Walking around the small village, Gordon points out numbers on each house. Those numbers were assigned to residents for the purposes of collecting produce and products.

Luckily, Gordon says, the Zoarites were skilled laborers.

“My ancestors - I'm a descendant actually - my ancestors ran the woolen mill. Kappel was their name,"" Gordon says. ""And on the other side, the Sturm side, he was a wagon maker.”

Zoar eventually established flour mills, cider mills and breweries. But the turning point for the young society, Gordon says, was the construction of the Ohio and Erie Canals.

When the canal was being built in 1825, the entire society pitched in - digging up seven miles of land and using the money to pay off debt and buy more land. Another wave of society members joined in the 1830s. From then, Zoar was self-sufficient. The town calls itself one of the country's most successful communal societies.

The canal allowed the technologically advanced town to ship things like fruit and grain to Canton, Akron and up to Cleveland. At its peak, Zoar boasted some 300 residents.

""They had all their needs taken care of,"" Gordon claims. ""Not too many complaints.""

Credit Gabe Rosenberg / Celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, Zoar Village only has about 175 residents.

Turning Outward

When Zoar established itself, Joseph Bimeler was its charismatic leader. Bimeler directed the town's religious pursuits as well as its industrial ones, giving dissertations from his home that he claimed were related directly from God.

Bimeler died in 1853, and for the most part, the church died with him. Over the years, the Zoar Church integrated itself into existing congregations, eventually becoming a United Church of Christ.

Though the town trustees continued to keep the society alive for almost half a century longer, Gordon says that no one could lead like Bimeler. After the Cleveland, Tuscawaras Valley and Wheeling Railway arrived in 1875 - flooding the town with summer tourists - Gordon says villagers really began to ""grumble.""

""It changed Zoar - whether good or bad - but nevertheless it did change,"" Gordon says.

With ample opportunities for work and leisure in the surrounding areas, villagers no longer needed or wanted the seclusion of Zoar. So the town trustees decided to dissolve the commune, divvying up the property equally to all residents and auctioning off livestock.

The town continued pretty much as normal after that - until about one decade ago.

Near Destruction

Walking around Zoar Village, it's hard not to see the levee. It looks like a large, grassy hill curling all the way around the town.

Credit Gabe Rosenberg / Zoar Levee was built in 1937 to protect the village from water impounded upstream of Dover Dam.

Zoar sits within what the Army Corps of Engineers calls a ""flowage easement."" When the Army Corps constructed nearby Dover Dam and other projects in the 1930s, the government maintained the right to impound water upstream in these flowage easements.

In most cases, the government bought and moved communities that fell within these zones. But Ohio wanted to preserve Zoar, so it constructed a levee around it.

“In Zoar’s instance, what we know is that it was chosen for a levee because of the cultural and historical value it could provide the region,"" says Aaron Smith, a senior project manager for the Army Corps.

Smith oversees projects in Ohio, West Virginia and other states. He says it's pretty normal for Dover Dam to push water to its flowage easements, and almost always Zoar Levee stops the water there.

Credit Army Corps of Engineers / An aerial view of the Zoar Levee, including where an emergency rock blanket was added in 2008.

But in 2005, a huge rain storm and large snow melt pushed a record amount of water against that levee, for a duration it had never seen before. The levee had to hold back another large amount of water in 2008.

Both times, the water started leaking through, underneath the ground.

“We saw concern that the foundation under the levee might be eroding,"" Smith says.

That was cause for panic in the town.

“There was an emergency situation here that the levee could possibly breach,"" Gordon recalls. ""And if the levee breached, it would flood the whole village.”

Villagers were on 24/7 evacuation notice in case the levee failed. Gordon says residents had to make a list of the stuff they would take with them and what they'd leave behind.

The Army Corps, at the cost of $1.9 million, worked around the clock to put in place a rock blanket on the knoll, which would stabilize the levee.

While the Army Corps undertook a risk assessment for the levee, they was forced to consider alternatives to repairs, including moving the village or destroying it entirely. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named Zoar as one of the country's most endangered historic places in 2012.

Luckily, Smith says, the situation turned out to not be so dire.

Smith says the Army Corps study found the levee's condition wasn't as dangerous as previously thought, and lowered the urgency of the project. Already they've installed $7 million worth of relief wells along the levee, which will reduce pressure, and added another station to pump water back over.

Credit Gabe Rosenberg / Aaron Smith of the Army Corps of Engineers stand in front of Zoar Levee and two of the newly-constructed relief wells. He's overseeing the $8 million project to permanently secure the levee's safety.

Now, Smith says they're beginning to budget for a longer-term fix that would add a filter and armor underneath the ground, preventing soil erosion. Provided their $8 million proposal is approved for the 2019 fiscal year, Smith estimates the project will take about two years to design and a year and a half to build.

“Really, from a visual standpoint, when everything’s said and done, you won’t see much,"" Smith says. ""It will be an unexciting project to ribbon-cut, other than we’ve reduced some significant risks.”

A Complete Circle

Inside Zoar's old sewing house, built sometime in the 1840s, Nancy Gordon Wyatt is preheating an oven and boiling a pot of lye.

She's making the famous Zoar Pretzels.

""My recipe came from my great-great-grandmother,"" Wyatt tells me, ""and she passed it along to her daughter, then her daughter, then her daughter, then me.""

Wyatt is the sister of Scott Gordon, and like him was raised just outside Zoar Village. She says these pretzels - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - come from the Württemberg area of Germany, the same region as the Zoarites.

Though her mother kneaded the dough by hand - exactly 621 times - Wyatt uses a KitchenAid mixer, before letting the dough rise twice. The actual cooking is a delicate dance: A few seconds in the lye bath, onto the tray, sprinkled with sea salt, then into the oven, and out after just a few minutes.

Credit Gabe Rosenberg / Nancy Gordon Wyatt holds up a freshly-baked Zoar Pretzel, which she says comes from a recipe passed down from her great-great-grandmother.

It takes her three hours to make 32 pretzels, which is why she only bakes them now for special events, like that night's museum opening.

Between batches, Wyatt tells me she's seen a resurgence in interest in Zoar since the levee made national news. And just last year, the town - with the help of the Ohio History Connection and the Army Corps survey - won the designation of a National Historic Landmark.

Baking the Zoar Pretzels, she says, is her own contribution to preserving the town's legacy.

As Zoar celebrates its bicentennial, she tells me that feels like a complete circle.

“When you’re a part of Zoar, and know the history, you want to pass it on,"" Wyatt says. ""So hopefully, after I stop baking, maybe somebody else will take my place.”","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/96ac385/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3872x2033+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwosu2%2Ffiles%2F201705%2FZoar-1.jpg,"['water', 'village', 'centuries', 'society', 'floods', 'smith', 'founding', 'town', 'survives', 'gordon', 'army', 'corps', 'zoar', 'levee']",

Fragile states that are poor and depend heavily on agriculture are most at risk of violent uprisings since they struggle to cope with climate change, according to a study published this week in the Journal of Peace Research.

“We’ve already started to see climate change as an issue that won’t just put the coasts under water, but as something that could cause food riots in some parts of the world,” said study co-author Bear Braumoeller from The Ohio State University.

The last time the world saw a severe food crisis was in 2007 and 2008, when extreme weather events hit major grain producing regions the year earlier, causing spikes in the demand and cost of food.

The higher prices led to social and political unrest in Morocco, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Indonesia, according to a 2016 report by Global Footprint Network and United Nations Environment Programme.

Drought is becoming more frequent and severe in places like eastern and southern Africa, and that – combined with the recent El Nino phenomenon – is taking a heavy toll on rural lives and economies.

Last April, a rice farmer in the Philippines was killed during protests demanding government assistance after drought linked by some to El Nino hit hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland.

El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, is linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.

Moreover, the US-based Center for Climate and Security on Friday said factors like global water shortages, displacement or migration caused by climate change, and rising sea levels also posed serious threats to international security.

Braumoeller said having a stable government was key to placating growing civil unrest and violence in the face of food shortages caused by climate change.

“A capable government is even more important to keeping the peace than good weather,” he said in a statement. “Less vulnerable countries can better handle the problems that droughts or food price fluctuations create.”

Braumoeller said fragile states needed to address instability and invest in sustainable, “greener” industries to increase their economic growth, in order to cope with food shortages due to climate change.

""Development aid is important now and it is likely to be even more important in the future as we look for ways to increase climate resilience,"" he said.

Greenpeace Indonesia has staged a protest in front of the US embassy in Jakarta over the decision of President Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change.

“President Trump looks likely to turn away from the impact of climate change with millions of people falling victim of natural disasters such as flooding, drought and extreme weather which have hit many countries including Indonesia,” climate and energy spokesman of Greenpeace Indonesia Didit Haryo said.

The protest was carried out on Wednesday.

Didit said the United States was the second largest contributor to gas emissions after China, adding industries in United States were even the largest emitters from the 1850s or the era of Industrial Revolution until 2010.

The United States would play a serious role hampering the global efforts to check rising global heat, he said, adding the policy of Trump reflected not what happened in US cities.

“The steps taken by Trump would not halt serious commitments by world leaders. Now it is important to implement the commitments especially in energy sector,” he said.

Indonesia also has pledged to maintain its commitment.

However, expansion had continued in coal mining and use that would make it difficult for the Indonesia government to fully implement its commitment to Paris agreement, he said.

China has proved its transitional commitment by building solar power plants with a capacity of 43,000 megawatt (MW) until 2016 and cancelled plan to build 104 coal fired power plants with a total capacity of 120,000 MW.

“There should be no debate over the capability of renewable energy to meet our requirement.

The initiative comes as the country is grappling with the worsening impacts of climate change, such as frequent flooding and recurring drought.

More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, and the United Nations projects that share will rise to 66 percent by 2050, with close to 90 percent of the increase taking place in urban areas of Africa and Asia.

While this growth will globally create wealth and reduce poverty, analysts say many cities are increasingly vulnerable to flooding, putting lives and property at risk.

Threatened by flooding

In East Africa, Tanzania is bearing the heaviest burden of flooding, which threatens infrastructure assets worth $5.3 billion in Dar es Salaam, the World Bank said at the launch of Tanzania’s urban program Wednesday.

Home to more than 4.5 million people, the nation’s commercial capital is vulnerable to flooding, which cripples the ability of poorer city residents to access clean water and better sanitation, officials said.

The new initiative, a collaboration between Britain’s Department for International Development, the World Bank and the Tanzanian government, aims to find ways to cushion people from weather-related disasters, such as identifying flood-prone areas and drawing up preparedness plans.

Moses Msuya, director of the disaster management department in the Prime Minister’s Office, said the program includes strategic actions, such as installing early warning systems, to boost Tanzania’s ability to respond to disasters and help people recover rapidly.

“Let us make good use of every opportunity to make our cities more resilient for people now and for our children’s future,” he said.

According to Msuya, many Tanzanian cities are at risk of flooding because of poor infrastructure, including a lack of storm drainage canals.

“Rapid urbanization is increasing our vulnerability to climate-related risks. Our cities have undergone massive spatial expansion with the majority of residents living in unplanned settlements,” he said.

According to the World Bank, the program will use scientific methods to evaluate risks, and install early warning and monitoring equipment to prepare vulnerable communities for emergencies.

“No disaster is entirely natural,” said Edward Anderson, a disaster risk management specialist with the World Bank. “Disaster itself is often a failure in development planning.”

Teaching resilience

As part of its strategy, the government will develop a “Resilience Academy,” in which the concept of resilience will be taught at university level to help younger generations tackle natural disasters and other threats, officials said.

Osiligi Lossai, local ward official for the Tandale neighborhood of Dar es Salaam, said flood risks are more severe in crowded slum areas like his.

“My people have suffered a lot, and they keep incurring huge losses every single year,” he said.

According to a recent World Bank report on greening Africa’s cities, protecting fast-degrading environments in growing cities like Dar es Salaam can make them more liveable, and help them cope with extreme weather.

“Restoring forest areas and rehabilitating river systems could alleviate urban flooding problems, and make cities more pleasant and productive places to live,” Bella Bird, the World Bank’s country director for Tanzania, told the urban program launch.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/6905F58D-FF5E-45A1-B4D0-6D2BF96A8512.jpg,"['climate', 'program', 'cities', 'change', 'areas', 'flooding', 'disaster', 'urban', 'vulnerable', 'worsening', 'bank', 'prepares', 'effects', 'tanzania', 'world']",

13,13,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Chad is the country most vulnerable to climate change – here's why - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/chad-is-the-country-most-vulnerable-to-climate-change-heres-why-78423,"Of the 186 countries assessed in a recent survey of climate vulnerability, Chad was rated most in peril. A combination of high poverty, frequent conflicts, and the risk of both droughts and floods means the central African nation is bottom of the list, just below Bangladesh and some way behind Norway, the country least vulnerable to climate change.

So why Chad? For a start, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. Around 87% of Chadians are classified as poor, according to the Multidimentional Poverty Index, which factors in health, education and living standards. That’s the fourth highest rate in the world. The percentage who are “destitute” (63%), the most extreme category of poverty, is also the fourth highest in the world.

This is exacerbated by the fact that the country has been in civil war or conflict for 35 out of the 57 years since it gained independence from France.

Any poor or conflict-prone country will always be vulnerable, but Chad’s geography means climate change is a particular risk. Chad is bigger than many Westerners may realise. At 1.28m km² it’s larger than Nigeria and twice the size of Texas. Around 90% of its 10m people live in the southern half of the country, as most of the northern half extends well into the Sahara desert.

Most Chadians base their livelihoods on subsistence farming and livestock rearing. The semi-arid rangelands of the Sahel, in the north of the country, provide pasture for livestock during the rainy season, while the fertile agricultural fields in the south produce most of the cash and food crops. When the dry season begins, pastoralists move their herds south to feed on the leftovers of the agricultural harvest.

Chad’s changing climate

Since the mid-20th century, temperatures in Chad have been increasing while rainfall is decreasing. Ninety percent of the country’s largest lake, Lake Chad, has disappeared over the past 50 years due to a combination of droughts and increasing withdrawals for irrigation. Climate studies project things will get increasingly hot and arid throughout the 21st century, which means lower crop yields, worse pasture, and a harder life for anyone dependent on Lake Chad.

Philippe Rekacewicz, Le Monde diplomatique, February 2008

Rural areas are most at risk from climate change because that’s where most of the population, and most of the poverty, is found. However, urban areas are not safe either, as the country’s growing cities struggle to accommodate the arrival of new residents. Sanitation services like sewage, storm water drainage and waste collection are poor, according to the World Bank. In the event of floods, as happened in 2010, 2011 and 2012, the infrastructure cannot cope and untreated sewage could infect the water supply, creating a high risk of infectious diseases such as cholera.

Demographic challenges

Chad’s population is mostly young, and high youth unemployment has already caused unrest in the capital N'djamena. Vulnerability to climate is made worse by civil unrest or conflict because people cannot receive the help they need during climate-related disasters such as droughts or floods.

Chad also hosts some 300,000 refugees from Darfur on its eastern border with Sudan, according to UN figures, while an additional 67,000 refugees from the Central African Republic are in camps on its southern border. These refugees consume Chad’s limited resources and sometimes compete with the local population. This creates resentment and sometimes violence between the refugees and their hosts.

To make matters worse, the Boko Haram crisis in northeastern Nigeria has spilled over to the Lac region of Chad, which now has more than 60,000 displaced people registered there and several thousand more that are unregistered. This is worrying as the country’s unemployed youth, restless and with plenty of time on their hands, could be at risk of recruitment and radicalisation by Boko Haram.

The way forward

Despite these challenges, there are ways to mitigate the effect of climate change. For instance, farmers in Chad’s semi-arid Sahelian zone have been using an indigenous rainwater harvesting technique called Zaï to successfully grow crops. Zaï involves the digging of small pits and sowing crops in them. The pits retain water for a long period of time and are particularly efficient when there isn’t much rain.

The Zaï technique was enhanced by introducing manure and compost into the pits to provide nutrients to the crops. This helped rehabilitate soils that are heavily degraded and significantly increased the yields of food crops.

Agroforestry, the combining of crops and trees in the same patch of land, can also help mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Tree roots stabilise soils and protect them from eroding during heavy rainfall, while also restoring fertility simply by producing litter which eventually makes its way back into the earth.

Of course, any country would be better placed to deal with climate change if it simply became much wealthier. Chad began producing petroleum in 2003, and it now accounts for 93% of all exports. However, this left the country vulnerable to declines in oil prices. So, when the price did indeed crash in late 2014, Chad suffered a significant loss of revenue. Needless to say, the impact of climate-related disasters such as droughts or floods becomes magnified if the country does not have the resources to combat them.

Chad cannot rely on oil forever. Farming is still the mainstay of its economy and, in the longer term, developing sustainable agriculture and livestock farming will be key in providing employment and maintaining food security.","Thu, 08 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/172291/original/file-20170605-16888-1v7xt5o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C306%2C2048%2C993&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['heres', 'climate', 'change', 'refugees', 'poverty', 'country', 'risk', 'chad', 'vulnerable', 'droughts', 'zaï', 'crops']", 
14,14,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Sixty per cent of shipwreck HMAS Perth gone after illegal scrap metal salvaging - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/93368226/sixty-per-cent-of-shipwreck-hmas-perth-gone-after-illegal-scrap-metal-salvaging,"HMAS Perth, which was sunk by the Japanese in 1942.

A team of Indonesian and Australian divers has made the shocking discovery that 60 per cent of World War II shipwreck HMAS Perth has vanished, with evidence of large-scale illegal salvaging for scrap metal at the site off the coast of Java.

""This isn't what we were hoping to find,"" said Australian National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption.

""It is with profound regret we advise that our joint maritime archaeologist diving team has discovered sections of the Perth missing.""

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL MARITIME MUSEUM Shinatria Adhityatama, from the National Research Centre of Archeology Indonesia, inspects a chain hoist at the shipwreck site. The hoist is evidence of salvage activities.

Sumption said interim reports after a research dive conducted on May 14 to 17 and an earlier remote sensing survey indicated only about 40 per cent of HMAS Perth remained.

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL MARITIME MUSEUM Divers inspect the HMAS Perth, which was sunk during the Battle of Sunda Strait during WWII.

One of Australia's most loved warships, HMAS Perth was sunk by the Japanese in the Battle of Sunda Strait 75 years ago.

""While some damage is a result of the Japanese torpedo strikes that sank the vessel in 1942 and the expected degradation of the site over the last 75 years, there are signs the removal of this material is a result of salvage, with some salvage equipment visible around the site,"" Sumption said.

Naval shipwrecks have huge amounts of scrap metal with an extremely high resale value – the phosphor bronze used in ships' propellers for example is valued at about $4000 a tonne.

HMAS Perth is not the only shipwreck around Indonesia to be torn apart for scrap – the sheer size of the archipelago means the constant policing of its waters is nigh on impossible.

Revelations last year that three Dutch ships sunk during the 1942 Battle of the Java Sea had vanished in their entirety prompted outrage in the Netherlands.

The scale of the underwater looting suggests a brazen and large-scale commercial salvaging enterprise.

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL MARITIME MUSEUM The only remaining steam turbine of four originally mounted on HMAS Perth.

The HMAS Perth helped evacuate Allied troops from Greece, fought against Vichy France forces in Syria and lost 13 men in the Battle of Crete.

It and the American heavy cruiser USS Houston were the only large Allied ships to survive the Battle of the Java Sea, but both were sunk by the Imperial Japanese Army after a fierce battle that began on February 28, 1942.

More than 350 navy personnel and civilians from HMAS Perth died in the Battle of Sunda Strait. Another 328 escaped with their lives but more than 100 later died as prisoners of war after they were taken captive by the Japanese.

Frank McGovern, one of only two survivors still alive, was a gunner on HMAS Perth.

Now 97, McGovern said he had been aware of some illegal operations at the site, about six kilometres to the north of St Nicholas Point off the northwest tip of Java, but hadn't expected the magnitude of the loss.

""That's sad news all right,"" he said.

McGovern said some of the hatches between compartments on HMAS Perth had been jammed by the torpedo explosions 75 years ago.

""Fellows were not able to get out and they were trapped down there, unfortunately,"" he said.

""Their remains would still be down there.""

For this reason, he said, he would like HMAS Perth to be declared a war grave. (The Commonwealth War Graves Commission does not consider a shipwreck to be a war grave.)

When Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Australia earlier this year, he and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull issued a statement which noted the 75th anniversary of the loss of the Perth.

It reiterated the countries' commitment to working together to strengthen co-operation in the areas of maritime cultural heritage.

Sumption said the Australian National Maritime Museum remained committed to working with the National Research Centre of Archeology Indonesia (ARKENAS) to protect what remained of the shipwreck.

""As the site lies in Indonesian territorial waters, it is important that we continue to work in close partnership with our Indonesian colleagues,"" he said.

ARKENAS director I Made Geria said the centre would continue to try to secure formal protection of the site and develop knowledge for the management of underwater cultural heritage in Indonesia.

The information from the research dive will be used to prepare a case for declaration under the appropriate legislation in Indonesia.","Tue, 06 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/j/l/8/4/e/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1jl7du.png/1496704845449.jpg,"['cent', 'site', 'war', 'national', 'perth', 'shipwreck', 'museum', 'gone', 'salvaging', 'sunk', 'maritime', 'battle', 'illegal', 'scrap', 'hmas', 'metal']",

20,20,FF-2019-000029-IDN,108 Indonesians living in Sarangani province 'no longer stateless' - Minda News,https://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2017/06/108-indonesians-living-in-sarangani-province-no-longer-stateless/,"GENERAL SANTOS CITY (MindaNews/06 June) – At least 108 Persons of Indonesian Descent (PIDs) living in Glan, Sarangani for years are no longer “stateless” after they were finally registered, an official said Tuesday.

Lawyer Ruben Fondevilla, Department of Justice assistant chief state counsel, said the Indonesians received their birth certificates in line with the provisions of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Fondevilla said the registration of the Indonesians is an offshoot of a bilateral cooperation between the Philippines and Indonesia.

“The ministers of these countries believed the “importance of determining the legal status of the Indonesian descendants in Southern Philippines with the view of providing them better legal protection,” he said.

By receiving their free birth certificates and having their citizenship confirmed by representatives from the Governments of the Philippines and Indonesia, the PIDs will finally be able to enjoy the full extent of their rights, Fondevilla explained.

With the global mandate of reducing statelessness worldwide, the UNHCR has partnered with the Philippine Government since 2010 to “promote as well as develop standards and operational responses in addressing the situation faced by stateless persons and people at risk of statelessness in the Philippines.”

The registration and distribution of birth certificates in Glan last week was the first of the series of distributions expected in areas in Mindanao where there are known Indonesian populations like Cotabato, Davao and Balut Island in Sarangani town, Davao Occidental.

Fondevilla stressed this initiative would provide PIDs with “legal protection” and eventually enable them to “access the basic services that will be provided by the government.”

With over 2,400 PIDs registered in Glan, the municipality has one of the largest populations of PIDs in the country, according to the UNHCR in a media advisory.

“Glan and the Northern Sulawesi province of Indonesia are separated by 200 kilometres of sea travel, and migration between the two islands is not uncommon,” the UNHCR said. “However, because of the unfamiliarity with citizenship laws of the Philippines and Indonesia, as well as limited access to information about their rights, most of these PIDs are exposed to the risk of statelessness.”

The UNHCR said “civil registration is one way by which statelessness can be reduced.”

The Philippines is a signatory to the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. It is also the first Southeast Asian country to adopt international legal standard to keep stateless persons from falling into legal limbo. Since 2011, it has been working together with the Government of Indonesia and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, in bringing legal protection to over 8,000 PIDs in Mindanao island.

In 2016, Glan Mayor Victor James Yap Sr. approved a Sangguniang Bayan resolution exempting PIDs from payment of civil registration fees, late registration of birth, and clerical correction of entries in civil registration documents that benefited PIDs who were not able to secure the document due to financial constraints, according to the Provincial Information Office.

This programme is also in partnership with the Bureau of Immigration, National Statistics Office, Local Civil Registrar, and the Public Attorney’s Office. (Bong S. Sarmiento/MindaNews)

* New bill would cut back health warnings on packs

* It would allow cigarettes to be sold near schools: official

* Bill mainly aims to grow tobacco output

* President Joko Widodo has yet to decide about bill

A proposed Indonesian tobacco law will roll back regulations to discourage smoking in a country that already has one of the highest smoking rates in the world and open the floodgates to advertising aimed at teenagers, a health ministry official said.

If the bill initiated by the parliament is passed, companies will no longer have to put grim pictures on cigarette packs of lung cancer or other diseases linked to smoking, said Mohammad Subuh, director-general of disease prevention and control at the health ministry.

Under existing regulations, 40 percent of the front and back of a cigarette pack must contain a ‘health warning’ in the form of pictures and text.

Under the tobacco bill, reviewed by Reuters, cigarette packs would not be required to have a specific portion dedicated to health-related pictures. Cigarette businesses that put up advertisements, either in electronic, printed or outdoor media, do have to include a health warning that is ‘written with clear alphabets, easily read and proportionate.’

School and playground areas would be designated as ‘no- cigarette-smoke zones’ instead of ‘no-cigarette zones’, which would allow cigarettes to be sold or displayed there, Subuh said.

‘Indonesia is the most liberal country for the tobacco industry,’ said Subuh, who oversees the health ministry's tobacco control efforts.

‘Let's not open again the opportunities for the industry to lure teenagers to party with cigarettes. It's like jumping from a helicopter without a parachute,’ he said in an interview.

OUTPUT INCREASE

Last year, 54.8 percent of males between 15 and 19 years old were smokers in Indonesia, more than double the percentage of smokers in 2001, according to the health ministry. The price of a pack of cigarettes in Indonesia can be less than $2.

A shocking video of a toddler reportedly puffing up to 40 cigarettes a day on the island of Sumatra went viral around seven years ago, firing up anti-tobacco activists who said it underscored the problem of underage smoking in Indonesia.

‘Indonesia is terrifying because it has among the most baby smokers in the world. From elementary school until high school, the smoking rate is also one of the highest,’ the health ministry's Subuh said.

Indonesia is the only country in the Asia-Pacific region that has yet to ratify or be a party to the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which seeks to protect against the harmful consequences of smoking.

The tobacco bill mainly aims to sharply increase cigarette output in Indonesia, already the world's fourth-biggest producer, at a time when other Asian countries are taking measures to curb smoking.

Proponents of the bill say it would safeguard a vital economic sector that employs millions of people and contributes nearly 10 percent of state revenues.

‘We don't mind some regulations, as long as they are not excessive,’ said Abdus Setiawan, a board member at the Indonesia Tobacco Growers' Association. Setiawan said he already considers emblazoning cigarette packs with the message that ‘smoking kills’ to be ‘excessive.’

To become law in Indonesia, the tobacco bill has to be agreed between the government and the parliament. President Joko Widodo agreed in March to start discussions on the bill with the parliament, but it is unclear when the president will make a decision.

$17 BILLION INDUSTRY

Indonesia, a country of 250 million and the biggest economy in Southeast Asia, is attractive for major cigarette companies at a time when growth is slowing in more developed markets.

Indonesia produced 269.2 billion cigarettes in 2015, while the total market was valued at 231.3 trillion rupiah ($17.3 billion), according to research firm Euromonitor International.

Philip Morris International Inc and British American Tobacco PLC have controlling stakes in local cigarette makers PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk and PT Bentoel Internasional Investama Tbk, respectively.

Other major domestic players include PT Gudang Garam Tbk and privately held Djarum Group.

Regulations for the industry have been poorly enforced and some companies target young Indonesians with new products such as fruit-flavored cigarettes or clever advertising, activists say.

‘A lot of advertisements here send the message that if you don't smoke, you're not macho, you're not cool,’ Muhammad Khanavi, a 14-year-old student, said on the sidelines of an anti-smoking event to mark World No Tobacco Day on Wednesday.","Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/620171122333657786180.jpg,"['tap', 'cigarettes', 'world', 'open', 'indonesia', 'ads', 'subuh', 'tobacco', 'packs', 'official', 'aimed', 'cigarette', 'kids', 'smoking', 'bill', 'health']",

By Mattias Söderberg

On Friday, faith leaders from some of the biggest religions in the world met and agreed on a joint statement to G7 environment ministers, who meet in Italy this weekend.

The statement – agreed by Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists – was formulated as a charter of values and actions, a message based on the belief that the world – nature, and the environment – is wonderful, and that we have a moral obligation to care for this miracle – the creation.

Each religion framed the concern in its own way, but each had the same message. We have the responsibility to take action, and to transform our way of life into a sustainable development path.

“We, as faith leaders and faith-based organisations, stand in solidarity with people and communities all over the world who are affected by the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation and commit to galvanising greater awareness and action that promotes more sustainable consumption and lifestyles and protects our natural environment, both on land and water,” say faith leaders in the joint statement.

When faith leaders talk about the world they do not focus on countries as such. When the world was created, there were no borders. And climate change knows no borders. Droughts and floods do not stop to clear customs, and the long term effects will fuel conflicts and migration with implications far beyond the borders of individual countries.

At the same time, all global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced. But this can only be achieved if all countries and all people engage. All countries must embrace a green and sustainable development paradigm, ensuring a resilient future for all people in the world.

So why was a call directed to the G7? All countries are important, but rich countries have special responsibilities for two reasons. First, they have a historic responsibility, linked to their large carbon emissions for decades, contributing to global warming. And second, because of their capacity to actually make a difference. A green transformation will not come by itself. It will be a result of innovation, technology development, and changes in our current development paradigm.

The G7 constitutes a group of countries with big responsibility, and big capacity. They can, and should, drive the transformation towards a green and sustainable future.

However, at this time, the G7 is not only a platform for discussion about development. This time the G7 meeting may also be a battlefield in a growing conflict between the current US government, and the other G7 countries.

The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, Scott Pruitt, will face his first international diplomatic challenge since president Donald Trump announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement.

When the G7 leaders recently met in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, climate change was also on the agenda, and Trump was isolated. Pruitt will most likely face the same situation. Mr. Pruitt was one of the persons who advised President Trump to withdraw, and he is known for his skepticism towards climate change. My guess is that he will have a difficult time defending and explaining the US decision when he meets his G7 colleagues.

In this context, the call from faith leaders contributes an additional critique. While the other G7 members will bring up arguments of security, economy, growth and development, faith leaders bring up the moral and ethical concern. Faith leaders stand, as they so often do, with the most vulnerable, the ones who have contributed the least to climate change and yet are disproportionately affected by it.

Together, faith leaders delivered their message of solidarity, calling on the G7 leaders—and all people—to take seriously the need to care for creation.

25,25,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Southeast Asia Joint Patrols Aimed at Islamic Militants - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/southeast-asia-joint-patrols-aimed-islamic-militants,"SINGAPORE - Joint patrols by three Southeast Asian countries in the Sulu Sea may be the start of a larger regional effort to keep Islamic militants at bay, officials said Sunday.



The patrols will be conducted by forces from Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, starting with sea operations this month, with air and land patrols starting at a later date.



The initiative in the Sulu Sea, an area bounded by the Malaysian state of Sabah and the southern Philippines, is a “collective agreement that is followed by the operational level,” Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said. It will feature joint command posts and exercises between the trio’s ground forces.

Joint patrols are an attempt “to prevent and protect our border, to close the border so that militants don’t go to other areas,” Ryamizard said. “If the situation escalates and extends to other waters, we would like to request other countries to join.”



Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population. Ryamizard was speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security conference in Singapore attended by defense ministers and experts from 39 countries.

The presence of Islamic militants has been felt in the region. Philippine troops are struggling to end a bloody siege by 500 Islamic State group-aligned extremists in the southern city of Marawi, one of the boldest militant attacks in Southeast Asia in years.



Forty foreigners involved in the Marawi attack may have found a path through the Sulu Sea, said Ricardo David Jr., undersecretary for defense policy at the Philippine Department of National Defense.

“They have a back channels corridor in our country, probably in the area of Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea, that they can proceed to Mindanao and link with the terrorist units in the area,” he said.



The joint patrols are not conducted under the umbrella of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia are part.



“ASEAN is not a military bloc. It is a defense corporation. If there are any issues, we have to find commonalities” out of the organization, Ryamizard said.

Common enemy



Still, the objectives are aligned.

“The very threat we face is a common enemy. Terrorists are the enemy. Especially in ASEAN, we don’t have any differences. I believe this can be a framework for other countries like the Middle East,” he added.



Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said that he has offered assistance in the form of an information-sharing center at Changi Naval Base.



China has been asked to contribute its ships. Responding to a question from a member of the Chinese delegation, Ryamizard said: “It is like peace patrols. It is very important to underline that it is joint peace patrols.”



The inclusion of China is sensitive as the country has pitted itself against smaller Southeast Asian neighbors in claiming disputed islands, coral reefs and lagoons in the South China Sea.

26,26,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Cambodia's Kingdom crafts niche as regional brewer - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Cambodia-s-Kingdom-crafts-niche-as-regional-brewer,"BANGKOK -- As the craft beer craze sweeps from West to East amid intensifying demand for diverse, flavorful beers, a microbrewery in Phnom Penh is positioning itself as one of the leading producers in the region.

Kingdom Breweries, launched in 2010 alongside the Tonle Sap river in the Cambodian capital, has gone from producing own-brand craft beers for the domestic market and Bruntys cider for local brand Asia Pacific Cider to making around 30 beverages for a dozen companies in Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, and the Philippines that lack their own breweries.

In Thailand, where strict rules block independent brewing, beer makers are increasingly looking to contract brewers to cope with expanding demand and to legitimize their operations.

""Going to Kingdom allows us to bring beer and sell it legally,"" said Mike Roberts, founder of Outlaw Brewing, which launched in 2015 as a brewpub in Thailand's northeastern Loei province and recently contracted Kingdom to produce its American-style India Pale Ale -- a development of a beer first brewed in 18th century England.

""A lot of us are getting busy, so we need to take the steps for volume, and brew at a proper brewery,"" said Roberts. He currently produces around 1,000 liters a month at his brewpub, but recently contracted Kingdom to make an additional 3,000 to 3,500 liters a month to cope with brisk demand.

Kingdom recently ramped up total production to around 100,000 liters a month, about 50% of which is brewed for other companies, making it the leading craft beer producer in Southeast Asia, according to Lawrence Mackhoul, Kingdom Breweries CEO.

""We want to be Southeast Asia's brew hub for quality beers,"" said Mackhoul, who is also an associate partner at Leopard Capital, a private equity firm that has a 55% stake in Kingdom and investments in Asia and Haiti. The remaining 45% is owned by a trio of Hong Kong-based private investors.

In Cambodia, the company controls a negligible share of the beer market. But regionally, Kingdom has become the leading craft brewery, producing more than double the beer volume achieved by its main competitors in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Mackhoul told the Nikkei Asian Review.

""For Southeast Asia, we are most likely contract brewing more than any other contract brewer,"" he said, estimating that there are about five contract craft brewers in the region. Mackhoul declined to reveal financial details about the company, but said it was ""financially sound.""

The big shift in the company's operations comes as the craft beer revolution, which began in the U.S. and Europe about 30 years ago, gains ground in Asia. ""Tastes are changing, people are more receptive to new flavors, to bolder tasting beers,"" said Mackhoul.

Cambodia's beer and bar industries are showing signs of diversity with the arrival of brewpubs such as Hops Brewery, Botanico and Cerevisia Craft Brewhouse in Phnom Penh. But when Kingdom launched, the country's beer scene was uninspiring and dominated by huge breweries, reflecting none of the excitement around beer in places such as Singapore and Bangkok.

Mackhoul said Kingdom was not trying to compete with mass-market beers such as Angkor, made by Cambrew, part of the Carlsberg group, and Anchor, brewed by Heineken Asia Pacific, formerly Asia Pacific Breweries, which also produces the Heineken and Tiger brands.

Sponsorship deals

But the big brewers' aggressive marketing and pricing strategies have made it difficult to win over the palates and purses of consumers used to paying 2,000 to 8,000 riel ($0.50 to $2) for a glass of beer. Kingdom's own-brand bottled beers, which include its flagship Kingdom Pilsner, a dark lager, and IPA brands, sell for around $3 or more.

""The big guys will give the bar a contract to put their beers on tap,"" Mackhoul said. In return, the bars get sponsorship deals and other promotions. ""They make it challenging to get into certain bars.""

Makkara Iv Thoun, owner of Barbados, a Phnom Penh bar popular with expatriates, said she stopped stocking Kingdom after buying a consignment about four years ago. Makkara said that ""not enough customers asked for it,"" while locals ""never drink it."" However, she said awareness of Kingdom was low at the time, and its prices prohibitively expensive.

Mackhoul said the company's entry into the Cambodian market may have been a little early, but its potential was stifled more by management woes than market forces. ""The idea was there; we had a good product; the timing was perhaps a little bit early, but the biggest issues were management.""

In those early years, the company was being steered toward economy and standard products in a ""deviation from our strategy,"" Mackhoul said.

In 2014 Leopard put its stake in Kingdom up for sale as part of its investment strategy to exit funds after a certain period. The offer drew a few interested buyers, and the company came close to sealing the deal with one party that was given a period of exclusivity in which to make the purchase. ""But they were not able to come up with the full amount of funding required for the buyout in the allotted time,"" said Mackhoul.

After the deal fell through Kingdom decided to take the company off the market and overhaul its management. Leopard hired British brewmaster Ian Leigh, who had more than 30 years' experience at big breweries including Scottish & Newcastle and Carlsberg China. Leopard also installed Mackhoul as Kingdom CEO. He scrapped the low and mid-range products, and turned the company's focus back to the premium segment.

With an established factory kitted out with top-of-the-range German equipment, a seasoned brewer, and a booming industry, offers soon began flooding in for contract brewing.

Brian Bartusch, co-founder of Bangkok's largest craft beer importer, Beervana, said Asia's beer industry is ""very young and fresh, but far from its infancy,"" with Kingdom in a key position to capitalize on this growth if it can continue to produce high quality beers at reasonable prices.

Bartusch said Kingdom must also be open to ""more experimental recipes beyond classic lagers,"" adding that, ""a flexible brew house, qualified labor, easy shipping and [the liberal] tax and export restrictions of Cambodia are all factors"" for success.

In the last couple of years, Kingdom has been pushing its own beer in Australia and Europe, with the U.K. now its biggest market after Cambodia. About 90% of the beer Kingdom produces is exported.

While there are still plans to crack more of Asia, entering new markets depends on finding good distributors and executing good marketing campaigns. ""There is still a long way to go and a huge untapped market, further afield and in the small shops and rural areas where the cost of craft beer is still very prohibitive,"" Mackhoul said.

Most importantly, the company needs to find a partner that ""believes in the brand,"" he said.","Mon, 05 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F5%252F6%252F6%252F46655-9-eng-GB%252F20170526_combodia-beer1.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['niche', 'crafts', 'brewer', 'company', 'market', 'breweries', 'mackhoul', 'beer', 'cambodias', 'kingdom', 'contract', 'asia', 'regional', 'beers', 'craft']", 
27,27,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Why not both? Rainforest diversity stems from two seemingly irreconcilable processes - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2017/06/why-not-both-rainforest-diversity-stems-from-two-seemingly-irreconcilable-processes/,"Scientists have long been puzzled by the immense diversity of tropical rainforests, but a new study finds that both light and height are key to plant diversity.

Diversity in the tropics isn’t just about light-loving species versus shade-tolerant ones, but also about how tall plants are when they hit maturity.

Research supports both niche theory and unified neutral theory, but with some twists.

It’s crowded in the tropics. Take the plant world: 1,000 tree species can coexist in a small equatorial area of only a quarter kilometer squared, according to one forest ecologist, S. Joseph Wright. That’s about as many tree species as in all the temperate forests of the northern hemisphere combined.

But the story of how rainforest plant biodiversity came to be – and rainforest biodiversity in general – suffers from critical gaps.

Almost all saplings must spend at least part of their lives in low-light conditions since the extensive rainforest canopy creates shady environments underneath. Forest ecologists know that tropical plants handle the limited light using a resourceful strategy: rather than devoting their energy to growing quickly to reach the light before the others, a great majority of plant species direct a very specific degree of energy into shade-tolerance. This dynamic, found in tropical forests across the world, makes plant diversity even harder to explain. Not only can hundreds of species pack amazingly into small physical spaces, but most also seem to inexplicably crowd into this one main niche space.

Scientists have debated what’s potentially going on for decades. Last December, Daniel Falster from Macquarie University, Australia led a PNAS study that pinned down some answers, showing how plant diversity stems from niche competition – except when it doesn’t.

“Competitive coexistence occurs when a group of species can all coexist without any of the species driving any of the others extinct, i.e. when each species has its own niche,” the study author, Falster told Mongabay. “In our model plants compete for light. The fact that species can coexist means that no species is able to monopolize this resource for itself.”

Falster produced a model that shows how competition for light enables the diverse yet stable landscapes we see in all tropical rainforests. The model landscape changes over time. Natural disruptions occasionally rip through it, leaving some patches bare.

“Disturbance events are common to nearly all forests,” Falster said. “These could be cyclones, fires, floods, disease outbreaks, or any other external agent causing a lot of trees to die. When a disturbance hits a small, local area we call this a ‘patch.’ A forest is made up of many such patches.”

Evolution takes off on these bare spaces. Plants compete for light, and at first, the species that do best are those that grow quickly capturing as much sunlight as possible. In their race to the top, early-successional plants neglect putting much energy into leaf development, causing what scientists call low “leaf mass per unit leaf area” or LMA.

“Plants with low LMA have leaves which are cheap to build, the savings they make on leaf construction enable the whole plant to grow faster, when small,” Falster said. “However, these cheaply built leaves are weak and therefore short-lived. As such, low LMA leaves need to be replaced often; the cost of this regular turnover makes it difficult to survive in low light where income is scarce.”

But one plant’s weakness is another’s niche. As the forest matures and fast-growing, sun-hogging species block the light, plants that direct energy to building higher LMA start to have an advantage. They don’t grow as quickly when they are seedlings, but their higher-quality leaves equip them for survival in the low-light conditions common in rainforests.

Falster’s model corroborated some findings from past studies. In the rainforest only three specific, widely different LMA values are viable. For any species with LMA values in between these three main types, the cost of trading growth for shade-tolerance doesn’t pay off, and the species dies out. In other words, along the spectrum of possible amounts of shade-tolerance, there doesn’t appear to be much room for diversity in fully developed forests.

This is the sticky point in niche theory. If competing species can only coexist because they all use different strategies to get enough light, then how come hundreds of species can huddle together around one place, in just a few niches? What’s more, many succession models show that niche development makes room for only one highly shade-tolerant species. But in the real world, the overwhelming majority of rainforest species are those with the highest viable shade-tolerance.

Falster’s study resolves the conundrum by revealing a whole new continuum of niches available only to shade-tolerant plants. This second variable is plants’ height at maturation (HMAT). When low-HMAT plants reach maturity, they produce more seeds, but don’t put much energy into further growth. In species with higher HMAT, mature plants might continue their upwards trajectory towards sunlight, but wait longer to reproduce.

Unlike with LMA, tropical forests do support a variety of niches in the “height at maturation” spectrum. The study calls this “evolutionary emergent near-neutrality.” As long as the forest is old enough to host highly shade-tolerant plants, niches all along the HMAT continuum become available, enabling the species richness we see in the real-life tropics. Falster explains that high-LMA species have smaller populations, relaxing competition between each other, and allowing plants with different HMAT strategies to coexist.

Importantly, the “evolutionary emergent near-neutrality” found in Falster’s study bridges gaps with the controversial “unified neutral theory” put forth in 2001 by Stephen Hubbell, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Unified neutral theory assumes that plants coexist, not because they occupy different niches, but because no one trait gives one species an advantage over another.

Falster says his study “shows there is a role [for] both theories in understanding forest diversity.”

Niche theory explains how shade-tolerant plants develop, while evolutionary emergent near-neutrality shows how plants with different HMAT strategies can coexist because they are almost equally fit to survive in the landscape.

“Our model is first and foremost a model of niche differentiation,” he said. “At the same time, an outcome of niche differentiation is the fitness equivalence that neutral theory takes as its starting point.”

The impact that climate change has on oceans and the degradation of marine ecosystems in many regions throughout the world has led people to migrate, sometimes by force, in order to protect their livelihoods.

In recent years, the issue of climate migration has been high on the global policy agenda, notably within the global climate negotiations. Indeed, one key outcome of the Paris Agreement was the decision to create a taskforce on climate displacement to help those who move because of negative climate impacts.

These concerns are not confined to discussions in diplomatic forum—news stories on global ocean warming intensifying storms and typhoons that in turn displace millions of people in the are plentiful; the academic community is producing dozens of new works every year examining the link between migration and climate change; and civil society advocates are striving to bring the voice of climate migrants to the fore.

Oceans and Migration: What’s At Stake?

The inexorable rise of sea levels causes coastal erosion, which results in loss of arable land and water reserves due to salinized soil and groundwater. Coastlines increasingly recede, and floods intensify during spring tides or severe storms. These extreme weather events regularly provoke the displacement of millions of people. Between 2008 and 2015, an average of 21.5 million people have been displaced every year within their own countries due to weather-related hazards, principally floods and storms. And there are potentially many more people on the move across international borders than what available data tells us.

In addition, sea level rise is expected to have long-term impacts on migration. The majority of world metropolises are located on coasts and 40 million people living in major coastal cities are threatened by submersion. Migrating out of dangerous areas might be the only option to manage coastal risks and adapt to these new realities. This is a concern, for example, for the 150 million people in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh at risk due to sea-level rise, the Alaskan villages that need to relocate inland due to coastal erosion, and the entire population of some small islands in the Pacific threatened by complete disappearance.

In addition, the livelihood of millions of people across the world is impacted by threats to marine biodiversity. In many least developed countries, economic activities such as fishing and tourism represent the main source of income, and the depletion of fish resources and the destruction of coastal infrastructures pushes large numbers of people to search for alternative livelihood options further inland. In Cambodia and Senegal, fishermen report that “distress migration” had begun in fishing villages that experience a decline in fish stock, as people are desperate to secure alternative sources of income.

The Future Is Now

For many of these communities, migration might be the only solution to escape the nefarious effects linked to ocean threats. So how can the international community help these people build more resilient lives to avoid instances of forced migration?

Global leaders are gathering in New York from June 5-9, 2017, for the United Nations Ocean Conference, a milestone event for the leaders to work toward one of the globally agreed sustainable development goals on “life below water.” This event represents a key opportunity to bring up the migration dimensions when striving to protect the oceans and keep the human at the center of the global policy discussions.

Work on the global policy stage needs to be supported by knowledge about the relationship between the ocean, climate change and migration. We also need to comprehend all of its different dimensions—from helping people suddenly displaced by extreme whether events to developing long-term solutions for those who migrate due to loss of ocean-related livelihoods.

It is also important to remember that most people would rather not migrate and both policy and program development should aim to help people remain undisturbed, especially in areas that already experience high emigration rates. Yet, in some cases, migration is—and will continue to be—inevitable. In these cases, we have a responsibility to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to support those who chose to or are forced to migrate. This, for instance, could take the form of developing more legal migration channels within a country or across borders to guide people in their migratory journeys.

Migration in a changing climate does not need to be a story of failure. We have opportunities to take action now.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GettyImages-656060216-e1496341550112-900x600.jpg,"['coastal', 'climate', 'migration', 'tides', 'rising', 'policy', 'world', 'storms', 'global', 'migrations', 'ocean', 'rise', 'migrate', 'future']", 
29,29,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Chinese Tourists – Parisians Not Only Happy about the Tourism Boom | .TR - Tourism Review,https://www.tourism-review.com/chinese-tourists-bring-troubles-to-paris-news5433,"Chinese tourists are travelling as never before and Paris is one of the main European goals of the tourism boom. The French capital attracts visitors with its museums as well as luxury shops. Their rapid inflow in recent years is viewed in two perspectives. On one hand, their presence is a huge boost for the French economy. But on the other, Paris citizens are complaining that clashes of culture in the city are changing its very nature. So, what exactly is happening in Paris?

During the current difficult times for Paris, a city racked with terror attacks, strikes and affected by floods, Chinese visitors continue streaming to the City of Love with enthusiasm. For them, Paris is still extremely attractive. At times, some parts of the city look more like downtown Beijing. Last year, nearly 2 million Chinese tourists visited Paris and spent over 1 billion euros. The impact is huge, but there are issues connected to cultural differences between these masses and the locals.

Specific Breed of Tourists

Firstly, it is important to note that Chinese (and overall Asian) tourists are a very specific travelling group. The tourism boom of Chinese visitors can be observed especially in Europe. The growing wealth of the Chinese and huge population means that many visitors in the travel groups are overseas for the first time and perhaps for the last time. To a certain extent, it’s a trip of a life time for them. They travel for approximately 20 days and attempt to visit as many countries as possible. This means that they are in an extreme hurry and can sacrifice only a certain period of time for each stop.

On average, these trips cost about $7000 per person, of which nearly half is spent in stores. The average Chinese tourists in France spend more on shopping than food, entertainment and accommodation combined. Returning hope with luxury goods is a source of satisfaction for Chinese visitors, who thus have a lot to talk about upon their return.

Unsurprisingly, the Gallery Lafayette is the first thing to be visited for them after the Eiffel Tower. The Gallery now also has a dedicated entrance just for Chinese tourists. That said, they count for up to half of luxury brand sales worldwide as of now. 85% of these purchases are made in Europe or the US. Thus, it is not surprise that tour guides keep Chinese customers in stores far longer than at museums or monuments, as they are paid big commissions for this.

Cultural Clashes and Decay

The fact that many Chinese tourists visit Europe as a once in a life time experience, however, leads to cultural clashes. Some have been documented on social media, like the man who had a bath in a Venice Canal or a student who graphited his name on an Egyptian temple etc. It would be prejudicial to say that Chinese tourists are worse than other, because this is simply not true. This is more a matter of culture and occasional misunderstanding of local customs. Tour operators have little interest in educating clients about French customs or culture. For them, the Chinese market is mainly a matter of money and numbers.

Clashes over cultural differences is one issue of Chinese tourism boom in Europe. Another is the decay of local cultures. The center of Paris used to be filled with bars, restaurants and traditional French bistros. In the past years, however, the trend has been changing. People in the streets started selling their businesses to the Chinese for astonishing amounts. Now, streets such as Rue de Provence are full of Chinese restaurants and duty-free shops.

It is difficult to say how the situation might develop, but if Parisians are worried about too many Chinese now, they should get ready for more. Authorities of Paris want to welcome 5 million Chinese visitors a year. This should not be too difficult to achieve. Only 7% of the Chinese has a passport as of now, but the interest in travelling is growing year by year. The gateway between China and the world has been open and there is a lot for everyone to learn about each other in the future.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.tourism-review.com/temp/aktualita-detail-facebook_tmb_5433.jpg?v=1502277846,"['visitors', 'europe', 'boom', 'parisians', 'paris', 'city', 'travelling', 'luxury', 'french', 'tourism', 'happy', 'tourists', 'chinese']", 
30,30,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Vietnam's Social Media Shaping New Environmentalism - Geopoliticalmonitor.com,https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/vietnams-social-media-shaping-new-environmentalism/,"“I am frequently on several environmental online forums and campaigns led by Vietnamese, who have addressed Hanoi’s logging of 6,700 trees, the Thai Binh deforestation for economic development, and the construction in Cat Ba,” says Tran Thi Thuy Binh, a member of the Vietnam Forum for Environmental Journalists in Hanoi.

Binh, along with 40 million other net-savvy young Vietnamese, appears to be part of a rising tide of environmental nationalism sweeping the nation. What’s most surprising is that Facebook, once banned in Vietnam, has now proven to be an attractive platform for organizing environment rallies. With a population of 93 million and an increasing Internet user base, social media has proven to be the first choice among the educated Vietnamese youth.

Their online activism was highlighted last year in Ha Tinh province, the scene of the Formosa Plastics Corporation’s steel plant’s environmental crime, where citizens took to the streets, even rallying near Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi, to protest the Taiwanese corporation’s improper discharge of untreated toxic wastewater into the East Sea.

It was a turning point for Vietnam’s environmental and social activists, many who became first-time citizen reporters and posted their photos of tons of dead fish swept along a 125-mile coastline, devastating sea life and local economies dependent on fishing and tourism spanning several provinces from Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri. With more than 35 million users, Facebook is rapidly becoming a lighting rod for environmental activism and sparking demands for improved environmental safeguards.

Hundreds of thousands of images of dead fish flooded social media following the incident. During last year’s central Vietnam industrial fish kill, internet censors blocked Facebook over the environmental hash tag, #IChooseFish, or the Vietnamese version, #toichonca.

The Formosa environmental disaster succeeded in creating a nation-wide opposition to unchecked industrialization in unprecedented ways. Citizens, especially the young, are demanding a clean environment. As a result, there’s a growing environmental awareness campaign.

Environmental activist Nguyen Huynh That believes that the Formosa steel plant ecological disaster “generated a social protest against an unchecked industrial development and signaled a new wave of environmentalism through Facebook postings.”

In two decades, Vietnam’s rapid industrialization has reduced poverty and helped raise the country’s per-capita income to over $3,600, dramatically propelling it past poorer neighbors like Laos and Cambodia. However, this rapid build at-all-costs industrialization occurs generally at the expense of the environment, especially with its corresponding pressure that’s placed on natural resources.

Despite an early government policy discussion in 1985 that called for a national conservation strategy, no such strategy has ever officially been adopted. In 1991, Hanoi announced a national plan for the sustainable management of the country’s natural resources. However, it was neither institutionalized nor implemented until the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE), and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) were created, along with the Vietnamese Environment Agency in 2008.

Pressure from the international donor community and local shareholders, resulted in some successful policy changes, but the new environmental laws failed to provide any legal enforcement to ensure compliance. In fact, five years ago the Environmental Performance Index listed Vietnam in the top ten worst countries for air pollution.

Because of Vietnam’s environmental enforcement weakness, a litany of damages to the land and water continues to mount: two thirds of Vietnam’s forests are in decline, mainly due to massive illegal logging; air pollution increases daily due to the growing number of motorbikes; wastewater is released untreated; and industrialization pollutes rivers and streams.

It’s no wonder that Vietnam has witnessed the emergence of prominent non-governmental organizations like People and Nature Reconciliation (PanNature), Centre for Water Resources Conservation and Development (WARECOD), ECO Vietnam Group, Green Innovation and Development Centre, and Save Vietnam’s Wildlife (SVW), to name a few.

Also, Mekong Eye previously reported on Vietnam’s photo campaign, “I Can’t”, directed at the proliferation of coal power generators. Sponsored by Vietnam’s chapter of the global climate change NGO 350.org and the Center of Hands-on Actions and Networking for Growth and Environment (CHANGE), it featured popular Vietnamese actors, musicians and artists wearing gas masks, performing before a devastating backdrop of smog and climate devastation.

Government officials like Tran The Loan, the deputy director of the Vietnam Environment Administration (VEA) has asserted: “Environmental pollution in our country has become alarming.”

While it’s true that the Vietnamese have recognized the importance of environmental protection through the introduction of national laws for environmental impact assessments, these laws have not been transparent and did not involve the participation of the people.

As early as 1994, Hanoi introduced the national law on environmental protection, yet did little to influence or monitor the planning and decision-making on industrial zones and the direct impact on the environment. According to a study on the role of public involvement in environmental impact assessment in Vietnam, credit should be given to the government for reviewing the environmental law in 2005, deciding that “participation from communal People’s Committees and local residents must be included in any EIA.”

“It is largely through social media that young people like Hoang Thi Minh, the leader of Change and 360 organizations, based in Ho Chi Minh City, are bringing people together to protest ecological damage to Vietnam’s landscape and seacoast,” claims Le Thu Mach, a lecturer at the Academy of Journalism and Communication.

The online protests associated with this degradation of the environment is evident in the ManForTree posting on Facebook; it reflects an effort to collect the signatures of Hanoi residents to protest the mass logging of over 6,700 old trees in ten urban districts.

In an attempt to increase the ranks of online environmentalists, Mekong Matters Journalism has assisted with the professional training of citizen reporters in the Mekong with their well-placed network of eyes on the myriad of environmental challenges in the Mekong Delta. This network was established in September 2014 and continues to link environmental bloggers, citizen reporters, and journalists from Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

According to Adam Hunt, an InterNews media trainer who has led several environmental media training programs in the region, including several in Can Tho: “The rapid pace of development in the Mekong is creating more opportunities for reporters to find innovative and important stories.” Hunt’s Mekong Eye website regularly showcases news from these reporters, and it has become an effective information resource for villages and government officials.

Over the course of the past five years, the Vietnamese have protested numerous environmental issues, including textile companies, sand dredging, the hydropower project in Cat Tien National Park, pig farms, coal power plants, cement factories, and most recently the steel plant in Ha Tinh.

“Social media is proving its important role in promoting environmental awareness to the young generation in Vietnam and throughout SE Asia,” says Khiem Nguyen, founder of Mekong Delta Youth, who’s now pursuing a Masters of Resource Management in New Zealand.

This era of social media contributes has proven effective in bringing together crowds of local citizens to protest a given environmental issue. But the jury is still out as to whether it will lead to an environmental structural change from Hanoi.

Nevertheless, the recent announcement by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to halt work at a $10.6 billion steel plant over concerns surrounding its environmental impact surprised many citizens. Some suggest that the government is attuned to the growing resentment among younger Vietnamese about the granting of project licenses without sound environmental impact studies.

Climate disruptions, notably floods and drought, are not new in the Mekong Delta, but last year’s historic floods and drought, coupled with expanding industrial development, has ushered in more online forums among citizens and nearby academics at Can Tho University. Last week’s two-day Can Tho ‘International Media Workshop’ on water security and narratives in the Mekong Delta highlights the emerging state of ‘green politics and environmental activism found in the lower delta. The program brought together a dozen foreign (Mekong) journalists and ten Vietnamese, along with scientists and other stakeholders.

Additionally, the workshop raised awareness about the need for improved communication and media practices with regards to environmental security matters. It also enhanced information-sharing among citizen-reporters and journalists in the region.

“People are better informed because of the Internet. Journalists and local Facebook users do provide information to more citizens and also to the government to take action in safeguarding their environment on issues like riverbank and coastal erosion, inland salinity intrusion, and water contamination,” says Nguyen Minh Quang, a lecturer and writer on conflict studies and politics at Can Tho University.

ATHENS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale hit Greece's Eastern Aegean Sea on Monday, causing damages to some old houses in the island of Lesvos but no people was injured.

The Athens Institute of Geodynamics said the epicentre of the earthquake was at sea, about 45km south from Lesvos island.

According to local media, there are reports of damages and collapse of old houses in the villages of Plomari and Vrisa in the southern part of Lesvos.

The strong tremor, which hit in early afternoon, was felt in Athens. There are aftershocks measuring from 4.6 to 3.6 on Richter scale.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['greeces', 'lesvos', 'aegean', 'measuring', 'quake', 'houses', 'hit', 'eastern', 'sea', '61magnitude', 'scale', 'old', 'earthquake', 'hits', 'xinhua', 'richter']",

The Bianconeri were quietly confident of ending their 21-year wait for Champions League glory but they ended up losing their seventh of nine finals

COMMENT

Everywhere one looked at full-time at the Millennium Stadium, there were people clad in black and white in floods of tears, on the pitch and in the stands.

This defeat hit hard, primarily because it was supposed to be different this time. Juventus were supposed to win this time. They didn't. They lost. Again. The seventh time in nine European Cup finals. The fifth in a row.

Perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised by Real Madrid's 4-1 victory over the Bianconeri.

Ronaldo double seals Real triumph

After all, the side with the worst record in European Cup finals had gone up against the side with the best record in European Cup finals. Furthermore, Real were the defending champions, a side of superstars assembled at a cost of €638.2 million (€215.9m more than Juve).

However, the Bianconeri had supposedly learned from their surprise appearance in the 2015 final, a 3-1 loss to Barcelona in Berlin.

They had matured, they told us, and strengthened their squad in the interim, last summer's €90m signing of Gonzalo Higuain viewed as a sign that now they could not only compete with Europe's elite on the field but off it too.

The signs were encouraging. Juve had reached the final undefeated, and having conceded just three goals in 12 games. On a demoralising night in Cardiff, they shipped four in 90 minutes. It was probably the most jarring statistic on a shocking night for Juve.

Ronaldo & Real are history boys

""The approach from Real was the same,"" Dani Alves mused, ""The difference was we didn’t defend as well as we usually do.""

They had started strongly, with Higuain testing Keylor Navas twice in the opening five minutes. After being rocked by a classic Cristiano Ronaldo counter-punch 20 minutes in - Real's first shot on target - they responded wonderfully.

In fact, they responded like potential champions, with Mario Mandzukic beating Navas with an improvised overhead kick, after a majestic move in which the ball never touched the ground as it went from Leonardo Bonucci to Alex Sandro to Gonzalo Higuain and then the Croat.

It was one of the greatest goals ever scored in any final and, at half-time, all the momentum appeared to be with the Italian champions. Yet, in truth, whatever belief they appeared to have completely disappeared during the interval. Juve went from dominant to dire in the space of 15 minutes.

From hounding every Madrid player in possession, Juve were suddenly chasing shadows. Worse, some players - perhaps overcome by fatigue after a double-winning domestic campaign - stopped chasing altogether.

Buffon baffled by Juve capitulation

“I thought it was a great approach in the first half, not giving Madrid any more advantages, and we ran really hard,"" captain Gianluigi Buffon mused. ""Perhaps we ran a bit too hard...

""It’s a big disappointment, because we thought that we had done everything necessary beforehand to play this final and finally win it.""

Cruelly for Buffon, the crucial second goal - an ambitious long-range strike from Casemiro - was, just like Ronaldo's opener, deflected. But, in truth, it had been coming.

Juve needed to rise again after falling behind for a second time but they simply fell further off the pace and were ultimately left feeling frustrated, embarrassed and disconsolate by the time the full-time whistle mercifully blew.

There will be an inquest - particularly into what exactly Massimiliano Allegri said to his side at half-time and why his side ""dropped off, psychologically"", as he put it - but only after another all-too-familiar painful period of dejection and defeatism.

Thanks to what they have done off the field in recent years, Juve are now in a strong economic position and have the resources and leadership to return to the summit of European football.

""We start again!"" midfielder Claudio Marchisio defiantly declared, while Allegri stated, ""We should’ve reacted to the second goal and defended for our lives, but this is another step we have to take in future to learn from this and mature.""

Fans split on Ramos-Cuadrado spat

However, several members of the second-oldest side ever to play in a Champions League final might never get another chance to lift the trophy, chief among them Andrea Barzagli and Buffon.

The latter had openly admitted before the game that some of his team-mates ""have at least four or years of football ahead of them. I do not.""

Sadly, there was to be ""no happy ending to the fairy tale"" that the 39-year-old Buffon had spoken about on the eve of his third final appearance, just the same old sad story for both him and Juventus.","Sun, 04 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['real', 'defeat', 'final', 'higuain', 'buffon', 'sad', 'juve', 'minutes', 'european', 'tale', 'old', 'fairy', 'juventus', 'champions', 'second']", 
37,37,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Bringing rhinos back to India's parks - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2017/06/bringing-rhinos-back-to-indias-parks/,"Several hurdles to cross

One of the biggest challenges turned out to be the difficulty in obtaining etorphine — a major component of the tranquilizing drug used to sedate large wild animals like rhinos and elephants.

Etorphine, an opioid that is about 1,000 times as potent as morphine, is classified as a Schedule I narcotic drug in India. This means that its import, export, manufacture, sale, storage or distribution is illegal.

Procuring the drug even for a government-supported project like the IRV 2020 has proven to be a lengthy, laborious process, conservationists say. Unfortunately, alternative drugs do not work well in the greater one-horned rhinos, Bibhab Talukdar, Asian Rhino Coordinator for the International Rhino Foundation, told Mongabay. Talukdar is also the Chair of the IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group and Secretary General of Indian NGO Aaranyak.

Etorphine also has a relatively short shelf life, further aggravating the problem. “By the time we get the drugs and execute our capture and translocation program, the validity for use of that batch of drugs is almost gone,” Sharma said. “That is where we were stuck.”

The teams finally managed to get a fresh batch of etorphine in 2010, and on 29 December 2010, they moved two adult females from Pobitora to Manas. By March 2012, the teams had moved 14 more animals from Pobitora and Kaziranga to Manas, bringing the total number of rhinos translocated under IRV 2020 to 18.

The rehabilitation center (CWRC) independently introduced 10 rescued rhino calves to Manas between 2006 and 2016.

Some of these translocated and rehabilitated female rhinos went on to give birth to calves. A few rhinos became mothers twice. By 2015, 14 calves were born, increasing Manas’s rhino population to 32, up from zero in 2005. Despite this baby boom, conservationists were not celebrating.

Between 2011 and 2016, poachers had struck Manas repeatedly, killing 10 rhinos. Iragdao was one of their victims.

These poaching incidents were a blow to the expensive operation. In 2013, IRV 2020 decided to stop further rhino translocations to Manas. They would first focus on improving the security of the park, they said.

“Translocations can only be successful if poaching pressure is reduced to less than one animal poached every year — which may not be a realistic goal at this time,” Susie Ellis, Executive Director of the International Rhino Foundation, wrote in The Horn in 2015. “Until the current intensity of poaching is reduced to zero for several years, the IRV partners will not move more animals to the Park, as this would be an unwise placement of a precious resource.”

With translocations to Manas on hold, the IRV 2020 team shifted focus to a second protected area —Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary.

Restocking a second park

Like Manas, Burachapori once had its own population of rhinos. In the early 1980s, Burachapori was estimated to have more than 70 rhinos, many of which were killed by poachers within a short span from 1983 to 1984. Of the rhinos that survived, some died due to natural causes. Others moved away to relatively safer protected areas nearby, such as Orang and Kaziranga National Parks. By early 1990s, Burachapori’s rhino population had plummeted to zero.

Between 2013 and 2016, Burachapori was prepped for the arrival of rhinos. Steps were taken to make its habitat rhino-friendly, and security was intensified. Like the boma created for rhino calves in Manas, experts built a 150-hectare (~371-acre) rhino enclosure in Burachapori. This would help the reintroduced rhinos adapt to the new habitat before they were allowed to move freely and explore the wild.

The enclosure in Burachapori is necessary, Sharma said, because it is a small park (only 44 square kilometers or 17 square miles in area) surrounded by villages.

“From our experience, we have seen that once we release a rhino, it can run up to 5 to 10 kilometers after being released and start exploring the area,” he said. “If it does that in a small area like Burachapori, it can easily enter a village, and that will be very dangerous for all parties.”

On 29 March 2016, a female rhino and her calf were captured in Kaziranga National Park and released in Burachapori the next morning. Two months later, the 35-year-old mother died. Its horn was found to be intact, and the rhino was suspected to have died of “natural causes.”

The monitoring team continued to follow the calf, named Ramani, and found that she “displayed extreme resilience in settling in her surroundings.”

“Even during the recent floods in Assam, the calf held her ground, and as water levels rose, she constantly moved to higher grounds. She also responded well to the regular supply of fresh fodder and other mineral supplements provided by the team at Burachapori. And she was doing well thereafter,” Sharma wrote in a statement in November 2016.

Unfortunately, Ramani’s health began deteriorating in the latter part of September. Despite round-the-clock veterinary care, she died on October 26.

The precise cause of Ramani and her mother’s death remains unknown.

“While we know that they died due to a disease, we are sorry to say that we don’t know exactly what disease,” Sharma said. “The problem is that we have very little scientific knowledge about factors affecting the health of Indian rhinos. We need to know what diseases affect rhinos to be prepared to have treatment facility in place for those diseased rhinos.”

IRV 2020 is currently re-assessing their experience at Burachapori, and further translocations are on hold.

“The team of veterinary doctors have submitted their report to the Chief Wildlife Warden of Assam,” Talukdar said. “I am sure the Chief Wildlife Warden has gone through the report and suggestions made and needed corrective measures shall be the priority in next phases.”

What’s next?

IRV 2020 started out with a goal of increasing rhino numbers to 3,000, with the animals distributed across Assam’s seven protected areas. The program began smoothly, but the ride has been bumpy ever since.

Sourcing etorphine, the tranquilizing drug of choice, remains a difficult and unpredictable task. Poaching continues to be a looming threat to rhinos that are reintroduced to new parks. Moreover, veterinarians and conservationists are yet to figure out treatments for diseases affecting these big herbivores.

Consequently, expanding the range of rhinos to seven parks across Assam in the next three years looks unlikely. While IRV 2020 will continue to attempt translocating rhinos to Manas National Park and Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary complex, getting Dibru-Saikhwa National Park (the seventh park in the list) assessed and ready for rhinos by 2020 might be a big challenge, Sharma said.

Despite these setbacks, conservationists believe that achieving a population of 3,000 rhinos by 2020 is still possible.

“As of March 2017, Assam has at least 2,600 rhinos and hence 400 rhinos in next four years may be still achievable if government is able to check rhino poaching incidences in Assam,” Talukdar said.

More than 31 million people were internally displaced due to conflict and disasters in 2016, but the issue has been overshadowed by the focus on refugees and migrants, according to a report by a monitoring group.

The Global Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) found that on average, one person was forced to flee every second in 2016, a trend it called a “horrific” new level of displacement.

Disasters displaced three times more people than conflicts, with most of the 24 million people affected by sudden-onset weather hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and severe winter conditions.

In total, 31.1 million new cases of internal displacements were reported in 125 countries last year.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with 922,000 new displacements in 2016, topped the list of countries where this displacement was driven by conflict while 7,434,000 people in China were forced to flee their homes due to natural disasters.

The UN refugee agency UNHCR put the number of refugees in 2015 at 21.3 million with 53 percent of those coming from Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria.

But despite the increasing numbers of the internally displaced people (IDPs), their plight was being overshadowed and becoming difficult to place on the international agenda, according to the IDMC.

“Absolutely, that’s one of our main regrets [IDP issue being overlooked],” Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, told Al Jazeera.

“Internal displacement is a politically sensitive issue. Refugees and migrants are driven by the fact that they arrive in Europe and put themselves on the radar screens of international and western policymakers. It is a visible phenomenon.”

More aid was spent last year on refugee resettlement than in the countries where the crises began, said the IDMC.

“The IDPs are behind the sovereignty of a country’s border and are far less visible. People tend not to think about them as readily as refugees and migrants.”

Numbers to rise

The total number of IDPs has doubled since 2000 and stands at 40.3 million as of December 2016. The numbers are likely to rise further if conditions stay the same as last year, said Bilak.

“Looking at the conflicts around the world as well as climate change issues, we don’t expect the numbers to go down anytime soon in either case [conflict or natural disasters]. The only way the numbers can decrease is if there is more investment on working on the underlying drivers that force people to flee – poverty reduction, peace building and climate change.”

The report also highlighted the intensity of the humanitarian crisis in Congo and how there is a “need for more development spending to be allocated to reducing existing vulnerabilities and future risk and for mitigating the longer-term impacts of internal displacement”.

Almost five million people were killed in Congo between 1994 and 2003 as a result of ethnic violence. Almost 19,000 UN troops are currently protecting Congolese people from violence in Congo amid calls by the United States to reduce that number despite increasing attacks and instability.

“That DRC figure really took us all a bit by surprise. Over the last four to five years, it was usually the Middle East that was consistently high on the list and DRC had fallen off the agenda,” said Bilak.

“It’s unrealistic to expect the international community to solve a problem as huge as the DRC alone. It’s a protracted crisis. There is very little humanitarian assistance on the ground in some parts.”

The Syrian refugee crisis remains one of the largest humanitarian crises since the end of World War II.

The number of refugees who have fled the country now exceeds five million, including more than 2.4 million children, and millions more have been displaced internally, according to the UN.

At least 23,544 civilians were displaced between May 18 and 22, 2016, added the UN.

“People say displacement is a domestic issue and should be resolved at a domestic level. Many see it as an encroachment at national sovereignty. Internal displacement requires its own set of principles and the approach is very different from the refugee and migrant issue.”

Additionally, many refugees returning to their home country fear the risk of being internally displaced once they return. Large-scale returns were mirrored by a considerable increase in the number of IDPs in 46 percent of cases between 2000 and 2016, according to the World Bank.

The IDMC presented the case of around 600,000 Afghans returning from Pakistan. UNHCR estimates that around half of them were unable to return to their place of origin.

Destructive floods and landslides in northern China killed at least 154 people and accounted for the majority of those displaced.

Typhoons, floods and landslides were the major causes of displacement in Philippines (5.9 million), India (2.4 million) and Indonesia (1.2 million) last year.

Jan Egeland, the head of the NRC, said the shocking figures show the need to focus as much on people displaced inside their countries than on refugees who flee across borders.

“Internally displaced people now outnumber refugees by two to one. It is urgent to put internal displacement back on the global agenda,” said Egeland.

A number of the IDPs, in search of improved conditions then cross over into a different country, said the IDMC. As a result, “today’s IDPs could become tomorrow’s refugees”.

“We know there’s an overlap but there is not enough data to be able to put a number to that phenomenon. We have the number of IDPs in a country but the minute they cross a border, not all of them appear on UNHCR registers. Many fall between the cracks. We know it’s happening. In Syria, In sub-Saharan Africa. It happens across the board.”","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/b7e48fab4f714eb19db66aebed5cc5ee_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['need', 'refugees', 'idmc', 'displacement', 'attention', 'displaced', 'refugee', 'idps', 'million', 'internal', '2016', 'number', 'world']",

Critics around the world are blasting Trump for his rashness, saying that his decision threatens climate stability, the U.S. and global economies, ecosystems and even civilization.

In this Mongabay commentary, scientists from around the globe offer their immediate responses to Trump’s Paris departure. We will continue to update this story in coming days, adding further responses from the scientific community as Mongabay receives them.

Donald Trump, who called climate change “a hoax” during his campaign, has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, rejecting a pact that is being honored by more than 190 nations.

The U.S. signed and ratified the agreement under President Obama, and it is a pact that is also heavily backed by U.S. and global corporations, including oil companies ExxonMobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell.

The U.S., the world’s second largest producer of greenhouse gases after China, committed in Paris to cutting its carbon emissions by between 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.

Trump justified his reversal of the U.S. commitment made to the world in Paris with the wholly unsubstantiated claim that the agreement is bad for U.S. business and labor.

The Paris Agreement aims at preventing dangerous climate change and keeping the world well below a 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degree Fahrenheit) average temperature rise over preindustrial levels. Studies have shown that the emission cuts volunteered by the world’s nations in Paris are still deeply inadequate for meeting that goal, and Trump’s move will only steepen the very difficult climb to climate stability and safety.

How much the U.S. withdrawal will endanger people and planet is uncertain, as no one can say how the departure will impact the actions of other nations, possibly causing some to back away from the agreement. Turkey and Russia, for example, have signed the pact but still not ratified it. So far, the world has stood firm in its Paris commitments, with only the United States, Syria and Nicaragua now not parties to the agreement.

Scientists over coming months will need to make a full assessment of the harm Trump’s decision will do to the earth’s climate, environment and ecosystems, and to its nations and people.

But for the moment, scientists are responding with deep concern. What follows are reactions from scientists in a wide variety of disciplines in the U.S. and around the world. Over the next several days, Mongabay will continue to update this article, publishing additional comments from the scientific community to Trump’s decision.

For the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Accord would have catastrophic consequences for the natural world, accelerating species extinctions worldwide.

About 20 years ago the effects of changing climate became evident nearly everywhere I went in the world. Most of my travels are to temperate and tropical coasts, coral reefs, and polar systems. At home in the Northeast U.S., climate-related changes to marine-life distributions are also evident.

The United States has long lagged at solutions, ceding leadership on clean energy technology to Europe and especially China. But it is one thing for our nation to fail to lead, or to come grudgingly along with mainstream science. But it is quite another thing for a man with no qualifications and no apparent grasp of information or the issue to simultaneously undermine world consensus and abandon world leadership.

There are no words for how horrifying it is to watch my country embarrass itself on the world stage and so severely injure its status and standing in the eyes of the world. I’d like to see us make America great again.

— Carl Safina, Ph.D., Endowed Professor for Nature and Humanity, School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences

The Paris agreement was a remarkable achievement involving unanimous agreement among over 190 countries. The way the UN operates is to achieve unanimity, which is a major problem. It means that it is impossible to put together binding targets. The whole of the Paris agreement is based upon goodwill. There are no punitive actions or means to enforce the agreement. The goodwill also includes the Green Climate Fund, to which the U.S. pledged $3 billion and has delivered $1 billion — but it seems unlikely [that Trump will] add to that. That alone undermines a lot of the good will. And it will be a major sore point in all the small island states and developing countries, who have not caused the problem.

The U.S. leadership was essential in Paris. If the U.S. does not lead by example — and we have a moral and ethical responsibility to do so as the largest accumulated emitter — then why should anyone else go along? Unless there is a universal carbon tax, fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest form of energy. It is not true, of course, because of all the downstream effects on air quality and climate change. So either some form of trade wars are realized in which heavy tariffs are used against the U.S. and other renegades, or the whole thing collapses and we all spiral into a race to the bottom, to see who can destroy the planet first.

Yes, other things are moving in positive directions, but not yet fast enough: ask India what they will do if they do not get technology transfer and help.

The U.S. cannot opt out without major other consequences.

Without the US and Paris, we crash through the 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degree Fahrenheit) threshold before 2060, perhaps a decade earlier owing to U.S. pullout. And this means increasing trouble with ecosystems being out of whack with the climate, trouble farming current crops, and increasing shortages of food and water.

But if Paris is fully implemented and feeds back on itself to a new energy economy, we can delay 2 degree C by 40 years, maybe. I believe that we will go through 2 degree C by 2100 regardless. But we can adapt better. It will be bad enough under the best scenarios, but [the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris accord] could be bringing doomsday forward by fifty to a hundred years.

President Trump should remember that the Paris Climate Agreement remains one of our best chances to protect the millions of farmers, ranchers, foresters, and manufacturers across rural America whose jobs are threatened by global climate change.

U.S. agriculture and its related industries provide about 11 percent of national employment — that’s 21 million jobs. Every year we produce nearly $330 billion in agricultural commodities, not to mention the U.S. forest product industry that is valued at $282 billion. By contrast, the U.S. coal industry employs fewer people than Arby’s (76,572 people in 2014).

Signs of stress on U.S. agricultural markets due to global climate change are already apparent. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, stronger windstorms and other climate change impacts exacerbate the stresses already occurring from weeds, insects and disease.

Severe drought cost California about $2.7 billion and 10,000 jobs in 2015 — a huge blow for the farming economy of a single state. Increased frequency and severity of wildfires puts our forest land at risk and strain our budgets by demanding more taxpayer dollars for firefighting.

And what about feeding ourselves? At a time when the world must find a way to produce 70 percent more food in 2050 than in 2006, we cannot afford the possibility of lower agricultural yields in the American Midwest, one of the world’s most productive breadbaskets.

The agriculture and forestry sectors play a complex and critical role in our country’s social and economic fabric. States, cities, businesses and citizens — both red and blue —must band together in support of those who work the land and push for ambitious climate action in the United States.

Donald Trump seems determined to turn a malfunctioning presidency into one that will, as confirmed by many observers, be considered disastrous.

Trump seems capable of almost any self-delusion — of convincing himself he is correct no matter the weight of evidence against him.

But to drag the U.S. down into his rabbit hole of bizarre beliefs regarding climate change is going way, way too far. For America to become one of only three nations on Earth that is not a party to the Paris climate accord is unthinkable, a bridge too far even for Trump.

This is the price that Americans are paying right now for electing this very peculiar megalomaniac as their president.

— William F. Laurance, PhD, FAA, FAAAS, FRSQ, Distinguished Research Professor, Australian Laureate & Prince Bernhard Chair in International Nature Conservation (Emeritus), Director of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science (TESS)

The rest of the world should pay no attention to the venal men who have temporarily taken command of our great nation.

The United States is suffering from a political disease that prevents us from showing the rest of the world and ourselves what is good in us. We will rid ourselves of this malady. America will be great again.

It will take time to undo the damage that the Trump Administration and his Congressional co-conspirators are doing to our nation and the world. But rest assured, that damage will be undone. The United States will work with the rest of the world to create a world where the poor become prosperous and where the environment is respected and protected.

The rest of the world must continue on its path to a better future. Today, we are lagging behind and moving backward, but tomorrow we will run ahead and help lead the way.

The Trump Administration and his co-conspirators in Congress are a historical aberration, the last dying gasps of a failed ideology. Future historians will see the Trump Administration and his congressional co-conspirators as tragic figures fighting a failed rear-guard action against the inevitability of historical progress. What is good in America will eventually triumph.

— Ken Caldeira, Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Global Ecology

U.S. President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accords is disastrous for the U.S. and for the other 194 signatory countries, including Brazil.

Brazil, where droughts and floods predicted to intensify in a warmer world, are already increasing in frequency, is one of the countries expected to lose most from climate change. Amazonia, where drought-provoked forest fires are rapidly increasing, holds an immense stock of carbon that represents a time bomb for the world’s climate if global emissions are not contained.

— Philip M. Fearnside, Ph.D., Research Professor, National Institute for Research in Amazonia (INPA), Manaus, Brazil.

Our withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord is shameful and is an abject embarrassment to not only our immediate past leadership but to all Americans who came first and exerted primacy for so many topical issues of vital health to our planet — from oceans and clean air, to biodiversity conservation and education.

There is hope down the road; it’s called elections and sovereignty.

— Joel Berger, Cox Chair of Conservation Biology and Senior Scientist, Wildlife Conservation Society

A lack of U.S. government support for the Paris climate agreement will mean that the United States will further isolate itself from international collaboration and cooperation on multiple fronts. It will affect U.S. security, the provision of jobs; U.S. business operations, and U.S. diplomatic efforts.

The agreement, because it has a broad basis of support, will continue with or without the United States. Many of the stipulations in the agreement further U.S. strategic interests, and cities and states will be hard pressed to fully carry out the diplomatic dimensions that the agreement brings with it. Many U.S. states and cities are centers of innovation, resilience and prosperity. Those [states and cities] will continue — as they work to meet the goals, aspiration and logical objectives under the Paris Agreement —but it will be harder for them to do so without overall U.S. government support.

If President Trump agrees to support the agreement there will be additional respect and receptivity to his administration and the United States in international circles. Members of the G7 and the Pope have encouraged the President to carefully consider supporting the agreement. Should he not support the agreement, it could potentially lead to colder relations with well-established partners for the United States and could mean that others could be willing to step in to increase their support and engagement as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Eyes will be on Europe and China in particular.

The Paris Agreement represented an unprecedented moment for a collective climate action plan. Because of the way that it is structured — with each country determining the best way for it to decarbonize and to revisit its progress in five year intervals — countries have the flexibility to be aspirational and inspirational. I anticipate that this momentum will continue.

The U.S. withdrawal will present a unique opportunity for China to provide some global leadership and goodwill — in much the same way that it did leading up to the Paris Agreement. China seems interested in doing so. So there is a clear opportunity for leadership in this space. That leadership could be one of taking concrete specific action to meet its [own national] obligations, but also by inspiring others to engage and work towards the benefits that the agreement provides for job creation, for prosperity and for a clean environment that protects its citizens. So the leadership space is one that is infused by action and by inspiration.

— Roger-Mark De Souza, Director of Population, Environmental Security and Resilience, Wilson Center, Washington, DC

Climate change is already happening. A world leader retracting from the Paris Agreement is no more than a short-term economical bet.

What is always surprising to me is to see someone thinking that climate change action is done only to protect the planet / nature, while such efforts should be seen as a major move for the survival of the next generations.

What Donald Trump and others like him do not understand is that the planet will survive the human race, with some important losses of course. But life will go on without us… The planet does not really need us to be saved.

On the other hand, we are currently building our own graves.

Humans will probably not survive climate change and its rapid modifications to complex environments that took us many centuries to adapt to, and to learn how to manage.

Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, before anything else, puts the human species at risk.

— Jean-François Bastin, Research associate at Université libre de Bruxelles.

In 2007 my research team and I projected that by the middle of this century we could lose two-thirds of the world’s polar bears if we continued our present greenhouse gas emissions path. By century’s end, we projected we could lose them all. This projection led Secretary of Interior Kempthorne to list polar bears as a Threatened Species. Polar bears reliably catch their seal prey only from the surface of the sea ice. Their food supply, therefore, depends on habitat that literally melts as temperatures rise — making them a great messenger about the dangers of global warming and its climate change symptoms.

The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 was great news. Earlier that year, we found that the northern Alaska polar bear population, the one I’d spent most of my adult life studying, had declined ~40% during the first decade of the 2000s. Reducing emissions to hold global temperature rise below 2°C, would mean the average temperature in Barrow Alaska would rise only about ~4°C rather than the ~10°C we’ll reach on our current path. Such a change in future warming could make the difference between polar bears surviving in parts of their current range or going the way of the dinosaur.

But the benefits of adhering to the Paris Agreement goes way beyond polar bears. They, in fact, are just sitting on the tip of the climate change iceberg. Across Africa and the Middle East, for example, where warmer temperatures and drying landscapes already have challenged human welfare leading to massive humanitarian and refugee crises, annual average temperatures are projected to be 3-5°C warmer by the end of the century.

Because a 1°C rise is associated with a 4-6% decline in wheat yield, a world that is 3-5°C warmer is likely to offer significant nutritional challenge for many of the world’s people!

At our current rate, end-of-century summer temperatures over much of the world will be hotter than anything we ever have experienced. Water availability for people, livestock, and wildlife, will be dramatically reduced and/or less predictable.

It is clear that if we fail to halt global temperature rise, numbers of refugees challenging the world’s national boundaries, including our own, will exceed anything we currently can imagine. If we meet the Paris goals, however, warming over the most populous parts of the world will be under 2°C and the future world will be a more recognizable and friendlier place.

The benefits of following the goals set in Paris are perhaps even more apparent in the world’s oceans — increasingly important sources of human nutrition. Following the Paris goals would mean sea surface temperatures would rise by only 1/4th of what they will rise if we continue along our current path. Likewise, we’d see 1/3 of the change in ocean salinity, 1/4 the pH decline and less than 1/3 the decline in ocean oxygenation.

The Paris goals, therefore, will minimize negative impacts on global ocean productivity — holding hope for continued human benefits from the sea. The bottom line is that the Paris Agreement charts a way to avoid the worst changes that future global warming has to offer. Striving for the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement will save polar bears and benefit the rest of life on earth, including ourselves.

The world’s ultra-rich, may survive and even flourish for some time in the dystopian world toward which we are now heading. However, if President Trump cares about the rest of us as he says he does, he’ll put America full force behind the Paris Agreement rather than withdrawing from it.

— Steven C. Amstrup, Ph.D., Chief Scientist Polar Bears International

A decision by President Trump to remove the United States from the 2015 Paris climate Agreement would be a shameful act of self-harm.

The decision would hurt everyone in the world, and poor people most, by making it harder to avoid a future of bigger storms and fires, disappearing coastlines, and tougher crop-growing conditions. But the most severe and immediate harm would be to the United States, which by banishing itself from the community of nations trying to prevent dangerous climate change would irrevocably damage its global standing.

The Paris Agreement will go on as planned, with or without US participation. Indeed, the agreement was ratified by countries at record pace in order to have it come into force before a possible Trump Administration — in hindsight a prudent maneuver.

And although there’s no substitute for strong federal climate policies, actions toward a safer climate will go on within the U.S. too, with state-level climate policies and increasing adoption of renewable energy due to technological advances and falling costs.

A decision to leave Paris would harm the U.S. in multiple ways. Americans would suffer more from climate-charged fires and floods. International rules on climate would be made without American input, meaning fewer opportunities for U.S. companies to take advantage of a growing low-carbon economy. But the biggest loser from this decision would be the United States’ standing in the rest of the world, where climate change is seen as the world’s greatest threat by most countries.

For years to come, millions of parents will attempt to explain to their children why Donald Trump didn’t want them to grow up on a planet with a stable climate.

The global goodwill which the U.S. has earned on climate will ebb to Europe and China, which have reaffirmed their commitment to climate action and the Paris Agreement regardless of what the United States does. It’s not just governments that would be more reluctant to deal amicably with the United States. Companies would be less likely to sign deals with American businesses than their overseas competitors. Individuals would choose to study, work, vacation, and buy their products elsewhere.

Leaving Paris would be part of a pattern by the Trump Administration of disowning U.S. leadership on multilateral issues that are too big for any nation to solve on its own: Global health and disaster response. Trade. Even defense. Each of these abdications in turn diminish America’s stature in the world even as they harm old friends who have counted on us.

But when future historians look back to pinpoint the exact moment when the US irrevocably ceded international leadership to others, leaving Paris will be it.

— Jonah Busch, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Center for Global Development (environmental economist). Dr. Busch’s complete statement can be found here.

The implications of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement are more intricate than what people have been fixating on so far.

1) There will undoubtedly be a countervailing increase in effort to reduce emissions on the part of Europe. When George W. Bush announced that he was not going to submit the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for ratification in 2001, it had the effect of dramatically speeding up the ratification process in other countries. In fact, his decision plausibly helped guarantee Kyoto’s entry into force.

The Paris Agreement is designed to encourage effective adjustments to this kind of development. All parties have committed to do all they can to keep climate within safe limits, and there are procedures to review what that takes and whether the accumulated commitments are adequate. With the U.S. signaling a retreat from the climate cause, the Paris mechanisms will induce many countries to dig deeper.

2) Even before Trump, the trajectory of U.S. emissions was driven much more by market conditions and local/regional politics than it was by what happened in Washington. What happens in Washington matters, but the bottom-line impact of the Trump-Obama shift, with respect to U.S. emissions, is probably less than people are fearing.

In that light, we can expect increased enthusiasm for subnational climate agreements, e.g. involving cities. If the federal government nails shut its climate window, other countries will pursue other venues for engaging the U.S., and agreements with individual cities, which have already proven useful, will become all the more attractive.

3) Proponents of geo-engineering will have a much easier time making their case now. Geo-engineering (e.g. reflective aerosols in the stratosphere) is not very popular right now — people prefer to reduce emissions. But we have continued talking about geo-engineering, largely under the premise that it may turn out that emission reductions may end up being insufficient. Trump’s move strengthens the argument that reductions are not sufficient.

4) Nuclear power is also more attractive to many countries. Many countries have already included expansion of nuclear power in their DNCs. But enthusiasm is muted, and some countries have chosen not to use them or even phase them out. All the nuclear plans that were just below the threshold of acceptability have now become acceptable.

5) People worry about the impact on research and development in the U.S., but the long-term effects are likely not so severe, even if the short-term effects will be very bad. During the battles over whether to phase out CFCs to protect the ozone layer, the French government opposed all such action and French companies refrained from investing in the search for substitutes. When the phase-out happened anyway, the French companies were not disadvantaged appreciably. They simply purchased access to the technology that other companies had developed (in one case buying a whole U.S. company). It would be better if we deepened investment in climate-related R&D, but a hiatus need not be catastrophic.

5) So on balance I think we have to look at this as part of a multi-player, multi-step strategic game. Trump has made a move that looks overwhelmingly bad. But how bad it becomes will depend on how everyone else reacts to it. Many of the reactions will offset the negative impacts.

Most of the world wants to reduce emissions and control climate change. Trump has not changed that fact. And that fact will continue to drive innovation and progress. We will see it manifest in some new ways — e.g. more treaties with cities, more exploration of geo-engineering and nuclear, and more roundabout pathways to relevant technology — but the incentives to solve this problem have not diminished in the slightest, and that’s what will drive progress.

I am writing this note at noon on Thursday May 1, 2017, anxious to hear President Trump’s decision regarding the Paris Climate Agreement. While I hear a lot of calming announcements that this is merely a symbolic act and that our economy is moving to effectively reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, I am not relieved. I hear about States and cities organizing to act deliberately and forcefully to meet the US commitment to the Paris Agreement, but I am not comforted.

As a climate scientist who directly engages in studying the phenomena and mechanisms of climate variability and change I am convinced that we are headed towards a different, and to many people hostile, state of the climate system, with a worldwide impact including many parts of the United States. Sea level rise will threaten many of the country’s major cities, many towns, and major transportation hubs. More frequent heat waves — a major cause of climate-related deaths in the U.S. and worldwide — will result in more casualties and damage, and the same fate will result from more frequent wild fires and floods.

All these changes are likely, and highly likely to occur because of humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels. In light of such possible dire consequences, do we take the chance that the act of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may do little to distract the rest of the world from its agreement in Paris? Or will the U.S withdrawal from Paris cause parties to drop out and thus risk dire environmental consequences?

Do we want the U.S. to join Syria and Nicaragua as the only two other countries that did not sign on to the Paris Agreement?

What damage are we causing to our national standing and our economy by turning our back to the rest of the word in its effort to move forward? What legacy are we leaving to the next generations who will have to deal with the consequences? How do we respond to a leadership that defies scientific knowledge and the opportunity for economic development embedded in the rise of new technologies?

All these thoughts are extremely disconcerting and depressing. Action is needed to respond to our rapidly changing environment and the global interest. Inaction on climate change is not a solution because due to the nature of the problem we cannot wait to act in the future and we must begin the implementation of the Paris Agreement now.

Avoiding reality under the pretense that “economic damage” will hurt the U.S. economy in the not so long run [is a bad idea]. If the U.S. government decides to abandon its Paris commitment, we must express our grave concerns and demonstrate to the world that we, as global citizens, are committed to joining in support of the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement.

— Yochanan Kushnir, Lamont Research Professor, Division of Ocean and Climate Physics, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, NY

As a climate scientist, and also as someone who is interested in non-fossil fuel energy, I view it as incredibly shortsighted from both a diplomatic and economic standpoint [to withdraw from the Paris Agreement].

Pulling out and reducing supports for clean energy and energy conservation such as fuel economy standards for cars and incentives to use solar and wind power will make the U.S. economy less competitive in the global marketplace.

The jobs in solar, wind and the auto industry are all relatively well paying, middle class jobs. Those jobs that can be done by robots are largely already in place.

If Trump genuinely wants to keep more high paying jobs in the United States, he should not pull out of the Paris Agreement.

— Dr. Dallas Abbott, Research Scientist at LDEO of Columbia University

Major cracks have appeared in recent months in a glacier in Greenland and an ice shelf in Antarctica. They are advancing and will soon release enormous icebergs into the ocean, one the size of the state of Delaware. And they will allow ice from the interior of Greenland and Antarctica to flow into the ocean, contributing to sea level rise. Coastal areas in the U.S. experience increasing floods, disrupting ports and airports, and interfering with the American economy that Trump clams to support.

And today a major crack appeared in the Paris Agreement. It threatens to release, not icebergs, but distrust and despair, and disruption of the mechanisms that had begun to slow down global greenhouse gas emissions. This crack — in policy agreements rather than in masses of ice — can be sealed, by efforts of other countries, and of states and cities in the United States, by actions of the corporations and organizations that sought to keep the U.S. in the Agreement.

The laws of physics indicate that ice will continue to flow from Greenland and Antarctica, at least as long as global warming is not abated. But the processes within global society are not as inevitable. With concerted action, the Paris Agreement can still be a vital force to preserve our planet from one of the greatest threats it has ever faced.

— Ben Orlove, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, New York

Eighteen months ago, the world felt hope when the global community came together in Paris to forge a path forward to halt climate change. Today, we take a step backward in disappointment.

The science is clear that human-caused warming of the planet and other climate change impacts are harming people, livelihoods and wildlife, and it will get worse unless something is done to curtail it. It is not just the climate scientists and conservationists who are raising this alarm; business leaders, economists and national security experts are urging global action to address climate change.

The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement creates a leadership void in the world that will be filled by other countries. The U.S. is ceding its historic role as an innovator, convener and global problem solver.

This is a missed opportunity for U.S. leadership and it’s a missed opportunity for our planet.

Thankfully, the rest of the world, and states across the U.S., will continue this effort. At WCS, we work with local communities in nearly 60 countries and all the world’s oceans that depend on healthy ecosystems and they are seeing the effects of climate change now; from coral bleaching and depleted fisheries to drought, infectious disease and invasive pests. Every day, we are working with these communities to address issues of deforestation and we are helping both wildlife and people adapt to the impacts of climate change by ensuring the protection of functioning ecosystems and the services they provide that support all life on our planet.

We all need to take further action to promote clean energy, wean our economies off fossil fuels, curtail deforestation, and focus even more on applied solutions to both the current and future impacts of a warming planet. And we must continue to push for a fully global response to the greatest of ecological challenges despite this setback.

— Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) President and CEO Cristián Samper

The Paris Agreement represents an unprecedented collaboration among nations who choose to work together to address climate change in their own countries and globally. Dr. Jane Goodall participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on Climate Change in Paris and, at that time, she called on each of us to take action ourselves to protect our natural world. Amidst all of the evidence and already occurring changes, threatening all living things in the oceans and on land (including humans), the Trump Administration is set on withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. In response to this, we must use Jane’s message of action as a beacon to call upon ourselves and others to make decisions to help in curtailing climate change — an agreement we all make with the planet and all the other creatures we share this world with to protect life.

The climate is changing, and not in a subtle or “cyclical” way. According to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate, predictions for accelerated climate change indicate that average global temperatures could increase between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (IPCC). Though that may seem “small,” the reality of this is several fold – causing alterations to global and smaller ecosystems varying between drought and flooding, increased frequency and intensity of storms, desertification, species migrations and extinctions, and reduced agricultural yield, just to name a few. Additionally, environmental refugees, scarcity, famine and conflict are sure to increase as these conditions do, and the economic losses due to climate change are massive, costing the global economy $700 billion annually by 2030 (Business Insider). The “greenhouse effect” is the main culprit, as the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trapping heat (NASA). We must reduce emissions and protect natural areas which sequester (trap) carbon, in order to prevent further and catastrophic warming.

The Paris Agreement

The Paris Agreement, established in 2015, enlisted all of the nations in the world, (with the exception of Syria and Nicaragua – who felt it was not “tough enough”) to pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to slow the consequences of increasing global temperature. Within the initial agreement, the United States committed to reducing carbon emissions by 26-28% within 10 years (White House Archives). A withdrawal from these commitments would not only endanger billions of lives, but will also portray the United States as detrimental to the progress and safety of international communities, environments and species.

“It would also devastate our international credibility. We are one of the two largest carbon emitters, with China. We are the ones who put this deal together. It is the first step to try to do something about climate change. For President Trump to take us out, it is anti-science.” – Nick Burns, former Under Secretary under the George W. Bush administration (CNN)

What Now?

Following massive movements like the March for Science and the People’s Climate March to underscore the necessity and integrity of science and science backed policy, we are even more aware how crucial it is to become informed about this enormous issue and to make it a priority in our planning, decisions, and policy as an international community. The Jane Goodall Institute has committed to protect forests and thereby ensure that stored CO2 is kept out of the atmosphere and that the trees can continue to absorb more. By protecting these habitats and biodiversity we can make sure these ecosystems remain healthy and ensure the long term survival of these forests.

We also work with local communities around conservation areas to create land use plans and determine how to best preserve forest, create forest reserves and build sustainable livelihoods. JGI has also been working with a REDD+ grant in Tanzania which allows heavy C02 polluters to offset their emissions by paying governments and villagers in developing countries not to cut down their forests, along with our forest monitoring project which is run by local citizens. These endeavors alongside our youth environmental compassionate leadership program Roots & Shoots in nearly 100 countries and our public outreach using Dr. Goodall’s voice (follow Dr. Goodall and the Jane Goodall Institute on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and our networks to increase awareness and grow a community of people inspired by hope to act, are ways in which we are addressing climate change and interconnected issues facing people animals and the environment, every day. Through a combination of individual action, our programs, and propelling movements demonstrating to policymakers that we will not accept apathy, we can change our behavior and better protect the balance of life on earth.

We Are Hope in Action

As the United States steps away from its commitments under the Paris Agreement and cedes its leadership role to other countries, we renew Dr. Goodall’s call for individual action. We see the power of individual action every day as people connect with one another and begin to drive real change. We see the power of this action as corporations make climate-responsible decisions that are both demanded by their customers and by their bottom lines. We see the power of you. Please join us to make our own climate agreements, to take action to make the world a better place for people, animals and the environment. Together, we will prevail.

— The Jane Goodall Institute and Dr. Jane Goodall

Back in 1897, the Indiana State Legislature was on the verge of declaring that, contrary to mathematical proof, the circle really could be squared (and, incidentally, the value of pi really was exactly 3.2), when solid arguments by a Purdue mathematics professor caused legislators to reconsider.

The physics of global warming is as scientifically irrefutable as the mathematical properties of the number pi. The world must warm as the burning of fossil fuels causes atmospheric CO2 levels to rise.

Warming will only cease when people take action to reduce CO2; no legislation, no executive policy and no political theory that does not lead to CO2 reductions can be effectual, for the laws of physics cannot be gainsaid. Scientists throughout the U.S. must repeat this message in every conceivable forum:

Climate change is not a hoax and those who believe it to be one need to reconsider, for inaction today endangers the next generation, both in America and around the world.

— Bill Menke, Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Earth Institute at Columbia University

This decision affects every living being and therefore requires an action from each of us. The long list of concerns, from animal extinction to sea level reaching cities has been widely exposed here and by countless credible sources.

Nonetheless, a stubborn man decided to overlook all of them — despite efforts from respected leaders to change his mind. To go beyond arguments, I believe the following actions should be taken by each of us:

Complain: Be part of social movements, post in social networks and talk about it. Companies and Governments will take actions to capitalize social discomfort.

Be part of social movements, post in social networks and talk about it. Companies and Governments will take actions to capitalize social discomfort. Reduce emissions: Emissions come from all of us. By avoiding consuming from companies with high carbon footprints and directly adopting eco-friendly habits, such as walking and biking, we can make a direct impact.

Emissions come from all of us. By avoiding consuming from companies with high carbon footprints and directly adopting eco-friendly habits, such as walking and biking, we can make a direct impact. Contribute to Environmentally Responsible Institutions: By donating money and being part of [the solution] we help create a channel to oppose at a higher level.

An unfortunate situation like this, caused by an unconscious man — who happens to be the president of a country that emits 15% of the world’s CO2 — can only be reverted with the actions of all of us. This is not only an effort to change a reckless decision, but also an opportunity to show that no man is above facts, and the desire of people and a community of countries looking for a better world.

Donald Trump decided to pull he U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

This is the wrong decision for America and the planet on many levels. First, it is scientifically ill-motivated, as the facts are clear; there is no alternate truth. The decision is also economically reckless, as the impacts of the changing climate have hit the U.S. hard already, and the current administration decided not to prepare the nation for it, at all costs.

The decision is politically a disaster, as it isolates the U.S. like no other move the current administration has done so far, putting the United States on a level with Nicaragua and Syria, the only two other countries not being part of the Paris Climate Agreement.

It is unclear what impact this step is going to have on the U.S. and the U.S. sciences and academia, but it is clear that it weakens and reduces America. However, as climate scientists, we will continue to do everything possible and in our power to improve our understanding of how the changing climate impacts the U.S. in order to better prepare the nation, as it is our scientific mission and our patriotic duty.

Deliberately oblivious to science and reality, the US administration has shown the very worst leadership behavior short of igniting a nuclear holocaust.

More than 25 years ago I told the head of UNEP “If you don’t take care of climate change you can forget about biodiversity”.

The biological toll of this decision will be devastating, but can be countered with good measures around the world and in the United States at the level of states and cities.

— Thomas E. Lovejoy, George Mason University

In a country beset by unprecedented droughts, wildfires and floods, rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms, ignoring climate change will in no way “Make America Great Again,” but instead threatens the food, water and security of us all.

— Richard Seager, Palisades Geophysical Institute / Lamont Research Professor, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University

This decision and the “bravos” from a certain —- minority — part of the US establishment is a return to darker ignorant ages and bring us back somewhere at the beginning of the industrial revolution, without the excuse of not knowing the many social and environmental havocs it will create besides generating wealth and progress.

[Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement] is ultimately a futile move that will really enter into force the day following the results of the next US presidential election in 2020. It is likely however to have serious consequences, and delay us in achieving our goals towards a tolerable (yes tolerable…) level of disruptions linked to climate change. I don’t need to elaborate further… anyone reading the news or the comments by eminent colleagues will understand.

The most frustrating thing, maybe, is that [the US rejection of Paris] will likely affect most the poorest in the poorest countries, and ironically, a large chunk of the US people who voted for Mr. Trump: the coal industry is dying and not because of the Paris Agreement but because of natural gas. There is more employment and growth in renewable energy than in coalmining. Also, US farmers will not be able to trade their carbon offset, potentially losing $1.8 billion of additional income. Coastal cities in the South of the US will be battered by storms or starved of water and the urban poor won’t cope.

Finally, I hope history will remember the US decision as not one by the American people, but as one of a bunch of losers living in a fantasy dream world. Wake up will be hard.

The move is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to bolster Japan's military role and its sales of defense equipment, especially in Southeast Asia, where China has expanded its own arms sales.

Hideaki Watanabe, head of the Defense Ministry's Acquisition Technology and Logistics Agency, said Japan will host a meeting Thursday with defense officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to discuss the sharing of equipment and technology.

He spoke Monday at an international arms exhibit near Tokyo that was attended by hundreds of defense officials and industry leaders from around the world.

Watanabe said there have been aggressive attempts by nations in recent years to change the status quo, in an apparent reference to China's building of artificial islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea.

“It is essential to maintain the open and stable sea under the rule of law,” he said. “Ensuring safety of navigation and flight contributes to the peace and prosperity of Japan and the international society. Japan's research and development of high-quality defense equipment contributes to the defense of Japan and elsewhere.”

Japan's defense industry at home is worth about 1.8 trillion yen ($16 billion) annually, a fraction of the country's 52 trillion yen ($470 billion) auto industry.

Japan had restricted arms exports under its postwar war-renouncing constitution, limiting joint research and development to the U.S. under a bilateral security pact. Since the 2014 easing of the rules, Japan now has joint research deals with Britain, Australia and France.

In order to scale up the defense industry, Japan's government has bolstered research funding to more than 10 billion yen ($90 million) this year.

Japan has been promoting the transfer of defense equipment to Southeast Asian countries to help their maritime security capabilities amid China's growing presence in the South China Sea, but deals have been limited to the sale of TC-90 surveillance aircraft to the Philippines.

China already exports mostly low-cost military equipment to many Southeast Asian countries.

The arms exhibit included panel discussions focused on missile defense. North Korea has conducted several missile tests this year.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:22:10 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/4480B641-3835-4448-82EA-EDE8DA71D16C.jpg,"['yen', 'expand', 'arms', 'southeast', 'seeks', 'japan', 'asia', 'defense', 'equipment', 'deals', 'research', 'asian', 'china', 'nations']",

River temperatures have long been an area of study, but until recently, the field has been hampered by technological constraints. Fine-scale measurements over large distances and long time periods have been difficult to collect, and research efforts have focused instead on average river temperatures, lethal extremes, and small-scale patterns. However, a suite of new technologies and methods, driven by inexpensive sensor technology, are enabling new insights, with significant implications for the future of river management. Writing in BioScience , E. Ashley Steel of the USDA Forest Service and her colleagues detail the effects of these new data and describe the ways in which the new information will assist future management efforts. Key among data-enabled innovations is the incorporation of measurements over time and space to create a holistic view of river thermal regimes that the authors dub the ""thermal landscape."" In natural thermal landscapes, there are complex patterns in which temperatures fluctuate over time, in slightly different ways, at every location on a river network.

The authors argue that a greater understanding of thermal landscapes could guide new insight into humans' effects on river networks. ""New data, models, and conceptual frameworks are providing insights into the biological implications of both temporal and spatial variability in water temperature patterns as well as illuminating ways in which humans have altered and are continuing to alter thermal landscapes,"" they report. Specifically, fine-scale data may elucidate surprising effects of thermal variability, such as enzymatic reactions that respond to fluctuations in water temperature in ways that could not be predicted using blunt measurements. The study of thermal landscapes is still in its early phases but insights are already leading to restoration actions such as reconnecting side channels and cool-water tributaries to floodplain main channels that are aimed at restoring thermal complexity. More research is needed to untangle anthropogenic from natural effects and to uncover the complex ecological responses to thermal landscape variability. ""Without this understanding,"" caution the authors, ""we may unknowingly continue to degrade (or fail to restore) essential functions of riverine ecosystems.""

He told the Security Council that ""strains on water access are already rising in all regions,'' noting that three-quarters of the 193 U.N. member states share rivers or lake basins with their neighbors.

""Water, peace and security are inextricably linked,'' Guterres said. ""Without effective management of our water resources, we risk intensified disputes between communities and sectors and increased tensions among nations.''



The secretary-general said the United Nations is ready to engage in preventive diplomacy to keep the competition for water from sparking conflicts.



Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose country currently holds the council presidency, noted that since 1947, some 37 conflicts have taken place between countries related to water.



""Our planet, the human family and life in all its myriad forms on Earth are in the throes of a water crisis that will only get worse over the coming decades,'' he said.



""If current patterns of consumption continue unabated, two-thirds of the world's population will be facing water shortages as a daily reality by 2025,'' Morales added.

Right now, he said, more than 800 million people lack access to safe drinking water and more than 2.5 billion don't have basic sanitation.

Morales, who presided over the meeting, said the limited availability of fresh water underscores the importance of tackling the issue and ensuring that access to clean water is shared and doesn't become ""a pretext for domestic or international conflict.''



British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the world has already seen what can happen ""when the waters run dry,'' pointing to drought in Somalia that is driving acute food shortages and threatening famine and a lack of clean water that is exacerbating the crisis sparked by Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria and sickening thousands.



He said the world currently is not on track to meet U.N. goals for 2030 calling for improved water security, access to drinking water and sanitation, as well as stronger management of water resources shared by countries.

In South Asia, Rycroft said, 1 billion people across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Pakistan rely heavily on just three rivers, but ""despite facing similar problems posed by water demand and climate change, regional collaboration between these countries is limited.''

Rycroft said Britain has provided $30 million over the past five years to support a regional approach to ""identify and resolve challenges affecting these transboundary waters.''



But to tackle the problem globally, he urged the world's developed nations to also invest in delivering improved water security within and between states.



In one example of regional cooperation, Ethiopian Ambassador Tekeda Alemu said that while there are differences between the six countries that are upstream and downstream on the Nile River, those nations negotiated for 13 years to produce an agreement on using its waters. It was signed by all six nations and is awaiting ratification by three of them.



""The cooperation between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan and the signing of the Declaration of Principles by the leaders of the three countries is also another manifestation of regional cooperation that needs to be enhanced further,'' he said.","Tue, 06 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/2596FA12-B0C4-4918-A90D-2674907A3361.jpg,"['water', '2050', 'warns', 'shortages', 'chief', 'guterres', 'countries', 'drinking', 'file', 'antonio', 'security', 'clean', 'secretarygeneral', 'serious', 'regional', 'nations']", 
51,51,FF-2019-000029-IDN,OVERVIEW GLOBAL BANANA MARKET - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2176943/overview-global-banana-market/,"Rainfall in Ecuador has pushed prices up. According to an exporter, US companies are not willing to pay those prices and are switching to imports from other Latin American countries. In Colombia and Honduras, this has resulted in export growth. Mexican exports are also on the rise, even though a smaller supply of organic bananas is expected. The Philippines is experiencing problems due to the unrest in the country, which is leading to reduced investments. In China, growers have been able to make a good profit from banana cultivation for a number of years.





Ecuador: Rainfall pushes prices up

Due to the heavy rain this season, prices are high. Some plantations have been flooded, which has an impact on the quality of the fruit. Last year, the country dominated the global banana market. A trader emphasises that good prices are needed to compete and for the sector to develop. He points out that growers are unable to invest in better working conditions if prices are too low. The minimum price set by the government is $ 6.26 per box; however, the price currently stands at 12 dollars per box. Many US companies are not willing to pay that price. According to a retailer, US companies therefore choose for imports from other countries, such as Colombia and Costa Rica. In any case, this exporter is concerned about the quality of bananas from other countries.





Since 1990, the Latin American country has had access to the Chinese market. The volume has since grown, especially in the case of baby bananas, which are doing really well. According to the latest figures, baby banana exports in 2015 amounted to 1,687 tonnes. A year later, that volume doubled to 3,240 tonnes. Up to April this year, exports stand at 779.99 tonnes.





Mexico: Delayed organic supply

The supply of organic bananas has been delayed by the cold temperatures recorded in February. Mexico is the year-round supplier of organic bananas for the US market. US importers are getting ready for the peak of the organic season, while taking also the market tightness into account.





Honduras sees exports rising

According to the Honduras Central Bank, exports have increased by 12.8% in the first quarter of this year, reaching $ 134.6 million. Although prices are under pressure, the country's profit increased by $ 15.3 million compared to the previous season, when the country made 119.3 million dollars from exports.





In terms of volume, the export figure amounts to 8.6 million boxes of 18 kilos. That is 13.1% more than in the first quarter a year earlier. According to the Central Bank, the increase is due to improvements in the plantations and new plantings.





Colombia exports to US and Europe

According to official statistics, 520,289 tonnes of bananas were exported through the port of Santa Marta in 2016. This export flow generated $ 248.6 million. About 28% of banana exports go through this port. With 30% of all shipments, the United States is the most important destination, followed by Belgium, with 23% of all exports. The third biggest market is the United Kingdom, with another 20%, followed by the Netherlands (11%) and Germany (9.9%). At the moment, work is underway to authorise the marketing of organic bananas.





China: End of growth in the domestic market? The country is the second largest banana producer and consumer in the world. By 2015, more than 14 million tonnes of bananas were consumed. The domestic production amounted to 12.9 million tonnes. Import bananas come from the Philippines, Ecuador and Costa Rica. With the country's economic growth and growing awareness among consumers about healthy eating trends, the banana market is expected to grow by 5% a year.

The cultivation is mainly found in the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan and Fujian. The total acreage is 270,000 hectares. In recent years, the situation has been difficult for the growers. According to estimates, only 10% to 20% of growers managed to make a profit from the crop's cultivation. As a result, plantations were abandoned and the total production decreased. The spread of Panama Disease only made matters worse. After three years, growers this season have a good harvest and higher prices. For example, in the Yunnan province, prices have risen by 0.8 yuan per kilo since the Chinese New Year and reached 3.0 yuan. However, growers are concerned about the growing importance of imports.

Filipino sector hampered by problems Although the country is one of the world's largest producers, more and more importers are turning their backs to the archipelago because of quality issues and social unrest. Philippine companies are worried and have asked the government for help. Companies have postponed investments. The government is working with a company from the Middle East to increase the acreage by between 5,000 and 10,000 hectares, but those plans have been put on hold. China, South Korea and Japan are the most important export markets. With the growing demand and developments within the ASEAN trading block, there should be more investment in the sector.





Indonesia expects good harvest Thanks to the favourable weather conditions, the harvest volume is expected to increase. Furthermore, investments are being made to expand the acreage. The main export markets are South Korea, China, the Middle East and Singapore. The biggest competitor in the region is the Philippines. The domestic market is also attractive, especially if international prices are low.

The Netherlands: Reduced supply keeps banana market The banana market is in a very reasonable situation for this time of the year. The supply is limited, which is keeping prices at a good level. Sales prices of yellow bananas oscillate between 16 and 18 Euro and that is very good for June. It is mostly the tight supply that is keeping the price stable, because there is an abundant supply of summer fruits, like soft and stonefruit. During the summer, banana sales are always a little lower. However, wholesalers hate the low price of bananas (99 cents/kilo) in supermarkets, against which they are hardly able to compete.

Italy: Banana loses ground to summer fruit In the summer months, the banana market stabilises. A trader in Naples explains that ""in the summer months, banana consumption drops drastically in favour of summer fruit."" Prices for bananas differ between wholesale markets. In Rome, the Cavendish cost 80 cents on 6 June. In Turin, the price for a similar banana was 93 cents a day later. Since the beginning of the week, the price rose by 0.03 Euro. Since the introduction of Fairtrade bananas in 2002, the market has grown to over 11,000 tonnes in 2016. An importer who has been importing these bananas from the very beginning has benefited from the growth in this market. ""We hope more importers will decide to promote Fairtrade.""





Israel discovered export market With a volume of between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, the Israeli banana production remains stable, despite reductions in the acreage in recent years. The cause of this decline lies in the extreme frost recorded in 2008. The production areas are located around the Galilee Lake and the northern coastal areas, where there is little chance of diseases spreading and a limited risk of extreme weather.

Almost all bananas are sold on the domestic market. The average consumption in the country is therefore higher than the global average. Israelis eat an average of 15 kilos of bananas a year, while in the EU, consumption stands between 1 and 10 kilos. The banana market is consequently lucrative and growers can afford to ignore exports. In recent years, however, exports have become attractive for organic bananas. Since 2008, a greater volume has been exported to the EU, which yields good prices. As a result, some growers are shifting their focus from the domestic market to the organic export market.

Retail prices on the rise in Australia In the 2016/2017 season, 396,000 tonnes of bananas were harvested, with a total yield of 600 million dollars (403 million Euro). The production is available year-round and is entirely sold on the domestic market. In March, growers feared hurricane Debbie would destroy the plantations, but reports from April show that the storm did not hit the main growing areas in the north. Queensland accounts for 94 percent of the 13,000 hectares of crops. Most of this acreage is found in northern Queensland, around the Cassowary Coast (Tully, Innisfail and Kennedy), south of Cairns, in Atherton Tablelands, and Lakeland, north of Cairns. Retail prices have risen in recent months to between $ 3.50 and $ 4.50 (2.30-3 Euro) per kilo.

The MEPs wanted to know whether organic food was healthier than conventionally grown crops and asked experts to look at the relevant research.

A report based on the review said a California study had found that children whose mothers had traces of organophosphate metabolites – the basis for many pesticides – during pregnancy were more likely to have “adverse mental development at two years of age, attention problems at three-and-a-half and five years, and poorer intellectual development at seven years"".

Another study calculated that an estimated 13 million IQ points a year are lost as a result of pesticides, which represents a loss of approximately €125bn (£109bn) across the European Union.

The report suggested this figure was likely to be an under-estimation, as it failed to take into account the possible impact of pesticides on diseases like Parkinson’s, diabetes and some types of cancer.

Sarah Mukherjee, Chief Executive Officer for the Crop Protection Association insists that pesticides are “safe”, and tells The Independent: “As the report itself acknowledges, they are only approved after extensive evaluation. Crop protection products are amongst the most heavily regulated products in Europe, taking up to 12 years and costing over £200m to bring an active ingredient to market.

Ms Mukherjee adds: “Year on year the results of programmes monitoring pesticide residues in food show that no consumers are exposed to residues at levels that pose a risk to their health.”

The experts also raised concerns about pesticide regulation. While they undergo “a comprehensive risk assessment before market release … important gaps remain,"" they said.

""At least 100 different pesticides … [are] known to cause adverse neurological effects in adults and all of these substances must therefore be suspected of being capable of damaging developing brains as well,"" they added.

Organic food, however, contains low pesticide levels and the “potential risks to human health are largely avoided”.

Professor Ewa Rembiałkowska, of Warsaw University, said: “There are indications that organic crops have a lower cadmium content than conventional crops due to differences in fertiliser use and soil organic matter, an issue that is highly relevant to human health.

""Organic milk has a higher content of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventional milk, although we cannot currently derive any specific health benefit from this.”

And Professor Johannes Kahl said: ""We find that people who prefer organic food also have overall healthier dietary preferences, including more vegetables, fruits, and wholegrain products and less meat.

""These patterns are also favourable from the perspective of environmental sustainability.""

For horticultural use, the extraction of peat requires the removal of a bog's living surface to reach the partially decomposed layers beneath. It grows at a mere sixteenth of an inch a year, and its mining removes layers that take centuries to develop. ""Peat is the best vegetative carbon sink we have on the planet,"" Highland says. ""Why dig it up?""

Highland developed peat-free mixes for seed starting, containers and general soil amendment, and he thought sales would ""go through the roof"" as gardeners around the world began to equate peat moss use with global warming.

In Britain, for example, using peat has become taboo. The government's environmental agency has said it wanted to phase out peat moss for hobby gardeners by 2020 and commercially by 2030. The London-based Royal Horticultural Society, the largest gardening organisation of its kind in the world, has reduced peat use by 97 per cent at its four major gardens and urges its members to follow its lead.

Highland, whose products are carried by Whole Foods Market, says he has seen steady growth in the past decade but not the explosive growth he and others had expected. On this side of the Atlantic, the ecological arguments against peat moss have been far more muted. Whatever the reasons, the issue has not seeped into most consumers' consciousness.

Peatland fires account for up to 5 per cent of human-caused carbon emissions, according to the United Nations, which last year launched a peatlands conservation initiative. Ulet Ifansasti

""I think the average gardener has no idea what peat moss is, where it comes from and whether they should even consider an alternative,"" Highland says.

Controversial herbicide

Of the hot-button issues seen by Sally McCabe, who manages educational issues for the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, peat moss concerns pale next to others. ""The biggest is probably Roundup,"" she says, referring to the controversial herbicide. She counsels members to minimise peat moss use. ""I always push the renewable stuff, particularly locally sourced,"" she said.

In northern Europe, dried peat has been used for centuries as fuel – raising its profile as a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide – and people live closer to ancient bogland that has been drained for agriculture and development. In Canada, by contrast, peat isn't used as a fuel, and its sheer acreage in less populated areas works in favour of its mining. Canada is the second-largest country on Earth and has 25 per cent of the globe's peatlands. The bogs are drained before harvesting, and the top layers of peat are mined with a large vacuum apparatus.

Peat producers make a persuasive argument that they are harvesting sustainably. (Canadian environmental groups I contacted had no position on peat moss.)

The London-based Royal Horticultural Society, the largest gardening organisation of its kind in the world, has reduced peat use by 97 per cent at its four major gardens and urges its members to follow its lead. duncan1890

The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association, representing 14 major producers, says that the industry has harvested about 73,000 acres out of 280 million acres of the country's peatlands and that the amount taken each year is a fraction of the quantity that is naturally generated in undisturbed bogs.

Paul Short, the group's president, says that for the past 10 years producers have been restoring harvested bogs by allowing them to re-flood and seeding them with shredded moss grafts that grow and knit together. The moss covers the harvest site within five years, he says, and the bog is ""back to a near-natural condition within 10 to 15 years"".

Acid-loving plants

The argument is convincing to horticultural growing media producers such as Karl Hammer, who uses Canadian peat moss in the mixes he makes for commercial greenhouse growers and others. ""Obviously, it's a resource that has to be used respectfully, but I don't see it going away,"" says Hammer, president of Vermont Compost Co. ""We should focus on using less gasoline, not less peat.""

Highland is unswayed. ""There are many ways to argue what's sustainable,"" he says. ""Any forest is sustainable if you plant more trees,"" but the original old-growth trees are gone. A mined peat bog ""is never going to return to its former self"".

The biggest environmental risk from peatlands is if they catch fire, which happened spectacularly in 2015 in Indonesia on land cleared for plantations. Ulet Ifansasti

If you're a gardener and you believe that using less peat is a good thing, you may want to reserve your peat consumption to container use and seed starting rather than the soil amendment and lawn work, which consumes larger quantities. Because of its low pH, peat is still a go-to amendment when planting acid-loving plants such as heathers, azaleas, blueberries and pieris.

For general soil improvement, I use mixtures of compost and leaf mold, either homemade or commercially produced. But peat? It's a no go. This meshes with advice from Britain's Royal Horticultural Society. ""We believe that using peat for soil incorporation and ground mulching is unnecessary and unacceptable,"" spokesman Garfield Myrie says.

By Abu Siddique in Dhaka

The government of Bangladesh has backtracked on plans to impose a carbon tax, in its budget unveiled on Thursday.

In the run-up to the budget announcement, the idea was floated as a way of raising revenue and addressing climate change. It was hailed by international commentators as a sign of leadership from one of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries to global warming.

But the only green initiative in the final version, presented by finance minister AMA Muhith, was a tax break for garment factories that meet international green building standards.

Officials from government agencies told Climate Home politicians did not want to risk increasing the cost of living ahead of an election scheduled next year.

Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), said: “The government has completely avoided the environmental concern though it was urgent to tackle the negative impacts of climate change, rather it focused on election by widening the coverage of popular schemes.”

What is more, Muhith doubled an import duty on solar panels from 5% to 10%, citing the development of domestic manufacturing.

Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, an independent evaluator of Green Climate Fund, criticised the mixed messages. “The government should decide what it wants,” he told Climate Home. “Sometimes it takes the initiative for tackling climate change and sometimes it goes against it, which is ridiculous.”

The World Bank estimates that if Bangladesh imposed a tax of $5 on each tonne of carbon dioxide, it could generate $2.4 billion annually which is 1% of the country’s GDP.

Zahid Hussain, lead economist of the World Bank office in Dhaka, told Climate Home the bank advised government to cap revenue at the same level as existing fuel taxes.

Under this proposal, the overall burden on consumers would not increase, just shift to discourage use of more polluting fuels. For example, he said, “some grades of diesel have high emission rate and it can have higher taxes per litre. This mechanism will ultimately reduce the use of diesel as well as emissions.”

But energy and transport interests lobbied against the proposal, saying it would hike costs.

According to the government’s power division data, around 30% of the country’s power generation is dependent on diesel and furnace oil, which is dirtier than natural gas. The Bangladesh Power Development Board in March announced price increases of 7% to 11%.

Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation currently charges 65 taka for a litre of diesel or kerosene, while petrol is more expensive at 86 taka.

Joynul Abedin, a member of Bangladesh Bus, Truck Owners Association, said: “We welcomed the government’s decision for not imposing extra tax like carbon tax as it would increase the transportation cost.”

Bangladesh is one of the most exposed countries in the world to the impacts of climate change, with millions of people living in low-lying coastal areas threatened by rising seas and tropical cyclones. The government estimated in its submission to the Paris climate deal adapting to these impacts would require $40 billion by 2030.

It contributes little to the problem: the carbon footprint of an average Bangladeshi is around one twentieth that of an American. Under its Paris pledge, Bangladesh aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5% by 2030 compared to business as usual, rising to 15% with international support.

As part of an informal grouping of countries on the front line of global warming impacts, it declared an aspiration to go further – ultimately aiming for 100% renewable energy.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2017/06/19209833621_16a2b0808f_k-e1496406158369.jpg,"['tax', 'climate', 'impacts', 'change', 'proposal', 'ahead', 'carbon', 'election', 'diesel', 'told', 'bangladesh', 'international', 'backtracks', 'world']",

But in 2013, newly elected President Xi Jinping announced that China's moment had arrived: It was time ""to achieve the Chinese Dream of great rejuvenation."" Couched in flowery terms, Xi's grand vision is to re-create the ancient Silk Road that made China a global trading power centuries ago, and to bind the world together in win-win economic relationships. ""Spanning thousands of miles and years, the ancient silk routes embody the spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit,"" Xi said at the Belt and Road Forum last month. Heads of state attending included Indonesia's Joko Widodo, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Russia's Vladimir Putin. The U.S. also sent a delegation.

China wants to make the 21st century into the Chinese Century, and its ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative is the key. It's a staggeringly massive development project spanning dozens of countries — the most ambitious global engineering endeavor the world has seen since the Roman Empire. The overland ""belt"" part entails highways, railways, and all their supporting infrastructure, including power and the internet, across multiple land routes from western China through Central Asia to the Middle East and Europe. The maritime ""road"" part consists of new ports, ships, and sea routes from southern China across the Indian Ocean to Africa and through the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. If all these projects bear fruit, trade along these routes will exceed $2.5 trillion a year. Already, China has invested $1 trillion in the project, and 68 governments and international organizations have agreed to participate. China is ""attempting to provide an ideological and moral alternative to the United States, the West, and liberalism,"" said Dan Garrett, a former Pentagon intelligence analyst. The goal is ""to return China to its formal (imperial) glory as the center of the world.""

Why now?

China says it wants to help the rest of the world achieve the economic miracle it has achieved. In the past 35 years, China has reduced the percentage of its population in extreme poverty from 88 percent to less than 2 percent. Clearly, though, the project is not altruistic. China must expand to foreign markets in order to maintain growth and provide jobs to its 1.4 billion people. Moving factories with excess capacity abroad will help the country reduce its supply glut, and Chinese companies will benefit in two ways: They will get most of the infrastructure contracts, and the new trade routes will enable them to export their goods more easily.

How does this affect the U.S.?

The Chinese have invited the U.S. to participate. But they see President Trump's ""America First"" protectionist policies as a great opportunity to replace the U.S. as the driving engine of global trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration, was designed to provide a counterweight to China's growing economic dominance in Asia. The largest regional trade accord ever negotiated, the pact would have created a free-trade zone for 40 percent of the world's economy, including the U.S., and required trade partners to adhere to American labor and environmental standards. When Trump canceled the pact on his first day in office, he said he was protecting American workers from a bad deal. But most economic analysts said the pullout left the U.S. with little leverage in Asia. ""There is a void that China's going to fill,"" said Max Baucus, a former ambassador to China.

What has been built so far?Beijing is finishing up a $590 million port in Djibouti, in East Africa, where the Gulf of Aden meets the Red Sea. Many projects have begun along the China-Pakistan economic corridor, including Pakistan's Port of Gwadar, near the Persian Gulf. One state-owned company, China Communications Construction Group, has already built 95 deepwater ports, 10 airports, 152 bridges, and 2,080 railways in various Belt and Road countries. Indonesia's high-speed railway is being built and should open in 2019. Over the past decade, Chinese construction firms have also been active across Africa and South America, building power plants in Ecuador, housing in Venezuela, and glass and cement factories in Ethiopia, to name just a few.

Will these countries benefit?

Yes, but at a price. China's state-owned firms have a big advantage over local companies in bidding to build these projects. And there are social concerns: China's own rapid development has been built on seized land and forced displacement of millions of people, and it may export that model. But the main worry is strategic. Host governments are effectively ceding to China control of very sensitive infrastructure, such as telecommunications and ports. Economic dominance can also serve to promote military goals. The deepwater ports China is building in Pakistan, near the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and in Djibouti, on the Red Sea, aren't just useful for trade: They can also provide Chinese naval vessels with ports and access to key waterways. Tom Miller, author of China's Asian Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road, says many nations participating in the project rightly wonder if it's ""a smokescreen for strategic control.""

Leading on renewables

China is also taking the lead on solar and other forms of renewable energy, investing more than any other nation — $88 billion last year alone. Already, six of the world's 10 biggest suppliers of solar panels are Chinese, including the top two. Last week it completed the world's largest floating solar array, built on the site of a flooded former coal-mining town. It expects to add 2.6 million jobs in the industry every year through 2020. This year it also plans to create the world's biggest emissions trading system. Now that the U.S. has abandoned the Paris climate accord, ""the world is looking for a climate champion,"" said Nicholas Stern of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.

Hundreds of homes in Knysna, a town of 77,000 people located on the tourist Garden Route 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Cape Town, have been destroyed by multiple fires triggered by the worst storm to hit the area in 30 years.

""The fire in Knysna is the largest and most destructive fire in a built-up area in the Western Cape in recent memory, with thousands displaced. It comes on the back of the worst storm seen in the Western Cape in at least thirty years,"" said Western Cape government spokesman James-Brent Styan in a statement.

A 3-year-old toddler died on his birthday alongside his parents as they tried to escape fire and smoke, local media reported on Thursday. His death brought the death toll from the storm to nine.

Other deaths occurred in Cape Town and parts of Western Cape Province.

On Wednesday, ocean swells reached up to 13 meters high (42 feet), flooded coastal areas and damaged cars and property.

Fire follows storm

A powerful storm packing gale-force winds, lightning and torrential rains hit Western Cape on Tuesday, felling trees, tearing the roofs off shanty houses and causing traffic chaos as roads shut. The national weather service has warned of flash floods in Cape Town and other low lying areas.

Nearly 50,000 people have been left without electricity.

In Knysna, many of the areas hit were in upmarket neighborhoods.

The military said it would send troops to patrol Knysna to prevent any looting.

Authorities also deployed helicopters to help put out the fires, but eNCA news reported that they have had trouble operating because of heavy winds and black plumes of smoke.

Fires also raised homes in Plettenberg Bay, east of Knysna.

Western Cape Province has been suffering from a severe drought, which is not expected to be eased by the storm.

after 15 months of renovation work, MoMA’s east section now features enhanced galleries and public spaces on three floors. on the third story, DS+R and gensler have reconfigured the existing layout to create two spacious galleries, while the historic bauhaus staircase has been extended to ground level to enhance access to the second-floor galleries. a first-floor lounge has also been added, while the café on the second floor has been renovated, and is now adjacent to a new museum store and an espresso bar overlooking the sculpture garden.

the overall expansion project will increase MoMA’s gallery space by one third, bringing it to a total of 175,000 square feet. the design seeks to optimize the museum’s current space, making it more flexible and technologically sophisticated. the scheme will transform the main lobby into a light-filled, double-height space that creates more intuitive circulation routes. in turn, this will allow the new western portion of the museum to be dedicated almost entirely to the display of art.

as part of the development, the MoMA design and book store will be lowered one level and made visible to the street through a glass wall — helping to make the building more open and connected with the surrounding urban fabric. the entire first floor will continue to be open to the public free of charge, including new gallery spaces. meanwhile, existing exhibition venues on the second, fourth, and fifth floors will be expanded westward through the jean nouvel-designed 53W53, which is currently under construction.

‘the museum of modern art’s renovation and expansion project will seek to reassure and surprise,’ says glenn d. lowry, director of the museum of modern art. ‘our curators and the architectural team have spent more than two years in conversations about the nature of our collection, the history of our installations, the continually changing nature of art, and our opportunities and responsibilities for engaging our audiences. the outcome of these discussions is a design that accommodates a global view and new perspectives on modern and contemporary art, and that embodies the metabolic and self-renewing nature of our institution.’

‘this project has called on us to work across MoMA’s rich architectural history, incorporating the museum’s existing building blocks into a comprehensible whole through careful and deliberate interventions into previous logics, as well as the construction of new logics that arise from MoMA’s current aspirations,’ explains elizabeth diller of DS+R. ‘this work has required the curiosity of an archeologist and the skill of a surgeon. the improvements will make the visitor experience more intuitive and relieve congestion, while a new circulation network will knit together the expansion spaces with the lobbies, the theaters, and the sculpture garden to create a contiguous, free public realm that bridges street to street and art to city.’

After all, this is the man who famously claimed that climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese.

While it will take around four years for the US to withdraw, the prospect is complicated by Trump’s claim that he wants to renegotiate the agreement – a proposal that European leaders were quick to dismiss. But the question now is who will lead global climate action in the US’ absence?

As I have previously argued on The Conversation, there are good reasons for China and Europe to come together and form a powerful bloc to lead international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

China is now the world’s number-one energy consumer and greenhouse gas emitter, and should it combine forces with Europe it has the potential to lead the world and prevent other nations from following the US down the path of inaction.

There are very early signs that this may be happening. Reports this week indicate that Beijing and Brussels have already agreed on measures to accelerate action on climate change, in line with Paris climate agreement.

According to a statement to be released today, China and Europe have agreed to forge ahead and lead a clean energy transition.

While it is too early to predict how Chinese and European leadership will manifest in practice, in the face of American obstruction they are arguably the world’s best hope, if not its only hope.

Decades of destruction

Trump’s announcement only reaffirms his antipathy towards climate action, and that of his Republican Party, which for decades has led attempts to scuttle efforts to reduce emissions at home and abroad. Let’s not forget that it was President George W. Bush who walked away from the Kyoto Protocol.

In just the few short months of his incumbency so far, Trump has halted a series of initiatives executed by President Barack Obama to address climate change. These include taking steps to:

Repeal the clean power plan

Lift the freeze on new coal leases on federal lands

End restrictions on oil drilling in Arctic waters

Reverse the previous decision against the Keystone XL pipeline

Review marine sanctuaries for possible oil and natural gas drilling.

And the list goes on.

This remains the real problem, regardless of whether the US is inside the Paris climate agreement or outside it. As the planet’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, what the US does domestically on climate change matters a great deal.

As a result, if China and Europe are to lead the world in the US’ absence, not only will they have to ensure that other nations, such as Australia, do not follow the US – and some members of the government hope they do – but they are also going to have to think creatively about measures that could force the US to act differently at home. For example, some leaders have already mooted introducing a carbon tax on US imports, though such proposals remain complicated.

In the meantime, while these political battles play out around the world, climate scientists are left to count the rising cost of inaction, be it the bleaching of coral reefs or increasing droughts, fires and floods.

High drama played out at the Poes Garden residence of late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa here on Sunday when her niece Deepa Jayakumar was barred from entering the house, triggering protests by her supporters.

Deepa arrived with her husband Madhavan around 10 am and staked claim to Jaya's Poes Garden residence but was stopped by security guards from entering into the house.

According to Deepa, she was denied entry by people working on behalf of VK Sasikala’s nephew and AIADMK Amma Deputy General Secretary TTV Dhinakaran.

AIADMK Amma camp sources, who were present at the residence, said Deepa made an unscheduled visit and wanted to garland a portrait of her late aunt kept in the front porch of the sprawling house.

Initially, Deepa was allowed to garland the portrait after which she wanted to enter the house, which was not permitted, they said.

""Suddenly, she wanted to enter the house to which we said we don't have the authority to allow. We also pointed to her that the house was locked and asked her to leave the premises,"" the sources said.

Incidentally, Deepa's brother Deepak was present in the house when she arrived.

Deepa, who founded the MGR Amma Deepa Peravai political front, claimed that her brother had called her to the property. She even claimed that her sibling should be 'punished' for 'killing' Jayalalithaa.

""I was stopped from entering the house. We are being humiliated. It looks like that Deepak Jayakumar has cheated us by joining Sasikala camp,"" Deepa, who had maintained a low profile since the cancellation of the RK Nagar bypoll in April, was quoted as saying by ANI.

""He (Deepak) is culpable like Sasikala. He killed Amma along with her (Sasikala). They did it for the money,"" she said.

Deepa's supporters then staged a protest alleging that she was blocked by supporters of Dhinakaran when she tried to enter the house.

As the incident sparked a controversy, police presence was beefed up in the posh locality amidst allegations from a section of reporters that they were stopped from covering the visit of Deepa.

Amid mounting tension, police allowed only the residents of the locality and their vehicles to enter the area and barred outsiders, including mediapersons.

The Poes Garden house was occupied by AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala, close aide of Jayalalithaa, till she surrendered at a Bengaluru court in February earlier this year to serve her term in the disproportionate wealth case.

There have been demands from the rival O Panneerselvam camp that the house be converted into a memorial. The front portion of the house where Jayalalithaa used to receive her supporters was thrown open to the public for some time in the aftermath of her demise in December last.

With the late CM having not left behind a will, her brother's children Deepa and Deepak are considered the legal heirs to the property.

This language disappeared from the latest annual G7 communique, signed in Sicily last month, while a similar G20 promise to end subsidies has no deadline.

Meanwhile, on the fringes of such promises lies the perpetual discussion of what the concept of fossil fuel subsidies does – or doesn’t – actually include.

Attempts to add up the annual global total range from a few hundred billion through to the massive $5.3tn estimate published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2015.

Carbon Brief takes an in-depth look at the ways fossil fuel subsidies are measured – and why semantic arguments over definitions may be missing the point.

The definition issue

There is no universally agreed definition of what constitutes a fossil fuel subsidy. Multiple organisations make assessments each using their own, unique approach. The huge range of estimates for the value of fossil fuel subsidies is driven by both the methods they use to calculate them and the countries covered.

From government spending on infrastructure, such as oil pipelines, to price controls on domestic energy, these organisations often count fossil fuel subsidies or support in very different ways. The table below breaks down how four major bodies make their calculations. These are examined in further detail below (as are producer, consumer and “post-tax” subsidies).

Consumer subsidies

The subsidies in most analysis can be broken down into two types of subsidies: those given to producers and those to consumers.

Consumption (or consumer) subsidies are those which reduce the price of energy to consumers, for example, through government controls on the cost of petrol or power. These have often been put in place to lower transport bills or help poor families access electricity.

Often calculations of consumer subsidies effectively measure the difference in the domestic price of the fuel compared to the global market price, although some consumer subsidies would not show up in this approach, such as those to help low-income families pay heating bills.

William Blyth, an expert in energy security and climate change policy and author of a 2013 report on fossil fuel subsidies for the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee (EAC), tells Carbon Brief:

“It’s very easy to tell in a particular country if a price of petrol is lower than the going rate, then that’s a clear measure of the [consumer] subsidy. […] It’s how subsidies are often done particularly in developing countries where governments want to make energy products cheaper for consumers, because it’s a popular policy decision, and that can affect, for example, petrol and diesel prices, LPG [liquid petroleum gas] for cooking, and so on.”

The trouble with this, says Blyth, is that consumer subsidies are, in fact, often applied to products, such as petrol, which only the relatively rich can afford. “That subsidy is coming from the general tax base.`So, in fact, what you see is that that subsidy is actually creating a transfer of wealth from poorer to richer people,” he explains.

Much of the global attention on subsidy reform has been looking at overturning consumer subsidies. However, as they are largely absent in richer nations, this narrows the focus of subsidy reform to developing countries. “That picture of the world tended to say energy subsidies is a developing country issue and it’s not really an issue for developed countries,” says Blyth.

The IEA: a consumer subsidy approach

In its calculations of fossil fuel subsidies the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) uses the “price-gap” approach, a method which compares domestic energy prices to the international market price and, therefore, largely incorporates only consumer subsidies. While the IEA collects energy data on almost all countries in the world, its in-depth subsidy data only covers the 40 or so developing world countries that it judges likely to have end-user prices for fossil fuels below our reference prices.

The IEA’s approach means it does not try to explain how or if producers are compensated by government for selling their products at a lower price. Instead it simply calculates the price difference and labels this a subsidy. This could have been provided via a direct budgetary transfer – which is usually considered a subsidy – or through a tax concession – which some don’t consider as a subsidy. Either way the IEA doesn’t report this.

While most broadly accept that what the IEA calculates can indeed be called a “subsidy”, there are some areas of discord. For instance, Assia Elgouacem, a consultant at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), tells Carbon Brief:

“One point of contention that emerges from the IEA price-gap approach is that a number of hydrocarbon-producing countries are of the opinion that the reference price should be based on the cost of production rather than on import- or export-parity pricing.”

The IEA’s most recent report put global fossil-fuel subsidies at $325bn in 2015 – just 6% of the IMF’s total estimate for subsidies for 2015, which included producer subsidies and externalities (see below).

Consumer subsidy reform

The IEA’s 2015 estimate was also down 35% from almost $500bn in 2014, a drop which the IEA said reflected lower fossil-fuel prices and a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in several countries, from Mexico to Egypt.

These concerted efforts in many developing countries to remove consumer fossil fuel subsidies are especially significant since government expenditure on such subsidies can exceed public spending on education or health in some countries.

In Indonesia, for example, spending on fossil fuel subsidies in 2016 is thought to have come to less than 1% of GDP, compared to over 3% in 2014, when President Joko Widodo implemented a series of reforms after taking office three years ago.

Meanwhile, in India, alongside other reforms, a campaign launched by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2015 encouraged rich Indians to voluntarily give up their Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) subsidy in order to “make a personal contribution towards nation-building” and help poor people to move away from burning firewood. Over 10 million people have already signed up to relinquish their subsidy.

A recent report from the Nordic Council of Ministers found that countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco and Zambia, who are already undergoing energy reforms, would particularly benefit from transferring funds that normally go on fossil fuel subsidies towards sustainable energy investment, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Production subsidies

Unlike consumer subsidies, production subsidies are those which make it less costly for producers to develop resources in the first place. They can include things such as tax breaks for capital investment, requiring a lower share of profits to be given as tax from developing a resource, public finance specifically given to fossil fuel production, and, in some analysis, investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

Blyth tells Carbon Brief:

“It’s basically giving more of the wealth which is generated from exploiting these fossil fuel resources to the producers, at the expense of the national government, which is the party to that kind of agreement.”

However, as Blyth explains, these type of subsidies can be hard to define. And as it is difficult to measure the effect of a particular production subsidy on the global price, they tend not to show up in the price-gap methodology used by groups such as the IEA.

With such a large array of ways of providing production subsidies, it can also be difficult – and contentious – to label what actually is a production subsidy and what isn’t.

This has proved controversial in several countries, including the UK, which claims it has no fossil fuel subsidies.

Does the UK have fossil fuel subsidies?

The UK defines fossil fuel subsidies as government action that “lowers the pretax price to consumers to below international market levels”.

Since a reduction in the usual rate of tax paid in a certain sector (such as North Sea oil and gas) doesn’t fit into this definition, the government says this isn’t subsidy.

Therefore, despite multiple reports highlighting how the UK gives frequent financial support to prop up its oil and gas industries, the government argues it is simply lowering the sector’s already higher-than-usual rate of tax and has no fossil fuel subsidies.

For instance, chancellor Philip Hammond recently announced new help for the North Sea oil and gas industry, also highlighting the “unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector through £2.3bn packages in the last three years”.

A recent Carbon Brief analysis found the UK’s North Sea oil and gas sector actually became a net drain on public finances in 2016, with the sector receiving an overall £396m in 2016, even when tax payments were taken into account. Another investigation released by Greenpeace and Private Eye in April found the UK had pledged £4.8bn in financial support to fossil fuel firms since 2010 through UK Export Finance, the government agency that supports risky export deals to boost international trade by providing guarantees, insurance and reinsurance against loss.

As Blyth explains, the reason the labelling of production subsidies such as those in the UK is so contentious is because they are in essence the result of a negotiation on how resources that are generated from exploiting oil and gas reserves are split between the private company and the country.

He tells Carbon Brief:

“That becomes a very individual sort of negotiation in most cases, and there isn’t really an international global standard against which to measure what’s normal…The way producer subsidies are defined is a deviation from the normal tax regime of the country. But the normal tax regime for the UK is different from the tax regime of Norway and the Netherlands and wherever else, so it’s not really possible to define what [deviation from normal] means globally.”

It’s worth noting that in the same FOI document quoted above, the government said it had given over £4bn in direct subsidies to renewables in 2014 to 2015.

In some ways, this goes to the heart of the debate over fossil fuel and renewables subsidies in developed countries, which often amounts to the issue of comparing often direct payments given to renewables to the tax breaks, reduced-rate VAT, investment support or even unpaid externalities which are used to support fossil fuel production.

The OECD: an inventory approach to production subsidies

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – a collective of 34 democracies with market economies which aims to stimulate economic progress and world trade – reports on fossil fuel “support mechanisms”. Its estimates broadly cover producer support to fossil fuels in the 34 OECD countries and a handful of large partner economies, such as Russia, India and China.

The OECD uses the term “support”, which it says is deliberately broader than some conceptions of “subsidy”, in a bid to get away from debates over what is and isn’t included.

Unlike the IEA, the OECD uses an “inventory” approach to provide a bottom-up breakdown of the policies and instruments governments are using to support or provide preference for fossil fuels in some way over alternatives. This could include, for example, the use of budget support to provide tax breaks or consumption subsidies for diesel. “For that you have to go into the detail of national tax regimes for the oil and gas sector etc, and it’s quite a detailed study,” says Blyth. It’s worth noting that the OECD does not try to strictly quantify the total amount spent on fossil fuel support, although the OECD is clear it does endeavour to be as complete as possible, especially for OECD countries.

According to Ronald Steenblik, a trade policy analyst at the OECD, totalling up the IEA and OECD estimates is a reasonable way to approximate the spend on worldwide support to fossil fuels. He tells Carbon Brief:

“A golden rule for inter-governmental organisations is ‘thou shalt not duplicate work that other organisations do’. So the OECD’s estimates complement the information provided by the IEA…There is a bit of overlap between [the two] estimates – mainly regarding Mexico and India (we are working with the IEA to eliminate those) – but, otherwise, adding the two sets of estimates together yields a rough approximation of most of the world’s support to fossil fuels.”

Shelagh Whitley, head of the climate and energy programme at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a UK-based thinktank which publishes regular reports on fossil fuel subsidies, says the OECD’s approach is actually the most practical instruction manual for those seeking reform.

This is because it gives specific policy-by-policy information on what can be changed; whether that be a certain type of support in a particular state or region, through to an oil field or mine. “The other institutions are looking more at data that can shape government policy or can shape international policy,” she says.

The OECD’s most recent inventory in 2015 catalogued almost 800 individual measures in the 41 mainly developed countries it covers. These had an overall value of $160bn-$200bn per year between 2010 and 2014. The OECD noted such support “seems to follow a downward trend” – again both because of low oil prices and policy signals from governments.

The closest thing to a definition

The OECD bases its inventory on the World Trade Organisation (WTO)’s 1994 definition of fossil fuel subsidies – the only internationally agreed definition of the term.

It labels subsidies as a “financial contribution by a government” which “confers a benefit” on its recipient. It specifically includes grants, loan guarantees, tax breaks and the provision of goods or services by the government in its definition. As noted above, some governments such as the UK sideline this definition, by arguing their tax breaks are not subsidies.

Like the OECD, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) (see above) uses the WTO definition in its reports on fossil fuel subsidies. However, it goes over and above the types of producer subsidies included in the OECD inventory to include public finance (such as loans given by majority state-owned banks) and investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in fossil fuels.

In its 2015 report on G20 subsidies to oil, gas and coal production, the ODI – in collaboration with Oil Change International (OCI) – found these amounted to $452bn a year, over twice the amount in the OECD’s inventory. (The report also singled out the UK for substantially increasing support for fossil fuels production in recent years to prop up its increasingly uneconomic domestic industry.)

Blyth argues much of the reason behind this higher value comes down to what is defined as “normal” and, therefore, what deviations from the normal are.

For instance, he says, the OECD tends to say things such as tax breaks on capital investment for decommissioning of old oil rigs are managing the end of life rather than production subsidies. The ODI/OCI study, on the other hand, says any sort of tax break – even for decommissioning old oil rigs – would still count as a subsidy, since this lowers the overall cost to the industry.

(It’s worth noting here that the OECD is currently in the process of updating its inventory, with the new version set to be released this autumn. According to the OECD, this will include a method for measuring the “subsidy-equivalent” of concessional loans and loan guarantees along with some examples.)

The ODI analyses often concentrate mainly on economies with producer rather than consumer subsidies, with its reports looking at blocs such as the G20 and the EU. In its most recent report, released last month, it found 10 EU member states had given an average of €6.3bn per year in subsidies to coal over the past decade. Six of these had even introduced new subsidies – worth a collective €875m per year – to support the coal sector since 2015, the year the Paris Agreement was made.

The list of organisations calculating subsidies in one way or another goes on, with calculations by a raft of others including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, alongside many non-profit or research bodies, such as the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Bankwatch and Influence Map.

But there is one organisation which a few years ago took a more radical (and fiercely debated) approach to calculating fossil fuel subsidies: the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF stirs it up

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), conceived at a UN conference in 1944, is a Washington DC-based body of 189 nations which works to promote international economic cooperation and standardise exchange rates. Its mandate was updated in 2012 to include all macroeconomic and financial sector issues that bear on global stability.

Back in the lead up to the UN Paris climate conference in 2015, the IMF released a major working paper which reignited the discussion over the worldwide cost of fossil fuel subsidies.

The report estimated that the world would be spending a colossal $5.3tn on energy subsidies in 2015, with most of this supporting fossil fuels. Equal to $10m a minute, this is an amount greater than the total annual healthcare spend by all the world’s governments. It is also around ten times the IEA and OECD values combined.

If all these subsidies were eliminated, the paper said worldwide government revenue could be raised by $2.9tn, around 4% of the global economy in 2015. Meanwhile, global CO2 emissions would be cut by over 20% and air pollution deaths more than halved, it said.

These are huge numbers. However, as several commentators noted, the IMF’s report looked at something rather different than most of the other attempts to add up subsidies to the energy sector. This is because it was one of first estimates of energy subsidies which incorporated “externalities” (or, as it called them, “post-tax subsidies”) into its calculations.

The IMF paper effectively said that any failure to factor in the full costs of using fossil fuels should be counted as a subsidy. This included any financial burden which fell on society due to the effects of air pollution or climate change caused by using fossil fuels. Removing these subsidies would, in practice, mean increasing the price of energy to cover the full health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels.

The paper, concluded all this made its calculation an “extremely robust” estimate of the true cost of fossil fuels – and how much they were being propped up by governments. It’s worth noting here that this “working paper” represented the views only of the authors and not of the IMF as a whole).

According to Blyth, the IMF report was important as it brought together the subsidy debate and carbon pricing debate, which had previously taken place in parallel. He says:

“Basically, what they’re saying is that the new normal should be to include, for example, carbon prices and carbon taxes into the price of the fuel, so that you’re paying for the external environmental damages and so on within the price of that fuel. And if that’s not priced in then that’s counted as a subsidy. That’s really changing the game in terms of subsidy definition.”

The grid below gives a basic breakdown of the types of subsidy (or otherwise) covered by the four main organisations covered in this piece.

Can externalities be subsidies?

The IMF report prompted much debate on whether externalities can really be labelled as subsidies. “[T]here is something rather Orwellian about describing a failure to tax something as a subsidy,” wrote Sam Bowman in the Daily Telegraph. “Rebranding externalities as subsidies might make for good headlines in the left-wing press, but it also makes for stifled debate and woolly thinking.”

Brad Plumer in Vox, meanwhile, pointed out that even if you accept the premise of allowing externalities to be subsidies, the IMF included some that are pretty tenuous to say are caused by fossil fuel use, such as traffic fatalities and congestion. Still, it’s worth pointing out that the lion’s share of the cost of externalities in the IMF report were from global warming and air pollution.

Others rejected the IMF’s inclusion of consumption subsidies, such as lower-than-typical VAT rates (as occurs in the UK, where the VAT rate on gas and electricity is just 5% compared to the standard 20%). “They’ve simply assumed that everything consumed in the economy should be paying much the same tax rate in order to raise revenue to pay for government,” wrote Tim Worstall in Forbes. “This just isn’t what we would normally describe as a subsidy although we can, if we want to, stretch the meaning to include it. However, do note that this means that renewables are gaining very much the same subsidies.”

(It’s worth noting that some experts, including Blyth, do consider reduced VAT rates a consumer subsidy. “The UK is almost unique in the OECD countries in having such a low VAT rate,” he tells Carbon Brief. “Normal economic theory would say that you should as far as possible keep the same VAT rates across all products. So that means, in my view, that it is subsidies.”)

But many also rallied to praise the inclusiveness of the IMF report, which some viewed as illuminating the unfair wider financial support with which fossil fuels are often privileged. Nicholas Stern, climate economist at the London School of Economics and author of the influential 2006 Stern review, said the report “shatter[ed] the myth that fossil fuels are cheap” by showing “just how huge their real costs are”.

According to Blyth, one of the most interesting things about the IMF calculation was to see how much the scale of the externalities – whether or not they are acknowledged as subsidies – tended to dominate that of subsidies under their normal definition.

For instance, the figures for air pollution and global warming externalities alone added up to over $4tn, compared to just $333bn for the more conventional forms subsidies (“pre-tax subsidies”). Blyth says:

“I think it puts it into a wider context: ultimately, the community of analysts and so on who are trying to push against subsidies are, ultimately, doing it for environmental reasons, so I think it puts the whole thing on a common sort of footing.”

What’s in a pledge?

Fossil fuel subsidies have featured on and off in G7 statements since 2009 (at the time G8, before Russia’s ejection), but 2016 was the first time the group had set a concrete deadline for phase out.

But while campaigners cautiously welcomed this 2025 pledge, many urged the G7 to go further by agreeing on a comprehensive phase out of fossil fuel subsidies by 2020. Now, with this pledge dropped from the latest communique last month, it remains unclear whether or not erasing fossil fuel subsidies will remain a priority for the G7. (The 2025 pledge was included, though, in the communique issued today by the G7 environment ministers meeting in Bologna.)

In March, though, G20 countries affirmed their commitment to phasing out “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption” (essentially a nod to consumption subsidies). Their communique also included for the first time a call for all G20 countries to undergo a peer review of such subsidies. (It’s worth noting that the UK has declined to take part in this, arguing it does not need to since under its own definition of fossil fuel subsidies it doesn’t have any).

However, the G20 pledge continues to address only a “medium term” phase out despite calls from climate vulnerable nations to set a deadline for this, preferably of 2020.

The table below sets out the statements on fossil fuel subsidies given by both the G20 and the G7 each year since 2007.

For instance, a detailed study released this year by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) looking at the impacts of US government subsidies on oil production and CO2 emissions found that, even at today’s low oil prices, almost half of the new oil fields in the US depend on them in order to go ahead. The report estimated these subsidies could shift about 20bn barrels’ worth of still-undeveloped oil reserves from unprofitable to profitable. Once burned, this oil would emit around 8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2 – about 1% of the world’s remaining carbon budget under the Paris Agreement’s 2C target, the SEI said.

It’s worth noting that the US has already undergone its fossil fuel subsidy peer review under the G20 – as has China – and has itself identified 16 subsidies it gives to fossil fuel producers. However, Peter Erickson, a co-author of the SEI report, tells Carbon Brief he would be “surprised” if the new administration under Donald Trump continues to look as closely at these subsidies as past administrations have.

To review: the U.S. Govt lists 16 subsidies to fossil fuel producers. Somehow @RexTillersonHQ wasn’t “aware” of this https://t.co/rydQpVYorv pic.twitter.com/n3FAfwmpKi — Peter Erickson (@SEI_Erickson) January 11, 2017

The ODI also looks into the climate impacts of fossil fuel subsidies. Another of its reports, released in February in collaboration with the Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI), estimated that a complete removal of subsidies to fossil fuel production globally would reduce the world’s emissions by 37GtCO2 between 2017 and 2050. At an average of 1.1GtCO2 per year, this is the equivalent of eliminating all emissions from the aviation sector, the report said.

But even in the case of agreement to phase out such fossil fuel subsidies, there is a need for agreement as to what counts within this – and what doesn’t. The G20 and G7 have no concrete definition of what should be included, leaving the door open to arguments – see the UK – that certain types of support for fossil fuels simply don’t count.

The multitude of different organisations looking at subsidies using different approaches, arguably, doesn’t help this debate. As Whitley argues, the issue is not necessarily that organisations disagree on the “definition” of a subsidy – it is simply that they are looking at different types of support, often in different countries. Ultimately, she tells Carbon Brief, the definition argument is beside the point:

“The issue is not whether or not [countries] by definition have subsidies. The issue is whether they are providing support to fossil fuels when they have pledged to end the use of fossil fuels under the Paris Agreement.”

The point, she says, is that governments are using a range of tools to provide support for those developing fossil fuels. And these tools are important to identify, not just to see a shift away from this support, but also to allow those same tools to be used to support other things, such as green energy. She says:

“We’re often told by governments we don’t have resources, we don’t have the funds to support green energy, we don’t have the money to give to climate finance. But actually if you look at the tools that are used for our current energy system a lot of that is to support fossil fuels and those tools are there.”

The question then becomes not whether this or that tax break counts as a “subsidy”, but whether governments are gearing their full support towards decarbonising their countries’ energy systems in order to avoid dangerous temperature rises, as they have promised to do in the Paris Agreement.

This article was updated on 26 June to clarify that the IMF report referred to was a working paper which did not necessarily represent the views of the IMF. Additionally, it was updated to say that not all consumer subsidies will be captured by the price-gap approach and to further clarify the IEA’s methodology.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-472900240.jpg,"['tax', 'oecd', 'fossil', 'challenge', 'energy', 'subsidy', 'countries', 'defining', 'explainer', 'fuel', 'oil', 'support', 'subsidies']",

In a major security scare, a rocket landed today inside the India House, the country's Embassy in Kabul, but there were no reports of any injury, External Affairs Ministry sources in Delhi said.

According to sources, the rocket landed in the volleyball court of the compound. Apart from the Indian Ambassador's residence, other mission staff also stay inside the premises. ""No injury reported so far,"" a source said in New Delhi.

The incident happened at about 11:15 AM, according to local reports.

The compound is in the heavily fortified diplomatic quarter, in Kabul, which houses a number of embassies, guesthouses and Resolute Support headquarters.

The attack comes amid extremely tight security in the capital following last week's deadly explosions that claimed over 150 lives and coincides with the launch of the Kabul Process meeting this morning.

Representatives from at least 23 countries, including India, are participating in the meeting aimed at establishing peace in the country.

Meanwhile, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani today revised the death toll from Wednesday’s deadly truck bombing, and put the total killed at over 150.

Sebastian Unger: First and foremost, the concept of ""governance"" means how we make decisions for dealing with the ocean sustainably. That encompasses much more than governing and regulating. It involves mixing hard, legal, international state obligations with civil society processes and actors. Everything taken together plays a really important role in deciding how we should deal with the oceans.



How are the seas divided up? In other words, who owns what and which rules are at play?





Sebastian Unger heads up the ocean governance department at the IASS

The oceans have a kind of constitution, the Law of the Sea Convention. The treaty divides the seas into different zones. First, there is the 12 nautical mile zone, which is basically [the coastal] waters that belong to a state. Governments exercise sovereign powers here similar to those on land.

When we go further out, the sovereignty of various states decreases. In so-called ""Exclusive Economic Zones,"" we deal with the use of the ocean's natural resources. In these areas, shipping is regulated by a UN organization. Fisheries beyond territorial waters are also regulated by international agreements.

It's a very fragmented system. Finding agreement is difficult.



What does that mean for the oceans? Does that mean that anyone can do what they want at a certain distance from the coast because nobody can really check?



There are fewer concrete rules the further one moves away from the coast. Still, there has to be some kind of management of the areas that enjoy the ""freedom of the high seas.""

Consider fisheries, for instance. We currently estimate that nearly 90 percent of global fish stocks are being either overfished or exploited to the brink of what is sustainable. There are restrictions here.





It's going to take more than cleaning up our beaches to stop ocean pollution

What shape do those take?



The Law of the Sea Convention includes the obligation to protect the oceans. We have to - and that is enshrined here - find a balance. States have the right to use these maritime areas, but at the same time they are obligated to protect them.

But the instruments at our disposal still aren't sufficient to implement that. That's partly because the instruments we already have - with regard to fisheries or deep sea mining, for instance - don't communicate with each other. On the other hand, there are major legal gaps.

For the high seas - or the areas beyond state sovereignty - we don't have any instruments to protect biodiversity. And the high seas cover almost half of the earth's surface.



How do you manage such a huge area?



Currently, two important processes are taking place. Both started in 2012 at the major Rio+20 sustainable development conference. States managed to decide to create a legally binding instrument to protect biodiversity on the high seas. A negotiation process is now underway to identify what would be needed for a new agreement on the protection of the high seas, and to then bundle together topics that would lead to an official negotiation conference. The conclusion of such a conference would be a corresponding agreement to protect the high seas.

The other process is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It's important not just for the oceans, but for sustainable development as a whole. It deals with fighting poverty, food security and the question of how the oceans can be used sustainably. The oceans are understood here as a central component of sustainability, and that's important to tackle topics like marine pollution and to find ways to fight the effects of global warming on the oceans.





Germany as one of the world's largest fish markets has to push for sustainability

How can you monitor whether all countries who have signed up to such agreements actually adhere to them?



Fortunately, there are some developments here to ensure obligations don't remain mere declarations of intent. For instance, with regard to fisheries, states can use something called Port State Control to check where the fish have come from and which boats were used to transport them.

With one of the largest fishing markets in the world, Germany has a major responsibility to support and push measures for sustainability in the industry. Consumers have a great responsibility, too, in deciding which fish to buy and how the fish is caught on the high seas.

Beyond that, there is, of course, modern technology - satellite surveillance and communications systems, which can monitor ships. To what extent criminal activities are actually prosecuted is another question.



Do we need trailblazers to encourage other countries in order to push sustainability and awareness?



I think that's really important. And there are plenty of good examples, many of which are in developing countries. Take the small island nations. For them, ocean protection is right at the top of the political agenda because it's vital for their survival. These countries are developing very innovative approaches, including with regard to sustainable financing of climate protection. These approaches will also be addressed at the UN Oceans Conference in June. This is the first large UN conference entirely dedicated to ocean protection. States and other actors are being called on to help achieve sustainability targets for the ocean with voluntary commitments.





Low-lying island nations, like the Marshall Islands - pictured here after flooding - are particularly vulnerable to climate change and keen to protect the oceans

Could you name a few examples here?



The seas, fish and marine pollution don't adhere to national borders and zones. States therefore have to work together in ocean regions. The project Fish-I for Africa is an example. It sees various coastal patrols and criminal prosecutors working together to combat illegal fishing. Such regional approaches are very promising and should continue to be supported.



We've yet to talk about ocean pollution - where do we have to focus if we want to tackle it successfully?



We have to be realistic: If we want to get a handle on the ocean garbage problem, collecting trash on the beaches isn't enough. We have to act earlier and stop the trash from coming into existence in the first place. The majority of trash in the sea originates on land. It's directly tied to economic growth. The more an economy grows, the worse the trash problem gets. That applies to countries like China, India and Brazil, as well as for Germany.

We have to establish a circular economy and recycling systems in the centers of economic growth. To achieve sustainable development goal 14, we also have to make big strides in reaching sustainable development and production. This is absolutely key to protecting the oceans. What we do at home, what we do in large urban areas is crucial to the future of our oceans.

The ministry issued a statement saying that 22-year-old Syaikhah Izzah Zahrah al-Ansari was arrested earlier this month under the country's Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial. Singaporean authorities have detained 14 male Singaporean suspected Islamic State sympathizers since 2015.



Singapore's immediate neighbors, Indonesia and Malaysia, have large Muslim populations and hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers are estimated to have traveled to Syria from the two countries to join the group.



The statement said Izzah had been ""radicalized in 2013 by online propaganda related to the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria'' and in turn posted materials on social media supporting the group. ""Several of her social media platforms were taken down by administrators because of the pro-ISIS content, but she created new ones,"" the ministry said.



Izzah, who worked at PCF Sparkletots, a chain of government preschools, planned to travel to Syria with her young child and ""was intent on joining"" the Islamic State group, the ministry said. ""She also said that she was prepared to undergo military training and engage in armed combat to defend ISIS, if called upon by the terrorist group to do so.""



She was allegedly looking for a Salafi or Islamic State group supporter ""to marry and settle down with."" Salafism is a form of Islam that interprets the Quran literally.



Her parents, both freelance Quranic teachers, and sister were aware of Izzah's plans and tried to stop her, the ministry said. But when Izzah was put under investigation, a family member tried to destroy evidence to ""try to minimize her acts.""



A report released by the Ministry of Home Affairs this month said that Singapore's terrorism threat ""remains the highest in recent years.""



It cited two foiled plans. Last August, the terrorist group Katibah Gonggong Rebus, based on the nearby Indonesian island of Batam, attempted to launch a rocket attack on downtown Singapore, the report said. Authorities also stemmed an attack planned by foreign Islamic State group militants last year, it said, but no further details were provided.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/75B8DC73-4071-4F56-A5B7-064A682B268F.jpg,"['singaporean', 'syria', 'local', 'islamic', 'group', 'izzah', 'tried', 'suspect', 'terrorist', 'female', 'arrest', 'singapore', 'state', 'ministry']",

68,68,FF-2019-000029-IDN,What if several of the world's biggest food crops failed at the same time? - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/what-if-several-of-the-worlds-biggest-food-crops-failed-at-the-same-time-74017,"Less than one-quarter of Earth’s total cropland produces nearly three-quarters of the staple crops that feed the world’s population – especially corn, wheat and rice, the most important cereal crops. These areas are our planet’s major breadbaskets.

Historically, when a crop failed in one of these breadbaskets, only nearby areas had to contend with shortages and rising prices. Now, however, major crops are traded on global markets, which means that production failures can have far-reaching impacts. Moreover, climate change is expected to generate heat waves and drought that could cause crop losses in most of the world’s breadbaskets. Indeed, failures could occur simultaneously in several of these key regions.

Brian Barker, University of Maryland , Author provided

Pardee Center postdoctoral scholar John Patrick Connors and I are using mathematical models to study the potential environmental and economic impacts of failures in multiple breadbaskets around the world. It is already clear from our preliminary work that this is a real, near-term threat.

The good news is that not all of these regions respond in the same way to shocks in other places in the world. Some could bring new land into production quickly, easing stresses caused by crop failures elsewhere. But in order to make global food systems more robust, we need to know more about the most damaging consequences of multiple breadbasket failures.

A vulnerable system

In the past several decades, many of the world’s major breadbaskets have experienced shocks – events that caused large, rapid drops in food production. For example, regional droughts and heat waves in the Ukraine and Russia in 2007 and then again in 2009 damaged wheat crops and caused global wheat prices to spike by substantial amounts in both years. In 2012 heat and drought in the United States slashed national corn, soybean and other crop yields by up to 27 percent. And yields of important food crops are low and stagnating in many countries due to factors including plant diseases, poor soil quality, poor management practices and damage from air pollution.

At the same time, many experts assert that world food production may have to double by 2050 to feed a growing population and satisfy rising demand for meat, poultry and dairy products in developing countries. Global agricultural production has risen over the past 50 years, largely fueled by improvements in plant breeding and more intensive use of inputs, such as mechanized equipment, fertilizers and pesticides. This trend has eased pressure to bring new land into production. But it has limits, especially in the developing world, where the need to produce more food has been a main driver of deforestation in recent decades.

It is clear that rising demand, growing international trade in agricultural products, and the potential for weather-, climate- and soil-related shocks are making the world food production system less resilient. Global agricultural trade can mean that price spikes in one region, if they are severe enough, can be felt broadly in other regions. Minor shocks, on the other hand, could be lessened by trade and by using grain reserves.

There is increasing evidence that in very poor countries, food price increases and shortages can lead to civil unrest and worsen other social and political stresses. And more wealthy countries are not immune, given the concentration of world food production and the global nature of trade. For example, the Russian/Ukrainian heat wave referenced above led to spikes in food prices, not just in the price of wheat. However, more wealthy countries also typically have more ability to buffer price shocks by either using grain reserves or increasing trade.

Modeling potential shocks

How can we understand this risk and its potential consequences for both rich and poor nations? Programs already exist to provide early warning of potential famines in the world’s poorest countries, many of which already depend heavily on food aid. There also are programs in wealthier nations that monitor food prices and provide early warnings of price spikes.

But these programs focus mainly on regional risks, and often are not located in major food production areas. Very little work has been done to analyze risks of simultaneous shocks in several of the world’s breadbaskets.

We want to understand the impacts that shock events could have if they occur in the real world so that we can identify possible contingency plans for the largest-impact events. In order to do that, we have used an integrated assessment model, the Global Change Assessment Model, which was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and is freely available to users around the world. Integrated assessment models have been designed specifically to simulate the interactions among Earth’s energy, economic and land use systems.

We have developed scenarios in which small shocks (10 percent crop loss) and large shocks (50 percent crop loss), averaged over five years, are applied to corn, wheat or rice in their major production regions, and then to all the combinations of one, two or all three crops in one, two or the top three production regions.

Unsurprisingly, our results to date suggest that large shocks have larger effects than smaller shocks, as measured in subsequent changes in land use, the total amount of land dedicated to agriculture and food prices. But more interestingly, not all breadbasket regions respond to shocks in the same way.

Some of these areas are quite unresponsive to shocks occurring elsewhere in the world. For example, the total amount of land in agricultural production in South Asia changes relatively little due to shocks elsewhere in the world, largely because most of the arable land is already in use.

But other regions are extremely responsive. Notably, Brazil has the ability to bring a lot of new land into production if large shocks occur elsewhere, because it still has a significant amount of potentially arable land that is not currently being farmed. However, this land currently is mostly forest, so clearing it for agriculture would add significantly to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and thus to global climate change.

Mapping risks

The Pardee Center has published a research agenda that discusses what we still need to know about these risks. Key questions include understanding the full distribution of risks, whether increased international trade can ameliorate risk and where the most responsive and the most sensitive regions are.

Ultimately, understanding and preparing for multiple breadbasket failures will require input from climate scientists, agronomists, ecologists, remote sensing experts, economists, political scientists and decision-makers. Mounting such an effort will be challenging, but the costs of failing to do it could be devastating.","Sun, 04 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/171721/original/file-20170531-1275-1wb0385.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['land', 'countries', 'food', 'shocks', 'global', 'regions', 'worlds', 'failed', 'production', 'crop', 'crops', 'biggest', 'world']",

The sense of community and continuity that had pervaded his childhood in rural Cameroon was lacking in the anonymous capital Yaoundé.

""Wisdom was handed down from the elders and through customs. Life in the village was about solidarity - sitting around a fire in the evenings and telling stories,"" Konkankoh recalled. ""I carried this with me to the city when I went to university, only to find this absent. People were more individualistic … I found no values of culture enabling young people to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.""

He saw himself as a misfit but soon realized others were yearning to reconnect with their roots. These were mainly young people who brought traditional skills from their own villages and were now living in the slums of the capital, dealing with floods, mosquitoes and the waste washed down from the hills where the rich dwell, Konkankoh said.

So he decided to create a community based around what he had grown up with: farming with indigenous knowledge, respect for nature and a spirit of community development. A community garden in the slums of the capital was born.

""The young people who identified with this started coming together and creating a space where they could actually develop their own pathway,"" Konkankoh told DW. ""From this concept of living off the land and the rite of passage, they were actually saying that a better world is possible in a slum in the city.""

'We don't want to lose our young people'

The environmental and community activism Konkankoh engaged in during his studies in Yaoundé stayed with him while he worked for Cameroon's social security department. As part of his job he traveled the country and saw firsthand the effects of the economic crisis on young people who weren't able to find jobs. He also witnessed a breakdown in traditional African systems of farming and indigenous knowledge.

Women trained in permaculture at the Bafut ecovillage. Konkankoh is first from the left

Growing frustrated, he quit his job in 2004 to focus on Better World Cameroon, the NGO he had created eight years earlier to promote sustainability, and to devote himself to community development.

After stints abroad in the United Kingdom and Germany, Konkankoh decided to create his country's first ecovillage in his childhood home of Bafut, northwest Cameroon some 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) from the capital.

Bafut ecovillage aims to create sustainable development with an emphasis on the ""African way."" Because, believes, Konkankoh, ""the top down model of the West had shown its limits in Africa, whether it be with the World Bank or international aid.""

""Our goal was to combine science and indigenous knowledge to come up with an adaptive system. The eco village is consciously designed through locally-owned participatory processes and this is a grassroots, bottom-up system that we are designing for Africa that takes in the beliefs of people, their values, their ethics,"" he added.

Bafut is designed to run from 2015 to 2020 with a focus on creating social entrepreneurship and empowering youth and women. Young people because they have fresh ideas and need more opportunities at home.

""Africans don't want to lose their young people to the West because we also need them. They are the ones who still have the energy to be able to think into the future and create a better world also in Africa,"" said Konkankoh.

Women are central to the project because they are the ones who ""farm, take care of the families and are the custodians of values in the African cultural context,"" adds the environmentalist.

Back to the roots

The concept of permaculture with a local twist forms the basis for the activist's approach at Bafut. Permaculture is somewhat difficult to define but it basically means designing agricultural ecosystems that are in harmony with and have the resilience of natural ecosystems. In the case of Bafut, that means intercropping, using local building materials, cultivating traditional medicinal plants and using natural fertilizer.

At the Bafut ecovillage, the women use traditional ovens that use less wood when cooking

These are all traditional, local practices that need to be promoted, says Konkankoh.

""Our forefathers knew that by throwing our kitchen waste behind the house where we had small plantations, under the bananas, natural composting was taking place,"" explained Konkankoh. ""It is where the natural vegetables were growing around the house. It is where the medicinal plants were growing around the house.""

Locals also once exchanged seeds through a local solidarity system and used local seed banks with native seeds that they adapted to the land. But Konkankoh said government corruption and corporations eliminated these, forcing farmers to go to the cities and buy seed that had to be used with fertilizer and pesticides.

""We have our own systems of thinking, which were completely eroded during the colonial era and they were completely undermined by the economic structures of today and that's why Africa has become so vulnerable,"" added Konkankoh

Still, Konkankoh points out that modern science has an important place but it has to be the right kind of science. He adds that international NGOs have their place too, as does working across geographic boundaries. His motto for the Bafut ecovillage is: ""think locally and act globally,"" because ""good solutions can come from anywhere.""

Rebellious teenager to world leader, fashion model to toddler, Mombasa to Managua, T-shirts are gender-neutral and ubiquitous and most of us own tons of them. Classic T-shirts are 100 percent cotton and we have all heard at some point that we should be buying clothing made of organic cotton, but does it really matter? Turns out, it does and here's why.

Cotton plants are thirsty

Growing cotton requires a lot of water. In fact, the production of one conventional T-shirt gulps up 2700 liters of water. Yes, you read that right, there is no decimal point missing here. And most cotton is grown in places where water is scarce. Now here's one good reason to buy organic cotton: it requires 91 percent less water than conventional cotton. So if you would like to save theAral Sea, here's your chance to do something about it.

T-shirts: hopefully not from fast fashion

Toxic stuff

Pesticides are very popular among cotton farmers. So much so that 25 percent of all pesticides used in the world are sprayed on cotton fields. That's despite the fact that just 2.5 percent of agricultural land is given over to cultivating the plant. Or to get back to our T-shirt: for each one made of conventional cotton, farmers dump about 150 grams of pesticides on their land. Yum!

So think about that next time you buy a T-shirt. Or better yet, think twice about buying that new T-shirt at all. Is it really that different from the other five blue ones in your closet?

How can I tell if it's organic?

Look for the label of the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), the most widely-used certification for organic textiles. If it says GOTS and ""made with organic"" the shirt is made of at least 70 percent organic fibres. If it says GOTS and just ""organic,"" the item must contain at least 95 percent certified organic fibres.

1.3 million children urgently need humanitarian assistance after storms batter Bay of Bengal

UNICEF ramps up aid delivery for children and families affected by severe weather in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar

© UNICEF/UNI48590/Nooran August 17, 2007. Resma, 9, illuminates the platform below her neighbour's tin roof where she and her family took refuge during the storm, in the village of Amua in Barisal District. The area was one of the hardest hit by Cyclone Sidr.

NEW YORK/BANGKOK/KATHMANDU, 1 June 2017 – At least 1.3 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across the Bay of Bengal region following severe weather over the past six days, UNICEF has warned. Devastation wrought by Cyclone Mora in Myanmar and Bangladesh, and torrential monsoon rains across Sri Lanka have left children homeless and in need of protection, nutrition and health services.



“Children who have had their lives upended by brutal storms, severe flooding and landslides, are now threatened by a lack of safe drinking water, inadequate hygiene services and limited access to healthcare,” said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes. “We must move quickly to ensure that services and supplies are in place to keep children safe and to stem the spread of communicable diseases like diarrhea, cholera or respiratory infections.”



UNICEF is particularly concerned about children and families who were already displaced and living in precarious conditions before the bad weather struck – this includes some 74,000 Rohingya refugees who recently crossed into Bangladesh and were sheltering in an area badly affected by Cyclone Mora, and 120,000 displaced people in Myanmar’s Rakhine State.



“The sad reality is these children have now been hit by double humanitarian crises,” said Fontaine. “Displaced Rohingya children in Myanmar and Bangladesh, for example, were in many cases already struggling to access essential services even before the storm struck. It’s imperative that we reach these vulnerable and marginalized groups – as well as those living in poor communities who will be far more susceptible to fallout from these storms – with the support they need.”



The destruction caused by the storms in each of the three countries has been brutal. Initial reports from Myanmar indicate severe damage from Cyclone Mora to villages, schools and shelters accommodating displaced people in Rakhine and Chin states. While in Bangladesh, Cyclone Mora has affected around 2.8 million people in vulnerable coastal districts. In Sri Lanka, flash floods and landslides from monsoon rains have so far affected more than 631,000 people, displacing at least 77,000.



UNICEF and its partners are ramping up efforts to provide children and families from all communities devastated by the storms in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar with lifesaving services and support, regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status. This includes:



Bangladesh: pre-positioned supplies in heavily hit areas of Cox’s Bazar and Chittagong, including hygiene kits, water purification tablets, plastic buckets, squatting plates and tarpaulins for approximately 11,000 people.



Myanmar: assessments to gather information on damages and needs in central and northern Rakhine and Chin states where landslides have disrupted major supply routes. UNICEF has pre-positioned plastic buckets, water purification tables, and tarpaulins and is working to provide supplies to get temporary learning spaces configured as the school year is just beginning.



Sri Lanka: distribution of 1,260 10-litre jerry cans, 1,000 tarpaulins and 100,000 water purification tablets to affected communities, and support for Government child protection efforts.

In cities across the country and in the capital of Beijing, a colorful bike-share revolution is taking over on the streets, helping ease traffic snarls and keeping the air cleaner. It is also creating some problems.

China used to be called the ?kingdom of bicycles,? and though cars have taken over in a major way, the growing popularity of bike-share apps seems to indicate two-wheelers are making a come back.

?Color revolution

For drab and dusty Beijing, the bike-share color revolution of yellows, oranges and blues is a welcome sight. People of all ages are enjoying the convenience the bikes provide, which combines cell phone technology, and GPS tracking in some cases, to help users find a ride.

Traveling by car across the sprawling, densely populated city is often a nightmare. Even distances of a few kilometers can take up to an hour when traffic is snarling.

Cheng Li, a bike-share user, said he has been driving his car less and using the metro more since he started using the service about six months ago.

?After I get off the metro, I usually have to walk another kilometer or two, so I?ll grab a bike share and go. It?s less stressful,? Cheng said.

For many, the convenience of cycling is its biggest attraction. Beijing?s city government has long had a bike-share program in place, but many of its bike-share stations were inconveniently located. Getting registered for the smart phone based apps is also much easier.

For Zhang Jian, the bike-share revolution is not only convenient, but nostalgic.

?Now, when we?re riding home from work, especially in the evening, when it?s not as rushed, it feels like we?re reliving the past,? Zhang said.

?Great Wall of bikes

But with a growing number of providers, competition is getting increasingly fierce. One key tactic of providers has been to flood the streets with bikes ? so much so that sidewalks are almost blocked in some cases.

The surge of bikes has become a major headache for city governments. Users frequently leave bikes in the middle of the street or just dump them on the sidewalk blocking passageways in an already densely populated city.

In Beijing?s southern district of Daxing, authorities have been fighting the surge by seizing the illegally parked bikes that clog streets and metro exits, one transportation worker said.

?Bike sharing is really convenient, but no one is taking care of the problem of illegally parked bikes,? the worker said. Behind her are several thousand bikes that have been seized. It was unclear when or how they would be returned to the companies that made them.

?Since the Lunar New Year, the number of bikes has been growing rapidly. At least 10,000 bikes have been added to the streets (of Daxing) since then, and we?ve collected about a third of that total,? she said.

China?s two biggest operators, Ofo and Mobike, have deployed more than 3 million bikes in scores of cities across the country. And the numbers continue to grow.

Mobike aims to expand to 100 cities at home and abroad by the end of this year.

Bike hunters

While many complain the bike-share revolution has taken over city streets, some like Gao Xiaochao are taking matters into their own hands.

Gao is one of many who call themselves bike-share hunters. Bike-share hunters find and report stolen and vandalized bikes that users deliberately park outside their homes or inside gated communities. With some bike-share apps, riders can report illegally parked bikes or other problems the two-wheelers may have.

Gao uses his lunchtime to find, report and move illegally parked bikes.

?Bike hunting is like a game, a hobby, a way to get some exercise. It?s like a new way of living,? Gao said. ?Sometimes, I spend two to three hours looking for illegally parked bikes and it?s just like talking a walk.?

Many like Gao are passionate about bike sharing and what it is doing to help transportation and the city?s notoriously smoggy air.

However, as complaints grow and competition gets increasingly cut-throat, they hope companies will do more to improve their service and not just focus on flooding the streets with bikes to edge out competitors.","Sun, 11 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/79A3DA72-028F-4578-A5F9-29139A0A1599.jpg,"['mobike', 'convenience', 'bicycles', 'revolution', 'bikesharing', 'streets', 'bikeshare', 'ofo', 'parked', 'bikes', 'brings', 'china', 'headaches', 'illegally']",

Trauma happens to us, our friends, our families and our neighbours.”

Trauma is the result of overwhelming situations that exceed our ability to cope or process the emotions they generate. Memories are typically stored in what is known as declarative memory, which you might imagine as a sort of virtual filing cabinet in which life events are organised and labelled according to various types and in chronological order.

This makes it easy to recall and describe memories from the past. However, because traumatic events are processed when under extreme distress they cannot be properly assembled together and remembered as a coherent narrative, and so are stored in non-declarative memory, which operates unconsciously and is not processed in words.

The declarative memory of traumatic events resembles this filing cabinet after a hurricane – only scattered records of visual images and bodily sensations remain with no coherent narrative of what happened. Unable to put the non-verbal, non-declarative memory of the trauma into words, the individual relives the event over and over as unconscious memories resurface when triggered by smells, images or sounds that resemble the original trauma.

This leaves the individual in a hyper-vigilant state, flooding the body with stress hormones long after the traumatic event has passed, with detrimental effects on mental and physical health. Symptoms include dissociation, anger, numbness, intrusive memories, muscular pain (stomach, neck, shoulders) and fatigue.

Left unattended, trauma can have devastating effects on people’s lives, so there is a need to find novel and effective techniques that help traumatised people recall and properly process the events that affected them, and so put the trauma behind them. One of these areas is the use of the creative arts.

An alternative to medication

So far, the medical model has played a key role in the treatment of trauma – perhaps, as Van der Kolk says, because drugs for “fixing” trauma are profitable and major medical journals rarely publish studies of non-medical treatments, which they class as “alternative” therapies. The problem is that medication cannot strike at the root of the trauma and so cannot free the individual from the loop of reliving it. Talking therapies such as psychotherapy are essential, but recent evidence suggests that creative arts can play a key role in helping individuals recover from trauma.

Creativity provides a space where – whether through a picture, play, song, or simply scribbles on a piece of paper – the trauma can start making sense. This might happen because traumatic events are coded non-verbally, and so through images, sounds or metaphors the creative process can help assimilate them into declarative memory. Research has shown that the process of labelling negative emotions can reduce their threatening effect.

These beneficial effects have been demonstrated. For example creative writing has been used for supporting young refugees in recovering from their pre and post-migratory traumas when resettling in the host country. Drama has been used in the treatment of soldiers with post traumatic stress disorder and photography has helped promote better mental health in women affected by HIV/AIDS.

Creativity also provides a means through which traumatic events can be shared with and witnessed by an audience. Doing so, the individual affected by trauma can step outside themselves and share the piece of art they’ve created with others. This helps them take in different perspectives on their trauma, putting some distance between them and the events. Through discussion with other people the events gradually stop hunting the traumatised individual.

In a recent article, the poet Lemn Syssay explained the reasons for reading the psychological files related to his traumatic childhood on stage in front of an audience. He said:

I feel good on stage, in a bizarre way, like I am with family, this is the best way for me to look at those files. I couldn’t be in a safer place. I feel more comfortable having this out in the open, because they fucked me up when I was on my own.

Arts can be used to reconnect cultures and dissolve the effect of trauma. For instance, the use of social theatre – theatre used as social work – has been effective in reconnecting and building dialogue between young people from Israel and Palestine.

Repairing communities divided by trauma

Creative arts might also help the integration of the so-called trans-generational or trans-cultural traumas, those passed on from one generation to the next or that belong to and are felt by specific ethnic groups, respectively.

An example of trans-generational trauma comes from Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel Maus, based on his father’s experience as an Auschwitz survivor. In the novel, Jews are portrayed as mice and Germans as cats. To me, one of the most powerful parts of this novel is when Spiegelman visits his father, Vladek. Sitting together at the kitchen table, his father insists in feeding Spiegelman out-of-date cereal that belonged to his ex-wife, since he cannot tolerate the idea of throwing them away.

“I cannot forget it”, says Vladek, “ever since Hitler I don’t like to throw out even a crumb.”

Art replies: “Then just save the damn Special K, in case Hitler ever comes back.”

To me this is not only a story about surviving a terrific collective traumatic event, but about a father and a son’s relationship reconnecting while pieces of untold trauma are unravelled and put into pages.

My interest in creative arts as therapy stems from my current research on developing interventions to improve the well-being of refugees. When I asked a woman from the Middle East if we should run creative writing classes for refugees, she said we should, stating that putting her side of the story in writing would stop the trauma following her family: “If I keep it inside, this becomes a problem for my daughter too, for the next generations too,” she said.

This made me reflect that, despite their effectiveness, talking therapies must be integrated with other forms of interventions, particularly when working with those who find it hard to verbalise their traumatic histories – for which the arts has shown itself to be very effective.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/172022/original/file-20170602-20582-47ju7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['paint', 'pen', 'revisit', 'traumatic', 'individual', 'helps', 'using', 'past', 'creative', 'memory', 'novel', 'song', 'process', 'trauma', 'memories', 'paper', 'events', 'used']",

80,80,FF-2019-000029-IDN,"To make financing sustainable agriculture work, farmers' terms must be met - eco-business.com",https://www.eco-business.com/news/to-make-financing-sustainable-agriculture-work-farmers-terms-must-be-met/,"Much of the deforestation in the world’s tropical rainforests comes so that we humans have enough to eat. But sustainable agricultural practices exist that help farmers coax more corn and soybeans, coffee and cacao, and a host of other products from the soil, without having to draw on land that’s currently covered with standing forest.

The tricky part is getting those tools and techniques to farmers and finding backers to fund the transition from traditional practices to sustainable farming.

“Farmers don’t have the money they need, and investors don’t know where to put their money,” said Simone Bauch, who directs the Global Canopy Program in Latin America. The Global Canopy Program is an Oxford, England-based think tank working at the intersection of tropical forest conservation and economics.

Bauch and her colleagues have just published a report that outlines how different finance approaches can streamline that shift to more environmentally friendly agriculture for smallholder producers.

Research indicates around 80 per cent of recent deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon was small-scale, most of which was likely done to make way for small farms. Conservationists are eager to shrink that statistic, but as Bauch and her coauthors point out, they don’t often have a nuanced understanding of finance.

With the report, the team draws on four years of experience with the Unlocking Forest Finance project and illustrates how different financial tools – or “instruments” – farmers get access an assist in shifting their methods.

“ Finance can flow through different instruments. It’s not like there’s one silver bullet that will solve all the problems. Simone Bauch, director, Global Canopy Program in Latin America

One of the big hurdles for farmers is getting loans to cover the move to more sustainable farming practices. It’s especially a challenge that crops up with perennial plants like coffee that need about four years before revenues start to flow in – what Bauch calls the “valley of death.”

But credit aimed at encouraging green farming can be tailored to this set of challenges, she said, “for example, decreasing interest rates to make them cheaper, or tweaking the terms of loans for producers.”

Banks and other lenders could also extend the loan’s timeline, to perhaps 15 to 30 years, she added.

“Yes, it’s longer than usual. But it’s definitely doable.”

In a case study looking at small producers of cacao in the Amazonian region of San Martin in Peru, the Global Canopy Program found that by providing lower interest rates, a one-year grace period during which farmer only had to pay interest and a longer payback term gave farmers more cash in the first few years of production.

This liquidity, they argue, makes the transition to sustainable farming methods more realistic and hedges against shocks like droughts, floods and fires that could wipe out their harvests.

Just as these schemes need to address issues for the producers, they also need to assuage the concerns of investors. Those who might otherwise be interested in footing the bill for a switch to more sustainable methods typically shy away from such ventures because they see them as “high risk, low return.”

That concern is “justified,” Bauch said. “Doing something different means it’s risky.”

The change in mindset requires a “shift in perception,” she said. Tools such as insurance and credit guarantees, in which an NGO or bank shoulders some of the risk of these loans, could make this type of investment more attractive.

Larger companies might also agree to fund farmers ahead of time in exchange for the chance to lock in purchases of agricultural commodities in what’s known as “an off-take agreement.” This pact helps to address a concern that Bauch has heard from large buyers.

“A lot of the big companies in supply chains such as cocoa [and] coffee, but also soy and beef, for example … complain that they don’t find sustainable producers that everyone is asking them to buy from,” she said.

Bauch added that one of the key lessons from the Global Canopy Program’s experience in Latin America and elsewhere is that a single drop-in solution is unlikely to help farmers push through to more sustainable methods.

“Finance can flow through different instruments. It’s not like there’s one silver bullet that will solve all the problems,” she said. “It’s mostly what instrument fits what scenario and how can you actually get the actors together to back that instrument.”

Appropriating a Monday-might tradition and slogan (""Wir sind das Volk"" - ""We are the people"") from the huge popular demonstrations that erupted against the East German regime in the late 1980s, PEGIDA protesters have been gathering in the city for their weekly marches for over two years - while associated protests have sprung up in several cities around Germany - ""Bärgida"" in Berlin, ""Wügida"" in Würzburg, ""Bogida"" in Bonn, and ""Dügida"" in Düsseldorf.

At its height in February 2015, some 20,000 flooded the streets of Dresden, accompanied by TV crews from international news broadcasters, and counter-protests that were often at least the same size. Though the group itself rejects the label ""far-right,"" neo-Nazis were routinely spotted among the marchers.

Lutz Bachmann founded the group, but now lives in Spain

The group maintained this momentum during the so-called ""refugee crisis"" in fall 2015 - when PEGIDA protesters took to demanding that ""Merkel must go!"" - but the numbers have continuously dwindled since around February 2016, and have numbered just 1,000 - 2,000 in 2017.

Though leaders have occasionally considered becoming a political party, the group is registered as a voluntary organization with only a handful of actual members - these make up the leadership, who often speak at the events. Chief among these is a former petty criminal turned advertising agent called Lutz Bachmann. He moved to Tenerife for professional reasons in May 2016, but has continued to appear at the public marches. In April last year, Bachmann was convicted and fined for using hate speech against refugees at a PEGIDA demo.

PEGIDA released a set of demands in 2014, which included a points-based immigration system, tougher deportation measures, ""zero tolerance"" for immigrants that commit crimes, and the ""protection of the Judeo-Christian western culture.""

Origin and beliefs of the sacred shrine

Culture

Situated near Ramnagar in Uttarakhand, the Garjiya Devi Temple is considered a sacred shrine that is believed to have been formed by the mud and clay that came along during a flood, years ago. Surrounded by the Kosi River tributary, the temple holds a rich, religious significance and the locals have a book full of stories associated with its formation and existence.

The alley preceding the gateway of Garjiya Devi Temple is a long narrow passage where the locals sell flowers, garlands, chimes, incense sticks, sculptures of various deities, plastic toys and traditional accessories, amongst various other items.

Upon entering the temple that is naturally surrounded by the Kosi River, all you will see around are shops selling flowers and other essentials for worshipping the gods, and a lot of locals as well as tourists, queued up on the narrow stairs – waiting for their turn to climb up to the temple.

As you proceed forward, through a small bridge that connects the two sides of the temple, one can witness the view of the gleaming waters of the Kosi River and the locals who are either bathing in the water or just sitting beside it, enjoying the cool breeze.

Located in the Garjiya village near Ramnagar in Uttarakhand, on the outskirts of the Corbett National Park, Garjiya Devi Temple is a noted sacred shrine where goddess Garjiya is the presiding deity, with idols of goddess Saraswati, lord Ganesha and Girija devi, standing at a height of 4.5 feet.

The temple that is situated over a large rock in the Kosi River, was not known by many till 1940 but in recent years, it has been protected and reconstructed many times by the temple management and pulls a crowd that increases every year.

However, the temple, which is over 150 years old, is not only a hotspot for devotees but also an attraction for bird watchers who visit the area to spot some rare species including the Himalayan kingfisher.

Of beliefs and formation

People in Garjiya village are deeply associated with the temple and consider it auspicious. Both the temple and the river tributary in this area stand as major tourist attractions and the locals and priests passionately narrate tales about the formation and importance of the temple and the surrounding holy water.

“One night before a flood that hit this area 150-200 years ago, a saint saw a dream that something along with water will come flowing in this region and he has to stop it. The next day, the area was hit with the flood and the saint saw a big mountain of clay and mud that was constantly getting collected in one place with the flow of water. He then meditated to stop the mountain on that place itself. Since then, the mountain is standing there at 100 metre tall, where people established effigies of idols – that later came to be known as the Garjiya temple,” explains Puran Pradhan, a resident of Nainital district in Uttarakhand.

Interestingly, according to the locals, ‘Girija’ is another name for goddess Paarvati (daughter of king of mountains – the Himalayas) and the power that created the Garjiya Devi Temple is the avatar of goddess Paarvati.

To add to the unending interesting history of the temple, some locals say that in order to control the over flooded river Kosi, a devotee of lord Shiva asked Garjiya – his sister, to marry Kosi and reside there itself to control the anger of the river. Obeying his order, his sister Girjya married Kosi and started residing in the rock located in the Kosi River. Girjya, being one of the avatars of Goddess Paarvati, blessed the entire place with her presence and it is believed that after she resided at the rock, river Kosi never flooded again.","Sat, 03 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-3.40.43-PM.jpg,"['water', 'locals', 'river', 'kosi', 'garjiya', 'temple', 'goddess', 'tale', 'devi', 'sacred', 'area']",

86,86,FF-2019-000029-IDN,"ILO: Children Risk Exploitation Most in Asia, Africa - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/africa/ilo-children-risk-exploitation-most-asia-africa,"GENEVA - The International Labor Organization (ILO) reports children caught in conflict and natural disasters are most at risk of child labor and of falling prey to trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. To mark the World Day Against Child Labor, the ILO is calling on governments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.

The world is facing its greatest refugee and displacement crisis, with more than 65 million people forcibly displaced by war and persecution. Children are among those most at risk of exploitation from the breakdown of family and social systems, the loss of homes, schools, and livelihoods.

The ILO reports an estimated 168 million children are in child labor globally, including 85 million engaged in the worst forms of child labor. This includes the use of children who work in slave-like conditions, in hazardous work, such as mining and agriculture, and in the use of children in combat or as prostitutes.

The ILO reports child labor is most prevalent in Asia and Africa.

ILO Senior Technical Officer on Crisis and Fragile Situations Insaf Nizam told VOA children are particularly abused in situations of conflict in Africa, where many are recruited as child soldiers by armed groups in conflicts such as Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

“We also have seen certain armed groups using children for extreme types of violence as suicide bombers or forcibly recruiting them as brides and for sexual slavery. So, the types of violations against children have increased in diversity,” he said.

FILE - A young boy leads militant Islamist al-Shabab fighters as they conduct military exercises in northern Mogadishu's Suqaholaha neighborhood, Somalia, Jan. 1, 2010.

Nizam said children also are recruited as soldiers and suffer other forms of exploitation in conflicts in Asia and the Middle East. But he noted in countries such as the Philippines and Myanmar in eastern Asia, children run greater risks from natural disasters.

“You get a lot of displacement of children. Families lose their livelihoods. Their community networks are lost. They are displaced. Communities become poor overnight. They lose their sources of income. Schools are either damaged or destroyed due to natural disasters. So, there children are pushed easily because of that,” he said.

Nizam said conflicts tend to grab world attention more quickly than natural disasters. This, he said, is especially true of slow onset disasters, such as drought, climate change and floods.

He added these situations are as harmful as conflicts to children, who are easily exploited by nefarious people.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/BDA9690B-220D-4C7A-9B0E-A6E61E5A333E.jpg,"['somalia', 'child', 'labor', 'world', 'risk', 'young', 'conflicts', 'children', 'natural', 'asia', 'africa', 'disasters', 'exploitation', 'ilo']",

An estimated 16 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti are affected by drought. The appeal by the IOM aims to provide emergency and early recovery aid to six million people through the end of the year.

The Horn of Africa is suffering severe food and water shortages brought on by two previous years of drought, exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon.

A recent sprinkling of rain is bringing some relief to the region, but the IOM regional director for East and Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Labovitz, says the rain has come too late and is not abundant enough to reach the level needed to mitigate the vulnerable condition of millions of people.

""We're happy that rains are happening, but it does not mean that the needs are fully addressed,"" he said. ""And, in fact, there is a lot of consideration that we will have to look at a much longer term of urgent humanitarian assistance.""

The IOM reports more than one million people within Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya have become internally displaced over the past six months because of severe drought conditions.

Labovitz tells VOA that warnings of famine so far have not materialized because of timely interventions by aid agencies; but, he notes, the crisis is far from over.

""In fact, we are adding millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance over the course of the last month,"" he said. ""When we talk about Ethiopia, it is a rapid increase. The last figure we heard was 5.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance about a month ago. Now, it is 7.8. We have just added almost two million people. And we think it is going to go much higher than that.""

Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in Somalia leave their homes every week in search of drought relief, according to Labovitz.","Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/FC564B81-AEAF-4388-BDB0-4D6FA72CFC30.jpg,"['somalia', '60', 'millions', 'severe', 'assistance', 'horn', 'iom', 'appeal', 'humanitarian', 'drought', 'million', 'africa', 'launches', 'ethiopia']",

Believe it or not, the researchers and doctors have actually researched on which is better? Menstrual Cups or Sanitary Napkins. According to a study, an average woman uses 10,000 sanitary napkins during her lifetime. Sanitary pads are offered in various lengths and absorbency levels. They are often preferred by women on light flow days or when they might have the fear of spotting. The disadvantage associated with them are that women sometimes feels the product uncomfortable or find that it is not suitable for certain types of physical activities.



But when these sanitary napkins are dumped, they take around 500-800 years to degrade. If these napkins are burnt, they release toxic gases unless it is done at a temperature of 800 degrees which requires a lot of energy. Therefore, we need to get serious about the menstrual products being used so that it does not cause environmental hazards as well as physical harms.



Menstrual Cup: A Better Approach?



Menstrual cups came into the market with tampons but still people are not aware of them. Women in United States do not widely use them. These menstrual cups are of two types: The first is a soft flexible, disposable cup that looks a lot like a diaphragm. The second is a bell-shaped cup which is either made of latex or silicone. Menstrual cups cab be reused after thorough cleaning. Both the types of cups do not absorb the menstrual fluid.","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2017/06/menstrual-cups-vs-tampons-inset1-1496831329.jpg,"['cup', 'women', 'physical', 'napkin', 'cups', 'vs', 'sanitary', 'types', 'napkins', 'menstrual', 'better', 'lot']", 
89,89,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Increasing probability of mortality during Indian heat waves - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700066,"Abstract Rising global temperatures are causing increases in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events, such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5°C over this period, with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146% increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.

INTRODUCTION Global mean temperatures are expected to increase by as much as 5.5°C by the end of this century (1), which is, in turn, expected to increase the intensity of heat waves around the world (2–4), with the largest relative effect on summer temperatures in developing regions, such as Africa, South America, Middle East, and South Asia (5). The impact of these heat waves on human and natural systems include decreased air quality, diminished crop yields, increased energy consumption, increased evapotranspiration, intensification of droughts, and—perhaps most concerning of all—direct effects on human health (6, 7). Heat stress during periods of high temperatures may also exacerbate health problems, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cause life-threatening crises (8, 9). Certain segments of the population, such as the young, elderly, and poor, may therefore be especially susceptible to this health impact due to existing health conditions and lack of basic resources, such as clean drinking water, shelter, access to air conditioning, and health care (10). Populations without central air conditioning tend to have higher heat-related mortality rates (11). In light of geographical patterns of warming and vulnerable populations, we present here an analysis of a half-century (1960–2009) of temperature, heat waves, and related mortality in India. Previous studies report that between 1971 and 2007, there was an increase of more than 0.5°C in mean temperatures across India (12), and the projected annual spatial warming in India will be between 2.2° and 5.5°C by the end of the 21st century, with higher projections over northern, central, and western India (13, 14). On the basis of data from the World Bank, of the 1.24 billion people living in India in 2011 (18% of global population), an estimated 23.6% earned <$1.25 per day and ~25% did not have any access to electricity, making them especially vulnerable to the impact of heat waves (15). This vulnerability has been made clear by events in recent years: Heat waves in 2010 killed more than 1300 people in the city of Ahmedabad alone, prompting the start of efforts to develop coordinated Heat Action Plans (16). However, these efforts remain limited and localized, and, in 2013 and 2015, the country experienced another bout of intense heat waves that killed more than 1500 and 2500 people across the country, respectively. Since then, there have been several more deadly heat waves, including the most intense Indian heat wave in recorded history in May of 2016 when maximum temperatures in Jaisalmer reached 52.4°C. Heat waves are usually described as successive hot days (4, 17) and are often defined on a percentile basis (6). Here, we consider heat waves to be three or more consecutive days of temperatures above the 85th percentile of the hottest month for each specific location. Figure S1 shows the heat wave threshold values across India (85th percentile of hottest month’s mean temperature in °C). For each warm season in India (April to September) from 1960 to 2009, we assess four different heat wave properties: (i) accumulated heat wave intensity, (ii) annual heat wave count, (iii) mean heat wave duration, and (iv) heat wave days. The annual heat wave count and mean duration are simply the number of heat wave events that occur each year and their average duration in days, respectively. Heat wave days are the product of heat wave count and duration and represent the number of days under heat wave conditions. We evaluate accumulated heat wave intensity as the cumulative cooling degree day (CDD), or the sum of the daily mean temperature during a heat wave subtracted by 22°C, over the entire heat wave event [that is, (daily temperature in°C − 22°C) × duration in days]. We perform our heat wave analyses based on summer mean temperatures (that is, the average of mean daily temperatures during summer) because we believe this to be a better indicator of accumulated heat stress. However, we also provide analyses based on summer maximum temperatures in the Supplementary Materials. These analyses are performed using 1° × 1° daily temperature records from the India Meteorological Department. Finally, we use the results from these retrospective analyses to develop a conditional probabilistic model of the relationships among summer mean temperatures, heat wave days, and heat-related mortality that we apply to estimate the probability distribution of heat-related mortality related to mean climate warming in the future. Further details of our analytic approach are provided in Methods.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 1A shows that summer mean temperatures have increased substantially from 1960 to 2009. The time series exhibits a statistically significant (95% confidence interval) upward trend confirmed using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. The accumulated intensity, count, duration, and days of Indian heat waves have also increased over the analyzed time period over most of the country and especially in the northern, southern, and western parts of India (Fig. 1, B to E). Fig. 1 Temperature and heat wave increases in India (1960–2009). Summer mean temperatures in India have increased from 1960 to 2009, as indicated by the MK trend test (A). The (B) accumulated heat wave intensity, (C) number of heat wave events, (D) heat wave duration, and (E) heat wave days during the latter period (1985–2009) has also increased over most areas of India relative to the previous period of 1960–1984. The red shading that dominates most of the maps in Fig. 1 indicates that the observed increases are widespread and strong: Southern and western India experienced 50% more heat wave events during the period 1985–2009 than during the previous 25-year period (calculated by dividing the difference in the number of events from 1985 to 2009 relative to 1960 to 1984 by the total number of events). Similarly, heat wave days and the mean duration of heat waves have increased by approximately 25% in the majority of India. Figure S2 shows the same analysis for heat waves calculated using summer maximum temperatures. Figure S3 shows the mean values for each heat wave characteristic from 1960 to 1984 and 1985 to 2009 separately. Figure S4 shows the areas where there was a statistically significant trend confirmed by the MK trend test. Figure 2A shows the relationships among standardized values of summer mean temperatures, heat wave days, and annual heat-related mortality occurring over the period 1967–2007 (the period for which reliable mortality data were available; see the Supplementary Materials for details). Although high summer mean temperatures often correspond to spikes in deaths, the correlation of temperatures to deaths is weaker (Pearson’s linear correlation = 63%, r2 = 0.38; Fig. 2B) than the correlation to the number of heat wave days each year (Pearson’s linear correlation = 77%, r2 = 0.58; Fig. 2C), especially in the years when there were high mortality rates. Fig. 2 Standardized number of heat wave days, summer mean temperatures, and heat-related mortality. Standardized trends show the correspondence among the three variables. In years when heat wave days (yellow) and summer mean temperature (red) are above average, heat-related deaths also spike upward. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms of heat wave mortality, we further explored its relationship with population and income levels in India. Figure 3 shows that the relationship between population-weighted heat wave days and mortality rates is only slightly better than that between mortality and summer mean temperatures (Pearson’s linear correlation = 67%, r2 = 0.44; Fig. 3B); however, the correlation between income-weighted heat wave days and mortality rates is better (Pearson’s linear correlation = 77%, r2 = 0.58; Fig. 3C). Fig. 3 Standardized population-weighted heat wave days, income-weighted heat wave days, and heat-related mortality. Standardized trends show the correspondence among the three variables. In most years when income-weighted heat waves (light green) and population-weighted heat waves (dark green) are above average, heat-related deaths also increase markedly. On the basis of these correlations, we infer that the relationship between income and human health is stronger than that between physical conditions and health, perhaps as the result of access to air conditioning or medical care. It is known that some highly populated regions have low income per capita (for example, northern India), and many rural low-populated regions also have low income per capita (that is, central and eastern India), which we show in fig. S5. Figure 2A highlights several years—1972, 1988, 1998, and 2003—in which there were more than 10 heat wave days on average across India, with corresponding spikes in heat-related mass mortality of between 650 and 1500 people. However, there are a few years, such as 1973, 1983, 1984, and 1995, in which there were an above-average number of income-weighted heat wave days but a low number of deaths. A possible explanation for this is that the areas where these latter heat waves occurred tended to be less populous and/or wealthier regions (see fig. S5). These observations reinforce previous work that highlighted poverty as a significant factor in climate-induced mortality, such as heat wave deaths (18). Figure 4 shows the results of a conditional probability density analysis (see Methods) of annual mortality, given certain thresholds for summer mean temperatures and heat wave days. The shaded region represents the probability of mass heat-related mortality (that is, heat-related deaths of more than 100 people), given different summer temperature values. For example, Fig. 4A shows that there is 13% probability that years with summer mean temperatures equal to 27°C will result to mass heat-related mortality. However, with an increase in summer mean temperatures of just 0.5°C (to 27.5°C), the probability of these levels of heat-related deaths jumps by a factor of 2.5 to 32%. Figure S6 shows a similar relationship with summer maximum temperatures. Similarly, Fig. 3B shows that the probability of heat-related mass mortality events increases from 46 to 82% (78% increase) when the average number of heat wave days across India shifts from 6 to 8 days, respectively. The substantial increase in mortality rates due to either a 0.5°C increase in summer mean temperature or two more heat wave days suggests that future climate warming could have a relatively drastic human toll in India and similarly in developing tropical and subtropical countries. Meanwhile, some experts expect India’s temperature to rise from 2.2° to 5.5°C (13, 14). Fig. 4 Probabilities of heat wave–caused mass mortality events. Parametric conditional probability density functions (PDFs) for yearly mortality given certain thresholds for summer mean temperatures (A) and heat wave days (B). With 0.5°C warmer mean temperatures or two more heat wave days per year, the probability of >100 heat-related deaths increase markedly. The relationship between the two variables and probability of mass mortality events is shown in (C). By almost all measures, heat waves have increased markedly across India over the past half-century and, with this, the incidence of heat-related mortality. Projected increases in global mean temperatures under a range of climate change scenarios can be expected to extend these trends. Although India is particularly susceptible to heat waves given its geography and current state of human development, there are many countries that are similarly vulnerable to the extreme heat events in the ever-warming world. Our results suggest that even moderate and practically unavoidable increases in mean temperatures, such as 0.5°C, may lead to large increases in heat-related mortality, unless measures are taken to substantially improve the resilience of vulnerable populations.

METHODS Temperature and mortality data Daily temperature data based on 395 weather stations and interpolated at 1° × 1°spatial resolution was obtained from the India Meteorological Department (19). Mortality data were also obtained from the India Meteorological Department and from annual reports, which compiled information from newspaper and other sources about mortality during specific extreme heat events (20). Statistical methods This paper used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to analyze the changes in distribution functions of heat waves in different periods. We used the two-sample KS test to analyze the differences between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the number of heat waves. This study compared the different types of heat waves that occurred in 1985–2009 relative to those in 1960–1984. The KS test is a nonparametric test that evaluates whether there is a statistically significant change between two distributions by calculating the largest distance between their empirical distributions. The null hypothesis is that the data sets come from the same distribution at a certain confidence interval (95% confidence interval in this study). The KS test determines changes in empirical distribution functions by comparing pre- and postchange samples, defined as where and are the empirical CDF of the two subsamples, I is the indicator function, n denotes sample size, and the terms and are adjustment factors for the length of each subsample. The KS test statistic is the maximum difference between two empirical distributions Larger divergence values (D τ,n ) represent greater changes in the cumulative distributions (21, 22). The MK trend test analyzes whether there is a statistically significant trend (95% confidence interval) in the number of heat waves per year time series. The MK test is a nonparametric test that uses the empirical ranks of time series and is widely used in hydrology and climatology (23). Here, we used the r2 measure to determine how close the mortality and heat wave characteristics data are to their respective fitted regression lines. The r2 statistic measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. Lower r2 values depict the fact that the dependent variable (mortality) cannot be predicted from the independent variable (heat wave days), and higher values portray the fact that the dependent variable can be predicted with little to no error from the independent variable (24). Calculation of conditional probabilities To derive the conditional probabilities presented in Fig. 4, we used the multivariate copula functions (25–28) to find the joint probability distribution of mortality and summer mean temperatures across India. We fitted the Frank copula and t copula families to the summer mean temperatures and mortality, and heat wave days and mortality data, respectively, because they have the highest statistically significant (95% confidence interval) maximum likelihood among all the copula families. Maximum likelihood and P values for five major copula families with respect to summer mean temperatures and heat wave days relative to mortality are shown in table S1. A copula function is defined as the multivariate distribution function (29, 30) (1)where C is the CDF of the copula and is the nonexceedance probability of x i (marginal distribution). Here, we used the bivariate form to estimate the joint probability distribution of mortality rates and summer mean temperatures, as well as mortality rates and heat wave days in India (2) To determine the conditional probabilities of mortality rates exceeding a threshold (Y > y) at different summer mean temperatures (X = x 1 , x 2 ,…), that is, F Y|X (Y > y | X), we developed the conditional PDF (31) (3)where c is the PDF of the copula function and f Y (y) is the mortality marginal distribution. Once we choose a certain summer mean temperature conditional PDF from Eq. 3, the probability of the mortality rates (Y) exceeding a particular threshold (y) is given by the area under the curve f Y|X (y | x). This allowed the calculation of conditional PDF f Y|X (y | x) for different values of x (for example, summer mean temperatures = 27°C or heat wave days = 6 in Fig. 4).

State legal bureau head Ng Kian Nam said the new village, which was the biggest in Negri Sembilan, was said to be the country’s first such settlement by Chin See Yin from MCA who won the Seremban Timur parliamentary seat in the 1959 general election.

“Chin, who was English-educated, had written a book on this and which was translated into Mandarin in the 1990s.

“He said that the Rasah new village was opened in 1949 and was then located a short distance away from its current location along Jalan Rasah.

“It was moved to its present location in 1951 after floods ravaged the village,” said Ng.

He said the new village had steadily expanded since then and its population today stood at 5,373.

He explained that there was a need to build a monument so that the younger generation would know their roots.

“Each family was given by the British colonialists a 4,000sq ft area to build their house.

“It was said that new villages which were created after that had all followed the Rasah new village model,” he added.

Ng said his team would interview the older folks in the village to verify Chin’s claim.

“We will peruse historical documents to ascertain this.

“Whatever the outcome, we will still go ahead with the project to build a monument somewhere in the village,” he said, adding that the state MCA would seek fundings from the Prime Minister’s Department for the project.

Ng said the monument would be built in a strategic location so that more people would see it.

“We only need a small area but it has to be both suitable and strategic.

“Who knows it may also become a tourist attraction one day,” he said, adding that the fact that the village was located a short distance away from Seremban town was an advantage.","Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['seremban', 'village', 'monument', 'build', 'younger', 'short', 'settlement', 'rasah', 'thanks', 'location', 'mca']", 
91,91,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Asia’s Mom and Pop Investors Lured by Bitcoin’s Returns - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/asias-mom-and-pop-investors-lured-bitcoins-returns,"TOKYO/SEOUL - Long the preserve of geeky enthusiasts, bitcoin is going mainstream in Asia, attracting Mrs Watanabe — the metaphorical Japanese housewife investor — South Korean retirees and thousands of others trying to escape rock-bottom savings rates by investing in the cryptocurrency.

Asia’s moms and pops, regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin’s 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.

Even after a tumble from last week’s record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone, driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.

Legal tender in Japan

Over the last two weeks, and encouraged by Japan’s recognition of bitcoin as legal tender in April, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, because of tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.

“After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1,800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.

“Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore,” she said. “This worries me, so I started bitcoins.”

Thriving investment culture

Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin because of the region’s thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.

“Right now, it’s a form of speculation, like stocks,” said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. “I don’t think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.”

The risks, though, are rising too.

Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy.

In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchanges operate under money service operator licenses, like money changers, while in South Korea they are regulated similar to online shopping malls, trading physical goods. Often there are no rules on investor protection.

Park and Higo were drawn into bitcoin by friends. Others are attracted through seminars, social media groups and blogs penned by amateur investors.

Noboru Hanaki, a 27-year-old Japanese web marketer and bitcoin investor, said his personal finance blog gets around 30,000 page views each month. The most popular post is an explanation of bitcoin, he said, noting that when the bitcoin price surged last month, readership of the article doubled.

Rachel Poole, a Hong Kong-based kindergarten teacher, said she read about bitcoin in the press, and bought five bitcoins in March for around HK$40,000 ($5,100) after studying blogs on the topic. She kept four as an investment and has made HK$12,000 tax-free trading the fifth after classes.

“I wish I’d done it earlier,” she said.

Not everyone’s making money.

Scams, pyramid schemes

The bitcoin frenzy has spawned scams, with police in South Korea last month uncovering a $55 million cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that sucked in thousands of homemakers, workers and self-employed businessmen seduced by slick marketing and promises of wealth.

Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and a bitcoin investor, warned amateur investors against speculating in the digital currency.

Some larger exchanges have voluntarily adopted security measures and compensation guarantees, according to their websites, although there are dozens of smaller platforms operating more or less unchecked.

In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has set up a task force to explore regulating cryptocurrencies, but it has not set a timeline for publishing its conclusions, an official there said.

In Japan — where memories are still fresh of the spectacular 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time — the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it supervises bitcoin exchanges, but not traders or investors.

Some professional investors say bitcoin can be a useful hedge to help diversify a portfolio, but investors should be cautious.

92,92,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Silk Road Hub or Tax Haven? China's New Border Trade Zone May Be Less Than It Seems - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/silk-road-hub-or-tax-haven-chinas-new-border-trade-zone-may-be-less-it-seems,"HORGOS, CHINA / KHORGOS, KAZAKHSTAN - On the border of China and Kazakhstan, an international free trade zone has become a showpiece of Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road initiative to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.

Chinese state media are filled with stories about the stunning success of Horgos, the youngest city of China's new Silk Road. Last month at China's Belt and Road Summit — its biggest diplomatic event of the year — promotional videos about Horgos' booming economy ran on a loop at the press center.

But Chinese business owners and prospective investors who had recently visited the China-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center (ICBC), told Reuters they were disappointed by the disconnect between the hype and reality.

Rather than the vibrant 21st century trading post of Beijing's grand vision, Horgos is instead developing a reputation as China's very own tax haven.

""We were so unimpressed by what we saw that after looking around for three hours, we turned around and drove eight hours straight back to Urumqi,"" said a businessman from the capital of China's far western region of Xianjiang, who only wanted to give his surname, Ma, due to the sensitivity of the topic.

Several business owners echoed complaints about poor design and low visitor numbers made by Ma, who visited Horgos to investigate the viability of opening a high-end clubhouse.

A man walks with a cart at Chinese part of the China-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center (ICBC), in Horgos, China, May 12, 2017.

""You've got Kazakh farmers walking around with plastic bags full of cheap Chinese T-shirts and you want me to open a club for government officials and businessmen to meet inside the zone — which, by the way, you can't drive your car into and doesn't have any five-star hotels?"" Ma said.

On the Chinese side of the border there are five malls selling cheap consumer goods, though traders complain there are not enough visitors.

""Sometimes I'll sit here for a whole day and not make a single sale,"" said Ma Yinggui, 56, who has a market stall selling clothes. ""Some Kazakhs are rich but most are poor. They come and haggle over a 20 yuan [$2.93] T-shirt.""

More than five years after the 5.3-square-kilometer trade zone opened, much of the Kazakh side remains empty.

Only 25 of the 63 projects on the Kazakh side have investors, according to Ravil Budukov, ICBC press secretary on the Kazakh side. About 3,000 to 4,000 people enter from Kazakhstan each day and around 10,000 from China, he added.

The Xinjiang and Horgos governments declined to make officials available for comment to Reuters for this article.

Huang Sanping, a senior Xinjiang government official, told Reuters at a news conference in Beijing that he had just returned from a visit to Horgos, a city ""performing extremely well. It's full of vitality and flourishing.""

China's tax haven

Beijing has bestowed numerous tax breaks and preferential policies on Horgos hoping to stimulate growth in this strategic border town in Xinjiang, a key link on the new Silk Road between China and Central Asia, where the government says it is battling to defeat Islamist extremism.

According to Horgos' tax bureau, 2,411 companies registered in Horgos last year, taking advantage of five years of no company tax, and a further five years paying half rate.

At least half those companies are registered in Horgos solely for tax purposes, estimates Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in Beijing.

Chinese celebrities are opting to register production companies in Horgos and an increasing number of financial services and IT companies are also registering there, according to Guan Xuemei from Shenzhou Shunliban, a tax advisory firm that recently opened an office there.

A man cooks a traditional Uyghur rice dish on the Chinese side of the China-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center (ICBC), in Horgos, China, May 19, 2017.

But with no obligation to operate from Horgos or even in Xinjiang, it is unlikely this policy will create jobs or bring money to what has long been an economic backwater, say experts.

""In theory this is a good policy because it aims to stimulate the local economy,"" said Shen. ""But Beijing didn't think through the fact lots of companies wouldn't actually want to operate from Horgos, which is very far away from China's economic centers.""

Those who do trade in the ""free trade zone"" find they face restrictions from both sides.

The Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) — of which Kazakhstan is a member — limits traders from the Kazakh side to importing up to 50 kg (110 lbs) of any goods per month duty-free.

China bans imports of many food products — the Kazakh goods most desired by Chinese consumers worried about food safety at home — and caps traders from taking more than 8,000 yuan ($1,175) worth of goods out each day.

""The EEU is a significant barrier because Russia and Kazakhstan and other Central Asia countries want to develop their own industries, they don't want to constantly rely on cheap Chinese goods,"" said a former Chinese government official turned businessman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Mao Shishi, 44, who currently raises cattle in nearby Qingshuihe, wants to import wool and wild herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine from Kazakhstan to China through Horgos.

""I'm watching and waiting for any policy changes. Right now we can't import lamb, fish or wild herbs into China,"" Mao said.

Logistics thoroughfare

Plans to develop a parallel special economic zone in Khorgos — as it is known on the Kazakh side — as a logistics hub appear to be having more success.

Trade volumes are skyrocketing at the Khorgos Gateway dry port in Kazakhstan, where container freight is lifted off Chinese trains and onto Kazakh ones because of different gauge rail tracks.

""According to our plans, this year we are going to trans-ship around 100,000 TEUs, five times more than we are doing now,"" said Asset Seisenbek, head of the commercial department at Khorgos Gateway, referring to ""twenty-foot equivalent units,"" an industry measure based on standard shipping container sizes.

Electronics giants HP and Foxconn both ship goods through the dry port, which is faster than sea freight but cheaper than air cargo. One container sent by sea to Europe is about three times cheaper than rail, while air freight is between five to 10 times more expensive, according to Seisenbek.

Last month, China's COSCO Shipping and Lianyungang port took a 49 percent stake in Khorgos Gateway — which Seisenbek sees as an opportunity to attract more Chinese business.

This sort of investment is what Horgos/Khorgos should hang its hat on, according to Ma, the businessman underwhelmed by the international free trade zone.

""The free trade zone doesn't need to be that successful if the intercontinental trains and roads take off,"" he said. ""In the grand scheme of things, that's the main role for this part of the world.""","Mon, 05 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/6E2DB247-5517-4A48-9DF9-0FD657657B33.jpg,"['tax', 'haven', 'icbc', 'zone', 'khorgos', 'road', 'kazakh', 'horgos', 'hub', 'china', 'chinas', 'international', 'silk', 'trade', 'chinese', 'border']", 
93,93,FF-2019-000029-IDN,How to Drive Value From Big Data: Collaboration - Datanami,https://www.datanami.com/2017/06/07/drive-value-big-data-collaboration/,"Big data can transform enterprise operations, uncovering trends that could be easily overlooked and pointing the way to new opportunities. From detecting a seemingly insignificant mechanical problem that could shut down operations to pinpointing an untapped market, the value big data offers is significant.

Yet contrary to popular belief, instead of making it easier for businesses to extract relevant insight in a timely manner, big data can make it difficult. Data levels are rising, flooded with data sets from disparate systems and in formats that are both structured (Hadoop and NoSQL) and unstructured (Twitter, Facebook, blogs, shop floor readings, to name a few). These terabytes and petabytes of data sets do not automatically translate into the intelligence that various departments within an organization need.

Ultimately, extracting full value from big data is a paradox — both easy and hard. For complex big data to truly be of value, organizations must embrace a model of collaboration. The adage, “It takes a village to raise a child,” applies equally well when an organization collaborates to develop big data to its fullest potential.

Here, we’ll take a look at the inherent challenges of big data and what collaborating to drive value encompasses.

Data First, Schema Later

In the past, before the data could be ingested, the schema, or the way the data is stored, needed to be decided. This made it difficult to add new data sets. However, today’s big data platforms make it easy to ingest high volumes of data sets — a design choice known in the industry as “data first, schema later.” Essentially, data is taken in quickly, without effort to transcribe or cleanse it. How to make use of the data will be resolved later. The result is a flood of data that the average person cannot easily use.

Complexity

Nevertheless, the biggest challenge most big data platforms pose is their complexity. It’s difficult for someone who is not a developer and only using the tools available to map data and answer questions, such as why sales are dropping in a specific region.

Due to complexity and volume, extracting value from big data involves a three-step process: cleaning a data set; merging the clean data with yet another data set; and finally, employing additional advanced analytical concepts to map the merged data to the business objectives. Performing these operations calls for multiple tools and possibly writing code – not a simple operation for an average business user.

Collaboration Builds Value

It is virtually impossible today for an individual or department to understand and use the entire gamut of data being collected or its applicability to business outcomes. After all, it’s easy to get carried away with the promise of technology – processing higher and higher volumes of data points than ever before, as quickly as possible.

However for this ongoing stream of raw information to be truly valuable, multiple departments must be able to work in sync with the data and pool their knowledge. There must be a common language and structure so everyone can view, share knowledge gained, and collaborate to the benefit of the enterprise. What is needed to enable and encourage collaboration? A business must be able to work together using data within three areas:

1) Data set annotation

Data is a starting point for analytics. Big data has also led to an explosion of datasets, not necessarily all of good quality. Users should be able to annotate data sets about quality and relevance so they can quickly and easily be discovered others. Furthermore, as the data sets are used, the system should auto-annotate the datasets with the usage.

2) Transparency in data visualization and analytics

When someone analyzes a data set, a snapshot of the data flow and descriptions of what has been done should be visible to others as well, under proper governance. Typically referred to as lineage, transparency across the data life cycle includes its origins, movements and visualizations. This transparency ensures that people can easily learn from each other’s work and makes the analytics easy to maintain and enhance.

3) Analytics should be easily reused and shared

A big data system should encourage usage by others within the organization by ensuring that the analytics is written in a reusable format. Starting from scratch and re-creating someone else’s efforts wastes time and resources that could be better directed towards building additional knowledge. A framework that makes it easy to write analytics that can be reused ensures that the same analytics can be used repeatedly.

It is essential that stakeholders throughout the enterprise can extract the knowledge they need from this pool of terabytes and petabytes of data, while making it available for others to use as well. And, as more and more intelligence is added, the data grows more valuable. That is the power of collaboration.

Do you have a collaborative platform which makes it easy for different people in different departments to work together?

The 70-year-old Deuba replaced Prachanda, a former rebel commander, as prime minister after a parliamentary vote on Tuesday.



He has pledged to complete the remaining phase of village and municipal assembly elections set for June 28, leading to provincial and national elections before the end of the year.

The first phase of local polls was held on May 14.

""These are early appointments and the prime minister will expand the cabinet in consultation with coalition partners,"" said Deuba's aide and nephew, Bhanu Deuba.

The main appointment was Home Minister Janardan Sharma, a former guerrilla fighter, who will be in charge of overseeing all three elections the government hopes will complete a difficult transition since the monarchy was abolished in 2008.

The president's office said three members of the ethnic Madhesi minority were among the seven appointments.

Those appointments are seen as a bid to appease the Madhesis, who live on the southern plains bordering India and say a new constitution that creates new provinces will unfairly consolidate the power of the country's hill elite over them.

Among others appointed to the cabinet was Krishna Bahadur Mahara, also a Maoist, who will be a deputy prime minister in charge of the foreign ministry, the president's office said in a statement.","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/7BB01F91-0485-42A3-8C0B-3F5660AA8BE6.jpg,"['office', 'nepals', 'minister', 'prime', 'presidents', 'makes', 'charge', 'maoist', 'deuba', 'appointments', 'guide', 'cabinet', 'elections', 'picks', 'phase']",

Greening the Grid: Some U.S. fossil fuel power stations primarily run during periods of high cooling demand. The output from these “peaker” plants is relatively inefficient, producing higher emissions. Ground source heat pumps, which harness the Earth’s heating and cooling energy, could help an integrated energy grid meet periods of peak demand with renewable energy. Currently in the testing phase, a geothermal system with ground source heat pumps will be coming to Cornell, using the Ithaca campus as a living laboratory to test the technology.

Making the Most of Marginal Lands: Marginal land, including degraded farmland and contaminated sites, could be the next frontier for expanding biofuel production. Less-fertile soils are often poorly drained, with pronounced wet and dry cycles, and these fluctuations can also affect how plants respond to climate stress. The team will identify responses in the rhizosphere – the soil layer where plant roots and microorganisms interact – that help biomass crops thrive during drought and rewetting cycles, for better productivity in marginal soils and a changing climate.

The Future of Pharma Is Sustainable: Many medicines are unsustainable to mass-produce, demanding complex, energy-intensive manufacturing processes and leaving toxic wastes. This team is finding new ways to make drug manufacturing more efficient and sustainable. Partnering with Snapdragon Chemistry, the researchers are testing a new chemical synthesis process, recently discovered in Song Lin’s lab, that converts cheap, abundant natural resources like carbon dioxide into pharmaceuticals in a single operation. Combining this discovery with continuous-flow processes suitable for commercialization promises cleaner, greener pharmaceuticals.

Investigators: Song Lin, chemistry and chemical biology; Héctor Abruña, chemistry and chemical biology; Abraham Stroock, chemical and biomolecular engineering.

Sustainable Yield for Colombian Cows: In the developing world, family income and food security rise with dairy production. Facing climate change, disease and low-quality forage, South American dairy farmers often expand their businesses by raising more animals on more land. This team will help dairy farmers in Colombia sustainably by increasing the yield of each cow. The project will identify risk factors for metabolic diseases that limit milk production during early lactation, develop farm management strategies and introduce new technologies for disease control.

Small Device, Big Results: A pocket-sized device promises health workers around the world an easy, inexpensive way to detect antibiotic resistance and manage infections. Partnering with Weill Cornell Medicine, the researchers will develop Rapid Identification of Antibiotic Resistance (RIDAR), a handheld diagnostic tool that delivers near-instant information about a patient’s infection type to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. If the infection is bacterial, RIDAR will check its antibiotic susceptibility and suggest the most effective drug for treatment. Co-sponsored by MPH.

Wildlife-Friendly Beef: Vast fences in southern Africa separate cattle from wildlife that can carry foot-and-mouth disease, impeding key species migration routes. A new approach to keeping beef virus-free for international sale that does not completely depend on fences could open global markets for farmers, enhancing livelihood opportunities from agriculture and sustainable ecotourism. Working with partners in Botswana, this team will pilot test new guidelines for biosafety in beef production that rely on practical risk-mitigation steps, instead of habitat-disrupting fences.

Preparing for Earth Source Heat: An enhanced geothermal system could bring clean, renewable heat and a smaller carbon footprint to Cornell by 2035. Cornell’s Earth Source Heat (ESH) project will use hot water circulated deep within the Earth to heat Ithaca campus buildings. The researchers aim to refine this emerging technology by testing techniques for mapping how fluids move underground, optimal well placement and long-term safety monitoring. The team will also engage community stakeholders in assessing perceived risks and benefits and planning ESH implementation.

Green Is the Norm: U.S. racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in environmental activism, although they rank among the most environmentally concerned demographic groups. This study will counter the widespread misperception that people of color are indifferent to the environment by engaging with Latino communities in major cities. To boost Latino environmental action, the team will test public messages that “green” attitudes and behaviors are in fact the norm in minority communities – especially those facing acute environmental hazards.

Investigators: Jonathon Schuldt, communication; H. Oliver Gao, civil and environmental engineering; Neil Lewis, communication.

Photosynthesis for Farmers: African farmers face severe agricultural risks from drought, floods and disease outbreaks. Accurate early predictions can save lives. Relief initiatives like famine early warning systems and index-based agricultural insurance rely on satellite images that show farmland or pasture greenness but do not directly measure actual plant functioning. The researchers will develop a new framework to improve yield predictions and emergency response systems, using satellite chlorophyll fluorescence that can probe the molecular process of photosynthesis, including stress-induced degradation in crops.

Investigators: Ying Sun, soil and crop sciences; Yanyan Liu, Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, Dyson; David Matteson, statistical science/social statistics; Toby Ault, earth and atmospheric sciences.

Learning for Conservation: Understanding how organizations learn and what constrains learning is essential for advancing sustainability transitions. Partnering with the Environmental Defense Fund, an interdisciplinary team will study learning dynamics in habitat exchanges. These conservation platforms allow farmers and ranchers who maintain habitat for at-risk species to sell habitat credits to businesses to offset environmental degradation. The researchers will work with stakeholders to assess and build capacity for critical reflection and learning to help the exchanges thrive, along with the habitat and vulnerable species they aim to protect.

No Fish Tale: Feed of the Future: World demand for seafood is rising as wild fish stocks decline, creating an urgent need for new sources of protein to grow fish. The researchers are developing a process for converting the aquaculture industry’s wastes into protein-rich feed. The technique acid-preserves offal from seafood processing facilities and solidifies it, creating a sustainable feed directly out of fishery byproducts. The new feed system could eventually replace fishmeal, reducing the aquaculture industry’s feed costs and carbon footprint.

97,97,FF-2019-000029-IDN,The month of May in Costa Rica broke record on number of lightning strikes - Costa Rica Star News - The Costa Rica Star,https://news.co.cr/costa-rica-may-brought-more-rain-and-lighting-2017/61663/,"The month of May in Costa Rica closed with a surplus of rainfall, exceeding the predictions of the National Meteorology Institute, the number of lighting strikes doubled the number of 2016.

In the past weeks the country has registered seven tropical waves which generated heavy rainfall and thunder storms that caused floods and landslides in different areas of the country.

May registered a record of lightning strikes with a total of 295 thousand lighting strikes, which exceeds the 143 thousand that struck last year and that had already gone way over the average of 58,000 registered in this month since 2004, according to information provided by the Costa Rica Electricity Institute (ICE). The number of lightning strikes in May of 2017 also broke other records, with 110 thousand strikes in just one week (May 15-21), and 30 thousand discharges in just one day (May 19).

The total lighting strikes from January through May 31st is of 443 thousand; La Guácima, Orotina, Quepos, Golfito and Nicoya are the five locations in Costa Rica where there are more electric discharges. 2014 is the year that registered the biggest number of lightning strikes in the country with 1 million.

Experts consider that the number of lightning strikes will go down in June, but remind the population to take the necessary precautions during a thunder storm: find a safe place to wait until the thunderstorm passes (inside your home, office, or car); never stand under a tree during a thunderstorm, unplug electric appliances and do not use landline telephones.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.co.cr/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/thunderstorm-lightning.jpg,"['broke', 'registered', 'thunderstorm', 'month', 'strikes', 'lighting', 'thousand', 'number', 'lightning', 'total', 'record', 'rica', 'costa']",
