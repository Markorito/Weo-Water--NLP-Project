Rescuers are searching for two more villagers presumed to have drowned

About 40%2C000 people fled to temporary shelters

More than 1%2C000 houses have been flooded in the disaster

MANADO, Indonesia (AP) — Days of torrential rain triggered a landslide and flash floods on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 13 people and sending tens of thousands fleeing for safe ground, disaster officials said Thursday.

Residents and rescuers in Sangihe district of North Sulawesi province dug through debris with their bare hands and shovels. Two bodies were pulled from the mud, and eleven others were found in the water late Wednesday, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

More than 1,000 houses were flooded by overflowing rivers in five other districts of the province, he said.

About 40,000 people fled to temporary shelters, and rescuers were still searching Thursday for at least two more villagers.

Police and soldiers struggled to reach about 1,000 people who were isolated in three hamlets after floods destroyed the only bridge, said the agency's provincial chief Noldy Liow.

He said that rivers bloated by days of rain burst their banks and washed away dozens of houses and vehicles, including in the provincial capital of Manado. Floodwaters reached a meter (3.28 feet) in some places.

""Many people drowned or were buried by mud … they didn't have time to save themselves,"" Liow said.

Millions of people live in mountainous regions and near fertile plains that are close to rivers. Seasonal rains and high tides in recent days have caused widespread flooding across much of Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands that's home to 240 million people.","Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87e2ba25d5f8aead14beb50f2df1871378af68b0/c=0-300-4288-2719/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2014/01/15//1389848148000-indonesia.jpg?width=3200&height=1806&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,"['floods', 'landslide', 'temporary', 'rescuers', 'rivers', '13', 'days', 'kill', 'province', 'houses', 'searching', 'provincial', 'sulawesi', 'indonesia', 'rain']",

Flooding is not a new issue for Jakartans, so, when the rainy season arrives, most are already aware of what will happen and what to do when floods occur. Casualties, however, are still inevitable.



Here are five things locals usually do during floods in Jakarta.



Volunteer



Many kind-hearted Jakartans volunteer at soup kitchens serving flood victims.



These people usually actively serve meals at public kitchens, gather donations, or rescue animals.



For example, Family Welfare Movement (PKK) activists from Pancoran district came together to serve residents living on the embankment of the Ciliwung River who were evacuated to nearby shelters.



Pancoran PKK secretary Sefprita Berlianawati said that more than 20 members of her organization helped at the local public kitchen daily.



'There are several shifts so our members can share responsibilities,' she said.



Sefprita said that her group always helped during the rainy season.



Move valuables



Some places in the city get inundated almost every year.



Kampung Pulo and Bukit Duri in East Jakarta, Rawajati in South Jakarta, are among areas that are annually hit by floods.



When the rainy season arrives and floods start hitting, residents usually move their valuable items to the upper levels of their homes to protect their belongings.



Budi Astuti, a housewife living in Bekasi, West Java, said that she put her clothes inside a suitcase and placed it upstairs.



If the goods are too heavy to move, residents find other ways to keep their goods dry.



'My husband raised our sofa, refrigerator and other furniture,' said Tuti.



Besides clothes and furniture, residents rush to save important documents, jewelry and books.



Stock-up on food



Those living in flood-prone areas have usually armed themselves with an adequate supply of food.



Canned sardines, instant noodles, eggs, bottled water and crackers are among favorite things to stock-up on in case of floods. Besides being durable and easy to cook, these items also have flavor.



Food supply is another reason why many flood victims are reluctant to be relocated to shelters. Many prefer to stay in the upper levels of their home and guard their belongings. 'They usually want to be relocated to shelters after they run out of food,' Jakarta Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) spokesman Edy Junaedi said.



Make money



For many, floods mean disaster. But for many others, the rainy season provides business opportunities. Rainy season entrepreneurs will offer services to transport people with two-wheeled carts from their inundated homes to their destinations. One usually has to pay up to Rp 20,000 (US$1.65) one way.



Have fun anyway



For children, an abundant amount of water stuck in one place can provide the perfect opportunity to swim. Without a care, many children, mostly those who live in the slums, get used tires and swim happily in the muddy water with their friends.

Largely overlooked, however, are traditional systems of agricultural management which can help keep floodwaters at bay.

For centuries, almost all lands lying in the floodplains of English rivers were meadows. Managing these meadows involved an annual hay cut followed by grazing, providing essential hay feed for livestock over winter. Nutrient-rich silts deposited on the meadows by regular flooding acted as natural fertiliser, leaving them reliably productive. But over the past 70 years, the vast majority of these meadows have been lost to housing development, gravel extraction and quarrying, water abstraction, changes in agricultural use, or just lack of management.

Flood meadows, the unsung hero

Natural floodplains, and in particular floodplain meadows, could play a vital role in reducing the sort of flooding that has repeatedly wreaked havoc in towns and villages across Britain over the past decade. Meadows have the capacity to store vast quantities of flood water and release it slowly over time, lowering the peak water level. In contrast, modern flood defences use embankments to constrain floodwater to a narrow channel. This simply pushes the problem downstream, until floodwaters reach levels that can overwhelm defences – with sometimes catastrophic results.

The reason why meadows are so effective at soaking up sudden influxes of water is because traditional meadow systems produce good, open-structured soil. This not only supports a wide range of plant species, but also increases their capacity to absorb and store water. By comparison, the tilling (ploughing) of fields common with modern agricultural methods leaves soils more compact, reducing their ability to absorb water. Meadows represent an agricultural system that actually works in harmony with a dynamic river system: as well as absorbing flood water, they collect and put to good use the sediment that would otherwise be deposited further downstream, causing blockages and smothering valuable riverbed habitats.

A contemporary example of how such a system is actively aiding flood protection is Clifton Ings in York, managed as an official washland by the Environment Agency. By storing floodwater during periods of high flow it can reduce peak levels in the centre of York by 15cm – enough to blunt the risk of significant flooding. The site is managed as a traditional meadow and is a valuable habitat for wildlife – so much so that it has just been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

So other than their role in alleviating floods, floodplain meadows are among the UK’s most biodiverse systems, commonly boasting more than 30 different plant species in a single square metre, such as great burnet and rare snakeshead fritillary. The soils and plantlife also sequester carbon, helping in its own way to mitigate global warming, improve water quality by trapping phosphates, and of course are by themselves a beautiful landscape to enjoy.

Restoring meadows’ place in the countryside

And yet despite all the environmental benefits they bring, the loss of floodplain meadows over the last 70 years has been so rapid that less than 1,500 hectares of species-rich habitat now remain in the UK – an area only slightly larger than Heathrow airport. This loss has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in catastrophic flood events we have seen. Is it possible to turn the clock back? Our research with the Floodplain Meadows Partnership suggests it is.

A key to these meadows’ survival is to maintain or revive their traditional management. Originally handled by farmers, they rely on a viable agricultural system to keep them productive, and so ensure they are not displaced for other agriculture or development. Understanding how traditional management systems work and disseminating that knowledge is one function of the partnership, created in 2007 to focus on this key, threatened habitat and explore means of conservation.

Once lost is not always lost. We have demonstrated that it is possible to re-create floodplain meadows, given the right sites and with the right techniques. There are a number of good examples where the process of restoring meadows has begun, with many new projects beginning around the country. Financial support for restoration is currently available through Natural England’s Higher Level Stewardship scheme, and the partnership website holds information on how to go about restoring meadows, and links to local organisations that can help.

Perhaps we can never return to the golden age of the British meadow, but a renewed focus on how we use floodplains is long overdue. Money spent to enhance the role of meadows as an environmentally beneficial, sustainable and effective system of flood defence would be a sound long-term investment.","Mon, 13 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/38845/original/mb6jbt28-1389362281.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['defence', 'restore', 'systems', 'flood', 'floodplain', 'system', 'traditional', 'meadows', 'agricultural', 'water', 'costeffective', 'flooding', 'role']",

More than 55,000 families, or 260,000 people, have been displaced by the storm

Most of the deaths were by drowning or in landslides

The heavy rains were brought by tropical depression Agaton, which has now dissipated

A tropical depression that has brought flash flooding and landslides to the southern Philippines has left 45 people dead and displaced more than 260,000, authorities say.

Nearly 900,000 people have been affected by the heavy rains brought by Tropical Depression Agaton, having lashed the country for days, says the country's national disaster agency , with more than 55,000 families currently in emergency shelter in 585 evacuation centers.

Among those affected are survivors of November's Typhoon Haiyan, which left millions homeless in the Philippines, says relief organization Oxfam.

Oxfam's Philippines country director Justin Morgan said in a statement that thousands made homeless by Haiyan had been evacuated from rain-collapsed tents and flooded makeshift shelters to avoid being left exposed to the elements by Agaton, including in the ravaged city of Guiuan, the first town in Haiyan's path.

On top of the official death toll of 45, the Philippines national disaster agency said 68 people were injured and eight missing. Most of the deaths occurred in the regions of Caraga (19) and Davao (18), both situated on the southernmost island of Mindanao.

Most of the deaths were by drowning or in landslides, the disaster agency said.

More than 800 houses have been destroyed by Agaton, and nearly 1,300 partially damaged, while 50 roads and 25 bridges have been rendered impassable by flooding.

The current onslaught of bad weather began Friday when a low pressure area southeast of Guiuan developed into a tropical depression, with winds reaching 55 kilometers per hour (34 miles per hour) near its center.

After drifting east and west over the south of the country, Agaton weakened to become categorized as a ""low pressure area"" Monday. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration , PAGASA, said in an advisory late Wednesday that the ""low pressure area"" had dissipated.

PAGASA said that Mindanao and the Eastern Visayas could expect isolated showers and thunderstorms, while strong to gale-force winds associated with the surge of the monsoon were predicted to affect the seaboards of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas. It advised fishing vessels not to go to sea in order to avoid the expected large waves.

Over the last decade, the Philippines has consistently ranked in the top five most disaster-hit countries -- along with China, the United States, India and Indonesia -- according to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, or CRED.

Sitting on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean, the Philippines is situated in the most active area for tropical cyclones, due to the surrounding expanse of deep, warm ocean water.

Its more than 7,000 islands offer plenty of exposed coastline to the mercy of wind and rain, while its many mountains, dropping sharply to coastal areas, present a risk of landslides. Many buildings in the Philippines are not built to withstand a heavy battering from the elements.","Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140122014038-philippines-flooding-butuan-story-top.jpg,"['heavy', 'agaton', '45', 'philippines', 'dead', 'depression', 'area', 'pressure', 'low', 'displaced', 'tropical', 'landslides', 'left', '260000', 'flooding']", 
7,7,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Global Natural Disasters Cost Insurers $45B in 2013: Impact Forecasting - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/01/13/316882.htm,"In 2013, there were 296 separate natural disaster events that produced total economic losses of $192 billion – four percent below the 10-year average of $200 billion, but above the average 259 events, according to a report by global reinsurance intermediary Aon Benfield’s catastrophe model development center, Impact Forecasting.

The natural disasters caused total insured losses of $45 billion – their lowest since 2009 and 22 percent below the 10-year average of $58 billion, the report says.

In a reversal from 2012, the largest global events of 2013 were heavily concentrated in Europe and Asia, rather than in the United States. However, despite just 16 percent of all economic losses occurring in the U.S., the country accounted for 45 percent of all insured losses globally due to its greater insurance penetration.

Flood events accounted for 35 percent of all global economic losses during the year, which marked their highest percentage of aggregate losses since 2010. Notable events included major flooding in Central Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and Australia.

Meanwhile, severe drought conditions contributed to billion-dollar losses in Brazil, China, New Zealand, and the U.S. , according to the Impact Forecasting analysis.

Aon Benfield said U.S. insured losses, at 45 percent of the total, were in-line with the U.S. 42 percent share of global property premium.

The study highlights that the most deadly event of 2013 was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines in November, leaving nearly 8,000 people dead or missing.

“The year 2013 was an active year for serious catastrophe events but one in which the industry dodged the bullet of a single dominating insured event,” Stephen Mildenhall, CEO of Aon Benfield Analytics. “Typhoon Haiyan, however, demonstrated the real and ever-present potential for large scale destruction.”

The May/June floods in Central Europe were the costliest single event of the year, causing an estimated USD5.3 billion insured loss and approximately $22 billion in economic losses. Most of the flood losses were sustained in Germany, which also endured record-level insured hail losses during multiple summer convective thunderstorm events.

No hurricanes struck the U.S. during the year, as the country extended its record streak without a major (Category 3+) hurricane landfall to eight consecutive years. The previous record was set between September 1900 and October 1906.

A total of 15 tropical cyclones (Category 1+) made landfall globally in 2013, slightly below the 1980-2012 average of 16. Thirteen of the landfalls were registered in the Northern Hemisphere, including nine in Asia.

Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and the Americas (Non-U.S.) each sustained aggregate insured losses above their 10-year averages in 2013. The United States and Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions both incurred below normal insured losses.

The report also reveals that preliminary data indicates that 2013 was the fourth warmest year recorded since global land and ocean temperature records began in 1880.

9,9,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Owen Paterson has failed to factor climate change into flood insurance - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jan/10/owen-paterson-climate-change-flood-insurance,"With insurers receiving thousands of claims for flood damage caused to homes over the past few weeks, there are worrying signs that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is failing, under the stewardship of its Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, to take account properly of the implications of climate change for a new flood insurance scheme.

Much of the recent flooding has been triggered by heavy rainfall, with last month being the sixth wettest December in the UK since records began in 1910.

Some households are making their second insurance claim in two years after extensive flooding in 2012, the UK’s second wettest year on record, which, according to the Environment Agency, cost the economy £600 million.

Met Office data shows that four of the five wettest years in the UK have all occurred since 2000. Long-term averages of 30-year periods show an increase in annual rainfall of about 5% between 1961-1990 and 1981-2010. In addition, a preliminary analysis by the Met Office also indicates that 1-in-100-day extreme rainfall events have become more frequent since 1960.

In addition, global sea level is also rising by more than 3cm every decade, and poses a particular problem for coastal properties in south-east England where the Earth’s crust is slowly sinking.

So a combination of increased rainfall and rising sea level is clearly increasing the risk of flooding, and raising costs for both homeowners and insurers.

At present, insurance for properties at high risk of flooding is implicitly subsidised through higher premiums for all policy-holders. However, insurance companies have warned successive Governments over the past few years that the rise in the number of properties at risk of flooding has pushed the existing arrangement to breaking point.

In June 2013, Defra initiated a consultation about a proposal for a new scheme, called Flood Re, to provide cover for high-risk properties, paid for through an explicit levy on all policy-holders’ premiums.

Defra's original proposal was accompanied by an Impact Assessment which stated that Flood Re would cover about 500,000 homes, and to pay future claims, £180 million each year would need to be raised through a levy of about £10 on all policy-holders’ premiums.

But the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment pointed out in its response to the consultation that the Impact Assessment for Flood Re, which the Government expects will operate for between 20 and 25 years from 2015, had failed to take into account any increase in flood risk through rising sea levels and shifts in rainfall due to climate change.

The Institute highlighted the Climate Change Risk Assessment, published by Defra in January 2012, which concluded that the number of residential properties in England and Wales exposed to a significant risk of coastal or river flooding could increase from 370,000 in 2008 to between 450,000 and 800,000 by the 2020s, even when assuming no new buildings.

In early November last year, Defra appeared to acknowledge this serious mistake and promised to publish a revised clause to be added to the Water Bill and an updated Impact Assessment which “has taken account of the consultation responses, notably in terms of developing the analysis of transition to a free market, the potential impacts of climate change, impacts on property values and the costs of the options”.

However, its revised Impact Assessment, published on 29 November, simply dismissed, with a single statement, the potentially substantial rise in the number of homes at risk due to the impacts of climate change:

The significant uncertainties in these factors, the relatively short term transitional nature of measures being considered and the Environment Agency Long Term Investment Strategy whose aim is to match the lower climate change scenario suggest that the assumption of no change in flood risk is a reasonable one for comparing options against the baseline scenario.

Hence, Defra has assumed that new and enhanced flood defences will prevent the risk to any additional homes from becoming significant, and that its original calculations, which ignored climate change, require no modification at all.

But last July, the House of Commons Select Committee on Environment Food and Rural Affairs warned that “funding has not kept pace in recent years with an increased risk of flooding from more frequent severe weather events and the relatively modest additional sums to be provided up to 2020 will not be sufficient to plug the funding gap”.

This shows that Defra is unable or unwilling to perform the serious analysis needed to ensure that its plans for Flood Re are robust.

It also provides further evidence that Defra has been failing, since the appointment of Owen Paterson as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in September 2012, to ensure that the UK adapts and becomes more resilient to the impacts of climate change, particularly flooding.","Fri, 10 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389355332274/8f142a82-bb62-44ca-aece-a2cc7ac4d8f2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f186c41c569414c94d9b7b27b77ff93,"['climate', 'assessment', 'flood', 'rainfall', 'properties', 'environment', 'factor', 'paterson', 'failed', 'change', 'owen', 'risk', 'defra', 'flooding', 'insurance']",

An international team of scientists has predicted a 'substantial' increase in extreme El Niño events from the present-day through the next 100 years

An unusually strong El Niño event occurs every 20 years, but this new research shows this will double to one event every 10 years

The impact of El Niño events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $35billion to $45billion in damage

Extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El Niños are expected to double, according to new research.



Climate scientists have warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts, wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years.



The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $35billion to $45billion in damage.



Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes

EXTREME EL NINO EVENTS

Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific.

The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.

This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns.

The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others.

Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years.

The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent.

An international team of scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, has spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events.



‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study.



‘El Nino events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added.



Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific.



The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.



Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two'

This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others.



Mike McPhaden of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the question of how global warming will change the frequency of extreme El Niño events has challenged scientists for more than 20 years.



‘This research is the first comprehensive examination of the issue to produce robust and convincing results,’ he said.



The impacts of extreme El Niño events extend to every continent across the globe killed an around 23,000 people in the 1997 event.



Wenju Cai, lead author of the study from CSIRO, said: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’



The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events. This satellite image shows the El Nino weather phenomena in 1997, represented by the the white area at the equator, which shows how the warm waters stretch from Peru to Alaska

In Australia, the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982-1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths.



The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events.



They found a ‘substantial’ increase in events from the present-day through the next 100 years as the eastern Pacific Ocean warms in response to global warming.



Professor Matthew England, a co-author from CoECSS, said: ‘This latest research based on rainfall patterns, suggests that extreme El Niño events are likely to double in frequency as the world warms leading to direct impacts on extreme weather events worldwide.’



‘For Australia, this could mean summer heat waves, like that recently experienced in the south-east of the country, could get an additional boost if they coincide with extreme El Niños ,’ he added.","Mon, 20 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/20/article-2542556-005DD5A400000258-134_636x382.jpg,"['el', 'floods', 'extreme', 'event', 'strike', 'droughts', 'global', 'predicted', 'fires', 'scientists', 'events', 'niño', 'double', 'wild']", 
12,12,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Eye on the Tiger: Satellite Images a New Tool for Conservation - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/140119-open-landscape-partnership-platform-satellite-conservation-tigers,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, satellite images may tell a crucial story for conservationists and anyone else looking to protect tigers or other endangered species.

""Maps are a common language, and satellite images are an unfiltered channel of information,"" said Dmitry Aksenov, general director of Russia-based nonprofit Transparent World. ""With satellite monitoring, it's not possible to hide what you're doing on the ground—your dirty secrets of mining, logging, and pollution.""

The former biologist presented the Open Landscape Partnership Platform at an international conference in Moscow in October 2013. The platform is led by Transparent World, ScanEx Research and Development Center, the World Resources Institute, the World Bank, the Global Tiger Initiative, and Global Forest Watch.

The Global Tiger Initiative then put the Open Landscape Partnership Platform to use, analyzing super-high-resolution images from countries with tiger habitats—parts of Russia, India, China, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, and Thailand. Over the past few months, the images have expanded beyond tiger habitat to a wide swath of ecologically important areas, ranging from the Amazon Basin in South America to parts of Indonesia, covering more than 380,000 square miles (1 million square kilometers) of lush land.

The platform goes beyond Google Maps and Google Earth, in which images from remote and forested areas tend to be blurry. Each pixel on the Open Landscape platform represents nearly 20 inches (50 centimeters) on the ground—enough to identify individual people or specific types of trees.

""We devoted 23 years of our lives to making images from space affordable in terms of price, speed, and technical simplification—and it was at a time when Google Earth did not exist,"" said Olga Gershenzon, vice president of ScanEx Research and Development Center, which is footing the bill for the initial 2.25 million square kilometers (0.87 million square miles) of satellite images. (Other projects by the remote-sensing company include providing images to help search-and-rescue missions after an earthquake in Haiti and after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, as well as to monitor construction, forests, ice, and impending floods.)

Saving Tigers With Mapping

For conservationists focused on habitat loss—one of the biggest threats to tigers, snow leopards, and other big cat species—detailed satellite images may be pixelated gold. That's because, with the blink of a satellite lens as it passes over the Earth, conservationists can closely see what's happening on the ground.

In four years, land occupied by tigers shrank 4,600 square miles (12,000 square kilometers)—three times the area of Rhode Island—according to a report released by the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Wildlife Institute of India and cited recently in the Times of India. Tigers are now restricted to seven percent of their historical range of the past 200 years, claims scientist Uma Ramakrishnan of India's National Centre for Biological Sciences.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Smaller, more fragmented habitat areas mean more territory conflicts among the big cats, and more clashes with humans along habitat edges as tigers pursue their prey, scientists warn. And with fewer than 3,500 tigers left in the wild, connectivity between populations is essential to their genetic viability.

In addition to the human footprint of housing and road construction, other factors jeopardize the habitats of tigers and other wildlife. Palm oil, used in cosmetics, foods, and household products, is produced on plantations that have cleared extensive tiger and orangutan landscapes. So have plantations that produce pulpwood for paper. From 2009 to 2011, forest clearing for both types of plantations destroyed two-thirds of all tiger habitat in Sumatra's deep peatland forests.

But changes in vegetation often leave a trace. With satellite images, the plantations ""look very different from the natural structure, where you could see a mosaic of different tree sizes, different species, and different colors of leaves,"" said Aksenov.

High-resolution images can also uncover ecological disasters that may otherwise remain concealed, like fires and oil spills. In 2010, the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, which was constructed to export crude oil to Asian nations, posed a potential threat to Siberian tigers when it leaked more than 10,000 cubic feet (280 cubic meters) of oil in eastern Siberia.

Though that accident was reported, ""many times we caught oil spills in Russia that were never presented to the public,"" said Aksenov. Greenpeace also claims that the Russian oil industry spills more than 30 million barrels on land each year, often without reporting it.

From high above, oil spills can resemble black pools, which could be confused with water. But thermal satellite images distinguish oil from water, since water is cold and oil emits heat.

Saving Other Species, Too

Nikolay Vorobiev, a geographic information systems specialist with Sakhalin Environment Watch, which strives to protect the natural ecosystems of Russia's largest island, plans to use images from the Open Landscape platform to protect salmon spawning grounds from gold miners and to check for oil spills from a skeleton of pipelines stretching across Sakhalin.

The organization began satellite monitoring with ScanEx and Transparent World three years ago. Before that, ""we spent a lot of time and effort identifying violations for fish traps using boats and GPS,"" he said. ""I was amazed when I realized that the satellite sees all violations,"" he said about the more efficient technology.

Within three years, the group reported thousands of violations with fish traps. As a result, the number of violations decreased by 68 percent in 2013.

The imagery need not be solely for scientists. Anyone with an Internet connection can access the Open Landscape website. They can draw lines and points on the images, and share coordinates. Applicants willing to wait three months can request specific imagery, buy it, or obtain original data directly from Digital Globe, the satellite provider. (One limitation is that the images provided by the satellites are, at least for now, on a six-month delay. This means that by the time someone receives a specific image they requested, it would have been taken nine months earlier.)

So far, the platform has received 20 applications, mainly from scientists, universities, and nonprofit organizations. But it may be just the beginning—and a way to diversify the satellite image industry, which relies heavily on U.S. government support.

13,13,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Thames Barrier raised again - RealClimate,https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/01/thames-barrier-raised-again/,"Back in 2007 I wrote a post looking at the closures of the Thames Barrier since construction finished in 1983. Since then there has been another 7 years of data* and given that there was a spate of closures last week due to both river and tidal flooding, it seems a good time to revisit the topic.

The Barrier is in the Thames Estuary in the South-East UK and is raised whenever there is a risk of flooding in London proper. The Thames below Teddington weir is tidal with quite a wide range and so (the very real) risks are greatest at high tide. Risks are elevated for one of two reasons (and occasionally both) – either the river flow is elevated, and so a normal high tide would cause flooding (a ‘fluvial’ risk) or the tide itself is elevated (usually associated with a storm surge) (a ‘tidal’ risk). Both river floods and storm surges have a potential climate change component, and so the frequency of closure and the reasons why might be useful in assessing whether risks have changed in recent years. Countering that though, there have been non-climatic changes to how flooding risks are managed, improved hydrological modelling which gives better predictability, and local subsidence issues which will increase flooding risks but is not climatic in origin. Connecting flooding (or flood risks) to climate change is always complicated – as this recent Carbon Brief posting reminds us.

So how many closures have their been?

Red denotes the closures that are tidal in origin, grey is the total number of closures. Obviously tidal closures are dominant, but closures due to the river flooding in 2001, 2003 and this season are very notable. However, for the reasons outlined above and discussed previously, the raw number of closures – despite having increased over the years, is not a clean indicator of climate changes. We can look a little deeper at the data though.

For each closure, there is a record of the high water level at Southend (at the mouth of the Estuary), the river flow at Teddington and how much of the high water level was due to a storm surge. These are plotted below for each of the closures. Note that closures come in clusters, all are during the winter months (Sep-Apr) and in cases where the river flow is high, closures can happen for multiple high tides in a row.

Looking at the changes in these causes is interesting. The highest storm surges were in 2007 and 1993 but there is no apparent trend. The river flow data are more enigmatic, with the peak flows post-2000 standing out, but since there is much better data on the history of the Thames flow, that data should be looked at instead to determine trends. There is also a summary description of the first 100 years of data at Teddington available.

The high water record is perhaps the most interesting and there seems to be an upward trend in the peak levels. However, sea level rise at Southend to 1983 was about 1.2 mm/year and in the 30 years since then, one would expect 3.5 to 5.0 cm more, which is much less than what one would deduce from the peaks in the figure. So, again, a deeper look into the more direct data is probably warranted.

I therefore conclude, as I did in 2007, that:

Thames Barrier closings tell a complicated story which mix climate information with management issues and are probably too erratic to be particularly meaningful – if you want to say something about global sea level, then look at the integrated picture from satellites and tide gauges. But it is a good illustration of adaptive measures that are, and will increasingly be, needed to deal with ongoing climate change.

At first glance you might think the otherworldly light in these pictures comes from a nebula or another planet deep in outer space.

In fact it is made by burning sulphur which pours from the side of the Kawah Ijen volcano on planet Earth, which is part of the Ijen volcano complex in East Java, Indonesia.

Miners have run ceramic pipes from vents in the side of the mountain to collection points inside a large crater where the molten chemical is left to cool before being broken up and carried away.

Out of this world: While these pictures may appear to be from another planet, they are in fact produced by burning sulphur here on Earth

The molten chemical comes from the sides of the Kawah Ijen volcano in Indonesia and is directed through pipes by miners to collection points in a nearby crater

While the sulhpur appears bright red during the day, at night it gives off an eerie blue light with flames that can reach up to five foot in height.

The miners who rely on the sulphur for their livelihoods work in treacherous conditions at the bottom of the crater. They wear nothing other than t-shirts and trousers as they collect the yellow material, despite toxic fumes being given off and the fact that the molten sulphur is heated to more than 240F.

They must also avoid the deadly turquoise-blue lake which takes up most of the crater floor, as it is made up of almost pure sulphuric acid, and would instantly kill anyone unlucky enough to fall in.





Once the chemical element has cooled the miners break off blocks weighing up to 220lb and haul it away by hand in order for it to be sold

The sulphur appears bright red during the day, but as the sun sets the blue flames - which can reach up to five foot in height - start to become visible

They must also move solid blocks of sulphur weighing up to 220lb up a very steep slope in order to sell them, using nothing more than a basket and their bare hands.

Photographer Olivier Grunewald, who captured some of these amazing shots, had to wear a gas mask during his expedition into the crater, and lost two lenses and a camera while trying to capture the mysterious pictures.

As a result, there have been growing concerns over the protective measures needed, particularly with respect to energy and infrastructure systems within cities that are also experiencing mounting risks and exposure levels.

In order to avoid risks and damage, and to strengthen resilience to natural disasters, national and local governments need to be prepared. At the local level, authorities must take action to construct policy packages that include locally based risk prevention facilities as well as risk finance and risk transfer systems.

A proposal for the establishment of a risk management facility has been submitted by the Parties and other organizations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The proposal by the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative consists of a three-tier risk management module for the international level, an international risk pooling mechanism for developing countries, an insurance assistance facility to cover medium-level risks, and a prevention pillar to achieve risk reduction.

In addition to governments and private enterprises that offer financial support and the provision of necessary goods and services to cover losses post-disaster, risk financing and risk transfer tools such as insurance, reinsurance, and catastrophe-linked securities are key. Such tools help to reduce the negative economic impacts of extreme risks.

This article discusses the risks associated with natural disasters, with particular focus on the vulnerability of energy systems. It examines the opportunities for local/community-based infrastructure to prevent risks through installing locally based energy systems, financing mechanisms to prevent risks and risk transfer systems as well as the associated challenges that exist with respect to their establishment.

Natural disasters and risks

As Aekapol Chongvilaivan noted in his 2012 paper, natural disasters, such as the 2011 floods in Thailand, have had huge impacts on urban systems and their associated infrastructure.

The nuclear power plant accident at Fukushima in Japan on 11 March 2011, a result of an earthquake and tsunami, highlighted the constraints of the existing energy system in Japan as well as its vulnerability to extreme events. Japan’s energy system is very centralized and dominated by ten regional electrical companies — according to data from Japan’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, about 90 per cent of the country’s power generation. For example, electricity in the megacities of Tokyo and Yokohama is provided by the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which depended on nuclear power plants for 29.7 per cent of its total generated electricity.

“ In consideration of natural disasters, which are expected to become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change, governments must be proactive and take a preventative approach to constructing resilient infrastructure and management systems within the city or community in cooperation with private and local non-profit organizations

The 2011 catastrophe increased public awareness on energy security, making it apparent that a review of energy security was necessary for the country, and that both a nationwide recovery plan and city-level recovery plans were needed. This has also emphasized the need for an innovative and resilient energy system with a diversified and decentralized energy supply and management system, including the development of more flexible, locally based energy supply and risk prevention facilities to quickly respond to risks.

Locally based development for enhancing resilience

More than a decade has passed since the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted (in 1997), which commits its Parties to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby setting mitigation targets and related climate change policy at the national level. This has also prompted individual cities to do the same, oftentimes more successfully.

For example, many local programmes and initiatives have been established in various countries, e.g., the Future City initiatives in Japan, Tianjin Eco-City in China, Thailand’s Low Carbon City pilot project and the Low Carbon Society project in Iskandar, Malaysia.

In Japan’s case, these city-based developments were launched as part of the National Strategic Projects in its “New Growth Strategy”, published in June 2010. The New Growth Strategy policies (blueprint for revitalizing Japan) were set up as a result of a Cabinet decision in 2010. One of the components is “Revitalizing rural cities and towns by utilizing regional resources; revitalizing big cities to serve as engines of growth”. The targets to achieve by 2020 are to utilize regional resources to the greatest possible extent and to increase regional power, as well as to make strategic, prioritized investments in airports, ports, roads and other infrastructure in major urban areas.

In consideration of natural disasters, which are expected to become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change, governments must be proactive and take a preventative approach to constructing resilient infrastructure and management systems within the city or community in cooperation with private and local non-profit organizations. Assessment of the damages of disaster risks and the costs associated with natural disasters ex-ante is also important. Therefore, for fully effective risk management and implementation, locally based facilities in line with an international risk management facility are needed.

After the recent sequence of natural disasters in Asia — including the flooding in Thailand, earthquake in Indonesia, and earthquake and tsunami in Japan — and their severe impacts on society, city-based risk management has become a major focus, particularly in Japan, and has been added in the components of local development strategies for enhancing resilience at this level.

In Japan, an “autonomous decentralized regional development model project utilizing regional renewable energy” was initiated in 2011. The project was implemented with additional funding of 1.0 billion yen in 2012. The budget was increased to 1.6 billion yen in 2013 under the programme of sustainable regional development (about 33 billion yen is planned to be distributed in 2013), according to the Ministry of the Environment budget request in 2013. The private sector has been a key actor in the implementation and has also included other players such as research institutions and local governments.

Community-based management systems and investment

In order for a decentralized, locally based energy system to exist, funding is required for the installation and operation of new facilities, such as solar power generation stations. In Japan, increasing attention has been paid to the establishment of such financial mechanisms as the result of raised public awareness on sustainable energy and security. Available funds have been identified through government subsidies, but cannot be fully relied upon, making it important to seek out other sources.

Various local funds have been established through investments from the private sector and also from voluntary citizen donations. Financial instruments have included the issuance of certificates, promissory notes, and small-issue bonds through financial institutions. For example, a micro-credit fund is an investment fund designed to finance microfinance institutions (MFIs), which provide financial services such as small loans to small enterprises. MFIs deliver microcredit through local banking, solidarity groups and individual loans.

In the case of Japan, for instance, after the Fukushima accident, the online retail investment fund management company (Music Securities Inc, Tokyo) set up new micro-credit funds to raise capital for small enterprises in the Tohoku region, which has been hugely affected by the accident. However, these instruments and methods vary and are dependent on the specific structures of funding within cities.

A challenge for local low-carbon energy investment availability and feasibility is the high degree of uncertainty and risks inherent in renewable energy technologies. Uncertainty is high due to the lack of experience and history in the case of green energy and community-based projects, and the lack of understanding on the associated social and environmental impacts as well as potential economic benefits. Therefore, local government and investors who provide subsidies or invest in these efforts must utilize proper analytical tools to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the local energy project including any economic, social and environmental impacts of its implementation prior to any decision-making.

Risk prevention and transfer

In addition to the establishment of locally based energy systems, risk prevention or risk transfer systems mitigating the financial impacts of natural disasters must also be established at the local level. Agendas for the formulation of systems to reduce disaster risk and establishment of funding mechanisms, such as risk financing, have been attracting attention. Risk financing can be used to quickly secure funds before and after disasters, and also investigates countermeasures against natural disasters, including methods such as insurance and climate change adaptation measures.

Economic loss attributed to extreme weather events around the world increases demand for the development of risk management and risk transfer schemes. Many nations, including both developed and also developing countries, have established such insurance schemes that improve adaptation capacity to disaster events.

One strategy to support the economic recovery immediately after a disaster includes a weather insurance index. This allows for the benefit of quick payment to aid in recovery post-natural disaster due to the parameters of the index (e.g., the wind speed of a hurricane or the degree of ground acceleration caused by an earthquake) rather than the actual damages that typically determine the conditions of payment. Use of these parameters aids in the liquidity of funding and helps insurees with more immediate recovery, as payments are paid as quickly as possible after the occurrence of disaster.

Development challenges

When introducing such a risk transfer mechanism, challenges are prone to exist in the development, dissemination and design of the risk transfer scheme. Uncertainty is high when disasters occur in places that, in particular, lack appropriate infrastructure for pre-disaster management, lack data related to weather, or have unreliable data with respect to quality. Other challenges include residual risk (e.g., the exposure to loss remaining after other known risks have been countered, factored in, or eliminated), the uncertainty of unexpected events due to the inability to quantify events of rare occurrence, the inaccuracy/unavailability of climate data, or poorly designed risk-mitigation mechanisms and management systems.

These are all of particular concern within developing countries where high residual risk results in high insurance premium costs that small enterprises and citizens in developing countries cannot afford. Therefore, for minimizing the residual and baseline risk, governmental support to cover expected losses and risk premiums, as well as to formulate reliable risk management mechanisms from accurate data (including compiled historical data and capacity development) is necessary.

Moreover, the challenges to the development of disaster risk insurance are profound in cities of developing countries that are disproportionately impacted by natural disasters such as typhoons, floods and drought — usually exacerbated by high population density and inadequate infrastructure. These challenges usually stem from the weaknesses that exist in observation systems including quality of data, availability of data, weather observation stations, the automation of the weather observation system to record and compile the data at the local/regional level (not only at the national level), and ageing facilities and equipment.

Therefore, for the improvement of risk prevention mitigation, first, the improvement of quality data and facilities to more accurately forecast and estimate risks is needed. The expansion, modernization and strengthening of a meteorological observation network is also necessary. Improvements in data processing are essential for the development of basic meteorological data for building a risk financing system, regardless of the field and approach of risk insurance or risk transfer mechanisms.

A policy package to prevent natural disaster risks at the local level — including low-carbon infrastructure, risk assessment for investment and risk transfer systems — are needed. Future disaster preparedness requires the establishment of risk financing systems. It is necessary to have not only locally based infrastructure systems such as community-based energy management and supply systems and financing mechanisms, but also risk transfer mechanisms including risk insurance for natural disasters.

In addition to the establishment of these systems at the local level, a basic infrastructure of data for risk assessment and estimates is required, and also a strengthening of regional or informational cooperation between cities or countries across both the developed and developing world.

Finally, it is imperative, as in the case of Japan, to develop and build a collaborative environment for public institutions and private companies for the success of these locally based initiatives.

20,20,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Bushfire planning leaves behind people with disabilities - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/bushfire-planning-leaves-behind-people-with-disabilities-21792,"When bushfires start, no one should be more worried than people with disabilities. Recent research shows people with disabilities are twice as likely to die or be injured than the general population during a disaster. They are also less likely to receive aid and less likely to recover in the long-term.

Jo Ragen, a senior research associate at the University of Sydney, describes her experience of a bushfire evacuation in the 1994 fires along Australia’s eastern seaboard:

We had over 100 young people with physical disabilities at a recreational camp, and I told the [State Emergency Service] we can’t be leaving on trucks. Even though they thought we had enough time to get out, in the end, that’s what happened: young people were loaded onto the back of trucks and utes and we left behind what was really essential equipment for those being evacuated – wheelchairs, ventilators. It taught me that people with disabilities need to be involved right from the planning stage. Thinking that someone is going to turn up and ‘rescue’ a person with a disability means someone is going to be forgotten and a catastrophic outcome is real.

As Australian authorities urge the general community to prepare and plan for bushfires, the early warning systems and public awareness campaigns are often failing to consider the needs of persons with disabilities.

Advice on the ground specifically for people with disabilities is pretty slim, and for bushfires is centred on the message of “leave early”. But recent research by the Bushfire Collaborative Research Centre finds many people instead choose the “wait and see” option. In fact, less than 1% would leave their house on days of extreme or catastrophic fire danger.

This may be compounded for a person with a disability, as leaving early can be difficult as it means leaving behind essential equipment at home that is needed for daily living.

How we could be better prepared

For people with disabilities, significant gaps exist in current approaches to bushfire risk reduction.

Communications about bushfire preparedness are often not in accessible formats. There are assumptions that people with disabilities are living in households dependent on others, when many are either living independently or are heads of households.

As Jo Ragen says:

Plans that lump all people with disabilities together are like plans that say ‘all people with blond hair must do this in a bushfire’. In my experience, when you wait for others to plan, or think someone else will evacuate you, you’ll either get evacuated in a way that is not safe or appropriate, or you’ll get left behind.

There are various measures being done to improve this situation in Australia.

For example, a recent report on “Increasing the Resilience of the Deaf Community in NSW to natural hazards” found that while none of the natural hazard preparedness programs or tools cater specifically to deaf people, there were communication tools that could be considered “deaf-friendly” or required only small alterations.

A recent United Nations survey consulted nearly 6,000 people with disabilities in 126 countries, and found a high proportion of people with disabilities die or suffer injuries during disasters because they are rarely consulted about their needs and governments lack adequate measures to address them.

In cases where they need to evacuate - such as during floods or earthquakes - only 20% of respondents said they could evacuate immediately without difficulty, 6% said they would not be able to evacuate at all, and the remainder said they would be able to evacuate with a degree of difficulty.

So where does that leave Australians during what is proving to be another dangerous bushfire season?

The only way we will ensure that no one is left behind is if people with disabilities are actively included in the consultation, planning and preparedness stages of thinking about disasters. Specific input and ideas from people with disabilities is essential for identifying risks and increasing the chance of survival if disaster does strike.","Tue, 21 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/38552/original/tqxqh4th-1389055055.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['research', 'recent', 'likely', 'bushfire', 'disabilities', 'evacuate', 'planning', 'leaving', 'left', 'preparedness', 'leaves', 'leave']",

By Paul Brown, Climate News Network

LONDON – The world’s richest countries have made some progress since the 1990s in limiting environmental damage. But they have not done enough to prevent catastrophic climate change, according to the OECD, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Scientists say that carbon dioxide emissions need to start going down in the next decade to prevent global temperatures reaching dangerous levels. But the OECD predicts that levels of carbon dioxide will continue to rise and by 2050 will be 50 percent higher than today.

The 34 OECD countries in the survey are mainly the older mature economies which in the 1970s produced well over half the world’s CO2 emissions from their factories and transport. Now the OECD share of total world emissions has dropped to 30 percent, but only because of the vast increase in the energy use of China and other high-growth countries like Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and South Africa. These now account for 40 percent of global emissions on their own.

More Vehicles

There is some good news in the report. Some OECD countries have both increased production and reduced CO2 emissions by introducing renewables and energy efficiency.

The problem for those that fail to do so appears to be political, with countries like Australia and Canada, which have repudiated the Kyoto Protocol, apparently also abandoning most policies to combat climate change.

The report, Environment at a Glance 2013, says that on average there has been progress. Since 1990 there has been a drop of 25 percent in the amount of energy required to produce a unit of production in member countries, but this is well short of what is needed to safeguard the planet.

The report, which reviews OECD members’ efforts to combat climate change by reducing fossil fuel use, says that the overall energy mix has barely changed in 20 years. There is still an 80 percent reliance on fossil fuels, although there has been a lot of switching from coal to gas, which does reduce emissions.

Renewable energy is still only 9 percent of the total energy supply. Another problem is the increasing demand for transport. Smaller, more efficient engines are failing to offset a 17 percent increase in vehicle numbers.

Rejecting Kyoto

The major political driver for reducing emissions since 1997 has been the Kyoto Protocol. Countries which made pledges to reduce emissions, principally those in the expanded European Union, have made most progress.

This is partly due to the economic recession and exporting some dirty industries to China and other developing countries, but domestic efficiency measures and switching to renewables has helped.

The growth in vehicle numbers has outweighed the benefits of better engine efficiency.

Among the worst performing countries are those that made pledges under the Kyoto Protocol and subsequently abandoned them for political reasons – the United States, Canada and Australia.

The top four countries in the per capita emissions table (the amount of CO2 emitted for each person in a country) has Australia in the lead and Luxembourg second, followed by the United States and Canada.

Positive Note

Luxembourg makes the list only because of its low taxes on fuel, which mean that motorists from neighboring countries fill up their cars at its petrol pumps and then drive back over the border.

Australia relies heavily on coal burning to power its industry and also exports large quantities of coal to China. The new government turned its back on international efforts to combat climate change last year. Canada had previously done the same, deciding instead to exploit its tar sands for oil production, involving high-energy use.

The United States has high per capita carbon emissions because of the lavish lifestyles of its citizens and a powerful Republican lobby that supports the fossil fuel industry and blocks any attempt to combat climate change.

On what the OECD calls “a positive note,” its members have slashed emissions of sulphur oxides by 69 percent since 1990 and of nitrogen oxide by 36 percent in the same period.

Sulphur oxides, in various forms, are a chief cause of acid rain and a potent greenhouse gas. Nitrogen oxides are also a contributor to climate change and low level ozone, which damages plants and buildings and irritates human lungs.

These reductions have been possible because of political action, showing that it is not the lack of technology that prevents the world tackling climate change but the lack of will and legislation.

Damage from Typhoon Haiyan, Dulag, Leyte, November 22, 2013. (Eric Jankstrom)



To learn how you can help typhoon victims in the Philippines, click here . And to meet an Asia Society Asia 21 Young Leader who started a grassroots relief effort called Bundles of Joy, click here

Last week, Weather.com travel editor (and former AsiaSociety.org producer) Stephanie Valera published ""The Sea Washed It Away,"" a powerful, on-the-ground multimedia report from the Philippines depicting the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, the deadliest typhoon ever to hit that country, with more than 6,000 casualties recorded to date. Based on her interviews with survivors, the piece is a wrenching account of human endurance in the face of an almost inconceivable natural disaster.

The story also resonated personally with Valera as a Filipino journalist based in New York City. She describes her experience interviewing her countrymen as ""very intense and emotional"" — but ultimately, she says, she was struck by their resilience and consideration for one another in a time of severe crisis.

Not long after ""The Sea Washed It Away"" appeared online, Valera answered Asia Blog's questions about her experiences in the Philippines via email.

How did ""The Sea Washed It Away"" come about?

To provide a bit of background, Weather.com has started doing long-form, multimedia features and after Typhoon Haiyan (known as Yolanda in the Philippines) struck, we knew it would be important to tell the stories of survivors in a more in-depth manner. Of course, we had coverage of the typhoon before, during and after (with insights from our experts and meteorologists, reports of casualties and photo slideshows of the devastation, etc.), but we wanted to present original video featuring voices of those who lived and experienced it. It was just an important story to tell, so The Weather Channel [weather.com's parent company] decided to send me and a video producer/shooter to the Philippines.

I flew to Manila on November 17 and then to Tacloban, Leyte (the ""ground zero"" of the destruction) on November 20 with a video producer. This was about a week after the typhoon struck, but Tacloban was still pretty much a disaster zone. Flying in to the airport in Tacloban was a heartbreaking experience — there really was no airport anymore to speak of. Passengers on the plane were wiping away tears as they peered out of the windows into utter devastation.

We were in Tacloban for about five days. The video producer, Eric Jankstrom, and I then traveled to the affected communities to talk to as many people as we could, everyone from survivors living in tents alongside roads, people asking for help in finding their missing family members, and village leaders who had to oversee mass burials to mayors of affected towns, relief and volunteer workers, military personnel, and evacuees living in centers, etc. Gas was pretty hard to get so it was hard to travel, but we were able to drive to coastal villages outside Tacloban, where we interviewed more survivors and relief workers.

After flying back to Manila (on a U.S. C-130 military plane!), we also visited Villamor Air Base (where evacuees from Leyte and Samar were being flown in) and the Tent City to interview more people.



Stephanie Valera in Tacloban

You are yourself Filipino, of course, but you also went to Leyte as a representative of a Western media outlet. Did you have any sense people were reluctant or hesitant to talk to you — or not?

People were actually more willing to speak to me because I'm Filipino and I speak the language. Filipinos are English-speakers too, but when they speak in their native language (whether in Tagalog or Cebuano) they can elaborate on details and express more emotion, and be less formal when they speak. They would inject humor into the conversation sometimes or just be more willing to talk at length about what they experienced than when they speak in English. Being able to speak the language definitely gave me an advantage when it came to getting them to tell me their stories.

Offline you alluded to the intense, even overwhelming emotion you experienced in conducting these interviews. Is that something you can describe, even briefly?

Interviewing the typhoon survivors was a very intense and emotional experience for me. As a Filipino, I, of course, felt for my countrymen and women. I rarely get to go back to the Philippines now and it was definitely difficult for me to return at such a tragic time for the country. But it was also enlightening/uplifting experience for me because it reminded me of how strong and resilient Filipinos are — and how thoughtful they are even in times of personal tragedy.

For instance, when I was at the mass grave in Palo, I was talking to a man who was there to bury his wife, but he was more concerned for me that I didn't have my face mask (to block the stench) on. Or when we were in the evacuation center, and people there who kept offering us food. These are people who lost everything they own, except for the clothes on their backs. And of course, just hearing about the loss of lives, you can't help but be affected emotionally.

Some of the survivors you interviewed are extremely blunt about the government's failure to deliver aid in a timely fashion after the typhoon. Is that failure the source of any lingering bitterness in these areas?

In the immediate aftermath of the typhoon, I think there was a sense of bitterness about the delay in getting relief to the worst-hit areas. I think this is only natural in the wake of the utter devastation. But as the recovery continues, I also think there is less and less bitterness and there is more of a general willingness to help each other, to stay positive and to get back on their feet. One of the many good qualities of Filipinos is their ability to smile through hardship and to stay positive amidst tragedy. There will be some blaming and some bitterness in the immediate aftermath, but they will soldier on. We saw and experienced this positivity so many times while we were in Tacloban, and we also tried to reflect that in our piece.

""The Sea Washed It Away"" conveys a sense of what it's like to be in a disaster zone not only immediately post-catastrophe, but weeks and months later, when the world's attention has largely moved on. In your opinion, what needs to happen next in the afflicted regions?

Recovery is all about people, so I think the country needs to continue to implement programs that will help children go back to school, or help people rebuild their homes and their livelihoods so they can regain their productive lives. Also, the Philippines is no stranger to natural disasters. Because of its location, it will regularly experience flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and typhoons. So as recovery and reconstruction continue post-Haiyan, there is also a need to focus on long-term improvements. I am not an expert, of course, but I think many will agree that there is a need to work on disaster preparedness, early warning/communication and emergency operations strategies for future extreme weather events, especially on the local and community level.

I know that we can't blame Haiyan (or any one weather event) on climate change but national and local governments must implement climate-change adaptation and disaster-risk reduction programs to help communities be more resilient to typhoons and storm surges (funding for these programs will be an issue too, of course).

78,000 people have now fled to neighbouring countries since mid-December. More than half have headed for Uganda's West Nile region straddling South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In all, 42,654 mostly women and children, from Nimule in South Sudan, are now in the Ugandan districts of Arua, Adjumani and Kiryandongo. According to colleagues, many men are taking their families to the Ugandan border and leaving them there before returning back to their country. From the refugees we have spoken to we are hearing eye-witness accounts of killings, houses been burnt and shooting.

The largest concentration of people currently is at the Dzaipi transit center in Adjumani District, by the border with Nimule, where there are 32,505 refugees. The center was initially designed to only host 400 people, so most of those there are having to sleep in the open with their children and complaining of cold at night. As well as shelter, they need clean water, food, and basic household goods. As more people continue to arrive daily at Dzaipi we are working with the Ugandan authorities to set up additional camps

Ethiopia is also seeing an upsurge in arrivals. 18,616 South Sudanese have crossed into the Akobo area from the Jonglei region and we are beefing up our staff presence to better monitor new arrivals and respond to their needs.

Kenya has also seen 6,778 arrivals from Jonglei state. UNHCR is concerned by the large presence of children among them and we are planning a joint assessment mission with UNICEF to find out more about their situation, and the needs - including family reunification or foster care for those who are separated or unaccompanied.

In Sudan, available estimates are that 10,000 have crossed into West and South Kordofan, two states that are themselves volatile. The majority are nomads and, so far, we have not been able to verify exact numbers due to lack of access. However, the Government of Sudan says that, so far, only 1,371 of the new arrivals are South Sudanese refugees. UNHCR, WFP and other partners are providing assistance to these people via local partners, as well as to some of the nomads who are in dire need of humanitarian assistance.

With fighting still being reported in parts of South Sudan-mainly in the states of Jonglei and Upper Nile - and the slow progress in the political talks in Addis Ababa, we are anticipating further displacement both within and beyond the borders of South Sudan. Internal displacement figures are now at 355,000, up from 200,000 last week. The added displacement is being fuelled by the fighting itself as well as by fear of it, combined with deteriorating living conditions, including a lack of food in some markets.

Despite the challenges UNHCR continues to provide assistance to 230,000 refugees in 10 camps in South Sudan. We are planning to begin food distribution tomorrow for some 77,000 Sudanese refugees in the camps of Yida and Ajuong Thok in Unity State, with the support of the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, which has agreed to redeploy troops to secure Yida.

27,27,FL-2014-000005-IDN,How do you evacuate a university during a storm surge? - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-evacuate-a-university-during-a-storm-surge-21907,"“Born on a perilous rock” is the title of a classic book by W J Lewis which describes Aberystwyth past and present; last weekend the town fully lived up to this description. To all intents and purposes, 3 January started as a normal mid-winter day in Aberystwyth with a gale howling in off the sea and spectacular waves crashing off the sea front. Most of the university had extended the Christmas vacation to have a few more days’ rest and less that 150 of the 700 plus students who live in our sea front halls had returned to prepare for their exams.

That it was going to be an unusual evening became apparent when John received a call from his mother-in-law, living in sheltered accommodation by the harbour, saying she was being asked to leave because of the storm. At much the same time Rebecca received a call saying Ceredigion County Council workers were trying to deliver leaflets by hand to all student residences, advising their occupants that evacuate the promenade at least one hour before the high tide at 9.11pm.

How does one evacuate numerous buildings in darkness in the teeth of a storm on a midwinter night and transport people to a place of safety? The answer was to intercept the leaflets and set off the fire alarms in each building in turn, advising the assembled residents to prepare a bag of essentials to be ready to be taken to the main campus. Transport was by requisitioning the small fleet of minibuses owned by the student unions and directing the students to a central place, in a street behind the sea front and from there to the Penglais Campus, several hundred feet above sea level, where we opened up our main refectory and fed and watered our evacuees.

By 8.45pm the evacuation was complete. Having taught and researched hazard management for 20 years John had the opportunity to put theory into practice as it was apparent that his research field had come to him. It was clear we had to make a number of decisions.

When could our students return to their halls? This was straightforward, once National Resources Wales issued this advice and when we had checked our buildings we transported our students back to their halls at 1.30am.

Had the risk of spring tide coupled with storm surge diminished? No. The weather forecast predicted a number of storm events coupled with high tides through to the morning of the 7th.

Was travel to Aberystwyth easy? No, the transport infrastructure was breaking down and trains were not reaching Aberystwyth, being stuck in various flooded stretches of the railway.

Could we easily evacuate 1,000 students from the seafront in the middle of the night during a storm? No.

By midnight on the 3rd, having established these points we made two key decisions:

First, discourage all students from travelling to Aberystwyth from their homes until further notice and certainly no earlier than the 8th. This guidance was issued by email and a variety of social media.

Second, postpone all scheduled examinations by one week.

These bought us the space and the capacity to manage the sequence of storm surges and tides we then faced.

On the morning of the 4th it was clear the seafront in Aberystwyth was badly damaged but we had no need to evacuate during the day as the wind speeds had fallen. On the evening of the 4th given the slightly lower wind speed, we announced a partial evacuation of the sea-facing rooms but not of the whole building at high tide.

On the 5th it was clear we were facing exceptionally high spring tides, storm force winds and a significant storm surge. All students were clearly briefed by email, social media and video and were evacuated to Penglais Campus again, where they were very well fed and given a bed for the night.

The clear lesson learned for us was to break the problem down into its constituent parts, establish what our priority was and then make the decisions we needed to make, however large and potentially disruptive they may be.

We are now planning for the next spring tides in late January and early February and in particular the very high 5.8 metre tide scheduled to arrive late at night on 2nd February. Wish us luck.","Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/38766/original/9r763w6h-1389294909.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['sea', 'transport', 'evacuate', 'clear', 'high', 'tide', 'aberystwyth', 'surge', 'tides', 'students', 'storm', 'university']",

The two resources are now more interconnected than ever -- significant amounts of water are needed in almost all energy generation processes, from generating hydropower, to cooling and other purposes in thermal power plants, to extracting and processing fuels. Conversely, the water sector needs energy – mainly in the form of electricity – to extract, treat and transport water. Both energy and water are used in the production of crops, including those used to generate energy through biofuels.

But energy and water resources are under unprecedented pressure, and there is growing competition for their use from people, industries, ecosystems, and growing economies. As the world’s population reaches 9 billion, demand will require a 50 percent increase in agricultural production and a 15 percent increase in already-strained water withdrawals. By 2035, the world’s energy consumption will increase by 35 percent, which in turn will increase water use by 15 percent and consumption by 85 percent, according to the International Energy Agency.

Climate change will add more uncertainty through increased water variability and more frequent and severe floods and droughts. Energy systems are becoming ever more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As temperatures get warmer, so do the rivers and lakes that power plants draw their cooling water from - which makes it harder to generate electricity in the coming decades.

“We cannot meet our global energy goals of extending access to the poor, increasing efficiency and expanding renewables without water. The water energy interrelationship is critical to build resilient as well as efficient, clean energy systems. The time to act is now,” said Rachel Kyte, World Bank Group Vice President and Special Envoy for Climate Change.

Risks to the energy sector

Water scarcity is already threatening the long-term viability of energy projects worldwide. Last year alone, water shortages shut down thermal power plants in India, decreased energy production in power plants in the United States and threatened hydropower capac­ity in many countries, including Sri Lanka, China and Brazil.

Nearly 93 percent of the Middle East’s onshore oil reserves are exposed to medium to extremely high overall water quantity risks. Developing countries are the most vulnerable, as they often lack capacity to meet the rapidly growing need.

Despite these concerns, current energy planning and production is often made without taking into account existing and future water constraints nor risks of extreme events. As Executive Director of the IEA, Maria van der Hoeven, explains, “Planners and decision-makers in both sectors often remain ill-informed about the drivers of these challenges, how to address them, and the merits of different technical, political, management, and governance options. The absence of integrated planning is unsustainable.”","Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['vulnerable', 'constrain', 'production', 'growing', 'worlds', 'used', 'future', 'water', 'power', 'increase', 'energy', 'plants']", 
29,29,FL-2014-000005-IDN,Against the grain - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/asia/2014/01/18/against-the-grain,"THE prospect from Sam mountain, a rocky outcrop in southern Vietnam’s Mekong delta, is timeless. Paddy fields shine emerald. Irrigation canals reflect the sunlight like mirrors. Three times a year, farmers in surrounding towns put on their rubber boots and plant rice seedlings in the deep soil. A few months later they sell their sacks of grain to traders, who bring it to riverside mills for processing. In its essence, this activity is timeless, too.

Rice cultivation is deeply rooted in the Vietnamese psyche. In September 1945, a day after declaring Vietnam’s independence from France, Ho Chi Minh told his cabinet that dealing with a widespread failure of the rice crop was its priority. He later collectivised the paddies. In the 1980s his successors promoted hybrid seeds and modern irrigation. Today Vietnam’s $4 billion in rice exports (see chart) accounts for more than a fifth of the global total.

Party officials trumpet their “rice first” agricultural policies. Yet, more and more, Vietnam’s rice farmers are being left behind. Part of the problem is that Vietnamese rice strains tend to be of low or middling quality—a contrast to the premium varieties grown in Thailand. The costs of fuel, fertilisers and pesticides are rising. And Vietnam’s rice-export sector is dominated by state-owned firms with links to corrupt officials. Some farmers, especially in the country’s north, are finding it more profitable to let their land lie fallow.

In An Giang province, at the heart of the Mekong delta, an average family earns just $100 a month from cultivating rice, or about a fifth of what coffee-growers earn in Vietnam’s Central Highlands, says Oxfam, an advocacy group. Tran Van Nghia, who farms near Sam mountain, says young people in his area supplement farm incomes by working as hotel porters or construction workers in Ho Chi Minh City and other urban centres.

Vietnam’s rice woes are likely to worsen. Myanmar, long ago South-East Asia’s rice basket, is emerging again as an export rival. The bulk of Vietnam’s crop is sold directly to other governments, but some of its biggest clients, including Indonesia and the Philippines, are boosting domestic production. Arup Gupta, a commodities trader in Ho Chi Minh City, adds that as a consequence of a crackpot and expensive campaign in Thailand to subsidise the country’s rice farmers, Vietnam is now being undercut as Thailand unloads stockpiles at bargain-basement prices.

Scientists also warn that the Mekong delta, which produces about half of Vietnam’s rice, is showing signs of environmental stress. The earth dykes that were built to keep seasonal floods from inundating the rice paddies prevent the Mekong river’s alluvial floodwaters from bringing nutrients to the delta’s soil.

Vo-Tong Xuan, a rice expert who has advised the government on agricultural policies, reckons that many soils in Vietnam’s rice-growing regions are now so poor in nutrients that they cannot immediately be put to other uses, such as cultivating maize. Other problems, he says, include a lack of farmer representation in the powerful Vietnam Food Association, and resistance by state-owned rice exporters to reforms that would eat into their profits. It does not help that Vietnam’s new constitution, which passed in late November, calls for state-owned enterprises to keep a central role in the economy.

The countryside, for the most part, is a patchwork of tiny plots. The average Vietnamese rice farmer cultivates a little over an acre (0.5 hectares), when two or three hectares is the ideal plot size.

Still, a new land law coming into force in July will give many farmers 50-year land leases, a big improvement over the current 20 years. The longer leases may help create larger farms producing crops other than rice. Yet the government stubbornly maintains a policy of preserving about 90% of existing rice land in perpetuity.

That might make sense if Vietnam still struggled with crushing food insecurity, as it did in the early 1980s. Yet a third of its rice harvest is sold abroad—more, if unofficial exports to China are counted. Meanwhile, rice is falling as a proportion of the national diet; a rising middle class is developing a taste for meat and wheat. Next month in Ho Chi Minh City, the son-in-law of the prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, is scheduled to open the country’s first McDonald’s. Its local competitor, a fast-food chain whose speciality is the “VietMac”, a rice burger, has its work cut out.","Sat, 18 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['minh', 'mekong', 'ho', 'land', 'vietnamese', 'grain', 'farmers', 'vietnams', 'vietnam', 'rice', 'chi']",

We had an early onset of the southwest Indian monsoon. And that was contributing to some of the worst flooding in the past half century, and there were many thousands of people killed.""

Manila, Philippines, January 13, 2014--Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), the group behind recent theatrical hits ""Care Divas"" and ""Bona,"" is back with a new musical comedy, ""Rak of Aegis,"" which features the music catalog of multi-platinum rock band Aegis--musically rearranged for the stage by actor-musician Myke Salomon.

The show's lead stars Isay Alvarez-Seña, Robert Seña, Aicelle Santos, and Joan Bugcat, along with other cast members Poppert Bernadas, Ro Alfonso, Jet Barrun, Kakai Bautista, Gimbey Dela Cruz, Neomi Gonzales, Pepe Herrera, Carlon Matobato, Julienne Mendoza, John Moran, Jerald Napoles, Gie Onida, Phillip Palmos, Myke Salomon, Paeng Sudayan, and Gold Villar, performed musical excerpts from the show, e.g. ""Hahanapin Ko,"" ""Basang Basa sa Ulan,"" at a press event held Friday, January 10 at PETA Theater Center.

Cast member Julienne Mendoza shares his photos.

Created by PETA Artistic Director Maribel Legarda and Palanca Award-winning playwright Liza Magtoto, the musical comedy directs the audience's attention to the residents of the flooded village of Villa Venizia, especially Aileen (Santos alternating with Bugcat), a young mall ""promodizer"" caught in the web of finding love and seeking fame to support her family.

Aileen's family, like the other residents, is greatly affected by the recent flooding in the Philippines, which apparently is beset by more than 20 major typhoons each year!

Aileen's father Kiel is in the brink of losing his job as barangay captain Mary Jane (Isay Alvarez-Seña) plans to close her failing shoe factory. Knowing that her income will never be enough to make ends meet, Aileen decides to make a video of herself in the hopes of becoming the next YouTube sensation. Aileen's suitor Tolits (Jerald Napoles alternating with Pepe Herrera) posts the video online, unaware that it will put Villa Venizia under the spotlight and change their lives forever.

Besides Salomon, Legarda, and Magtoto, the production also involves Gio Gahol (choreography), Jonjon Villareal (lighting design), Mio Infante (production design), Carlo Pagunaling (costume design), Maco Custodio (shoe design), and Joan Pamintuan (accessory design).

Infante, who recently won Best Set Designer at the 2013 BroadwayWorld.com Awards for his work for Trumpets' new musical, ""The Bluebird of Happiness,"" has created a semi-arena performance space, which features knee-deep floods, for the production.

""Rak of Aegis'"" Friday and Saturday shows are at 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and Sunday shows are at 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., except Sunday, February 23 with shows at 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. and Sunday, March 2 at 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.

32,32,FL-2014-000005-IDN,What is 'acceptable risk' when planning a nuclear power plant? - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/what-is-acceptable-risk-when-planning-a-nuclear-power-plant-22192,"Modern safety engineering follows the aphorism, “there is no such thing as zero risk, only acceptable risk”. However, calculating chances and risk is a finicky process, especially when played out against factors of cost, time and complexity. Major accidents such as at Fukushima Dai-ichi – still unfolding as it approaches its third anniversary – demonstrate how essential it is to correctly assess risks and safeguards.

Risk is expectation of loss, and is dependent on the chance of a loss-event occurring combined with its magnitude. The chance can be tiny, but the loss huge, and the risk therefore considerable. Analyses of the possibility that the universe would collapse when operating the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) were undertaken, despite the infinitesimal chance.

Calculating risk is now de rigeur in big engineering projects, but it wasn’t always so. Built in the late 1940s, the Windscale piles, Britain’s first two nuclear reactors, used air blown over the core and up a chimney as their cooling. Exhaust filters were added to the chimneys only as an afterthought, insisted on by designer Sir John Cockcroft at some expense – the so called “Cockcroft’s Follies”.

During a procedure to release pent-up energy in the graphite core in 1957, there was a fuel meltdown, and radioactive material escaped up the chimney into the environment. This was handled to all intents by brave, indeed heroic, people doing what they could. But the events were kept as concealed from the surrounding civilians as possible. This was, after all, a facility for producing plutonium for nuclear weapons.

Planning for disaster

Nowadays it would be unthinkable, indeed illegal, for any organisation including the government to keep information of such a release of poison from its possible victims. English case law already contained a legal judgement (Lord Asquith, Edwards vs National Coal Board) that required industrial risks to be reduced “as low as reasonably practicable”. But there is no indication in Windscale’s final design or operation that a meltdown risk was objectively assessed, nor of any efforts to mitigate that risk – we can be grateful in retrospect for Cockcroft’s Follies, which afterwards appeared a good investment.

Lessons were learnt. Containment would have been desirable. The Boiling Water Reactor Mark 1 (BWR) is a US design that contained its core entirely inside a pressure vessel, with a removable cap to insert and remove fuel rods. The pressure vessel contained water and steam, forming part of a closed-circuit heat-exchange mechanism. The pressure vessel itself is fully enclosed within a steel-and-concrete bulb known as “primary containment”. And the primary containment itself is enclosed within a building, which constitutes “secondary containment”. BWR Mark 1 designs were commissioned from the 1970’s – the first was at Fukushima Dai-ichi in Japan in 1971, 14 years after Windscale.

Calculating the risk

The chances and extent of things going wrong must nowadays be calculated. The theoretically possible accidents and their precursors (“hazards”) must be listed and the concomitant risk assessed. Methods for this such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) have evolved over more than 60 years.

What were the chances of a core melt at Fukushima? Cooling requires electricity, generated either by the plant, from the electricity grid, or from emergency generators or last-resort batteries. Four different systems providing “defence in depth”, as required. Except that the electrics and emergency systems, all in the basement, are susceptible to simultaneous failure from flooding. This was known since the 1990’s, and widely published in a book by organisational sociologist Charles Perrow, The Next Catastrophe, in 2007.

IAEA Imagebank

With Fukushima Dai-ichi’s six reactors (and another four at Fukushima Dai-ini further down the coast) sitting low on the coast, Japanese experts had pointed out the risk from exceptional tsunamis to Fukushima Dai-ichi’s operator Tepco and the nuclear regulator prior to the earthquake. It seems they had begun to react, but the changes required cost lots of money. Another engineering aphorism says “if you think safety is expensive, wait till you have to pay for an accident”.

While Fukushima had 40 years of uninterrupted successful operation, in a highly industrialised country where engineers are technical perfectionists, with regulatory regimes in place and a risk-averse government, situations can quickly change. Quite suddenly, heroics were required, again. And again as at Windscale, and Chernobyl in 1986, they were available.

How did the engineers and planners get their numbers so wrong? Calculations are only ever as good as the assumptions, for example that flooding was not going to be a problem. And not everything that is known feeds accurately into the calculations.

Some years ago, a common commercial aircraft type started suffering a series of critical failures. The chance them occurring had been painstakingly evaluated as orders of magnitude less than once in the present or future history of the universe. The cause was fortunately discovered and remedied before the plane was grounded. Big numbers usually tell you that you have a problem. But small numbers are not so good at saying that you don’t.

Pitting one risk against another

So, do we build nuclear plants to avoid fossil fuel pollution? Even with the best people and organisations, can we avoid accidents and disasters that lead to major contamination? The best guess is: maybe, and maybe not.

Some, such as Lee Clarke in his book Worst Cases, argue that the worst case scenario should be considered without an estimated chance of its happening. The LHC analysts performed worst-case analysis. Mitigating worst cases, though, is often expensive.

One bad accident every 25 years appears sufficient to make nuclear power amongst the costliest in terms of reparations according to some calculations. And in a sense we’ve been lucky, as Windscale, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima could all have been much worse – perhaps as bad as Chernobyl. For example, what if the process of unloading spent fuel assemblies from the damaged reactor pool taking place at Fukushima Dai-ichi goes wrong, and all that radioactive material burns off into the atmosphere? Are we content with weighing numbers representing risk, or do we need to go beyond – even far beyond – someone’s idea of “reasonably practical” to ensure that such events cannot happen?

The LHC commissioners took the worst case very seriously. By their own admission, the Fukushima regulator and operator did not. There is likely no single “right” approach. Whatever we decide, the outcome may not be as relatively benign next time.","Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/39430/original/kdnwyrrb-1390226062.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['nuclear', 'numbers', 'planning', 'fukushima', 'chance', 'plant', 'containment', 'required', 'power', 'worst', 'fuel', 'risk', 'core', 'acceptable']",

Economic Jim O’Neill has been named honorary professor of economics at The University of Manchester.

Brought up in Gatley and a life-long Manchester United fan, he worked for investment bank Goldman Sachs between 1995 and 2013.

He was chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and the firm's chief economist from 2001 to 2011. Prior to that, he was head of global research at Swiss Bank Corp.

Prof O’Neill famously coined the term ‘BRIC’ economies in a 2001 paper, predicting that Brazil, Russia, India and China would become future powerhouses of the world economy.

The acronym has been widely used to symbolise a shift in global economic power away from the G7 economies towards the developing world.

The businessman who also led the Red Knights group that tried to buy Manchester United in March 2010, has recently presented four programmes on BBC Radio Four on what he predicts will be the next group of growing economies, which he calls the MINT countries - Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey.

Prof O’Neill said: “I feel flattered and honoured, and hope I can give something of value to justify it.""

Prof Dame Nancy Rothwell, president and vice-chancellor, added: “Jim O’Neill is a world renowned economist who, during his career, has done more than most to lead the research and policy agenda on foreign exchange and emerging markets. Staff and students alike will be energised by his position as Honorary Chair in Economics.”","Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article1296855.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/MEN_Jim-O'Neill-Phot.jpg,"['united', 'research', 'jim', 'professor', 'manchester', 'economies', 'group', 'sachs', 'oneill', 'honorary', 'world']",

Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 22, was unable to walk after 8 months of abuse

5,000 protesters marched in Hong Kong's commercial area of Wanchai

They claim the case would never go to court without a mass protest



Now a second maid claims she too was abused by the same employers

She says boss threatened to throw her off balcony making her beg for life



Thousands of domestic helpers took to the streets of Hong Kong yesterday to demand justice for an Indonesian maid who was allegedly enslaved and tortured by her employers for eight months.

Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 22, was reportedly left unable to walk following eight months of abuse in the southern Chinese city and was admitted to an Indonesian hospital in critical condition last week after returning home.

Details of her torture has sparked widespread anger across Hong Kong, and yesterday a second Indonesian domestic helper came forward to claim that she had suffered similar beatings and death threats at the hands of the same employers in 2010.

Made to sleep on the floor, Erwiana said she worked 21-hour shifts, had no days off, was fed just a single bowl of rice a day and was beaten constantly, sometimes for no apparent reason at all.

Tortured: Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 22, was left unable to walk following eight months of abuse at the hands of her employers

Justice: Protesters on Sunday including maids, rights activists and migrant group members marched through the commercial area of Wanchai

In the final weeks of her ordeal, she said blood and puss ran from her wounds so badly that her employer complained it was staining the carpet.

Rather than take her to a doctor, she said her boss wrapped her injuries in bandages and plastic bags, but it still seeped out.

Finally, when her injuries had become so severe that she could no longer work, her boss bought her a ticket home, gave her 70 Hong Kong dollars (£5.50) and dumped her at Honk Kong airport, making her swear never to mention what had happened to her.



'She told me that she knew a lot of people in Indonesia and if I said anything she would have my parents killed,' Erwiana told Al Jazeera, surrounded by her family in a hospital bed in Sragen, Central Java.

Healing: Doctors at Amel Sehat Islamic Hospital said she is suffering from swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head and her feet are brown and swollen with cellulitis - an infection of the skin that resulted from her long-untreated wounds

Brutal: Erwiana said her employer beat her on a daily basis with a lot of different implements, usually with the handle of her mop, mostly on her head

Doctors at Amel Sehat Islamic Hospital said she is suffering from swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head. She also has several broken teeth, a broken nose and her hands and feet are bruised and swollen with cellulitis - an infection of the skin caused by her untreated wounds.

'When I first came to Hong Kong I thought it was a kind of luxurious place, an amazing place. But it was not the reality for me,' she added. 'She would beat me with a lot of different implements, most usually with the handle of my mop. She would hit me all over, but mostly on my head.

'I had to work for 21 hours a day. I didn't have my own room so whenever I could sleep I would sleep on the floor.



Demands: They handed a petition to Hong Kong Police Commissioner Tsang Wai-hun urging faster progress in the case before marching to the city's government headquarters

'No more torture': Many of the protesters brandishing the Indonesian national flag, chanted slogans and waved banners with the words 'Justice for Erwiana'

'If [one of her two teenage] children found me sleeping when I wasn't supposed to be they'd tell her and she'd beat me again.'

Protesters on Sunday including maids, rights activists and migrant group members marched through the commercial area of Wanchai, many brandishing the Indonesian national flag and chanting slogans including 'Justice for Erwiana'.

They handed a petition to Hong Kong Police Commissioner Tsang Wai-hun urging faster progress in the case before marching to the city's government headquarters.

'We want the investigation to speed up and we demand the Hong Kong government to stop abuses on domestic helpers in Hong Kong,' Eni Lestari, chairwoman of the International Migrants Alliance and rally spokeswoman, told reporters at the protest.

Also yesterday a 28-year-old maid, known only as Bunga, said she experienced ten months of abuse while working for Erwiana's alleged abuser.

'One time the employer got so angry she dragged me onto the balcony and threatened to throw me off it. She made me beg for my life,' Bunga said. 'I told her that she could beat me as much as she wanted but I went on my knees and begged her not to kill me because I had a son.'

Bunga said she was never allowed outside the Tseung Kwan O flat and would be locked inside when the family went out.

'The woman threatened to pay the Indonesian police money to kill my entire family if I talked to others about the beatings,' she said. She was eventually helped to leave by an employment agency, but the agency urged her not to press charges.

Campaign of torture: The march comes as a second Indonesian domestic helper came forward to claim that she had suffered similar beatings and death threats at the hands of the same employers in 2010

Groundswell: Organisers claimed around 5,000 people participated in the rally

'I'm speaking out now because I feel so sad I didn't do anything to help Erwiana,' she said.



The allegations have renewed concern about the treatment of domestic helpers in the former British colony following a spate of similar abuse cases and recent criticism by rights groups.

Hong Kong police had at first categorised the alleged torture as a miscellaneous case but last week launched a criminal investigation after an outcry by domestic helpers in the city.

On Friday authorities said investigators will travel to Indonesia to speak to Sulistyaningsih, who remains in hospital in Sragen on the main island of Java.

'Without this kind of protest the case of Erwiana will never go to the public or go to the court. There will be no justice,' Lestari said, adding that two other maids have since come forward alleging abuse at the hands of the same employer.

The agency that employed Erwiana has said they were unaware of her injuries until they were notified by their corresponding agency in Indonesia.

More claims: The second alleged victim claimed the employer got so angry she dragged her onto the balcony and threatened to throw her off it before making her beg for her life

Growing trend: The semi-autonomous Chinese city is home to nearly 300,000 maids from mainly Southeast Asian countries - predominantly Indonesia and the Philippines - and criticism from rights groups over their treatment is growing

Organisers claimed around 5,000 people participated in the rally, a sharp increase in numbers from a similar march on Thursday which drew several dozen protesters.

Hong Kong police were not immediately available for comment on Sunday.

The semi-autonomous Chinese city is home to nearly 300,000 maids from mainly Southeast Asian countries - predominantly Indonesia and the Philippines - and criticism from rights groups over their treatment is growing.

A Hong Kong couple were jailed in September for attacks on their Indonesian domestic helper, which included burning her with an iron and beatings with a bike chain.

Amnesty International in November condemned the 'slavery-like' conditions faced by thousands of Indonesian women who work in the Asian financial hub as domestic staff and accused authorities of 'inexcusable' inaction.

It found that Indonesians were exploited by recruitment and placement agencies who seize their documents and charge them excessive fees, with false promises of high salaries and good working conditions.

Domestic helpers in Hong Kong are paid about HK$4,000 (£313) a month.

At the same time, we have never had better know-how and solutions available to avert the crisis and create opportunities for a better life for people all over the world.

Climate change is not just a long-term issue. It is happening today, and it entails uncertainties for policy makers trying to shape the future.

EFFECTS ON RUSSIA

In 2008, the Russian National Hydrometeorological Service (Roshydromet) found that winter temperatures had increased by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius in Siberia over the previous 120-150 years, while average global temperature rose about 0.7 degrees during the same period.

Russia is projected to cross the 2°C threshold earlier than the world on average if significant and effective mitigation is not forthcoming. By 2100, the northern half of Asia, including Russia, is likely to experience a temperature increase of 6 to 16°C, compared to approximately 4°C global mean temperature increase.

While warming might have some potential gains for Russia, the adverse effects include more floods, windstorms, heat waves, forest fires, and the melting of permafrost.

Globally, permafrost is thought to hold about 1,700 gigatons of carbon – and near-shore seabeds in the Eastern Siberian Sea hold a similar amount in methane hydrates that could potentially be destabilized in a warmer world, as well. This is compared to 850 gigatons of carbon currently in the Earth’s atmosphere. Of this, 190 gigatons are stored just in the upper 30 cm of permafrost, the layers that area most vulnerable to melting and the irreversible release of methane. The release of even a small portion into the atmosphere could dramatically compound the challenge already presented from anthropogenic sources, potentially wiping out any hard-won mitigation gains.

Russia hosts perhaps 70 percent of methane in circumpolar permafrost, as well as the methane hydrates in the East Siberian Sea. Permafrost warming of up to 2°C in parts of the European Russia has already been observed.

Russia will be front and center for any efforts to deal with thawing permafrost and Russian leadership is much needed to better understand its effects for the global climate as well as finding solutions for effective adaptation. There is no time to lose.

In Yakutsk, collapsing ground caused by melting permafrost has damaged buildings, airport runways, and other infrastructure. In 2010, the Ministry of Emergency Situations estimated that a quarter of the housing stock in Russia’s Far North would be destroyed by 2030.

Analyses indicate that about 60 percent of infrastructure in the Usa Basin in Northeast European Russia is located in the ""high risk"" permafrost area, which is projected to thaw in the future. This region is an area of high industrial and urban development, like coal mines, hydrocarbon extraction sites, railways, and pipelines. Yet the timing of this thaw remains uncertain – potentially a few decades or as long off as a century away.

DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY

Policy makers all over the world are facing similar challenges. While we certainly know that the climate will change, there is great uncertainty as to what the local or regional impacts will be and what will be the impacts on societies and economies. Coupled with this is often great disagreement among policy makers about underlying assumptions and priorities for action.

Many decisions to be made today have long-term consequences and are sensitive to climate conditions – water, energy, agriculture, fisheries and forests, and disasters risk management. We simply can’t afford to get it wrong.

However, sound decision making is possible if we use a different approach. Rather than making decisions that are optimized to a prediction of the future, decision makers should seek to identify decisions that are sound no matter what the future brings. Such decisions are called “robust.”

For example, Metropolitan Lima already has major water challenges: shortages and a rapidly growing population with 2 million underserved urban poor. Climate models suggest that precipitation could decrease by as much as 15 percent, or increase by as much as 23 percent. The World Bank is partnering with Lima to apply tested, state-of-the-art methodologies like Robust Decision Making to help Lima identify no-regret, robust investments. These include, for example, multi-year water storage systems to manage droughts and better management of demand for water. This can help increase Lima’s long-term water security, despite an increasingly unpredictable future.

WORKING WHERE IT MATTERS MOST

Each country will need to find its own ways to deal with uncertainties and find its best options for low-carbon growth and emissions reduction. While they vary, every country has them.

One example: Russia has made remarkable progress since 2005 in reducing the flaring of gas from oil production, but it is still the world’s largest gas flarer. And it is situated in a region from where black carbon from the flares reaches the Arctic snow and ice cap, which diminishes the cap’s reflective power (albedo). The World Bank Group is appreciative of the successful cooperation with Russia's Khanty-Mansiysk region in the Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership (GGFR). With more Russian partners, in particular from Russian state oil companies, the impact could be even greater.

Russia’s forests provide the largest land-based carbon storage in the world. Better forest management and improving forest fire response – a long-standing field of cooperation between Russia and the World Bank Group – are another example to reconcile growth and emissions reductions.

Options for countries all over the world include a mix of technology development that lowers air pollution; increasing investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, expanding urban public transport; improving waste and water management; and better planning for when disasters strike.

Each of these climate actions can be designed to bring short-term benefits and lower current and future emissions.

To move forward on the global level at the required scale, we must drive mitigation action in top-emitting countries, get prices and incentives right, get finance flowing towards low-carbon green growth, and work where it matters most.

Prices: Putting a price on carbon and removing harmful fossil fuel subsidies are necessary steps towards directing investment to low-carbon growth and avoiding a 4°C warmer world. We are working with others to help lay the groundwork for a robust price on carbon and supporting the removal of harmful fossil fuel subsidies. An ambitious global agreement could help establish stronger carbon prices and should include commitments to accelerate fossil fuel subsidy reform and other fiscal or tax policy measures in support of low carbon and climate resilient development.

Finance flowing: Progress on the provision of climate finance is critical. Governments must deliver a clear strategy for mobilizing the promised $100 billion in climate finance. This $100 billion is doubly important in that it must be used to mobilize effectively private investment and other finance.

Climate change increases the costs of development in the poorest countries by between 25 and 30 percent. For developing countries, the annual cost of infrastructure that is resilient to climate change is around $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion, resulting in a yearly $700 billion gap in financing. It will take combining efforts of development banks, financial institutions, export credit agencies, institutional investors, and public budgets to meet the climate and development challenge.

All public finance should be used to leverage private capital and fill gaps in the market where private finance is not flowing. Also, it must be deployed in a way that the least amount leverages the maximum amount from public and/or private sources. We are not dealing with how to jump start something in which the private sector is not interested, but how we create the framework within which the now small but significant momentum is captured, disseminated, and accelerated and the speed-bumps are removed and setbacks avoided.

At the World Bank Group we are committed to working where it matters most:

By 2050 two-thirds of the world’s population will be living in cities. Helping developing country cities access private financing and achieve low-carbon, climate-resilient growth and avoid locking in carbon intensive infrastructure is one of the smartest investments we can make. Every dollar invested in building creditworthiness of a developing country city will mobilize $100 dollars in private financing for low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure.

To feed 9 billion people nutritiously by 2050 we need to make agriculture resilient, more productive in changing landscapes, and aggressively reduce food waste. Making agriculture work for the people and the environment is one of the most pressing tasks at hand. We need climate-smart agriculture that increases yields and incomes, builds resilience, and reduces emissions while potentially capturing carbon.

The World Bank Group supports the Sustainable Energy for All goals of doubling both the rate of improvement of energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix from 18 percent to 36 percent by 2030. Reaching these goals is key to low-carbon growth.","Wed, 15 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['climate', 'energy', 'sustainable', 'world', 'global', 'challenge', 'lowcarbon', 'private', 'change', 'water', 'russia', 'permafrost', 'carbon', 'development']",

Thai politician Suthep Thaugsuban dominated our year-end reader poll for Asia's Person of the Year 2013 — in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion. Thaugsuban attracted 88 percent of the vote, nearly 116,000 votes in total. Malala Yousafzai, the female education rights activist from Pakistan, was runner-up for the second consecutive year. She earned close to 12,000 votes, 9 percent of the total, a figure that would have made her the winner in 2012.

This year, Yousafzai looked destined to be the clear victor the week after our poll launched on December 20, with Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke running a distant second. And Thaugsuban? Shortly before the new year, he was sitting dead last, with 0 votes.

That changed dramatically once 2014 began. During the first two days of the year, our poll page received more than 172,000 pageviews. Nearly 165,000 of those visits originated in Thailand. Most of the traffic came from Facebook and a handful of Thai message boards. At one point, Thaugsuban had around 97 percent of the total vote. In recent days, Yousafzai voters made a bit of a late push to eat into Thaugsuban's lead ever so slightly. (You can see the complete 2013 results here.)

This scenario was very similar to the grassroots social media effort Pakistani supporters of Imran Khan utilized to make him the overwhelming winner in our 2012 poll. But Thaugsuban received around 10 times the number of votes that Khan did.

As it did in 2012, the unusually large number of votes did raise some red flags for us. Are these votes real? Did we get hacked? But the amount of visitors that flooded our site from Thailand (with close to 300,000 pageviews, the poll is easily the most popular piece of content on Asia Society's website ... ever), the number of blog comments (more than 400), Facebook likes (54,000), and write-in votes all point to these votes being the acts of many, many actual people — very passionate people.

To learn more about the Thaugsuban phenomenon, we reached out to Patrick Winn, the Bangkok-based senior Southeast Asia correspondent for GlobalPost who has covered protests in Thailand since 2008. Winn offered his insights via email.



Patrick Winn

Who is Suthep Thaugsuban? And what kind of movement is he leading in Thailand?

Depending on who you ask, Suthep Thaugsuban is either an insurrectionist or a hero. He's been a professional politician in Thailand since the 1970s and, given the chaos of Thai politics, that means he's resilient.

In the last year, Suthep has reinvented himself as the face of a movement to rid Thailand of corruption. But he is hardly a pure, Gandhi-like figure. He enjoys the reverence of a sizable and devoted following but not the universal support of the masses.

Suthep's solution to ridding Thailand of corruption is fairly radical: toppling the current elected ruling party and installing a council of wise leaders to purify Thailand. It appears that Suthep and his circle would enjoy the privilege of handpicking the members of this group, which sounds an awful lot like a politburo.

How popular is he? Why do you think people are attracted to him?

Before his ongoing street crusade took off, Suthep was a household name. But he wasn't much of an inspirational figure. His reputation is that of a tough power broker and gamesman who has survived his own corruption charges. He's seen as a roll-up-your-sleeves-style politician — the guy that didn't mind stepping on a few toes to get things done. Think Dick Cheney.

His anti-corruption crusade mostly just translates into a war against a rival political network helmed by one of Thailand's most powerful families: the Shinawatras. This network has won every major election for more than a decade. Suthep's party, the Democrat Party, hasn't won a major election since the early 1990s.

Because the Shinawatras' power emanates largely from Thailand's upcountry, they have come into collision with the traditional power base in Bangkok: royalists and patrician families but also the workaday middle class.

At this point, the Shinawatra-led parties appear untouchable at the polls. They are not without their serious flaws and irregularities; consider that their current incarnation, Pheu Thai (translation: ""For Thais""), appears to be managed from afar by Thaksin, who eludes corruption charges by self-exiling himself in Dubai.

There is a sense, which runs heavy amongst the urban middle-class, that ceding power to the lesser-educated provincial Thais will forever doom Thailand to misrule. Suthep's popularity relies on tapping and exacerbating this sentiment.

Who are his followers? Do they fit into any particular demographic categories? Are they especially tech savvy?

A recent Asia Foundation survey lent evidence to the widely held contention that Suthep's protesters are, by and large, well off and educated by Thai standards. About 85 percent have have diplomas beyond high school. Well over half make more than $1,000 USD per month, which is a nice salary in Thailand.

Using social media — namely Facebook and the chat application Line — enables protesters to inhabit an online echo chamber. They have a rabid focus on the minutia of the protest campaign. These digital worlds can breed extreme thought because they're mostly populated by like-minded people. They can also be rapidly mobilized to raise cash, occupy intersections, flood critics' Facebook pages with derision and — as Asia Society now knows — sway online polls.

Does it surprise you that Thaugsuban's followers took to our year-end poll so earnestly? What do you think it says about them? About Thaugsuban?

I can't say I'm terribly surprised that Suthep's online faithful swarmed Asia Society's poll. They're web junkies and they can spot an opportunity for free and impactful PR.

I've covered protests of all stripes for six years. I have to say that this incarnation of protester seems to have a unique psychological profile. Many are truly possessed with the sensation that they're foot soldiers in a grand struggle that will determine Thailand's future.

Their activism overtakes their daily life. Even in the real world, they often wear protest kitsch — typically ribbons or whistles — out to dinner or while running errands.

After Asia Society asked me to respond to these questions, my curiosity led me to track down a protester who took part in the poll. She said solicitations to vote for Suthep were appearing on her friends' Facebook walls and voting in the poll was ""just a trendy thing to do."" She'd never heard of Asia Society before but was pleased this tactic proved effective.

Is he a particularly controversial figure?

Suthep is hugely controversial. Shutting down Bangkok, vowing to overthrow an elected government and declaring yourself fit to install a council of unelected rulers is a sure-fire receipt for controversy.

Where do you see Suthep Thaugsuban this time next year?

Thai politics have more plot twists than soap operas. Making these predictions is an excellent way to make yourself look foolish. But I will hazard one prediction: Suthep Thaugsuban will not sit behind bars one year from now in January 2015.

Protest leaders — even those charged with terrorism and insurrection — have a way of staying out of prison or at least walking free on bail after a short stint in jail. Suthep is deeply connected and enjoys the support of figures in high places. That's the sort of backing that can embolden someone to lead a movement to topple a government.

This phenomenon is explained deftly by Sunai Phasuk, a Human Rights Watch researcher, who told me the following in a recent interview:

“Protest leaders use confrontational, nationalistic slogans to hype up protesters. Yet it’s unlikely protest leaders will ever face any direct consequences. In almost every confrontation, they escape unharmed,"" Sunai said. ""The reality is very different for the protesters that get killed, wounded or disabled. … They don’t enjoy the same level of luxury as their leaders.”","Fri, 10 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1200w/public/1/140109_suthep_thaugsuban.jpg,"['votes', 'sutheps', 'thailand', 'asia', 'leaders', 'suthep', 'thaugsuban', 'away', 'ran', 'thailands', 'thai', 'poll', 'person', 'facebook']",

What's in store for food prices in the year ahead - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/eating-healthy-whats-in-store-for-food-prices-in-the-year-ahead-21970,"Australia’s cost of living is among the highest in the world, despite our low inflation rate. In this series we explore what consumers can expect from the big ticket items - petrol, power and groceries - in the year ahead.

As we start a new year many of us have resolutions to eat healthier, but for some, the price of food plays a critical role in staying the course.

What can we expect for food prices in 2014?

The price of food is affected by a multitude of local and international factors including food production, preparation and transport costs, degree of competition in the marketplace, regulations and policies, climate and weather conditions, trade, oil prices, and currency exchange rates.

This makes it difficult to predict exactly what is likely to happen to food prices in the year ahead. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations argues that “food markets are becoming more balanced and less price volatile”. This indicates global food prices are set to remain relatively stable. The US government generally supports this view.

In Australia, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests food and non-alcoholic beverage pricing has increased at a slightly lower rate than the overall inflation rate (2-3%) over the last five years. But some industry analysts expect greater food price rises this year.

Food supply and availability

One of the main underlying factors that impacts food prices is the amount and type of food available. Australia produces enough food to feed 60 million people.

This indicates that, in 2014, there should be enough food available for our 23 million residents and a substantial amount available for export. But despite the overall abundance of food in Australia, some communities have an inconsistent supply of foods, particularly healthy foods. This is a problem for many remote communities and some other low-socioeconomic groups. In the year ahead, continued food supply problems in these areas are likely to further push up their food prices.

In 2014, major weather events such as floods, cyclones or other disasters could affect food production and pricing, but these are difficult to accurately predict. Importantly, the Australian food supply is very diverse. This means that single bad weather events are only likely to affect the price of a few products. This was evident when the price of bananas skyrocketed after Cyclone Larry in 2006, but other food prices remained relatively stable.

Changes to national food policy can have an impact on the food system. While the former Labor government released a National Food Plan in 2013, the current government is set to release a new agricultural policy in 2014. While the details of this policy are still under development, it remains unlikely that new national policies will have a major impact on food availability and prices this year.

Price of healthy compared with unhealthy foods

We know that price is one of the most important influences on the food choices people make. We also know that the price of healthy food is a major barrier to optimum nutrition, particularly among vulnerable groups. Given that poor diet contributes at least 14% to the burden of disease in Australia, it’s important to consider not just food prices overall but the relative price of healthy foods compared with unhealthy foods.

In Australia and internationally, there is surprisingly little information on the relative cost of healthy diets and meals compared with unhealthy diets and meals. But there is some indication that prices of some healthy foods have risen more in Australia in recent years than prices of similar unhealthy foods.

Alan Porritt/AAP

Food-related taxes can have an impact on the relative price of foods. Internationally, Mexico has recently introduced a tax on soft drinks and unhealthy snacks, and several other governments are considering similar taxes. In these countries, these taxes would have the effect of making unhealthy foods more expensive relative to healthy options.

While there is no indication that the Australian government is considering implementing a soft drink tax, there has been talk about amending the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to apply to all foods. This would have the effect of increasing the cost of fruit and vegetables and other non-processed foods by 10%, and would have negative impacts on the health of the Australian population. However, even if there were tax changes, they are unlikely to be implemented in time to affect food prices this year.

Food affordability

In considering what lies ahead for food prices, it’s also important to consider food affordability. As a proportion of total household expenditure, food and beverages make up an average of around 19% of the budget. This is a far lower proportion of our income than our grandparents used to pay for food. But, with 12% of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face.

We know that wealthier Australians tend to be healthier. Diet-quality, obesity prevalence and health outcomes are generally worse in lower-income groups.

In 2014, people who are already doing it tough will find food more or less affordable depending on personal circumstances and broader economic and social conditions. Food price rises of just a few dollars a week can strain these consumers before other Australians feel the pressure.

Chances are that, overall, food prices will go up basically along the lines of inflation. But there is the risk that certain products will go up by more than that, and these are likely to be the healthy ones. This could pose a risk to health, particularly for low-income groups.

Now, thanks to him, hundreds of children have been rescued from hell



60,000 paedophiles may be looking at abuse images at any one time

Extreme child pornography has been linked to child abuse

But detectives like James infiltrate places where paedophiles operate

They remove offending images and liberate victimised children



The vital clue is quite innocuous: part of a canoe. But it is enough to secure an arrest, then a conviction - and the safety of two small boys.

The canoe features in several photographs, but it is not the focus of the images. On the contrary, it is a seemingly incidental background detail in a series of sickening depictions of child sex abuse.

But police child protection expert James Traynor is skilled at spotting the relevance of such clues.

Epidemic: The Child Exploitation & Online Protection Command estimates that 50,000 to 60,000 paedophiles may be looking at abuse images at any one time

He magnifies the section of the photo showing the canoe. He takes it to a specialist boating magazine where the make and model of the craft is identified. Crafts of this type are rare, so this, in turn, leads him to the manufacturer.

After some detective work, he goes from there to the place where it was sold.

A further phone call and some more digging locates the exact address where the canoe is stored - a suburban house.

Two police officers are dispatched to investigate. As they arrive, two young boys are getting into a car. The police recognise the children as the ones who were being abused in the photos.

The man who is with them is arrested. Later, he is convicted of making horrific images of the children and imprisoned for 14 years. As a result, two child victims are safe and spared the terror of further abuse.

Not all such cases are resolved so satisfyingly and conclusively, but many child victims are being rescued from the clutches of abusers thanks to the assiduous work of men such as James.

Recent cases: Both singer Ian Watkins, left, and Mark Bridger, the man who abducted and murdered April Jones, looked at images of child pornography

He is a victim identification specialist, and part of the small team of police and civilian investigators who work for the Child Exploitation & Online Protection (CEOP) Command, which is part of the newly created National Crime Agency (NCA).

I visit him in the office where he works, a large airless room in the basement of an unexceptional South London block.

Only, unlike most workplaces, this one has extra-tight security. Entry demands a security pass, and most of those who work in the building are forbidden from entering the room in which his team operates, unless they are accompanied by James or one of his fellow investigators.

The 38-year-old spends most of his working day online, looking at images of the most unspeakable child abuse. Each day he hopes for a fresh breakthrough, 'another canoe'.

Yet the images he is subjected to minute after minute of every working day are remorseless in their vile brutality. How can anyone bear to watch them?

'You do your best not to get involved,' he says. 'The end goal is to find that child. You need to put your own emotions to one side or you're no use to anyone. That means staying calm and focused on the job.

'You can't afford to feel angry at the offenders or spend too much time wondering why people do it. There are as many motives as there are offenders: many just use images as a means to gain a certain sort of sick status within their ""community"".





'The end goal is to find that child. You need to put your own emotions to one side or you're no use to anyone. That means staying calm and focused on the job.'



'Nor can you afford to be overwhelmed by the suffering. Because what I am feeling is nothing compared to what that child feels.'

James, an experienced detective sergeant, is a gentle, affable man, but the key to his success in this most challenging sphere of policing is this ability to detach himself emotionally from his gruelling job.

A softly spoken Glaswegian, he is married with a five-year-old son, but cannot allow his feelings as a parent to cloud his judgment. The counterbalance to the horror James witnesses is the satisfaction he feels in getting results.

He pulls out a spreadsheet: 473 UK victims identified from indecent images and removed from abusive situations by CEOP since it was set up in 2006.

It is, of course, a drop in the ocean when compared to the bigger picture.

CEOP estimates that 50,000 to 60,000 paedophiles may be looking at abuse images at any one time. Not all will be actively involved in abuse, though, as James puts it: 'Fantasy can all too easily lead to reality. We need to stop it from becoming real.'

Indeed, we have seen a rash of recent cases in which extreme paedophile pornography was directly linked with the most repugnant of crimes.

Last month Ian Watkins, leader singer of the rock band Lostprophets and a heavy user of online child pornography, admitted committing sex attacks on two babies. Mark Bridger, given a life sentence for the abduction and murder of five-year-old April Jones last May, had a laptop containing images of children being raped and abused.

Police also found a horror film on his computer, paused at a rape scene.

Heroic: James, an experienced detective sergeant, does not allow himself to be overwhelmed by the suffering

Stuart Hazell, convicted in May last year of the murder of Tia Sharpe, 12, also had a history of viewing extreme paedophile material online.

The work of James and his colleagues may only be scratching the surface, but it is invaluable. On its own, his small team's detective work has directly led to the discovery of 205 child victims who are no longer subject to abuse.

The stories James confronts daily are too disturbing to discuss with anyone, including his wife Zoe, who is a detective in a unit dealing with serious crimes against children.

Even so, sometimes they affect his family life.

'Once my mum read a newspaper report about a case she knew I'd worked on. She didn't say anything, but I could tell she was shocked. I don't think she'd quite understood what I did before.'

Sometimes James just needs to switch off. 'Cinema is a place where I can just lose myself for an hour or two,' he says. 'I always watch something lighthearted. Most recently, I took my boy to watch the comedy Frozen and just loved the sense of going back in time to an earlier age.'

CEOP Command recognises the incredible stress the nature of its work puts on staff.

All those in victim identification must undergo counselling every three months, and the door is always open for them to seek help if they need it.

James is part of an online network of victim identification officers. Forty countries are connected to CEOP, so at any moment across the globe there is always someone on the internet scanning and infiltrating places where paedophiles operate.

'The first thing we do is to sift through the images sent to us,' he says. 'They come from the public, from other police forces and from the Internet Watch Foundation.

'And they might be anywhere: the internet proper or the ""dark net"" [the hidden area of the internet that acts as a sort of Wild West for crooks and paedophiles], where more and more criminal activity is taking place.

'When we identify a new image, the first job is to examine it minutely, looking for the smallest of clues that might tell us where it comes from.

'First we need to decide where the abuse took place, and if it's overseas, to forward the image to the relevant police force. And then, for those that might have been taken in the UK, to extract as much intelligence as we can from the image.





The work of James and his colleagues may only be scratching the surface, but it is invaluable.



'It's all about using good old- fashioned investigative techniques you learn from being a detective.

'You treat an indecent image of a child as a crime scene, because that is what it is. You look for clues.

'Sometimes you home in on an apparently innocuous piece of information. You explore it, keep worrying away at it, until that takes you somewhere.

'It would be good if every case was simple - as easy as reading a street name and house number in the background. But they rarely are.'

In 2011 his team was engaged in an international investigation into a large-scale paedophile ring.

One member of this group, who had been posting child abuse images regularly for eight years, was a British man living in Indonesia.

Analysis of chat logs provided a profile of the suspect: in his 60s, originally from North-East England.

James and a small team were sent out to Indonesia where, working with local police, they quickly identified the offender, Henry Featherstone Parks, as well as four child victims.

Parks admitted taking sexual photographs of up to 12 children. He is now serving a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence.

Escalating problem: James believe the problem is growing - because the ubiquity of mobile phone cameras makes it far easier to share images



It is thanks in large part to James that a law, instituted in 2012, forbids paedophiles from discussing their fantasies with one another online.

Before then, it was assumed that the law on obscenity applied only to material that was widely disseminated, rather than personal online discussions. However, James was so disturbed by an online conversation that his team had stumbled across that he took it to senior officers and the Crown Prosecution Service.

It was an online 'chat' about the abduction and abuse of young children, and while those involved were adamant this was mere fantasy, James reasoned that there was a real risk of it becoming reality.

Something had to be done. He pushed. Senior officers were supportive, with the result that today those having such conversations can be prosecuted.

Part of the organisation's work is education: teaching young people to understand risks and deal with situations in which they feel threatened.

But CEOP Command also runs a strategic intelligence team whose job is to analyse threats and feed information back to those involved in its educational material.

The threat to children is constantly changing. A growing concern is images taken by young people themselves, often naively shared online among their friends, but which can end up in dangerous hands.

Incredulity: As a father, James particularly struggles to understand why parents abuse their own children

And that is where the police work comes in. CEOP Command runs undercover teams whose job it is to infiltrate paedophile organisations online and catch the ringleaders.

Figures from the 2012-2013 CEOP annual review tell their own story: it has received almost 19,000 reports of child sexual exploitation and forwarded 3,000 intelligence reports to police forces; 790 children have been rescued from abusers around the world; 192 suspects arrested.

More than 2.6 million children have viewed their online resources, which include warnings about the dangers of sexual exploitation and instructions on how to use webcams safely.

The work has changed the way James views the world.

He says: 'I'm more observant and probably a little more suspicious of people generally. I try to be grounded, though, and remind myself that the people I deal with are from a very minute element of society.'

As a father, he particularly struggles to understand why parents abuse their own children. 'My son is the most precious and important thing in my life,' he says. 'I don't understand why someone would destroy a parent-child bond.'

He believes that the problem is escalating; not necessarily because more abuse is happening, but because the ubiquity of mobile phone cameras has heralded an explosion in the sharing of images by paedophiles.

'The sharp increase in numbers of images means we have to get cleverer, using recognition software to check when and where we've seen them previously,' he says.

'We're using technology in ways it has never been used before, and if it doesn't exist, we'll make it - or get it made.'

James started his police career with Kent Constabulary, moving to the child protection team in 2006. His first case involved sexual abuse against six children.

'When it was over, one of the kids wrote a thank-you card,' he says. 'That really opened my eyes to the good work you can do to protect children. It was a turning point.'

Players and spectators heading to the Australian Open should prepare for some baking hot days at the tennis: 35°C today, rising to 41°C on Tuesday, with temperatures in the high 30s or low 40s expected to linger until the weekend.

Coming after a relatively mild summer weekend, many of us will be wondering why it’s got so hot, so quickly.

That was the question my colleagues and I asked ourselves a year ago, when we began looking at the causes of severe heat waves. In particular, we wanted to know what made the 2009 summer heat wave - which set new records for the most days above 40°C in many parts of south-eastern Australia, and which killed hundreds of people - quite so deadly. Were there any hidden culprits behind the record-breaking spell of fierce heat?

What we discovered was that a seemingly unrelated tropical cyclone off the Western Australian coast contributed to making the south-eastern Australian heat wave worse.

And what’s about to happen with this week’s heat is a textbook example of what we found.

This week, a tropical low is forecast to intensify over northern Western Australia, and a trough will extend from north-west to south-east across the state. Whether or not a tropical cyclone develops, the effects of these low pressure systems will be felt as far away as Melbourne and Hobart.

Our recent research in the internationally peer-reviewed journal Geophysical Research Letters explains how tropical lows and tropical cyclones affect heat waves in south-eastern Australia.

In late January 2009, Tropical Cyclone Dominic hit the Western Australian coastline, causing minor structural damage and bringing down power lines in the small Pilbara town of Onslow. Flooding of a nearby river resulted in significant crop damage, and caused a train to derail near Kalgoorlie.

But as cyclones go, Dominic wasn’t so bad: at its peak, the cyclone only reached category 2 status, well below the most severe category 5 level.

Yet as our research showed, even at that level, the cyclone over in Western Australia still had powerful downstream effects for the extreme heat wave across South Australia, southern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania in late January and into early February 2009.

During this heat wave, Ambulance Victoria was swamped with a record number of emergency calls, while the Adelaide morgue ran out of room.

Later, the Victorian Department of Health estimated that 374 “excess deaths” occurred in the week of January 26 to February 1 2009. Although it is not possible to directly attribute mortality solely to the heat wave, there was a clear spike above the normal death rate, highlighting the health risks of heat waves, particularly for elderly people.

So how did Tropical Cyclone Dominic increase the intensity of that heat wave? And how do tropical lows in Australia’s west - like the one we’re seeing again this week - affect the weather as far away as south-eastern Australia?

When the pressure’s on

It turns out that the position of the tropical cyclone, rather than its size or severity, is what really makes a difference.

It doesn’t even need to be a full-blown cyclone; as we’re currently seeing, even a tropical low can have a big impact on south-eastern Australia’s weather.

Heat waves in Victoria are associated with slow-moving high pressure systems, or anticyclones. These surface highs hang around over the Tasman Sea for several days, bringing hot northerly winds from the interior of the continent.

During heat waves in Victoria, there is also a similar anticyclone at higher levels in the atmosphere.

These upper level anticyclones form when very long, planetary-scale waves in the atmosphere (known as Rossby waves) break to the south of Australia.

Our recent research showed for the first time in Australia how those upper level anticyclones have been present in all of the most severe heat waves in Victoria over the past two decades.

How cyclones work

The circulation around tropical cyclones at low levels is cyclonic, as air spirals in a clockwise direction (in the Southern Hemisphere; it spirals the other way in the Northern Hemisphere) into the centre of the storm where the pressure is lowest.

At upper levels, the air flows out again from the centre, and its nature changes to anticyclonic, switching to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction.

This outflowing air can intensify heat waves over Victoria in two ways. The first is when the outflow “nudges” the upper level jet stream, the band of strong westerly winds that circle the globe at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres.

When the outflowing air from the tropical cyclone nudges the jet stream south of western Australia, the disturbance generates more waves. This results in a stronger upper level anticyclone over Victoria.

The second way in which the intensification can occur is a direct result of the anticyclonic properties of the outflowing air. The outflowing air can be carried by the winds directly into the upper level anticyclone over Victoria.

The more intense the upper level anticyclone over Victoria, the more persistent it will be. This makes it more likely that a heat wave will form as higher temperatures continue for several days.

You can imagine this as being a bit like putting a pebble into a stream. The larger the pebble, the harder it will be for the water to shift it, and the more likely it is that the pebble will remain in place for a while as the water flows around it.

The cyclone effectively makes the pebble that is the anticyclone a little bit bigger, so that it stays stationary for longer.

Our improved understanding of how heat waves form should help weather forecasters better predict when extreme heat waves will hit Victoria.

It will also help in studies of how the intensity and duration of heat waves might change in the future due to climate change.

But in the short-term, when the heat is on at Rod Laver Arena this week: take a look way out west - and watch out for those cyclones.","Sun, 12 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/38876/original/mnhnkrgs-1389521075.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['upper', 'southeastern', 'heat', 'waves', 'level', 'cranking', 'victoria', 'wave', 'whats', 'tropical', 'australia', 'cyclone']",

The balancing act is a common one for developing nations, particularly those rich in natural resources. In Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia, protests have erupted in recent years when governments have cut fuel subsidies. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. In oil-rich Nigeria, protesters paralyzed the nation in 2012 over a rollback in fuel subsidies. In Bolivia, protesters laid siege to the capital in 2010, forcing President Evo Morales, a close ally of Mr. Maduro, to quickly abandon a cut in gasoline subsidies.

Venezuelan officials have said the increase here will probably be gradual, with the goal of eventually charging enough to cover the costs of producing the gasoline.

“What is fair is to say that we have to charge for the hydrocarbons that we sell in the domestic market because we are paying for people to fill their tanks,” Mr. Maduro said this month. He denied that the government needed the extra income to balance its books this year and called for a national dialogue on the issue. But he has insisted that an increase will happen.

“Will it go?” he said late last month. “It will go.”

Rafael Ramírez, the powerful president of the state oil company, who is also the energy minister and vice president in charge of the economy, said last month that the break-even cost of high-octane gasoline, which is what most people buy, would be the equivalent of $1.62 a gallon, far higher than what is charged now.

Venezuelans use about 323,000 barrels of gasoline a day, Mr. Ramírez said last year. And despite having enormous oil reserves, Venezuela has imported tens of thousands of barrels of gasoline a day from the United States over the last two years, according to the Energy Information Administration in Washington, because of problems at refineries. So in effect, the Venezuelan government has been paying market prices — which averaged about $2.70 a gallon last year — to import gasoline that it gives away almost for free.","Mon, 20 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/world/JP-VENEZUELA-1/JP-VENEZUELA-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=398&w=600&s=8ea951f3e8ad7709595d194a5c56302497d39ee8df2d59f8ff1209ec419fde84&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['pump', 'subsidies', 'month', 'fuel', 'protesters', 'gasoline', 'increase', 'prices', 'reality', 'venezuela', 'president', 'price', 'meet', 'ramírez', 'mr']",

There's no safer place in the Pacific for a family holiday than Samoa. The most traditional of all the islands of Polynesia, locals mostly still live as they have done for 2000 years in simple villages with their extended families, ruled by chiefs and other elders.

Rainforest-covered volcanic mountain peaks jut out from untouched hinterlands and Samoa's coastline is made up of endless, deserted white sandy beaches, bar the occasional fisherman.

Samoan culture has a strong focus on welcoming visitors - especially families. There's everything here for families - from kayaking across blue lagoons to surfing world-class waves along barrier reefs to swimming with endangered turtles or bike rides circumnavigating the islands.

FAMILY FUN: For just a few dollars you can swim with an endangered marine species, the green turtle.

A DAY TOUR BACK IN TIME

Take a 20-minute boat ride to an island with no roads, no cars and, until just a decade ago, that had no electricity. Located off the western coast of Upolu, a day tour to the tiny island of Manono gives an insight into how all Samoans once lived.

A dirt walking track circumnavigates the three-square-kilometre island, past traditional villages, schools and farming plots. There's also some of Samoa's best lagoons to snorkel in and a barbecue lunch.

Tour costs about 198 tala ($102), children five to 11 are half price, children under four are free. See samoascenictours.com

VISIT A LOCAL TREASURE

Hike through rainforest to the final resting place of history's most famous family-adventure writer.

Robert Louis Stevenson, author of Treasure Island, lived his final years on a huge estate in Vailima near Samoa's capital, Apia. When he died, the Samoan people carried him behind his estate to Mount Vaea, creating the Road of the Loving Hearts.

Visit Stevenson's elegant restored estate and museum and hike the half-hour Loving Hearts track past cascades to his resting place, which offers the best views over Upolu's north coast.

A museum visit costs about 15 tala ($8) for adults and about 5 tala ($3) for children. See rlsmuseum.ws.

SAIL AWAY WITH THE FAMILY

Choose from a list of adventure sailing options on-board Samoa's only locally based catamaran - the 10-metre Shilo II. Sail around Upolu's lagoons and stop to snorkel and go ashore on a deserted sandy beach, or go further afield across the Apolima Strait to the islands of Savai'i, Manono and Apolima.

You can also sail at sunset or book a turtle-watching cruise.

There's also full-day and half-day fishing options for families that include non-fishing activities.

Lagoon sail tours cost 110 tala ($57), sunset tours cost 120 tala ($62), Manono tours cost 280 tala ($144), children are half price. See samoa-adventure.com.

SURF RESORTS FOR FAMILIES

Samoa caters for entire families on a surfing holiday. It doesn't matter how many in your family surf - Samoa's ""surf camps"" offer luxurious lagoon-side accommodation with an extensive activities program for non-surfers, as well. In other surfing hot-spots, such as Indonesia and Fiji, surf camps are for experienced surfers only, but Samoa offers a range of non-surf attractions, as well as some of the Pacific's best - and most uncrowded - surf spots.

Family units cost 300 tala ($155) a night, see samoanaresort.com.

SWIM WITH TURTLES

For just a few dollars you can swim with an endangered marine species, the green turtle. At the Satoalepai Turtle Sanctuary on Savai'i, juvenile turtles are raised from infancy by villagers, before they're released into the wild - where they reach 180 kilograms.

Savai'i is one of the only places on the planet where you can swim with green turtles in captivity before they're tagged and released by the Fisheries Department.

Entry costs 5 tala ($3), see samoa.travel.

PACIFIC'S BEST WATERFALLS

Visit some of the South Pacific's most powerful waterfalls on a waterfall crawl tour incorporating a visit to Samoa's most famous natural attraction, the Sua Ocean Trench.

Drive through Upolu's lush forests and stop at Falefa Falls before visiting the Sua Ocean Trench. Climb 30 metres down a ladder into a massive waterhole fed by water flowing through lava tubes from the ocean.

You can swim under the tubes into caves, and out to the lagoon. Then stop at Samoa's largest waterfall, the Papapapaitai Falls, which drop 100 metres into a volcanic crater.

The East Upolu and Aleipata tour costs 109 tala ($56), children five to 11 are half price, children under four are free. See samoascenictours.com.

CYCLING ADVENTURES

Savai'i, Samoa's least populated island, is the ideal island for family cycling adventures because there are virtually no cars on the road and the speed limit is a leisurely 40km/h. Much of the road hugs the coastline, offering stunning views and countless opportunities to stop and swim.

Complete a family circumnavigation of the island, with a support vehicle to carry non-riders or younger children when they tire.

Baby-sitting is also available. Accommodation is pre-booked, and there's plenty of time off your bike.

A family cycling adventure includes bike hire, accommodation, support van and most meals and costs about A$1050 ($1110) a person for nine days, see outdoor.co.nz.

TEACH THE FAMILY TO DIVE

Savai'i is one of the best places in the world to learn to dive because of the range of its beginner dive sites, the great visibility and a year-round water temperature of between 26 and 29C.

Either take the family out for an introductory dive, where you'll learn to dive in shallow water before doing one dive up to 12 metres, or complete an open-water dive certificate.

The dive sites are located either inside the safety of the lagoons, or just outside the reef where you can access shipwrecks, coral gardens and sea canyons and see green turtles, eagle rays and reef fish.

An introductory dive costs 300 tala ($155), a four-day open-water dive course costs 1200 tala ($619), see divesavaii.com.

PADDLE IN CLEAR LAGOONS

Take the family on a day-long kayaking adventure that caters for every level of paddler.

The most popular family tour takes paddlers to the marine- protected zone of Namua Island. The lagoons here are ideal for beginner kayakers.

You'll also have the chance to paddle outside the reef to watch sea turtles and to snorkel at nearby Fanuatapu Island - one of Samoa's best snorkelling locations.

There's a variety of day tours to choose from, including tours to deserted atolls and to mangrove forests.

Day tours cost 180 tala ($93). See kayakingsamoa.com.

DANCE YOUR NIGHTS AWAY

Capture all the energy and excitement of Samoa's traditional Polynesian culture without leaving Apia, when you head to one of the South Pacific's most celebrated annual events.

Every September, Apia is the host of a week-long celebration of Samoan culture, the Teuila Festival, which brings thousands of locals out each day and night for Polynesian dance competitions, fire knife dancing and Samoa's best live music ... and it's all free.

This year's festival will be held in September.

It's your best way to mix with the local people at the year's biggest event and sample local food cooked in an umu.

It was the terrifying yet little-known air accident that could so easily have become one of the worst disasters in Welsh aviation history.

As Patricia Laing and her family were among the passengers cruising at 28,000ft from Rhoose Airport to Majorca, the excited sunseekers realised one of the propellers had developed a fault.

Moments later there was a blast as the propeller came loose and ripped through the cabin, tearing through one of the aircraft’s toilets, and forcing the pilot to send the plane into a chilling 20,000ft nosedive.

Now, nearly 50 years on, Patricia has spoken up on the “hushed-up” June 1964 accident that nearly wiped out a plane full of Welsh holidaymakers in the early days of the package holiday boom.

Pat, her husband Walter, and daughters Katie, Sarah and Jane had been sitting right up front in the cabin as they boarded the Viscount plane for the Mediterranean.

Two hours into Cambrian Airways flight, after passing over Barcelona, Pat noticed a change in the sound of the engines.

The 78-year-old recalled: “I looked out the window and saw that the propeller nearest to us had stopped.

“No one was particularly distressed over it - in fact we were all having a sing-song to Coming In On A Wing And A Prayer, a song from World War II - when there was a tremendous explosion and the propellor tore through the side of the plane, through the toilet cubicle next to where we were sat and stopped outside the opposite toilet cubicle the other side of the plane.

“The pilot then took the plane into a nosedive which, from what I later learned, was from 28,000ft to 10,000ft to prevent any irreparable ear damage.”

Amazingly, Pat kept her composure.

“I thought we’d be landing in the sea,” she added. “I was very calm, I took removed the girls shoes, loosened their dress collars and placed their life jackets over their heads and was ready to push them out when we hit the water.

“I had no chance of talking to Wally or any of the cabin crew as it was too loud.”

Pat, who is still the financial director for family property business Connie’s of Cardiff, and has documented the air accident in a new book, says she had something of a “Peter Pan” outlook - that dying might be the next big adventure.

The mother of six children and two foster daughters claims her stoicism and calm attitude was a by-product of growing up during the Second World War.

“It was quite an anticlimax by the time we were cleared to get back on board to collect our luggage,” she added.

“When we first landed we were ordered to get off the plane, leave everything behind. the runway was lined with water cannons.

“The worst bit of the whole ordeal, and which grates me to this day, is that I was confronted by a Spanish customs officer who ordered me to open my case for inspection.”

In the 50 years since the incident on the Cardiff to Majorca flight Pat has not let it deter her from travelling across the globe - but husband Walter was perhaps unsurprisingly not so keen to travel by air, despite returning to Majorca in 1967.

“I’ve been to Australia nine times, as our daughter Sarah lives out there, flown around America, been to Indonesia,” Pat said. “The Eurostar has been a Godsend for us as it means we can go to Europe.

“Wally always told me to go, and Sarah comes home quite a lot. My grandson Sean came to live with us for a year and went to school here. He starred in the school’s production of Oklahoma! and is now an actor in Australia.

“And my granddaughter Carys plays football for Wales and has stayed with us when she was playing in Sweden and the Welsh FA brought her to Wales for treatment.”

The aeroplane drama gained little notoriety in newspapers at the time, apart from a small notice in a national, Pat told Wales on Sunday.

But the incident is documented on a website for aircraft enthusiasts - Vickers Viscount.

The entry for the Cambrian Airways tenure of the plane - which was the Viscount c/n 27 - notes that in June 1964, “the No.2 (port inner) propeller detached in flight as a result of a failure in the Dart engine’s Reduction Gearbox and struck the forward fuselage, entering the toilet but causing no injury and luckily without a sudden decompression.”

It goes on to say that the aircraft was sent for repairs at Teversham, Cambridgeshire.

Pat’s book - Travelling Hopefully - may be about the trials and tribulations of family holidays over three decades, but in fact the Harvard educated Cardiff-girl has a wealth of tales that could fill many more.

And she boldly claims that given her various brushes with death, the odds against further disaster means: “If you’re scared of a plane crashing, or if there’s a storm, be in my company!”

The grandmother of eight says she was struck by lightning at the age of 13.

As a child during the Second World War she slept in a homemade bomb shelter in her parent’s back garden for two and a half years. Tragically, her best friend was killed during the bombings of May 1943, when she lived in the Penylan area of Cardiff.

“I said bye to her after school one day, and that night the bomb hit and she died,” said Pat.

“Five people in that family died. The bomb hit a gas main and the explosion ripped through the house.”

Although they were tough times, Pat is certain that the perils of wartime made her the woman she is today. And the wartime dramas posed an interesting backdrop for those childhood days.

Pat explained: “Bombed houses were like an adventure playground for us. My mother must have despaired at all the broken crockery and sodden cushions we brought home as ‘treasure’.

“There was one house we ran over to, after school one day, on Lady Mary Road - but it had been boarded up.

“But we noticed the garage door open and we went in. There were garden tools up on the wall, and a brown leather bag on the floor - we pulled it open and a skeleton came bursting out.

“Well Usain Bolt eat your heart out, we ran all the way home and didn’t stop. Later we found out it was a doctor’s house!”

It was through a Facebook group called ""Whangarei Heads People"" that the offers came flooding in. ""People I didn't even know were asking how they could help.""

Paris was not a student at Parua Bay School.

A relative said the freak accident had shaken the family.

A police iwi liaison officer said a local kaumatua had blessed the scene on Sunday afternoon after the death. Paris' body will be at Ngunguru Marae from today ahead of his tangi.

Paris' sister Hine wrote in a funeral notice: ""Paris will never fall apart because he's always in my heart.""

The Northland tragedy bought back memories of a near-fatal incident at Karekare Beach, northwest of Auckland, in October 2012. Alia Bland and Shalema Wanden-Hannay were on the beach when they came across a teenager trapped underneath sand.

""We tried to pull his legs and it was like pulling on concrete. His legs were kicking and we were screaming for others to help.""

They estimated the teenager had tunnelled about 2m into the side of the sand dune before the sand collapsed on him.

""It was really scary. We were calling to people at the carpark to help but many just stopped and watched - I think they thought we were joking around."" After about six minutes, the women and the teenager's older sister managed to get the youngster out and, miraculously, he came to.

Mrs Wanden-Hannay of the Karekare Surf Lifesaving Club said more awareness was needed of the dangers of digging in the sand.

""I believe they should be part of school-based beach education ... and I'd like to see sand collapses on beach signage containing other safety messages, such as falling rocks, large waves and rips.""

Safety tips in sand

* Never dig large holes or tunnels on the beach.

* Teach children the dangers.

* Always fill holes or tunnels you may come across on the beach.

* Recognise that people respond differently in emergencies, so give clear instructions when delegating.","Mon, 20 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/sBAzzHbvzx8BMLjfLp_25JgHRgc=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/25QFNHUOHEBJY7RJEAMPQH74IU.jpg,"['digging', 'sand', 'tragic', 'community', 'family', 'beach', 'whangarei', 'offers', 'help', 'wandenhannay', 'came', 'death']",

Change in restrictions on religion over time. http://t.co/4Y20xHZ1zJ http://t.co/PJg6teSesB — Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) January 14, 2014

The Pew Research Center's report issued two indices, based on statistics from the years 2007-2012:1) The Government Restrictions Index (GRI), which measures government laws, policies and actions that restrict religious beliefs and practices.2) The Social Hostilities Index (SHI), which measures acts of religious hostility by private individuals, organisations or groups in society.The results show that ""Pakistan had the highest level of social hostilities involving religion, and Egypt had the highest level of government restrictions on religion.""Neighbours Afghanistan and India were also up there with Pakistan in the SHI index.Worldwide, except for the Americas, ""the share of countries with a high or very high level of social hostilities involving religion reached a six-year peak in 2012 ,"" while ""the share of countries with a high or very high level of government restrictions on religion stayed roughly the same in the latest year studied.""Pakistan topped the list for most religious hostilities while showing a 'very high' range of scores in the other index too.One third of 198 countries reviewed saw high or very high levels of internal religious strife, such as sectarian violence, terrorism or bullying in 2012, compared to 29 percent in 2011 and 20 percent in 2010.The biggest rise came in the Middle East and North Africa, two regions that are still feeling the effects of the Arab Spring of 2010-2011, said the Pew Research Center.As an example, the report cites an increase in attacks on Coptic churches and Christian-owned businesses in Egypt. It said China has also witnessed a big rise in religious conflict.https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/423109435817725953PEW said that radical elements often target mainstream Muslims and Christians in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia, while India has recurring tensions between its majority Hindus and minority Muslims and Christians.Results for strong social hostility such as anti-Semitic attacks, assaults by Muslims on churches and Buddhist agitation against Muslims were the highest seen since the series began, reaching 33 per cent of surveyed countries in 2012 after 29 per cent in 2011 and 20 per cent in mid-2007.Christians and Muslims, who make up more than half of the world's population, have been stigmatised in the largest number of countries. Muslims and Jews have suffered the greatest level of hostility in six years, the report said.Religious violence declined in the Ivory Coast, Serbia, Ethiopia, Cyprus and Romania.The number of countries whose governments have imposed restrictions, such as bans on practicing a religion or converting from one to another, has remained more or less the same, however. Three out of ten countries have high or very high levels of restrictions, the study said.Official bans, harassment or other government interference in religion rose to 29 per cent of countries surveyed in 2012 after 28 per cent in 2011 and 20 per cent in mid-2007.Harassment against women and religious connotations of the way they dress has also risen in nearly a third of countries to 32 per cent, compared to 25 per cent in 2011 and seven per cent in 2007.The five countries with the most government restrictions on religion are Egypt, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.Among the 25 most heavily populated countries, Egypt, Indonesia, Russia, Pakistan and Myanmar suffered the most religious restrictions.The 198 countries studied account for more than 99.5 per cent of the world's population, said the Pew center.It did not include North Korea, whose government ""is among the most repressive in the world, including toward religion.""The Washington-based center, which is non-partisan and takes no policy position in its reports, gave no reason for the rises noted in hostility against Christians, Muslims, Jews and an ""other"" category including Sikhs, Bah'ais and atheists. Hindus, Buddhists and folk religions saw lower levels of hostility and little change in the past six years, according to the report's extensive data.Europe showed the largest median increase in hostility due to a rise in harrassment of women because of religious dress and violent attacks on minorities such as the murder of a rabbi and three Jewish children by a radical in France.Tensions in Israel arise from the Palestinian issue, disagreements between secular and religious Jews and the growth of ultra-Orthodox sects that live apart from the majority.The world's two largest faiths, Christianity and Islam, make up almost half the world's population and were the most widely targetted in 2012, facing official and social hostility in 110 and 109 countries respectively.Jews suffer hostility in 71 countries, even though they make up only 0.2 per cent of the world's population and about 80 per cent of them live in Israel and the United States.https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/423114904561008640The report said there were probably more restrictions on religion around the world than its statistics could document but its results could be considered ""a good estimate"".It classified war and terrorism as social hostility, arguing: ""It is not always possible to determine the degree to which they are religiously motivated or state sponsored.""","Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://tribune-reloaded.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/659005-Untitled-1389763175/659005-Untitled-1389763175.jpg,"['report', 'religion', 'cent', 'muslims', 'list', 'pakistan', 'high', 'religious', 'countries', 'tops', 'restrictions', 'pew', 'social', 'hostilities', 'hostility']",

It’s a couple of days into the New Year, and Jeffrey Deitch is in Los Angeles, that city that he, in three years as director of the Museum of Contemporary Art—and like so many swashbuckling, top-of-their-game Manhattanites who moved out West before him—ultimately failed to seduce. His plan was to transform the museum into a House of Deitchism: crowds, excitement, music, dancing, James Franco and Marina Abramovic, graffiti writers mixing it up with Andy Warhol’s soup cans, Kenneth Anger and the sisters of fashion label Rodarte. In short, the entire theatrical, multidisciplinary, occasionally pervy, finger-on-the-pulse aesthetic-­entertainment complex that he’d helped stir up in New York, where for four decades he’d cavorted stylishly with a march of boldface names. It was a very New York concoction of cool.

But it didn’t go over so well at MoCA, where his sensationalist instincts rankled those who wanted their art museum to be something more ecclesiastical, set apart from the give-’em-what-they-want box-office mania of Tinseltown. Many in New York had thought his hire was a brilliant one, having seen how Deitch had, apparently out of a simple desire to amuse himself by enabling others, managed to be both transgressive and investment grade all at once. But major museums are not run by big-time art dealers, much less one with a Harvard M.B.A., and while Deitch gave the man who hired him (billionaire collector and MoCA underwriter Eli Broad) what he said he wanted (attention-getting shows, if ones that did disrupt the museum’s traditional educational mission), Deitch didn’t seem that interested in the job of running a museum, with all that glad-handing, fund-raising, and curator petting. He just wanted to be able to do the shows he wanted to do. After much controversy and travail, he announced he was calling it quits six months ago. But even now—as MoCA zeros in on a more conventional replacement and claims it’s raised $100 million for a new endowment—the systematically upbeat Deitch isn’t ready to abandon L.A. entirely.

“It’s 77 and beautiful,” he says from a home he still keeps there, on a day when New York is a grimy tundra bracing for the “polar vortex.” “I find it very productive,” he says of the good-cheer weather. “I’ve already written two essays. So many people I connect with here can live because they sold a pilot two years ago. So it’s much more comfortable.” People in New York, he says, feel embarrassed when confronted by people between projects. “They always ask, ‘What are you doing? When is the book coming out?’ ”

“The book” is a Deitch Projects retrospective, a meticulously curated history and part of a legacy-manicuring project that is Deitch’s Act Three. As I met with him over the fall, Deitch didn’t seem the least defeated by his Los Angeles adventure. Instead, he seemed determined to consolidate his gains and shore up his claim to a central place in the last half-century of American art. I’d seen him first at the Hole, a gallery on the Bowery, where one of his former protégées, Kathy Grayson, let him re-create the eighties nightclub Area, which had been important to him when he was younger (timed to someone else’s book about the place). One of Deitch’s core beliefs is in the dance floor as a cultural teakettle, though he himself is the sober sort, usually in the corner, watching it all go down. He’d filled this party with artwork produced by Area habitués Keith Haring, Chuck Close, and Larry Rivers, and as it got going that night, Deitch took in the dancing, completely naked Japanese-masked young people who call themselves “the Narcissisters” and, half-smile on the face, nodded: “Oh, yeah, we got it. This is Area,” he said quietly. He felt he’d recaptured something, a time when, he told me later, “downtown was really a community, because virtually every artist, art writer, musician, and hanger-on lived somehow in this area.” It was a hothouse he’d been trying to keep alive, or restage, for decades now, as the once-rambunctious city lost a certain energy, first to the devastation of AIDS and then to gentrification.

I later saw him in Miami, during Art Basel, where he staged a talk with his friend Spike Jonze about Her, at which he admitted he “almost had the same kind of relationship with a girl who gives me directions on my GPS.” It seemed like a joke someone else would make about Deitch and his give-nothing-away personal life (almost everyone in the art world is quick to blithely declare him “asexual,” though “Page Six” said he found “true love” with former Warhol crony Paige Powell in 2009). And we met up as well in his former gallery on Grand Street, where he is now both landlord and “guest” of another former protégée, Suzanne Geiss, preparing that monograph on the full fifteen-year life of Deitch Projects, titled Live the Art—a concept, or mandate, that has preoccupied him since the mid-seventies, when he curated his first show, “Lives,” about artists who use their lives as their medium.

It is Deitch, not Larry Gagosian or David Zwirner or Sotheby’s now-ex-capo Tobias Meyer or collector Steve Cohen, who is probably the most exceptional and representative figure of the post-Warhol art world—a strange and slippery amalgam of tight-lipped wallflower and PR-savvy showman. The Greek-Cypriot super-­collector Dakis Joannou, whom he’s known and advised since the eighties, jokes that Deitch is “superhuman.” He’s certainly Zelig-like. Deitch claims to be the first person to have bought Basquiat (“five little drawings for $50 each”), midwifed the incredible ascent of Jeff Koons, forged the loss-leader gallery model of supporting exciting and attention-getting but deeply weird work with an aggressive backroom secondary-market hustle, helped give Art Basel Miami its bacchanalian gloss with his annual music-art extravaganzas (Fischerspooner, Devendra Banhart, Santigold, Chicks on Speed), and abetted the process by which the ­contemporary-art museum became a showcase and playroom for private collections, many of which he helped assemble, in part with work from artists he made stars: Vanessa Beecroft, Cecily Brown, Dan Colen, Shepard Fairey, and Miranda July, among many others.

I’d called him in L.A. to ask about reports that he was about to create a temple to Deitchism in Red Hook. Artforum had blogged that he’d been talking at a holiday cocktail party about opening a “ginormous” new space there, which could be his own mini-MoCA, a monument to his legacy and values without the hassles or compromises. But Deitch says Red Hook is far from a done deal. “I’m looking at different places,” he says, including possibly the so-called SuperPier on the Hudson at 14th Street. “Most of them have complications. I am looking at Red Hook, but there are a lot of issues, like can we get a water taxi going? Who could help subsidize that?” It all came out on the Internet because Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich’s girlfriend, the collector Dasha Zhukova, mentioned that she’d been out to Red Hook (which is already home to many big-time artists’ spaces, including Dustin Yellin and Deitch favorites Urs Fischer and Swoon), and he quizzed her on her perception of its accessibility.

That’s Red Hook, the gloriously isolated former docklands that Robert Moses cut off from the rest of the city with the BQE and then populated with public housing, and that Sandy flooded so badly. Red Hook, which now, like everything else, has become a colonial department of the international art-and-money crowd—a class of people, and aspiration, that Deitch knows well, because he helped create it. “I want to do something big and fresh,” he says. But also: “I do want a space that I can control.”

Deitch knows everyone, but most people don’t know much about him. Like his hero Warhol, he’s an impresario of almost undetectable brio, a painfully painstaking man, patient with his explanations but only because, one suspects he suspects, you might be too inattentive to otherwise understand just what he has in his mind. He is solitary—a disciplined runner, he’s never been married and answers all his own e-mails—and in 1992, he curated a show largely drawn from Joannou’s collection called “Post-Human,” about the blurring of what is real and what is artificial. It’s a concept he can seem to embody: a kind of abstracted and evacuated person, almost holographic, not unlike his friend Jeff Koons. (“I think he has played the role of a post-human character himself,” says Massimiliano Gioni, the New Museum and Venice Biennale curator.) Deitch will talk over people, but politely, unspooling pedagogic insight. That closed-off social affect, for what it’s worth, always annoyed the L.A. Times art critic (and Deitch arch-critic) Christopher Knight, who complained to me that “I’ve sat next to Jeffrey at dinners many times and I’ve never been able to have a conversation with him.”

To talk about his future, and the meaning of his past, Deitch suggested dinner at the Leopard in the old Café des Artistes, near his apartment at the Century on Central Park West. It’s a staid, beige place that lost most of its historical charm in an inattentive renovation a few years back. “So, these are by Howard Chandler Christy,” he says, pointing to the gamboling wood-nymph murals from the twenties and thirties by the artist known for his coquettish World War I recruitment posters as well as Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, which hangs in the U.S. Capitol. “This is one of the special places in New York City. I wanted this table so you could be inspired here.”

The waitress approaches to take our order: “Do you have good tomatoes today?” he asks, then repeats: “Good tomatoes.” She retreats to the kitchen to check. “I’m very fast,” he says on her return. “What I’d like to get is tomato and mozzarella, please, with extra tomatoes. Then I’ll try the Dover sole.”

Deitch is fastidious and very much in control of his self-presentation: For years, he’s had his trademark glasses custom-made in Germany to his own design, and his trademark double-breasted suits made in Italy by the tailor an old girlfriend introduced him to. “I’ve been through all of these scenes from radical politics and Students for a Democratic Society and the hippie period—all of this, and then punk rock,” he tells me. “But see, I’ve been like the same through it. There’s pictures of me like in the seventies where I look pretty much like I do now, in a way, and that’s part of my thing.”

Deitch was born in 1952 and grew up in Connecticut, where his father ran a ­heating-oil and coal company and his mother was an economist. He was an exchange student in Japan during high school; his brother imports musical instruments from Africa and Indonesia. “My parents were very cultured people,” he says. “They collected local art. They really were not aware of the New York art world, but the house was filled, still is filled, with art by local artists.” His father’s business had an early computer, and “I took home these reams of this accordion-type computer paper they used to use, and I would just draw endlessly interesting logos and logotypes, corporate logos. Most of what you see is driving around in shopping centers, and you see the signs. It’s on packages. That’s the visual world, so that’s what I reacted to. I don’t know where that art is, reams and reams of my drawings,” he says wistfully. “My mother tried to push me into piano lessons, which I did, but that’s not where my interest or talent was. I remember being an elementary-school student, 8 years old or something, and I remember this vividly, of the first time that I made a serious painting. I was at the beach in Long Island Sound, and I painted the cottage that we were renting. I remember this feeling of ecstasy, of making. I just had such joy.”

It’s easy to see, five decades later in this 61-year-old man, that obsessive kid, drawing logos (the Deitch Projects logo was derived from Warhol’s Brillo boxes). He’s a sort of lonely romantic, a pragmatist seeking a mechanism for transcendent experience—or at least a way to pay for it. “I played in a marching band when I was in school. I played brass instruments. I played trumpet, baritone horn, and I loved it. That was a really fun thing to do. I like that kind of real mainstream Americana, like John Philip Sousa.” (He had a marching band play for Jeff Koons on his 50th birthday and invited the USC Trojan Marching Band to play at MoCA.) “I’m very aware of the connections between art, literature, and music. I look for aesthetic energy, aesthetic movements that are so big that they’re too big to just be an art alone, that they spill over.”

He switched from economics to art history at Wesleyan University—on summer break, he opened a gallery in the parlor of an inn in Lenox, Massachusetts—and also scrutinized Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine, fascinated by the counterculture he created at the Factory. “I just wanted to be part of art, and I didn’t really differentiate so much whether I was going to be a writer, a curator, a dealer, artist.”

What he was looking for was “this kind of aesthetic energy,” he says—he tried his hand at performance art, setting up arguments on the street and then filming them. “I couldn’t get any traction,” he says a little sadly. “Flash Art was the only magazine that covered me.” While working at a gallery, he found the music scene: “Television, Talking Heads, and Devo, and then my favorite, Suicide. It was a great reward to eventually show Alan Suicide’s art at the gallery. I might have been there at the first Talking Heads show in New York. Because I wanted to be able to stay up half the night and go to these concerts, I quit my job at the John Weber Gallery and switched to writing the gallery newsletter so that I could stay out till five in the morning. It was a great education for me.”

But he still wasn’t making money, which is part of why he went and got the M.B.A. “I used to joke that I was the only person who ever went to Harvard Business School and studied art criticism, because I introduced the kind of art writing about the connection between contemporary art and economics. I may have been the first person to write about this. I gave a talk at the College Art Association in 1979 on art and economics. That became, eventually, an essay in Art in America on Andy Warhol as a business artist. So, all that drew on what I learned at Harvard Business School, understanding economics and the theory of marketing. So, it really helped me to have an original take on art and its economic structure and the way the art market was a crucial part of the consensus of how artists present their work to the world and how they’re judged. I wrote up a business plan for a bank to start an art-market department, and I went to both Chase and Citibank, but in 1979, Citibank was the more dynamic bank. Walter Wriston was chairman of the bank, who went to Wesleyan, where I went to school. He was a legendary, visionary business leader. So, I decided to go to Citibank.” The slope-roofed new headquarters had just opened (“I just noticed there’s a Haring work that’s up for auction of a flying saucer zapping the Citicorp Center”), and Deitch got to go to Japan a lot, because Japan was buying a good deal of art with all the extra money from what became known after the fact as its real-estate “bubble economy.” He finally got to know Warhol through an advisory gig he had with something called the I Club in Hong Kong in 1982—“a similar idea as Area, but it was a heavy investment,” he says (meaning a reported $10,000 membership fees). Warhol had done a portrait show at the Whitney, “and I knew Andy loved going around, getting portrait commissions. So, I brought Andy Warhol to Hong Kong.

“Before, I’d seen him around. When I visited the Factory, I did this research on business art, and he would just talk in monosyllables. I just figured he doesn’t really talk in complete sentences. Then I picked him up at the airport in the Mandarin Hotel Rolls-Royce, and he’s very energetic. He and his entourage booked the whole first-class section on the Pan-Am flight. So, he was ready to go and go to the club and have dinner, and there’s this big Chinese-style table with a lazy Susan, and it was Andy’s entourage and me and Alfred, the owner of the club. And Andy was comfortable with all of his friends, just talking. I just couldn’t believe my ears. When I came back, talking to [gallerist] Leo Castelli, I said, ‘Not only does Andy talk, he’s one of the most fascinating conversationalists I’ve ever encountered.’ Leo said, ‘Of course. Who do you know who has a more interesting life than Andy Warhol?’ ” But most of the time Warhol kept that voluble self under wraps, Deitch says, “because he couldn’t talk to all these people wanting to hustle him into this or that.”

In 1988, Deitch started his own art-advisory firm—both living and working in Trump Tower, an easy stroll every Friday over to MoMA to study the collection. But “in the eighties and in the nineties, I was feeling unfulfilled,” he says—still a little too far from the curatorial center of things as merely an art businessman. “That’s one of the reasons why I did Deitch Projects. I had to get into more creative things.” He’d sell an $8 million Warhol and bankroll a performance collective like Fischerspooner—he’d do that kind of thing quite a lot. “The business was never an end in itself; it still is not,” he says. “One of my roles is to be the kind of person who finds money for the most transgressive, crazy art project, to make it happen.”

“He very clearly crafted his image around being this agent-provocateur citizen of the world,” says painter Kehinde Wiley, who had his first New York solo show at Deitch Projects when he was just out of Yale art school. (“In studio visits he would never have negative criticisms. He would say, ‘I like this, this is a masterpiece.’ ”) “He reminds me very much of the flâneur: He’s in society and not engaging. But there’s a fork in the road where the flâneur is able to take all that knowledge and mobilize it, but never is it about personal agency. Sort of like the Wizard of Oz.”

“The criticism that he gets sometimes is that he’s critic and curator and finance expert,” says Gioni. “Sometimes he is criticized for being complicit with the market. But he became his own model.” The other criticism, of course, was that he wasn’t actually serious about serious art—or not as serious as he was about the party taking place around it. Which he sort of confesses to: “I do not think that there’s any contradiction between being rigorous, super-­serious, and being fun and lively,” he says. “Look at the greatest artists, Picasso. This is the most rigorous, toughest stuff. He pushed and challenged himself, but you see the images of Picasso—he’s having fun, he loves it. Toulouse-Lautrec, this is revolutionary, rigorous art. He’s hanging out in those clubs. He’s going to the Moulin Rouge and having a good time. Of course, obviously, the example of Andy Warhol, the Factory. That’s a fundamental thing, that there’s no contradiction between engagement and enjoying life, and a rigorous approach and disciplined approach to art, and you should be able to do both. Art that’s deadly serious—and some that I respect—it’s not the art that excites me.”

But in 2010, he chose to shut down his Emerald City carnival of the new, as well as the art-dealing operation he’d honed to pay for it, to become the director of the financially troubled MoCA at the behest of Broad, with whom he’d worked quite closely over the years and who would call Deitch’s arrival a “game changer.” “I feel as if I’ve been training for this position my entire life,” Deitch said at the time.

Reinventing the museum would be Deitch’s biggest project yet: his high-low show on a big new soundstage and with better weather. But running an institution was a very different game. As a gallerist, “you can indulge completely your own interests,” says Christopher Knight. “A really great museum director has to have the capacity to set aside his aesthetic biases and support the staff.” Instead of Deitch Projects’ two garagelike galleries in Soho (and satellite spaces in Brooklyn and Long Island City), he’d have an entire museum, and in some ways an entire new city, at his disposal, not to mention an 8,000-square-foot house, with space to display his cheerily surreal art collection (there’s a Michel Gondry piano that plays a video programmed by participants in 88 locations around the world). In New York, he’d bunked in a monkish apartment near Central Park, where he’d run miles every morning; at his place in L.A., he could have a hundred people over. It’s up near Griffith Park, looking down on the city and up to the Hollywood sign. For added transgressive romance—which is what seems to make Deitch most happy—it’s said to be where Cary Grant lived with Randolph Scott.

“I got so slammed for this show,” says Deitch, shaking his head in disbelief. It’s the day before Thanksgiving, and we’re looking at images of Dennis Hopper’s art, the subject of a MoCA show that opened a few months after Deitch arrived. “Did you know his photographs? They’re great.”

When in New York, Deitch has set up camp at 76 Grand—he still owns the building, though Geiss has been running her gallery in it. And now they’re sharing the loftlike upstairs office again, with matching desks that look like they come from a Sol LeWitt home-furnishings line. “Suzanne,” Deitch says, looking over at Geiss, a stylish woman in an interesting sweater with three tasteful rings in her left ear, who’s winding up business so she can go away for the weekend at Disney World. (No, no kids, she tells me, just because she loves Disney World.) “You saw ‘Hopper,’ right?”

“Yeah, I went out for it,” she confirms, one hand on her phone.

Deitch turns back to his computer screen. “It was just crazy … You’ve read all this negative stuff from New York critics who never went there, who didn’t understand that this was … this was as interesting as anything that any contemporary museum in the country did, what I did in three years …” To prove it, he’s doing a book about his time there, too, called The MoCA Index.

Rain drums on the skylight, trucks rumble down Grand, and two other well-turned-out young women toil away on the other side of the bright-white room in front of a wall of bookcases, one with a small sculpture on her desk of a hand, middle finger up. Deitch stops himself: He is not by nature a grouser, or a glum and persecuted outsider, but rather a thorough­going, almost aerobic optimist, a man whose fundamental talent might be the consistency of his affirmation of whatever strikes his conceptual fancy. Which is a lot.

He turns to the PDF of Live the Art, to be published in the fall by Rizzoli. It’s a kind of art-history memoir, told as a visual essay; a dinner plate will be fused to its cover. Its first line is “Deitch Projects was not meant to be an art gallery.”

“I’m really privileged and inside the center of the art world, since the early seventies,” he says. “I absorbed so much and am lucky to have had personal relationships with most of the major artists, all of the major artists, most of the major collectors, dealers, and curators. I want to do what I can to solidify this knowledge and to participate in the writing of the history,” he adds solemnly, gently. “It doesn’t mean I’m not interested in the new stuff anymore. I still am, but I feel this responsibility that I can’t just let this all go through my fingers. I want to be part of telling this story.”

We turn back to the book, and he begins to tell the story: “Joe Fawbush had this gallery, and it was a very good gallery,” representing Kiki Smith and Christian Marclay. This is where we are now, 76 Grand, at one time the home of a workshop that made theater curtains. “He died of AIDS. His partner, Tom, knew that I loved the building. They were good friends. He asked me if I wanted to take over the lease. I made a deal with the landlord to rent with an option to buy, which was a good deal you could make in those days.” At the time, he was helping Koons create his “Celebration” series (which reportedly nearly bankrupted Deitch), and 76 Grand “was a project room just to have fun while I did my art-advisory business.” In the beginning, he invited only artists who hadn’t yet had a New York solo show and would give them $25,000 in production funds, which, if not reimbursed through sales, meant that Deitch got to keep the works for his own collection.

We scroll on. There’s Vanessa Beecroft, who filled the room with twenty nearly naked women. There’s Jocelyn Taylor, walking fully naked down Canal Street. There’s Russian artist Oleg Kulik, who lived for two weeks as a dog. “He just was incredibly brilliant, in fact really scary. You believed that he was a dog,” Deitch says. This was fun; soon he bought the building housing Canal Lumber, a bigger space around the corner on Wooster. The first major exhibition project there was of a Barbara Kruger video-and-slide-projection show in the fall of 1997.

There was Shower in the Dark, a conceptual performance from 2002 where participants were asked to leave their underpants in a cup when they departed and got a Deitch Projects thong in exchange. There was Paul McCarthy’s The Garden (featuring an animatronic man humping a tree). There was “Session the Bowl,” in which he turned the Canal Lumber space over to skateboarders. “This is a crazy thing we did with Patricia Cronin,” he says, turning to a sculpture of two women in bed. “She wanted to have a show here. I said, ‘I’ve got a better idea. It shouldn’t be a show in a gallery. Let’s buy a cemetery plot.’ She said, ‘Well, I want a gallery show.’ ‘Trust me,’ I said. ‘This is much more interesting. It’s permanent.’ ” It’s a grave site for her and her partner in Woodlawn Cemetery. “It’s really transgressive to have in a cemetery. And this is now like one of the major stops on the Woodlawn Cemetery tour, with Miles Davis’s grave.”

He goes on and on: “Isn’t that crazy? This is amazing. This was a good show … And this was another phenomenal show. This won the Critics’ Prize that year for best show … This is probably our most notorious show … A thousand people at this opening.” We get to the “Art Parade,” which took over the nearby blocks with a street party. “There are all these people coming to us with great projects, and I said, ‘I’m sorry, there’s no slot for you.’ So the ‘Art Parade’ was an opportunity to say, ‘Everybody, you can come.’

“I’m very idealistic,” he says. “I just have this fundamental idea that vanguard art can be life-enhancing and can be inspiring to all kinds of people. I don’t have a hierarchy. For some people, if you’re a kind of conventional person with a job and money, then you’re evil. Or, for others, people who live that kind of conventional life, people who are on the margins, whether culturally or economically, they are like subhuman. You don’t want to go near them. I try to be open, embracing, with everybody, and I want everybody to share in the exhibitions if they decide to. Today, I was in the office of maybe the most important real-estate person in the country, talking about an art project, and tonight I’m having dinner with Alan Suicide. So that’s been my life for a long time.”

He pauses. “It was a great experience at the museum, but I had a much more efficient system,” he says. “I’m happy to be back doing it my way.”

Australia’s agribusiness sector has been in the headlines recently. An example is the decision by federal Treasurer Joe Hockey in November last year to block the takeover of GrainCorp by US agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. Despite the newly elected Abbott government’s claim that Australia was now “open for business”, this issue opened a major rift within coalition ranks.

Not only were the National’s implacably opposed to the sale of GrainCorp, but many rural Liberals also joined the call to keep the business in Australian ownership. While the farmers expressed delight at the decision, business leaders and the investment community were highly critical and remain so. Their criticism is based on their view that it sends the wrong signals to foreign investors.

Another international acquisition bid that has attracted attention is Canadian dairy foods company Saputo’s interest in taking control of Victorian dairy processor Warrnambool Cheese & Butter (WCB). This attracted media interest due to the arm wrestle that has been taking place between Saputo and local dairy co-operative Murray Goulburn.

These events have garnered attention here in “The Conversation” with Ian Lee’s piece on the motivation of Saputo to acquire WCB, and Brigit Busicchia’s article on the “bleak” outlook for Australian grain co-operatives, in particular that of WA based Co-operative Bulk Handling (CBH).

These articles are both very good in their analysis of what are quite complex issues. However, they highlight two things that I feel deserve some follow up comment. The first relates to the motivation of Saputo’s bid for WCB as outlined by Ian. The second relates to the wider outlook for farmer co-operatives in Australia as discussed by Brigit.

Saputo’s motivation for the WCB bid

In his article on the Saputo bid for WCB Ian Lee provides an interesting background on the forces that are motivating this Canadian firm to invest in Australia. The strategic imperative for Saputo, like most major dairy processors around the world, is that the dairy sector has grown into a global industry.

Demand for dairy products has grown significantly in the Middle East and Asia, particularly in China, where rising household incomes, changing dietary habits and the ownership of refrigerators has boosted the consumption of dairy products. According to Dairy Australia, global milk supply has been rising across Europe, North and South America and New Zealand. Even China has implemented plans to significantly expand its own dairy sector to help meet local demand.

Ian points to the high cost of milk supply within Canada as compared to Australia. This is supported by Dairy Australia’s statistics that show Canadian farm gate milk prices as significantly higher than those in other dairy producing countries. By comparison Australia’s farm gate dairy prices in the past decade have been broadly at or below those in other countries.

Since the deregulation of the Australian dairy industry in 2000, the dynamics of Australia’s dairy sector have been subject to global competitive forces. Farm gate milk prices are effectively determined by international pricing. Australia exports around 40% of the milk it produces and our farmers have generally received farm gate prices that are lower than world standards. This has led to a significant decline in the number of dairy farmers over the past ten years.

For example, in the early 1980s there were around 22,000 registered dairy farms across Australia. By the end of the 1990s this number had fallen to about 13,000. In 2011/12 there were fewer than 7,000 dairy farms left in business, although those that remained were generally much larger. According to Dairy Australia this decline in the number of farms is correlated with the farm gate price of milk.

Dairy farming is a tough business that requires significant capital investment and constant work to maintain the daily milking cycle. It is also subject to the impacts of drought, flooding and other natural environmental risks. Low farm gate milk prices squeeze the farmers’ profit margins at times when input costs (e.g. feed, power, and wages) are constantly rising.

It is therefore unsurprising that Saputo would be keen to secure a foothold in Australia where it can access milk supply at much lower prices than can be obtained in Canada. Another key attraction for it to purchase WCB is the latter’s export business. WCB exports about 40% of its cheese products, with Japan, Korea and South East Asia being key export markets.

WCB also exports milk powder and Whey Protein concentrate to the USA and Japan. These are used in health and sports drinks products and within food processing as a binding agent. The profit margins on this product are reportedly very high. The company also entered into an agreement in 2012 to supply premium milk powders to Japan.

The co-operative alternative

A keen rival to Saputo for the WCB takeover bid has been Murray Goulburn. I wrote about this battle last year inThe Conversation where I highlighted the significant concentration of market power that exists in the Australian dairy industry. I also pointed to the benefits that co-operatives offer to farmers who – as small business operators – lack the bargaining power to negotiate farm gate prices with major processors.

It is worth noting that in all segments of the industry supply chain a handful of large processors control the majority of the market. Of these firms only Murray Goulburn is an Australian farmer owned co-operative. The other processors are either Australian investor-owned firms such as Bega Cheese Ltd or WCB, or foreign owned subsidiaries such as Lion (owned by Kirin, Japan); Parmalat (Italy/French), or Fonterra (New Zealand). The last of these is a farmer co-operative in its home country, but it operates as an investor-owned firm in Australia.

IBIS World 2013

As the bidding for WCB has unfolded Murray Goulburn and Saputo have gradually increased their offer per share. At time of writing Saputo was offering $9.60 per share if it could secure 90% of the share capital. By comparison Murray Goulburn was seeking a minimum of 50% the share capital for $9.50 per share. Murray Goulburn was already a major shareholder in WCB at the start of this process with around 17.5% of the company’s share capital. The other key shareholder has been Bega Cheese who held another 19%. Bega was the third major bidder in the ring.

The recent decision by Bega Cheese to sell their stake in WCB to Saputo appears to have tipped the bid in the Canadian company’s favour. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 January 2014 suggested that Lion, which owns a 10% stake in WCB, might enter the ring.

This same article quoted Bega’s Executive Chairman Barry Irvin as saying that his board would have preferred to see WCB (Australia’s oldest listed milk processor) remain in local ownership. Yet one can imagine that the potential profit of around $68 million for the sale of their shares would have overcome any nationalistic sentiment.

Murray Goulburn is not completely out of the race, but it has met some resistance from both the WCB board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). In January 2010 the board of WCB rejected a proposal by Murray Goulburn to take over a controlling share of the company. This antipathy towards the co-operative’s bid to control WCB by the firm’s board and management has been a feature of this recent bid.

The ACCC has also expressed its concern over Murray Goulburn’s bid to acquire WCB. These concerns appear to be founded on the existing market share controlled by Murray Goulburn within the Australian dairy market. The co-operative has a major share of fresh milk, milk powder, butter and cheese. However, the major area of concern was in the supply of raw milk and involves a complex argument over whether the raw milk market is defined on a state-by-state basis, or a national interstate level.

In 2013, Murray Goulburn, working in concert with NSW-based dairy co-operative NORCO, secured a significant contract with Coles to supply fresh milk. These contracts had previously been held by Japan’s Lion, and they signalled a strategic move by Murray Goulburn to move across the Victorian border and sign-up farmers in NSW.

The announcement by Coles in relation to this deal with the two co-operatives was that it would offer a better deal for the thousands of small dairy producers in those states, provide more secure long-term contracts, plus higher and more stable farm gate prices for milk. It comes on the back of a lengthy period of retail milk price discounting by the major retailers Coles and Woolworths, and concerns that this was damaging the financial viability of farmers.

What goes for dairy also goes for grain

While these events have been unfolding in the dairy sector the Australian grains industry has been undergoing its own revolutions. As noted above, the aborted takeover bid for GrainCorp by ADM became highly political. This was an issue that I discussed here in The Conversation in an article that examined the history of market deregulation in the grains industry, and the need to consider the interests of farmers.

In her article on the future of grain co-operatives Brigit points to the decline in the number of farmer co-operatives and factors that contribute to this. Key factors suggested were the declining number of farmers, market deregulation, farmer indebtedness, and a fragmented legislative system with a multitude of outdated State Co-operatives Acts that impeded cross-border trading.

While these observations are all largely correct, they overlook the complexity of the co-operative business model. There is little question that the number of Australian farmers has fallen significantly over recent decades. Like many businesses farming has become increasingly mechanised and farms have had to grow larger and more capital intensive to remain competitive. For example, in Western Australia the membership of CBH was around 15,000 in the late 1960s, today is around 4,500.

However, the decline in the number of farmers is not necessarily a cause of decline in agricultural co-operatives. Neither is the fragmented legislative system that governs co-operatives. There is indeed a case to be made that the lack of a National Co-operatives Act was an obstacle to interstate expansion for some co-operatives. Yet it was not the most significant factor.

For example, Murray Goulburn has operated under the federal Corporation’s Act and its predecessor for the past 50 years. Its constitution enshrines the democracy and values of co-operative enterprise and provides protection from a minority taking control of the company’s share register. Other major Australian co-operatives (e.g. Capricorn Society in the automotive trades industry) have followed a similar path.

Over the past decade Australia’s state-based co-operative’s legislation have been significantly overhauled. There is now the introduction of a Co-operatives National Law, designed to facilitate the growth and expansion of co-operatives across state and territory borders.

Perhaps the most significant force that has impacted on farmer co-operatives has been the deregulation of agricultural markets. The movement to open up the Australian economy to greater international competition commenced in the 1980s and early 1990s under a federal Labor government. It was keenly pursued by the Liberal-National Party (LNP) coalition from the mid-1990s and has continued ever since.

Market deregulation is generally a positive objective and one that has helped to transform Australia from a closed and largely uncompetitive economy, to an open and efficient one that compares well against most other nations. This trend in market deregulation has been mirrored around the world and reflects the broader “globalisation” process that has proceeded since the end of the Cold War in 1989.

However, while enhanced competition is a good thing, it can have negative consequences, particularly for small business operators such as farmers. These producers sell their commodities into national and international supply chains. They have relatively limited – if any – power to negotiate farm gate prices with major buyers who control “choke points” in the supply chain.

Taking care of the little guy

It was this powerlessness in the market that triggered the emergence of farmer co-operatives across Australia in the last century. In the bulk grains handling and marketing sector the solution was handled differently by each state. Western Australia and South Australia formed farmer owned co-operatives, while in NSW and Victoria the state governments established Grain Elevator Boards.

The process of market deregulation that swept through Australia’s grains industry over the past twenty years led to the privatisation of these former state owned enterprises. Once they became publicly listed companies they embarked on a process of merger and acquisition resulting in the rise of GrainCorp with around 80% control over the grain storage and handling network in east coast Australia.

Joe Hockey’s denial of the ADM bid continues to upset many who accuse him of caving into “bush socialists” and arguing that the only way to run our agribusiness sector is to allow in more not less foreign ownership. Once again the argument is more complex than this. There is a need for more foreign direct investment into Australia’s farm and agribusiness sector. However, we also need to consider the future of our farmers and the rural communities that rely upon them.

A key concern for many grain growers in relation to the GrainCorp deal was whether ADM would retain grain receival points in their areas, and also what this takeover might do to farm gate pricing and the cost of handling and storage. Any business – whether it is a co-operative or investor owned firm – must operate efficiently. However, there are situations in which the excessive focus on profit maximisation and shareholder return can result in negative consequences for small producers.

To illustrate this we can look at the dairy industry in NSW. Despite the presence of NORCO the NSW dairy industry is dominated by large, international processors. These companies impose a two tier pricing system on farmers that offers them a fair price for “tier-one” milk that the processor wants, but a very low price for “tier-two” milk that they don’t want. The dairy farmer cannot easily control the amount of milk their cows produce and they can’t readily dump milk (at least not legally).

This two-tier system has impacted significantly on farm gate pricing for raw milk and squeezed the profit margins of producers. It has been attributed to the decline in the number of dairy farms in NSW and as more farms close, those that remain become “stranded”. Their isolation makes the collection of their milk less economical for the processor and the cycle continues.

By comparison the policy of Murray Goulburn is to take all the milk its members wish to supply, and to pay one fair price. As a farmer owned co-operative the company is concerned primarily with its farmer owners who are also its shareholders.

The same general pattern of behaviour can be seen in Western Australia where CBH operates. As a “non-distributing” co-operative, CBH does not issue dividends to its member shareholders. It also offers a storage and handling network that seeks to provide uniform access and handling charges to producers across the state.

Co-operatives have a different purpose to Investor-Owned Firms

In summary, the co-operative enterprise continues to offer benefits to Australia’s farmers just as they still do across most other countries which compete with us within global food supply chains. They have a different overall purpose to investor-owned firms and this “co-operative difference” revolves around the fact that they are owned by their members who also supply to and buy from them. They also operate with a highly democratic governance model in which it is not possible for a small number of shareholders to take control of the company.

Comparing co-operatives and investor-owned firms is difficult due to the different purposes that drive them. Like any business their performance and efficiency compares favourably with investor-owned firms when run well. However, they need to be assessed not just in their share price and profitability, but also in the wider benefits that they deliver to their members. This may not be best measured in price per share, but in their ability to offer fair prices, and greater stability of farm gate pricing and supply contracts.

The 22-year-old says Haru's demanding ways have now taken over her life

The seven-month-old owl is apparently now convinced that he is human

Has also developed a taste for high-octane television, including Top Gear



A pet owl that thinks it is human is exasperating its owner by demanding to watch 'male' television programmes like Top Gear and Star Wars.

Natasha Welch, 22, adopted Asian brown wood owl Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months-old he has 'taken over' her life.

Ms Welch, from Maidstone in Kent, said Haru has developed human characteristics since she hand-reared him from being a chick - and now has a taste for high-octane television.



Taking over: Natasha Welch adopted Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months old he is dominating her life. She says the Asian brown wood owl is convinced she is his mum

Ms Welch, who graduated from university with a fashion degree, now takes Haru around classrooms and fetes after setting up a craft workshop called ‘Owl About Art’.

She said when he was tiny she had to feed him mice and 'supervise him' when he drank water to make sure he didn’t accidentally drown himself.

Ms Welch added: 'When he was a chick it was like having a baby. He would wake me up crying and call for food in the middle of the night.'

'I would hand feed him 10 chicks and a couple of mice a day and have to be with him when he drank water, otherwise he could drown.'

All grown up: When he was a chick (left) Natasha had to feed Haru and 'supervise him' when he drank water to make sure he didn’t accidentally drown. Now he's an adult he is becoming increasingly demanding (right)

Natasha says Haru loves watching television, especially Top Gear (pictured) and Star Wars

Haru even slept in a cot at first, but is now becoming 'the man of the house' and has started to become 'very demanding'.

Ms Welch said: 'He loves watching TV, especially programmes I don’t like, so I have to sit in front of tennis, Top Gear and Star Wars with him... Over Christmas he watched Madagascar all the way through.'

She said the bond between them is so strong the owl treats her as his mother, but added: 'Unlike the saying, owls aren’t actually very clever at all. He thinks I’m his mum and that he’s a human.'

Haru lives in an aviary in Ms Welch’s garden, but Asian brown wood owls are native to India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and China.

She hopes her Owl About Art travelling workshop will encourage children to get into 'owl themed art with a live owl'.

Her website states: 'Natasha & Haru tour the country visiting schools, clubs, nurseries, events, fetes and craft fairs or even your home with this one-of-a-kind experience!'



It adds: Our most popular package includes the ‘make your own’ sock owl workshops where everyone enjoys stuffing socks, decorating their sock owl with felt wings, feet and beaks & cute button eyes.'

As even millionaires tightened their belts and corporate bonuses became scarce it seemed certain two of Britain's most iconic brands Rolls-Royce and Bentley would suffer badly.

Industry experts predicted rocky times for the famous pair.

Sales dipped, causing the doommongers to nod their heads knowingly.

In 2009 Bentley took the drastic step of temporarily halting production at its factory in Crewe.

This makes the latest figures from the two manufacturers all the more remarkable.

Since the depths of the recession Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales have tripled, according to the motor trade association, and last year both achieved record sales.

Bentley produced 10,120 cars last year and bosses plan to invest £800million to increase output at Crewe to 15,000 vehicles by 2018.

It's an equally rosy picture at Rolls-Royce, which delivered 3,630 cars last year and is to create 100 new jobs at its factory at Goodwood, West Sussex, where bespoke models are made.

Both are cashing in on huge demand from overseas. Exports to emerging markets such as China and Russia, as well as traditional hot spots the US and mainland Europe, are booming.

There's no doubt the Chinese love their Rollers - one in every four built is now sold there.

This is despite the barriers to car ownership in the big Chinese cities.

Curbs on congestion, pollution and rampant consumerism mean would-be owners must enter a lottery to be allowed to buy a new car and face punitive registration costs, which can easily double the basic price.

Yet Chinese buyers snapped up about 110,000 British cars last year, another record.","Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/24/590x/rolls-453732.jpg,"['newsletters', 'boom', 'record', 'wouldbe', 'economic', 'chinese', 'factory', 'buyers', 'sales', 'rollsroyce', 'recovery', 'cars', 'car', 'britishmade', 'upmarket', 'evidence', 'bentley']",

Mr Negroni was there with his trusty Nikon D300 to capture the action. The eruption was in the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic chain, about 575 miles south of the capital, Santiago. The chain last saw a major eruption in 1960. As a precaution, the government evacuated 3,500 people from the surrounding area.

It was the latest in a series of volcanic eruptions in Chile in recent years. Chile's Chaiten volcano erupted spectacularly in 2008 for the first time in thousands of years, spewing molten rock and a vast cloud of ash that reached the stratosphere. RELATED ARTICLES Previous

By Mick Krever, CNN

In 2004, Bisi Alimi did an extraordinary thing.

He went on national television and told his fellow Nigerians that he was gay.

Alimi lived in a country not only where open discussion of sex and sexuality is considered déclassé, but where 98% of his fellow citizens now say they do not approve of homosexuality.

“There were so many things we don’t talk about,” Alimi told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. “My career was on the line, I was going to be outed by the media.”

It was better, he decided, to come out of the closet on his own terms.

“I have a responsibility to stand up for the community, to give a face to the community, to demystify the old arguments that there are no homosexuals in Nigeria,” he said.

He became the first Nigerian to declare his homosexuality on television.

In that same year, 2004, Alimi had been diagnosed with HIV. He had been working for years as an activist with the gay community in Nigeria, and was programing director for an HIV-advocacy group.

The world learned this week that Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has signed a new law, the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.

So strict is the law that CNN’s Vladimir Duthiers, reporting from Lagos, told Amanpour that he could even face imprisonment just for interviewing a gay activist.

“I could be thrown in jail for 10 years under this new law,” Duthiers said, as could someone caught distributing condoms for use by homosexuals – that in a country where more than three million people are living with HIV, according to UNAIDS.

The law “makes it illegal for anybody to associate, to aide, to abet, to comingle with anybody who is perceived to be homosexual, to be part of a gay group, to be part of a gay society,” Duthiers said.

A Nigerian man in Lagos told Reuters he was “very glad” Jonathan signed the anti-gay bill.

“It's un-African,” he said. “We don't want such a thing in our country.”

After Alimi so publicly told Nigeria that he was gay, he said, “the conversation got mainstreamed.”

But not necessarily as he would have liked.

The discussion “was more of victimization rather than having an intelligent, adult conversation around these issues,” he said.

“People were not ready to educate themselves. And this created a lot of problems for the LGBT community in Nigeria.”

“I couldn’t get a job, I left university, nobody was going to employ me, my life was constantly in danger, I was always beaten, arrested by the police, discharged.”

He would eventually seek asylum in the UK, where he now lives.

Parliament passed the bill last year, so why did the president sign it now?

“He has been boxed to a corner,” Alimi said, who believes President Jonathan is increasingly politically alienated.

“I know, like so many other Nigerians know, that this is a distraction.”

As for those fellow countrymen, Alimi believes that for many, their intolerant views are bolstered by religion.

“How many Nigerians know…what this law means? Or how many Nigerians have an understanding outside of religion what exactly we talk about when we talk about sexuality?”

“Why then should religion be the basis of putting a law in place in a secular state?”","Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140116204424-aman-bisi-alimi-horizontal-gallery.png,"['nigeria', 'told', 'community', 'alimi', 'gay', 'nigerian', 'tv', 'talk', 'law', 'come', 'president', 'meet', 'nigerians']",

Andrew Cotton is man on a mission - to surf the world's biggest, most challenging and dangerous waves.

His journey has taken him to the four corners of the earth, placing him in terrifying situations, leaving him breathing many a sigh of relief at near misses survived.

But 2014 could be the year the 34-year-old enters the record books, as he waits for official confirmation that a 80ft monster wave he surfed off the coast of Portugal this October is the biggest conquered to date.

Scroll down for video



Part-time pro surfer Andrew Cotton is tipped to take the world record for the biggest wave surfed after riding this monster off the coast of Portugal in October as the powerful St Jude storm rolled across the Atlantic. Experts say the wave could measure 80ft, two feet higher than the current record

Officials are in the process of verifying the size of the wave, but Mr Cotton will have to wait until May before the wave's height is confirmed

As the St Jude storm rolled across the Atlantic in October, the force of nature whipped up mammoth swells out at sea.



And rather than batten down the hatches, pro surfers from across the world congregated on the beaches of Portugal's Praia do Norte.

Among them and eager to get on his board was part-time pro surfer, plumber and lifeguard, father-of-two Mr Cotton.

Facing such gigantic waves requires surfers to enlist a little extra help to line themselves up to ride the huge expanse of water.

And so Mr Cotton was towed by jet ski to catch the wave, he and others hope could be set to break the world record.

Mr Cotton said: 'People have been saying the wave I caught in October in Portugal is around 80ft.'

The current world record for the world's largest wave ever surfed stands at 78ft.

The 34-year-old part-time pro surfer, plumber and life-guard, said while it would be great to hold the world record it is not why he goes out on his board. He said: 'I love being in the water and my dream is to become a full-time professional big wave surfer. By pushing myself to catch and ride bigger and bigger waves I will hopefully achieve that dream'

The self-employed plumber chose to be his own boss to allow him to head off around the world to chase gigantic waves, at short notice. In October as reports of the St Jude storm broke, he joined professional surfers from across the world in Praia do Norte in Portugal where he caught this monstrous wave

Towing Mr Cotton in to catch this potentially world record breaking wave, is his close friend and pro big wave surfer Garrett McNamara, who currently holds the record having conquered a 78ft wall of water

And it is a record Mr Cotton is not unfamiliar with. T he surfer currently in possession of the title record breaker is Cotton's close friend and surfing partner in crime, Mr McNamara.



When the Hawaii-born pro surfer gained his title it was Mr Cotton who towed him in to catch his record-breaking wave.



And the favour was returned when Mr McNamara jumped on the jet ski in October, lining Cotton up to take on the wave, which is tipped to steal the record from under his board.

Officials are currently in the process of verifying the height of the wave Mr Cotton rode, but the 34-year-old will have to wait until May next year for confirmation.

But he says while a world record to his name would be nice, it is not what motivates him to get on his board and travel across the world, often at short notice, chasing gigantic waves.

'I love to push myself,' he told MailOnline in an exclusive interview.

'I love being in the water and my dream is to become a full-time professional big wave surfer.

Mr Cotton is on a mission to try and conquer the world's biggest waves. His ultimate aim is to become a full-time professional surfer

Describing the feeling of conquering a wave measuring 80ft, Mr Cotton, pictured here surfing at home in Devon, said: 'You do get an adrenalin rush, but it depends on the style of the wave as to when the rush hits home. Sometimes it will be while you are riding the wave but other times it is when you are safe and back on dry land'

Relaxing at home in North Devon, the father-of-two has been obsessed with the sea since he was a young boy



Mr Cotton started surfing when he was around seven years old. His father Bob, a retired policeman, encouraged him on to his first board when the family moved to north Devon

'By pushing myself to catch and ride bigger and bigger waves I will hopefully achieve that dream. A world record can't hurt though, it's the kind of thing that can really open doors.'

'It is cool to think I could have a world record, but it is just as cool to say I helped Garrett get his. It would be awesome to think he helped me get mine too,' he added.



'The ideal would be for me to get the record and the pair of us to keep beating each other by going bigger and bigger, pushing ourselves further.'

Describing how it feels to ride a near 80ft wave, the father-of-two, said: ' This is something I have always wanted to do. It is what I have been pushing myself towards.

'It is scary, but at the same time it feels like the most natural thing for me to do.

'You do get an adrenalin rush, but it depends on the type of the wave as to when the rush hits home. Sometimes it will be while you are riding the wave but other times it is when you are safe and back on dry land.'

Reaching speeds of up to 40mph, Mr Cotton said every bump in the water feels 'hugely magnified'.

'It feels like you are going really fast, but I felt at times like I was watching the ride in slow motion, feeling every bump in the wave.

'At such fast speeds you really have to think about everything that you are doing, every movement.

'Just staying on the board is half the battle, it can be really hard.

'While the waves look really clean from the shore, when you are up there and riding it, any bump at 40mph feels hugely magnified.'





'They are my inspiration': Father-of-two is driven to chase his dream supported by his 'amazing' wife and kids

As a seven-year-old Mr Cotton's father introduced him to surfing when the family moved to north Devon

Working in a surf factory kick-started his dream, taking him to Indonesia and South America to chase waves

When reality bit the then 25-year-old trained as a plumber giving him the chance to be his own boss

'Katie is amazing' says Mr Cotton, who describes his wife as his 'rock' allowing him to reach for his goal



Mr Cotton hails from the village of Croyde near Braunton in north Devon.

And it is on the shores of the Devonshire coast that he rode his first wave at the age of seven, encouraged by his parents former classroom assistant Christine and retired policeman Bob.



'I was really into swimming, having quite bad asthma doctors told my mum swimming could really help,' he said.

'When we moved to north Devon I was about seven and it was my parents who got me into surfing.

The 34-year-old said six-year-old Honey has taken to surfing, loving being in the water like her dad. He said he would never push his children to follow in his footsteps but wants them to be comfortable in the sea



'I haven't looked back, I have loved it since the very beginning and since I first got on a board I have wanted to become a pro surfer.

'At school a lot of teachers said if I had spent more time on my school work and less time surfing I might do really well.

'Being a pro surfer was all I could think about but I wasn't quite good enough to do the contest side of things. At that point, when I left school at about 15, my master plan was to work in the surf industry to enable me to mix surfing with work.

'My first job was in a surf board factory - it was great.



'I am the luckiest man alive to have such an understanding wife and two great kids. They have not just put up with me, they have supported me when I wanted to dash off at short notice. Katie is amazing' Andrew Cotton

'The factory shut in January, February and March and we spent that time travelling across the world. We went anywhere where the waves were, Indonesia, Peru, Hawaii, Chile, every time it was somewhere different.

'I was very lucky, at the age of 16 I got a taste of what life was like living as a pro surfer.'

But when Mr Cotton reached the age of 25, the realisation hit him that he had to look for a proper job.

And so he took evening classes, training to become a plumber.

'My parents were worried I would not be employable if I carried on as I was,' he added.



'And so I quit the surf factory and when I finished the college course I got a job working for a company that installed solar panels and under floor heating.

'Around the same time I got my first sponsorship deal from the US company Analogue. It was a bit of recognition and a bit of money.'

Mr Cotton worked for about a year full-time before quitting.

'It was a bit of a bone of contention with my family,' he admitted. 'But it was 8am to 5pm and I hated it.

'I started trying to carve myself a career in surfing, following my dream properly for the first time.

One-and-a-half-year-old Ace, left, is still a bit young to be jumping on a surf board with his big sister Honey, pictured with Mr Cotton right. Mr Cotton said Ace is still a bit unsure of the water, and doesn't like the cold. He said his children and wife Katie are a big inspiration to him, supporting him unconditionally as he chases his dream



'I started working as a self-employed plumber with a bit of life-guarding in the summer. It meant I could spend as much time as possible in the water, I can be flexible, going off to chase a wave at the last minute.'

After the exotics travels of his youth, Mr Cotton said he tends to stray no further than the seas of Europe these days, constrained by cost and time and his desire not to travel too far from the 'loves of his life', his family.

Behind every successful man, there is a great woman so the famous saying goes.

And for Mr Cotton this sentiment holds true.

Set up by their mutual friends on a blind date four years ago, Mr Cotton and his wife Katie, who had lived in the same village for years, instantly hit it off.

The couple, who tied the knot last September, have two children, six-year-old Honey and Ace, who is one-and-a-half.



And Honey is following in the paddle strokes of her father, loving the water and enjoying learning to surf.

But her little brother Ace, is not a fan of the cold water.

Mr Cotton said: 'I will never push the kids to surf if they don't like it. The most important thing for me, as a life-guard but also as their dad, is that they are comfortable and not afraid of the water.



'My dad made sure that I was comfortable being in the sea and that is all I can hope for, for my kids.'

Aside from his family, Mr Cotton said friends and pro surfers Garrett McNamara, left, and Al Mennie, right, have inspired him to chase his dream to become a professional



Pinpointing his inspiration, Mr Cotton said it 'goes without saying' that his wife and children top the list.

But he added there have been a handful of people, surfers and friends, who have inspired him to chase his dream.

'There are people you feed off, people I have been surfing with for years.

'Big wave surfer Al Mennie was a real inspiration in the beginning, he was a real motivator for me. He always told me anything was possible, at times when perhaps I would have given up, it was Al's encouragement that kept me going.



'It was his advice to stick with plumbing and he was the one who really pushed me.



'And Garrett is another inspiration for me. Over the last couple of years seeing how he does things and the opportunity to team up with him has been invaluable.

'But I am the luckiest man alive to have such an understanding wife and two great kids. They have not just put up with me, they have supported me when I wanted to dash off at short notice. Katie is amazing, she is my rock.'","Sun, 12 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/18/article-2525102-1A2E775F00000578-313_636x382.jpg,"['andrew', 'cottons', 'waves', 'wife', 'chase', 'mr', 'record', 'pro', 'wave', 'worlds', 'surfer', 'biggest', 'surfing', 'cotton', 'quest', 'world', 'challenging']", 
96,96,FL-2014-000005-IDN,George Galloway's Farcical TV Show Takes Anti-Israel Slander to Unprecedented Level - Algemeiner,https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/01/21/george-galloway%E2%80%99s-farcical-tv-show-takes-anti-israel-slander-to-unprecedented-level/,"George Galloway spent an entire episode of his TV show, Sputnik, vilifying former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the State of Israel. The British MP, who was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003, was joined by two anti-Israel activists who added to the denigration of Sharon’s legacy. While Galloway repeatedly referred to Sharon as the “Butcher of Beirut,” he remained silent on the ongoing carnage in Syria that has claimed more than 100,000 lives, and other grave human rights abuses committed by Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.

His show is broadcast on Russia Today, a television network funded by the Russian government and notable for producing a relentless stream of anti-American and anti-Israeli bulletins. The level of vitriol in this episode however, was unprecedented, even by RT’s standards.

His first guest, anti-Israel activist Jeff Halper, promulgated a theory that Ariel Sharon withdrew from Gaza to make Israel the hegemon in the Middle East. Halper, who supports the anti-Israel BDS, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, stated that Israel cannot be weakened internally but could buckle under external pressure.

His other guest, Gaza based anti-Israel film maker and activist Harry Fear, perversely stated that Palestinians were celebrating Sharon’s passing “because this is the only act of justice that has ever come to Ariel Sharon.” Fear referred to Sharon as a “psychopath” and “butcher” and said that he was “responsible for massacres in Lebanon.” He further added that “in Israel it’s almost like creating blood and terrorizing Palestinians and knocking them into the darkest corners of the earth is success.” He agreed with Galloway that Tony Blair’s eulogy to Ariel Sharon was “hard to bear.” Among other incredulous statements, Fear claimed that Tony Blair is responsible for a million deaths in Iraq.

Fear claimed that the situation for the people of Gaza has gotten worse, placing the blame on Israel and glossing over the brutality, terrorism and economic mismanagement of the territory’s rulers Hamas. Although Israel withdrew from Gaza, Fear claims that the “besiegement continues in broad daylight, against the law, against all morals.”

Galloway described Netanyahu as a “petty and venal figure” and Tony Blair as a “war criminal.” He claimed that he just managed to escape from Lebanon in 1982 from the IDF’s “phosphorus bombs and tanks.” Galloway’s anti-Israel diatribes were supported by his sidekick Gayatri, who also happens to be his wife. She chimed in with libelous claims saying that Israeli dams contributed to flooding in Gaza, and described former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin as a “terrorist leader.” The former allegation had been previously exposed as a falsehood and a spokesman for Israel’s Water Authority confirmed that “no dams even exist in the area.”

Toward the end of the program, Galloway bizarrely claimed that the blue lines on the Israeli flag represent the Israeli ambition to rule from the Nile to the Euphrates. Contrary to this absurd claim, the blue lines derive from the design on the traditional Jewish prayer shawl.","Tue, 21 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/George_Galloway.jpg,"['fear', 'galloways', 'sharon', 'takes', 'level', 'farcical', 'antiisrael', 'israel', 'galloway', 'tv', 'claimed', 'unprecedented', 'tony', 'slander', 'ariel', 'george', 'gaza', 'israeli']",
