0,0,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Indonesian Conservationists Blame Reckless Development for Deadly Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/indonesian-conservationists-blame-reckless-development-deadly-floods,"JAKARTA - Less than a week after Indonesia faced its third round of deadly landslides and flash floods this year, some local environmental advocates are saying the sheer impact of the natural disasters is the result of more than just bad weather.

At least 26 people, including an 8-month-old baby and eight children, were left dead as torrential downpours pounded the vast tropical archipelago on Wednesday. A National Disaster Management Mitigation Agency spokesperson was quick to warn of increasingly heavy rains through January, partly because of La Nina, the opposite of El Nino, which has a general cooling effect.

In the Garut district of West Java, among the hardest hit areas, where 18 people remain missing, Abetnego Tarigan, director of Friends of the Earth Indonesia, the country's largest environmental organization, says man-made factors are also putting lives at risk.

“The function of this catchment area has changed,"" he told VOA's Indonesia Service, describing a natural watershed area that has been subject to commercial development in recent years.

On many Indonesian islands, forested catchment areas naturally absorb rainfall and guide surface runoff toward surrounding river and shoreline areas. But when paved development projects eat up the natural landscape, Tarigan said, the water can't be absorbed as efficiently, exacerbating the impact of floods and landslides.

""It was conservation forestry, so why did it become tourist facilities, where 10 percent of its area are allowed to be developed in concrete?"" he said. ""For sure, all these have influenced the disaster.”

In an archipelago nation where millions of people live in mountainous areas or on flood plains near rivers, landslides and flooding are common. But so long as heavy rains persist amid unchecked development, he said, resulting death tolls are likely to increase.

The primary culprit is what Tarigan calls ""nature parks for tourism,"" a program that pairs private companies with government agencies to build tourism facilities in dedicated conservation areas, sometimes to support commercial interests.

Agung Ganthar Kusumanto, a West Java-based environmental activist, said the entrepreneurs who pair with government agencies to conduct conservation efforts aren't assuming responsibility for the consequences of developing watershed areas.

""Where is the role of Perhutani, in protecting the forestry?"" he said, referring to Perum Perhutani, a state owned enterprise that is tasked with managing national forests in Java and Madura, and oversees some national development directives.

""If we look closer, the protected forestry area has become a vegetable farm,” he said.

Dedy Kurniawan, chairman of Indonesia Conservation Cadre Communication Forum, said development directives can't simply be issued from Jakarta, but must done in concert with provincial officials if the impact of heavy rains is to be kept in check.

“Spatial planning of Garut District area must be in accordance with the policies of the province,"" he said. ""At issue is the infrastructure development and tourism facilities, such as road openings, hotels, etc, that are being built without prioritizing environmental preservation.

""In many cases,"" he added, ""regulations made by the provincial government are not in accordance with the program of district government and the central government institute in charge of such an area.”

If tourism development continues to disregard preservation of the natural environment, he said, officials will have no way to attract tourists in the first place.

In June, heavy rains caused massive destruction when flood waters carried mud and rocks into Central Java province, the most populous region on the island, killing almost 50 people.

In May, 15 students on holiday at a popular tourist spot in western Indonesia were killed when a landslide swept through their campground.","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/21AA7FE6-A909-4765-BB79-EF95B9BF2153.jpg,"['deadly', 'reckless', 'floods', 'development', 'area', 'indonesia', 'heavy', 'environmental', 'natural', 'conservationists', 'blame', 'tourism', 'areas', 'indonesian', 'conservation', 'rains']",

One of the worst-affected areas was the district of Garut, where 16 people died, including five children, seven women and an 8-month-old baby, after Cimanuk and Cikamuri rivers overflowed Tuesday night, reports the Associated Press. Nine people in Garut and Sumedang districts, in West Java province, are still missing.

Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Mitigation Agency, told AP that nearly 1,000 villagers have been evacuated to army barracks and other temporary shelters.

“The floods have receded in several spots,” Sutopo told local media on Wednesday morning. “[But] the situation is quite critical there,” he added.

4,4,FL-2016-000103-IDN,India's Most Flood-prone State Aided by New Satellite Mapping - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/indias-most-flood-prone-state-aided-new-satellite-mapping,"BHUBANESWAR, INDIA - Every year India's northeastern state of Bihar is deluged by floods that submerge roads, destroy homes and wash away crops, leaving the disaster management authority struggling to monitor and assess the damage, and to distribute aid effectively.



But new satellite mapping of flood-prone areas should transform disaster response by equipping authorities with near real-time information about inundated villages, officials said.



Bihar, which borders the Himalayan nation of Nepal, is India's most flood-prone state. More than 70 percent of its total geographical area is at risk of annual floods, which put lives at risk and lead to heavy financial losses.



A major challenge for the Bihar state disaster management authority (BSDMA) has been mapping and monitoring flood-hit areas, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which works to promote development across the Hindu Kush Himalayas.



Since floods started in the state last month, more than 200 people have died and more than 300,000 have been forced from their homes, disaster officials said.



ICOMOD has helped generate innovative flood mapping for 33 districts in Bihar and an online flood information system that is allowing faster response to a crisis, quicker damage assessment, and better risk management than with conventional methods, said officials from ICIMOD, based in Kathmandu.



""Traditionally, field teams are organized and dispatched to flooded areas to map floods. This can be time consuming and operationally difficult during a flooding event,"" Shahriar M. Wahid, a senior ICIMOD hydrologist, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.



While ""satellite-sourced flood maps alone cannot provide early warning to [the] at-risk population"", he said, satellite data, in combination with flood simulations, can do this.



If flash floods triggered by torrential rain occur in Nepal, Bihar's residents can expect to see inundations about eight hours later, according to data from the BSDMA. Wahid said the new flood maps will be most useful for the distribution of relief, assessment of damages and to determine crop insurance payouts, among other benefits.



The project uses satellite technology that penetrates cloud cover, unlike optics-based satellite imagery. This is useful in the Himalayan region where monsoons bring thick clouds.



Flood maps can be generated within five to six hours after raw satellite data is received. The floods are circulated to government officials and relief agencies through a satellite communication network.



Space satellite technology is often touted by disaster relief experts as an important tool in managing the growing number of climate-linked disasters around the world.



But the cost of such technology for developing countries, even fast-growing ones like India, can be a challenge. ICIMOD is able to obtain some satellite data and images at no cost, which it then passes to the government for free, it said.



For many residents of Bihar's capital, Patna, prevention is the first step towards building resilience against floods that are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change.



Satellite maps can also aid prevention because they act as a template for years to come, recording rainfall patterns and data from the water department, among other factors, ICIMOD said.



""The very principles of urban planning in Bihar need a drastic review,"" said social worker Kumar Gaurav.



Planning ""must now take into account global warming, intense and concentrated rainfall along with the construction boom that is responsible for high-rises on the Ganga's riverbed and floodplains,"" he said.","Thu, 29 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/76037311-36EF-4DAC-A21C-623C394122FE.jpg,"['bihar', 'mapping', 'aided', 'floods', 'floodprone', 'state', 'data', 'officials', 'satellite', 'icimod', 'flood', 'maps', 'disaster', 'indias']", 
5,5,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Indonesian slum dwellers challenge eviction law in landmark case - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-landrights-slums-idUSKCN1201QK,"JAKARTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in Indonesia have launched a landmark legal case to challenge a decades-old law which has been used to forcibly remove thousands of families, amid a wave of evictions in the country’s capital.

The case comes as authorities ramp up efforts to clear housing along a main river bank in Jakarta, the sprawling capital of 10 million people, to pave the way for an ambitious flood mitigation project.

Local residents have asked the court to declare a law enacted in 1960 as unconstitutional as it “gives the government a great authority to take the land from the people” without due consultation, court documents show.

“I see more and more people suffering like me. This is wrong, this is inhumane,” said Mansur Daud who was evicted last year from a slum in west Jakarta to make way for the project.

The 54-year-old hawker launched the legal challenge with two others this week, saying they want justice to be upheld.

“There was no dialogue, no compensation. I have to live at my parents’ house now, my children were traumatized by the eviction, where is the justice?” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Friday.

The 1960 law prohibits the use of land without permission from the rightful owner, but land rights advocates argue it has long been invoked in favor of the authorities.

Lawyer Alldo Fellix Januardy said the law unfairly targets slum dwellers and the poor who cannot provide proof of land ownership, due to a legacy of unclear and overlapping land titles, as well as bureaucracy in Indonesia.

However he said this was exacerbated by the fact that the law does not require the government to provide the same proof of title when it is used to evict the residents.

“The problem with land evictions in Indonesia is that nobody has a (land ownership) certificate,” said Januardy, who specializes in land rights cases and represents the slum dwellers.

“If nobody has a certificate, then the court should be the one to decide whose land it is but the government never sends cases to court, they just evict people because of this law.

“If we win the case, every forced eviction must be decided through the court before it happens,” the lawyer added.

The Constitutional Court has yet to fix a date to start hearing the case.

The Jakarta city government has defended its move and vowed to push ahead with the evictions despite criticism.

Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama said the project was necessary to prevent annual floods during monsoon season and alternative housing had been provided to those affected.

According to the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute, which has been helping evicted families, there were 113 forced evictions last year, with each round typically involving many dwellings. A total of 8,145 families and 6,283 small businesses were affected in 2015, the group said.

Another 325 evictions were set to take place this year, the institute said, citing the government’s planning documents.

The latest round of eviction took place on Wednesday, which saw bulldozers demolish a waterfront shanty town in Jakarta. It went without protest but past evictions have sometimes resulted in violence.

In August last year, security forces fired teargas and water cannon after they clashed with residents while clearing a flood-prone area in the capital, with 27 people arrested.","Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['law', 'court', 'legal', 'landmark', 'case', 'evictions', 'families', 'jakarta', 'slum', 'land', 'challenge', 'eviction', 'indonesian', 'dwellers']",

Linkedin Suherdjoko (The Jakarta Post) Semarang, Central Java ● Thu, September 22, 2016

In their effort to prevent losses during unforeseen disasters, 88,492 paddy farmers in Central Java’s northern coastal areas have participated in an agriculture insurance program.

With the insurance, paddy farmers who mostly have only less than 0.5 hectares of farming land can request for payments to cover financial losses suffered from harvest failures caused by natural disasters, plant pests and diseases. They can later use the payment to start working on their paddy fields again.

Sumadi, the marketing manager of state-owned insurance firm PT Jasa Asuransi Indonesia (Jasindo) at the Semarang office, said the farmers had paddy fields amounting to 22,123.59 hectares of land.

“One hectare of paddy field can be worked on by three or four farmers,” he said on Wednesday.

Sumadi further explained that with a crop insurance program, farmers could be protected from losses during times of natural calamities.

The government introduced the paddy farming insurance program in 2015, based on Law No.19/2013 on farmer protection and empowerment, Agriculture Minister Decree (Kepmen) No.40/2015 on paddy farming insurance premium guidelines and Kepmen No.2/2016 on paddy farming program management and implementation methods.

Launched during a rainy season in October 2015, the program aims to cover one million hectares of paddy fields in 16 targeted provinces.

The government has appointed Jasindo, which has five branches in Central Java, as the implementing entity of the program. Those offices are in Purwokerto, Semarang, Surakarta, Tegal and Yogyakarta.

For Central Java, Sumadi said, Jasindo was targeting to cover 150,000 ha of fields. For northern coastal areas, which comprise five regencies, namely Kendal, Magelang, Semarang, Temanggung and Wonosobo, Jasindo targeted 24,000 ha, but only 13,356.64 ha had been realized.

Jasindo also aimed to cover 38,500 ha of fields in seven other northern coastal areas, namely Blora, Demak, Grobogan, Jepara, Kudus, Pati and Rembang. Only 8,766.95 ha had been realized, however, said Sumadi.

Based on existing regulations, each farmer would pay an insurance premium of Rp 180,000 per ha of area. As the government subsidies 80 percent of the premium, farmers would pay only Rp 36,000 per ha per planting season.

With the program, if 75 percent of their crops are damaged due to flooding, the dry season, pests or disease attacks, farmers can request Rp 6 million to cover losses in every hectare of their fields.

“Farming group leaders play key roles to encourage their members to participate in the insurance program. Each member will have to a pay an insurance premium of around only Rp 9,000-Rp 12,000 because his or her land is less than 0.5 ha,” said Sumadi.

He further said Jasindo had paid Rp 133 million to cover losses for Demak, Grobogan and Pati farmers, who suffered harvest failures caused by flooding at the beginning of 2016.

To support the program, the Dutch government has provided software that can process satellite imagery that helps track the extent of damaged paddy fields through its Geodata for Upgrading Small Holders Farming System in Indonesia (G4INDO) project.

“Our targeted group comprises 200,000 small farmers,” said G4INDO project head Aart Schrevel. The project has been piloted in three East Java regencies, namely Jombang, Kediri and Nganjuk, which is known as the national rice producer.

Seven renowned environmental scientists have just published an analysis of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group co-founded by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization to measure and study the climate-change crisis.

Just in the past few years the average global temperature has risen much faster than it did between the 1990s and the early 2000s.

The scientists' analysis, The Truth About Climate Change, released Thursday, says an average temperature increase of just over 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2050 would result in severe climate changes worldwide. In just one effect of global warming, the world's oceans are predicted to rise steadily to calamitous levels that would displace millions of people, in both developed and developing countries.

Scientists say 'Act now!'

Speaking to VOA by telephone, a co-author of the new report, Sir Robert Watson, said governments and the public should understand it will be cheaper to act now, to invest in a low-carbon economy and protect the world climate, than it would be to repair the immense damage that rising sea levels will cause.

Last Zimaniwa feels the broken ground at a spot which is usually a reliable water source that has dried up due to lack of rains in the village of Chivi , Zimbabwe, Jan. 29, 2016.

Watson, a former chair of the IPCC, said climate changes will adversely affect food and water production around the globe and, consequently, degrade human health.

“We need to use our energy more efficiently,"" Watson said, by building ""more efficient houses, more efficient cars, more efficient equipment.

“We need to use more non-fossil fuel energy, renewable energy [and] wind energy, which could be very good in many developing countries,"" he added, ""and we need to get rid of these fossil-fuel subsidies that subsidize fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy.”

Still possible to avert disaster

The most drastic consequences of global warming are possible, but not certain, at this point in the 21st century, according to the study. However, the environmental experts said governments and people must recognize that floods, droughts and storms already have become much more frequent, and how greatly rising seas will endanger coastal areas.

They recommend urgent efforts to make agricultural systems more resistant to climate change and, in general, teach populations how to be less vulnerable to the effects of global warming.

It is the third time major flooding has hit Kemang in just one month’s time, and unless the government takes drastic action, it is likely to happen again and again throughout the rainy season.

Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama seems ready to take that action. During the last bout of flooding in early September, he vowed to tear down all of the building that were encroaching on the Krukut river, the main waterway that runs through Kemang. He has said that the river was once 25 meters in width but that developments have slowly shrunken that figure down to a mere 3 meters, preventing rainwater from being channeled away swiftly.

But Ahok acknowledged that it would be a difficult task from a bureaucratic standpoint. Although an audit showed that many of the river adjacent buildings did not have the proper permits and could thus be legally torn down, other buildings had permits that Ahok suspected were obtained illegally.

This morning, Ahok said that he would make sure that his administration would begin dismantling the buildings along the Krukut river as soon as possible, targeting the operation to begin in October. He said some had advised him that it would be a bad decision to carry out the demolitions so close to the 2017 governor’s election, but he says he has no other options.

“If [the buildings[ don’t have the proper permits, I will dismantle them. I don’t care [about the potential political consequences]. I have to tear them down. There is no other choice,” Ahok said as quoted by Liputan 6.

The governor said that his administration would buy the land from those buildings which did have proper permits. He said that funding the operation might be a problem, so he has asked for contributions from the private sector.

The barrier, originally meant to prevent the city from succumbing to rising sea levels and floods, is made up of 17 artificial islets.

The masterplan, however, now hinges on whether a private developer can resolve concerns over how its part of the project may affect the safety of a nearby power plant. This comes after a government study indicated that the site awarded to Muara Wisesa Samudra (MWS) may block off sea water needed to cool the Muara Karang Power Plant.

It is located at the mouth of Kali Krendang, a river that ends just as the site MWS is developing begins.

The firm, a subsidiary of Indonesian property giant Agung Podomoro Land, now needs to submit a proposal to the government, detailing how it plans to resolve the safety issue.

Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar, who suspended the project in April, said last Friday that the MWS project can resume in a matter of weeks if the firm meets the government's conditions.

These include environmental impact analyses for the project, which ""at a rough estimate, they will be completed within a month"", Ms Siti was quoted as saying in The Jakarta Post last Saturday.

The suspension had threatened to derail Agung Podomoro Land's Pluit City development on the site, but its chief executive Cosmas Batubara said MWS already has a solution for the Muara Karang Power Plant.

He said yesterday that the firm will propose re-engineering the cooling system to ensure that only cool sea water is pumped into the plant to lower its temperature.

The alternative is to build a dedicated canal next to the islet, to prevent inflowing cool water and outflowing warm water from mixing.

GIVE AND TAKE We care about the fishermen's well-being and will not just do anything we wish, but on the other hand fishermen should not think they monopolise the sea. MWS CHIEF EXECUTIVE COSMAS BATUBARA

The ""Giant Sea Wall"" project was first mooted in 1995, during Indonesia's New Order regime under then President Suharto.

This followed studies showing that Jakarta, located on a low flat basin below sea level, was sinking at a rate of up to 20cm a year, especially the northern parts of the city.

Jakarta has been trying to clean up its flagging canal systems for years, and the 24km-long seawall was meant to be the silver bullet to its flooding woes.

The latest version of the project ran into several roadblocks along the way, including disagreements between the central government and Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama over who had the authority to issue development permits.

Besides the power plant cooling issue, local fishermen also complained that land reclamation works, which started in 2014, affected their catch.

A group of fishermen is reportedly planning to file a legal challenge against the decision to resume land reclamation works in the area.

Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan, who officially revived the project last Tuesday, remains optimistic that the endeavour, which could see North Jakarta turn into a vibrant waterfront city, will take off.

He told The Straits Times that the Joko Widodo government has concluded that ""there is no reason not to go ahead with the reclamation"" and plans are in place to help local fishermen continue their trade elsewhere, such as the waters off the Natunas.

""The President's orders include making the fishermen a priority,"" said Mr Luhut. ""The 12,000 fishermen must be better off than they are now.""

Mr Cosmas agreed, adding that besides the environmental concerns and safety of the power plant, his firm is also looking out for the interests of local fishermen.

""We care about the fishermen's well-being and will not just do anything we wish, but on the other hand fishermen should not think they monopolise the sea. Especially within 200m from the coast line, where the sea is polluted, so fishermen should want to travel farther out to fish,"" he said.","Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2016/09/22/ST_20160922_VNJKARTA_2614382.jpg?itok=xGTeJrhy,"['sinking', 'project', 'wall', 'plant', 'giant', 'jakarta', 'power', 'mws', 'firm', 'fishermen', 'land', 'sea', 'hits', 'water', 'snag', 'save']",

Asia Pulp & Paper, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper producers, claims to have made a remarkable turnaround on sustainability. The company, owned by Indonesia’s Widjaja family, has a legacy of forest destruction, conflicts with hundreds of local communities, and an historic US$13.9 billion default on its corporate debt, the largest in emerging markets history.

Though the damage from that legacy persists, today APP receives a lot of positive attention for championing sustainability issues. Even the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) says it may re-engage with the company. FSC previously disassociated with the paper firm in October 2007 for “destructive forestry practices,"" and a re-engagement would signal to conscientious commercial buyers that it may be okay to do business again with APP.

Recently, TriplePundit published six pieces written by Leon Kaye that highlight APP’s sustainability initiatives for its operations in China and restoration efforts in Indonesia. Indeed, since adopting its current sustainability policy in 2013, APP has deftly promoted itself as an environmentally responsible business. But it has done so in a manner that conveniently overlooks the fact that the company is again expanding its operational footprint in ways that are fundamentally unsustainable.

The company is building one of the world’s largest pulp and paper mills through its subsidiary PT OKI Pulp & Paper Mills in Indonesia’s South Sumatra province. And even before the mill starts production trials as early as October, the US$3 billion project has already caused considerable environmental degradation and social disruption, and there are compelling reasons to believe it will continue to do so for decades to come.

Significantly, APP is building the OKI mill without first establishing a sustainable wood supply. The new mill will depend on fiber supplied from acacia plantations predominantly developed on drained peatlands, which pose significant environmental impacts and financial risks, according to a report released by 12 international and Indonesian NGOs in April 2016.

When peatlands are drained for industrial plantations, they start subsiding and release tremendous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. As is already happening on other pulpwood and oil palm plantations in Sumatra, the soil subsidence makes these areas increasingly prone to frequent and prolonged flooding, impacting productivity. Eventually, such areas become unviable for drainage-based commercial forestry such as Acacia plantations; and prolonged flooding may also impede any other commercial forestry or agricultural land-use, according to the findings of a Wetlands International report.

Catastrophic fires on drained peatlands

While the degraded peatlands are subsiding to drainage limits, they can easily catch fire and burn for long periods of time deep into the organic soil. This is what happened in 2015 when terrible fires blazed across Indonesia’s forests and peatlands , part of the fall out from developing one quarter, or 3.2 million hectares, of peat areas in Sumatra and Kalimantan for industrial plantations (pulpwood, oil palm, and rubber) since 1990.

The resulting haze caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia and neighboring Singapore and Malayasia, according to one recent estimate. The government of Indonesia said only 19 people died while acknowledging that at least 43 million Indonesians were exposed. The World Bank tallied economic losses in Indonesia from the fire and haze to exceed $16 billion, without taking into account economic losses in neighbouring countries. And the fires were similarly catastrophic for global carbon emissions levels. On the worst days the fires and haze emitted more carbon than the entire U.S. economy, and as an annual contributor topped Japan and Germany’s overall emissions.

Remarkably, over a third of all the high-confidence hotspots on the island of Sumatra occurred in four APP supplier plantations in South Sumatra that have been developed to supply the new mill. Each of those four concessions is at least 70 percent covered by peatlands. One concession, Bumi Mekar Hijau, was recently found guilty of causing fires in 2014 and faces a $6 million fine; the Indonesian government has not yet begun to prosecute cases related to the 2015 fires, which were much worse.

For APP, the threat of fines and culpability is on top of the extensive damage to its pulpwood base. A coalition of Indonesian civil society organizations estimated that the 2015 fires burned over 293,000 hectares within plantation concessions in South Sumatra affiliated with APP, including 86,000 hectares of planted Acacia -- or 26 percent of the group’s total planted area in the province. (To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the company has still not released its own estimates of the damage.)

In early 2016 APP announced that it will spend US$20 million on firefighting systems, and it has been implementing a program for responsible peatlands management. These remedial efforts are “too little, too late” when looked at next to the company’s expansion of pulpwood concessions on peat since 2000.

Indeed, APP has taken these actions well after the company and its affiliates cleared and drained hundreds of thousands of hectares of natural peat swamp forests, depleting biodiversity and effectively creating the incendiary conditions which allowed these areas to burn so intensely in the first place. Moreover, APP has done so just as it is putting the finishing touches on what may ultimately become the world’s largest pulp mill, a facility that will exert tremendous pressure on South Sumatra’s peatlands for many decades to come.

This disaster is not likely to end anytime soon. The authors anticipate that APP will have to find new areas for pulpwood plantations when its current plantations on peatlands become unviable. The wood supply gap can be expected to grow as a result of the peat soil subsidence and related flooding, which is likely to reduce productivity over time. Options to address these issues involve the large-scale rewetting of peatlands by stopping drainage and using alternative species that can grow on such rewetted peatlands.

APP is already trying out restoration and alternative species models, which is a positive step forward. If successful, however, these measures will probably result in lower productivity on pulpwood plantations, and, in turn, increase the pressure to expand the total plantation area. Much of this plantation expansion can be expected to occur, again, on environmentally sensitive peatlands and on lands that are claimed and managed by local communities, including indigenous peoples.

This unfortunate cycle of peatlands degradation and plantation expansion will be the way Indonesia’s peatlands are lost and global carbon emission levels continue to escalate. So when Leon Kaye writes a series of six pieces for Triple Pundit on APP’s sustainability and does not detail the real and anticipated impacts of the OKI mill (or even mention the project), he seems to miss the bigger picture in which APP’s sustainability campaign is situated.

Why is this dangerous?

A promising movement to make the private sector more sustainable is one of the world’s great hopes to curbing deforestation and global warming. The corporate sustainability community, which Triple Pundit serves, is doing remarkable things that encourage companies to adapt to more sustainable business models.

But there’s a big risk when a company’s reputation improves a lot faster than its actual behavior merits. PR campaigns are easier and faster to orchestrate than field activities are to implement, so this is an understandable, though dangerous, situation.

In the case of APP, the enthusiasm generated from its corporate sustainability initiatives has distracted from sober reflection about the group’s expansion plans. And so three years into its sustainability campaign, the OKI mill is about to expand APP’s wood demand in Indonesia by nearly 75 percent; the company has only resolved a handful of the hundreds of land conflicts it has with local communities; and two thirds of its plantation areas remain on high carbon peatlands and are not sustainable in the long term.

The speed and scale of the OKI mill expansion signals to the authors that APP’s sustainability campaign may have helped the company to resuscitate its image, but it has not changed the underlying business calculus driving the company’s operations. But what will happen when the demands of business diverge from sustainable best practices? How will the company react, for example, when the sustainability policy makes it hard to find enough low-cost fiber to “feed” its three mega-scale pulp mills in Indonesia?

And though the company claims it will prioritize its sustainability commitments, the OKI mill project involves a capital investment of US$3 billion in high-tech machinery and port infrastructure, much of which has been financed by loans from the China Development Bank. By contrast, APP’s Forest Conservation Policy is a set of stated intentions and targets. When the company’s loan payments come due, which will prove more durable?

Flanagan says there were no secret deals with corporations

Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan has said he does not believe the European Commission respected the fact that Irish tax laws were a matter of national competence in relation to its ruling on Apple and its tax affairs in Ireland.

Speaking in New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Flanagan said he did not believe the commission was ""a judicial forum"".

He said he welcomed a judicial review of the decision and said categorically that Ireland had ""no secret tax deals, or tax deals with individuals or corporations"".

While it was important that ""everybody pays their fair share"", he said the commission did not ""appear to have respected the fact that tax laws were a matter of national competence, a matter for our own sovereign State, a matter for our own jurisdiction"".

Ross defends Olympic ticket investigation

Minister for Sport Shane Ross has defended the choice of a non-statutory investigation into the controversy over alleged mis-selling of Rio Olympics tickets that had been allocated to the Olympic Council of Ireland.

Following a meeting with Attorney General Máire Whelan, Mr Ross last month announced the inquiry, to be chaired by a retired judge.

Speaking at an Oireachtas committee today, Mr Ross rejected criticism that the investigation would be toothless; saying a non-statutory investigation was chosen for reasons of cost and time.

He also told members that the three main parties expected to give evidence had all volunteered to give evidence and produce any papers required.

He added that the judge leading the investigation had the option to come back and seek a statutory investigation, if he deemed it unsatisfactory.

From mid-September to late October, fashion floods every corner of the globe through the Fashion Weeks in different cities. These global storefronts tend to attract attention though their bold bets, impossible costumes, uncomfortable materials…

Is it possible to draw attention from the simplicity? Could a modest style unseat Alexander McQueen, Phillip Treacy or John Galliano boldness?

That’s just what happened during the latest edition of New York Fashion Week. The hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women, was presented to the fashion world as more than a religious garment.

“Being upset about hijab is like being upset with Grace Kelly for wearing her iconic scarves when she used to go out.”

It seems that designer Anniesa Hasibuan has not ignored a market of over 200$ billion. The Indonesian designer has become a pioneer by introducing the hijab for the first time to New York Fashion Week. Her chiffon fabric designs, rich color varieties and necklaces shone on the fashion show and were among the most admired pieces.

Anniesa Hasibuan has not been the first to democratize the “hijab style”: Japanese retailer Uniqlo, launched a line of hijabs and skirts and tunics earlier this year. Fashion companies like Dolce & Gabbana and H&M have also committed to opening up to the Muslim market that will move over than 500$ billion dollars annually by 2019.

Thinking of Islamic fashion should not be limited to imagining long robes and unattractive women’s headscarves. Quite the opposite. There’s a world to discover. It just needs a look at Pinterest to see that there aren’t just a few Muslim women who have sense of fashion. Moreover, there are many bloggers and YouTubers who insist: “We must stop seeing the Muslim woman as a submissive stereotype for not being ‘sensual’ from the Western point of view.”

In an interview with The Worldfolio, Ms. Alia Khan, Founder & Chairwoman of the Islamic Fashion and Design Council (Dubai, UAE) comments that “being upset about hijab is like being upset with Grace Kelly for wearing her iconic scarves when she used to go out.”

Indonesian designer Anniesa Hasibuan has opened the door of the big “hijab style” parades. It is not unusual that Indonesia, with more than 85% of its population following Islam’s doctrines, is considered by many as the capital of Islamic fashion. And it is no surprise that Jakarta Fashion Week will run its eighth edition this October.

Will we see more hijabs at Milan Fashion Week or London Fashion Week?

Will we be able to overcome stereotypes against Islamic clothing?","Wed, 21 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.theworldfolio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/islamic-fashion.jpg,"['fashion', 'hijab', 'upset', 'week', 'world', 'islamic', 'muslim', 'women', 'burkini', 'style', 'hasibuan']",

The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Beale Air Force Base on a training mission around 9am, military officials said yesterday.

They did not release the pilots' names or any information about the condition of the surviving airman.

The aircraft, assigned to the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, crashed in the Sutter Buttes, a mountain range about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Sacramento.

The U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" is a surveillance and reconnaissance plane capable of flying above 70,000 feet (21,336 meters), an extremely high altitude that's twice as high as a typical commercial airliner flies.

The U-2 is known as one of the most difficult aircraft to fly at low altitudes due to the characteristics that allow it to travel near space, according to an Air Force fact sheet.

Beale Air Force Base is home to the Air Force's fleet of single-seat U-2s and a double-seat variant used for training pilots to fly the specialized aircraft.

It also is the base for the T-38 Talon, a training aircraft, and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance drone. It houses 4,500 military personnel.

""We are saddened by our Airman's death & offer condolences

to the family & all who are mourning this tremendous loss,"" Gen. Dave Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, said on Twitter.

Ejection seats allow military pilots to get out of a stricken plane and parachute safely to the ground.

After the death in this instance, military investigators will look into whether the chute properly deployed and whether the pilot hit debris after ejecting, said Michael Barr, an aviation safety instructor at University of Southern California who flew fighter missions in Vietnam.

The recently concluded 28th and 29th ASEAN Summits in Vientiane, Laos again saw ASEAN give a muted response to the more contentious issues facing member states. This is largely a result of conflicting national interests between members in the absence of a cohesive framework to deal with such issues.

To date, ASEAN’s responses — or lack thereof — to regional disputes has relayed an impression of indecision and dysfunctionality to the international audience. But, to its credit, the regional body has worked cohesively to effectively resolve other challenges such as managing responses to natural disasters. This cooperation — in the typical ASEAN fashion of decision by consensus — has taken many years of discussion (and several devastating natural disasters) to materialise.

The majority of ASEAN states are located in geographic areas at high risk of natural disasters. Examples prevalent in the Southeast Asian region include floods, tropical cyclones, forest fires, and the occasional tsunami. A number of ASEAN states — particularly Indonesia and the Philippines —also reside geographically in the ‘Pacific ring of fire’, an unstable and volatile seismic area known for major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

When the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami hit Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, other ASEAN member states were reluctant to assist in rescue operations due to traditional apprehensions regarding state borders, military intervention and humanitarian aid.

After witnessing the consequences of their indecision — destroyed communities and fractured families — ASEAN nations learnt their lesson. In 2005, the United Nations’ World Conference on Disaster Reduction helped to create a framework for appropriate disaster relief response through the Hyogo Framework of Action. This then prompted ASEAN to initiate its own legal framework for a united and coordinated response to natural disasters. The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) was signed by all members of ASEAN in 2005 and came into force in 2009.

In 2008, in the wake of Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar and killed at least 130,000 people, ASEAN set up an Emergency Rapid Assessment Team (ASEAN-ERAT) that assesses disasters and recommends the appropriate course of relief actions — such as water and sanitation, food, health, logistics and coordination of relief units. ASEAN-ERAT also serves to harmonise disaster relief operations by reducing confusion and delays and optimising assets and manpower deployment.

ASEAN-ERAT is now managed by the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre). The AHA Centre itself was formed in 2011 and is governed by the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management. It even has its own strategic vision: ‘One ASEAN, One Response’.

ASEAN-ERAT also serves as the liaison between ASEAN and non-ASEAN countries involved in disaster relief in the region. Today, the ASEAN-ERAT team has 91 members from a spread of ASEAN states that are trained to respond to regional natural disasters. Since its formation, ASEAN-ERAT has been deployed on 10 operations, including the Haiyan and Rammasun typhoons and the Bohol earthquake, all of which hit the Philippines.

ASEAN has established standby arrangements through which members voluntarily offer civilian and military assets, logistic support, and supplies that can be immediately mobilised for relief operations. ASEAN has also introduced standard operating procedures that ensure smooth coordination and execution of emergency operations by the multitude of ASEAN agencies that have very different languages and work cultures.

The AHA Centre runs the ASEAN Disaster Information Network (ADInet), which provides an up-to-date database of all natural disasters reported in the region. This database is used by the AHA Centre’s Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS) for analysis and disaster alerts and freely shared between member states. The AHA Centre also conducts regular executive courses and joint civilian and military training on disaster management for ASEAN members.

To further prepare for natural disaster relief operations, ASEAN has run annual disaster simulation exercises since the signing of the AADMER in 2005. These exercises test the readiness of ASEAN disaster management and emergency relief agencies, its cohesiveness and its ability to collaborate closely with other UN agencies, non-government organisations and military units.

ASEAN’s recent cooperation in the midst of natural disasters serves as a strong confidence building initiative. It is one of the few key areas in which ASEAN members can work closely with each other regardless of other strategic challenges or conflicting geopolitical interests. This bodes well for the future of ASEAN and shows that it can act cohesively and decisively in its own distinctive way to address issues that might otherwise threaten to divide one of the world’s more important regional organisations.

28,28,FL-2016-000103-IDN,What is a debris flow? - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2016-09-debris.html,"Landslides constitute one of the most destructive geological hazards in the world today. One of the main reasons for this is because of the high speeds that slides can reach, up to 160 km/hour (100 mph). Another is the fact that these slides can carry quite a bit of debris with them that serve to amplify their destructive force.

Taken together, this is what is known as a Debris Flow, a natural hazard that can take place in many parts of the world. A single flow is capable of burying entire towns and communities, covering roads, causing death and injury, destroying property and bringing all transportation to a halt. So how do we deal with them?

Definition:

A Debris Flow is basically a fast-moving landslide made up of liquefied, unconsolidated, and saturated mass that resembles flowing concrete. In this respect, they are not dissimilar from avalanches, where unconsolidated ice and snow cascades down the surface of a mountain, carrying trees and rocks with it.

A common misconception is to confuse debris flows with landslides or mudflows. In truth, they differ in that landslides are made up of a coherent block of material that slides over surfaces. Debris flows, by contrast, are made up of ""loose"" particles that move independently within the flow.

Similarly, mud flows are composed of mud and water, whereas debris flows are made up larger particles. All told, it has been estimated that at least 50% of the particles contained within a debris flow are made-up of sand-sized or larger particles (i.e. rocks, trees, etc).

Types of Flows:

There are two types of debris flows, known as Lahar and Jökulhlaup. The word Lahar is Indonesian in origin and has to do with flows that are related to volcanic activity. A variety of factors may trigger a lahar, including melting of glacial ice due to volcanic activity, intense rainfall on loose pyroclastic material, or the outbursting of a lake that was previously dammed by pyroclastic or glacial material.

Jökulhlaup is an Icelandic word which describes flows that originated from a glacial outburst flood. In Iceland, many such floods are triggered by sub-glacial volcanic eruptions, since Iceland sits atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Elsewhere, a more common cause of jökulhlaups is the breaching of ice-dammed or moraine-dammed lakes.

Such breaching events are often caused by the sudden calving of glacier ice into a lake, which then causes a displacement wave to breach a moraine or ice dam. Downvalley of the breach point, a jökulhlaup may increase greatly in size by picking up sediment and water from the valley through which it travels.

Causes of Flows:

Debris flows can be triggered in a number of ways. Typically, they result from sudden rainfall, where water begins to wash material from a slope, or when water removed material from a freshly burned stretch of land. A rapid snowmelt can also be a cause, where newly-melted snow water is channeled over a steep valley filled with debris that is loose enough to be mobilized.

In either case, the rapidly moving water cascades down the slopes and into the canyons and valleys below, picking up speed and debris as it descends the valley walls. In the valley itself, months' worth of built-up soil and rocks can be picked up and then begin to move with the water.

As the system gradually picks up speed, a feedback loop ensues, where the faster the water flows, the more it can pick up. In time, this wall begins to resemble concrete in appearance but can move so rapidly that it can pluck boulders from the floors of the canyons and hurl them along the path of the flow. It's the speed and enormity of these carried particulates that makes a debris flow so dangerous.

Another major cause of debris flows is the erosion of steams and riverbanks. As flowing water gradually causes the banks to collapse, the erosion can cut into thick deposits of saturated materials stacked up against the valley walls. This erosion removes support from the base of the slope and can trigger a sudden flow of debris.

In some cases, debris flows originate from older landslides. These can take the form of unstable masses perched atop a steep slope. After being lubricated by a flow of water over the top of the old landslide, the slide material or erosion at the base can remove support and trigger a flow.

Some debris flows occur as a result of wildfires or deforestation, where vegetation is burned or stripped from a steep slope. Prior to this, the vegetation's roots anchored the soil and removed absorbed water. The loss of this support leads to the accumulation of moisture which can result in structural failure, followed by a flow.

A volcanic eruption can flash melt large amounts of snow and ice on the flanks of a volcano. This sudden rush of water can pick up ash and pyroclastic debris as it flows down the steep volcano and carry them rapidly downstream for great distances.

In the 1877 eruption of Cotopaxi Volcano in Ecuador, debris flows traveled over 300 kilometers down a valley at an average speed of about 27 kilometers per hour. Debris flows are one of the deadly ""surprise attacks"" of volcanoes.

Prevention Methods:

Many methods have been employed for stopping or diverting debris flows in the past. A popular method is to construct debris basins, which are designed to ""catch"" a flow in a depressed and walled area. These are specifically intended to protect soil and water sources from contamination and prevent downstream damage.

Some basins are constructed with special overflow ducts and screens, which allow the water to trickle out from the flow while keeping the debris in place, while also allowing for more room for larger objects. However, such basins are expensive, and require considerable labor to build and maintain; hence why they are considered an option of last resort.

Currently, there is no way to monitor for the possibility of debris flow, since they can occur very rapidly and are often dependent on cycles in the weather that can be unpredictable. However, early warning systems are being developed for use in areas where debris flow risk is especially high.

One method involves early detection, where sensitive seismographs detect debris flows that have already started moving and alert local communities. Another way is to study weather patterns using radar imaging to make precipitation estimates – using rainfall intensity and duration values to establish a threshold of when and where a flows might occur.

In addition, replanting forests on hillsides to anchor the soil, as well as monitoring hilly areas that have recently suffered from wildfires is a good preventative measure. Identifying areas where debris flows have happened in the past, or where the proper conditions are present, is also a viable means of developing a debris flow mitigation plan.

There is a trio of colourful, slightly evil looking cats hanging on the wall above my bed. They are painted in a traditional Indonesian art technique called batik.

They remind me of the time I got scammed.

Yogyakarta is probably Indonesia's second-most popular tourist spot, after Bali. It's an ancient city, surrounded by temples.

DWI OBLO Batik is a traditional Indonesian fabric dying technique.

A colleague and I were there for work, and had some free time up our sleeves. We looked up the city's main attractions and found Jalan Malioboro, a 24-hour shopping street.

Not wanting to waste a second, we jumped in a taxi, and soon found ourselves in a souvenir paradise, with mountains of t-shirts, jewellery and handicrafts.

DWI OBLO Women wait for customers at batik stalls.

My friend wanted to buy some batik, which Yogyakarta is famous for. We ventured down one of the narrow alleys, getting lost in a swirl of colourful fabrics.

Within minutes, we were approached by a man with a broad grin who wanted to know where we were from.

He clapped delightedly. ""All Blacks, very good!""

The nice man asked if we were looking for batik, and offered to show us the best stalls. Hot, tired, and overwhelmed, we decided to follow him.

He chatted non-stop as we wove through the market, pointing out the different qualities of fabric, and dismissing most of them as ""too expensive"".

""My friend is an artist, he receives money from government to teach batik,"" he told us.

""Come visit his gallery. I would like you to see real batik.""

We hesitated for a moment, before agreeing. After all, it was a tourist area. He was probably a well-meaning tour guide, giving us a cultural experience.

We left the bustling market and followed him through dusty backstreets, stopping at an unmarked shack. The artist was waiting outside.

As promised, we were shown the wax and dye used to create batik. The artist held the fabric up to the light so we could admire the effect. We oohed and aahed and nodded politely.

Our tour guide brought over some ice-cold water bottles. ""Free of charge,"" he said.

He also gave us a list of prices from A to Z, each corresponding with an artwork on display. He encouraged us to look around - ""slowly, slowly. Take your time.""

My friend and I felt we had better buy something. The cats caught my eye, and didn't seem too expensive - maybe $30? It's hard to tell when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of rupiah.

The artist said I could buy another one for half price. ""Present for your mother,"" he suggested.

I didn't have enough cash on me. No problem, our tour guide said. ""I take you to cash machine.""

Once again, I followed him. It was a couple of blocks away. I got out the money, and we returned to the gallery, where my friend was waiting anxiously.

It wasn't until I was handing over the wads of cash that alarm bells started ringing.

Later, when I did the conversion, I realised I had spent more than $100. By Indonesian standards, that's an obscene amount of money.

Back at the hotel, I looked up Jalan Malioboro again. ""Beware of batik scam"", one of the first posts said. Our experience was textbook. The batik we bought were more than likely screen-printed fakes, worthless pieces of cloth.

The main lessons I learned? They're painfully obvious, but in the heat of the moment, it can be easy to forget.

Always do your research. Be skeptical if someone is too helpful to be true. And know the damn currency conversion.

I know you're judging me. Don't worry, the cats on my wall are, too.

No, the cause isn’t sea-level rise, at least not this time. It’s a little-known but enormous industry called sand mining, which every year sucks up billions of tons of sand from beaches, ocean floors, and rivers to make everything from concrete to microchips to toothpaste.

In the process, conservationists warn, the sand mining industry is damaging ecosystems, changing coastal water flows, and making beaches and communities less resilient to storm surges and floods as climate change accelerates.

“Sand is actually the second-most-used natural resource on Earth, behind water,” said Claire Le Guern Lytle, general director of the Santa Aguila Foundation, which was founded in 2009 to focus on coastal preservation. “It’s a finite resource, and it’s depleting very quickly, but nobody thinks about it.”

“No one ever thought we’d run out of sand,” said Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It’s a devastating problem, but nobody in the U.S. has a concept of it because we go to the beach and see this big wide expanse of sand.” The problem is worse, he said, in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. “They’re basically just sucking the sand up, taking entire coastlines and islands away.”

Most of the extracted coastal sand is used to make concrete and glass, the staples of the construction industry. “The numbers are staggering,” Le Guern Lytle said. “An average-size house requires 200 tons of sand. A hospital requires 3,000 tons. Every kilometer of highway requires 30,000 tons.”

A 2014 report from the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that the construction industry consumed 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tons of sand in 2012. The numbers are based not on reports of extraction—those reports don’t exist—but on how much concrete was used around the world that year. The U.N. called extraction rates “unsustainable” and noted that the rate of sand mining far exceeds the ability of natural systems to replenish themselves.

The problem is only going to get worse. As the human population grows, the construction industry is rushing to fill the need for housing, roads, hospitals, and other structures. As a result, the use of sand has soared. China’s construction industry has grown so large that it used more concrete between 2011 and 2013 than the United States did during the entire 20th century.

China is hardly alone. A recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that the global construction industry will grow 85 percent between now and 2030. China, the U.S., and India, the report found, will account for 57 percent of that growth. Meanwhile, the U.N.’s World Urbanization Prospects report predicts that the cities will add 2.5 billion residents by 2050, requiring the construction of a lot of new buildings.

It’s not just construction. “Sand is in everything we do,” Le Guern Lytle said. It’s used in products ranging from microchips to tires. The natural gas industry also relies on sand as part of the fracking extraction process. “Sand is used in many, many, many ways that are unknown to most,” she said.

Some of the sand comes directly from the beach, which can damage habitats for sea turtles and birds, but much of it is dredged up off the seafloor by large ships. Le Guern Lytle said that destroys critical breeding habitats for fish and other marine life. “Extracting sand from the sea bottom just dissolves that ecosystem,” she said.

Although much of the industry is legal, sand mining has become so lucrative that illegal activities are rife. Numerous reports out of India carry news of murders and other crimes carried out by “sand mafias” during the course of illegal sand mining activities. Other countries with recent reports of illegal sand mining include Namibia, Morocco, Malaysia, and Israel. “Sand mining is as much a human tragedy as it is an environmental tragedy,” Le Guern Lytle said.

Even as many beaches are mined, others need new sand to repair damage from ever more severe storms. Normally that would require trucking in sand from other sites, but that may not always be an option. “Beaches are the most effective natural buffer from waves, storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis,” said Griggs, who also pointed out their economic and cultural importance. “Here in California, almost half of the roughly $45 billion in the coastal economy comes from tourism and recreation.”

A recent warning from the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association noted that coastal communities may need to start exploring new and more expensive ways to shore up their shores, possibly by importing sand from faraway sources or turning glass back into beach-quality sand.

Although there is just one coastal sand mine in the U.S.—a huge, century-old operation near Monterey Bay that is being targeted by the California Coastal Commission for causing too much erosion—other mines are located inland. Wisconsin, for example, has dozens of mines extracting sand for use in fracking. “About 60 percent of all sand that’s used in fracking comes from Wisconsin,” said Bill Davis, director of the Sierra Club’s John Muir Chapter in Madison. “It tends to be a real nightmare for the people that live around the mines.” The mining process, he said, often releases particulate matter into the air that can choke people’s wells and airways. “It can very easily lodge in your lungs,” he said.

Le Guern Lytle said that although the sand mining problem is invisible to most people, she has hope. “The United Nations report in 2014 was a humongous step,” she said. “The greatest progress now is bringing more awareness.”","Wed, 21 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/sand-mining.jpg,"['coastal', 'report', 'mining', 'guern', 'talking', 'lytle', 'industry', 'crisis', 'used', 'construction', 'sand', 'conservation', 'le']",

More than wild 72 dolphins have been caught from the ocean and kept in captivity as part of travelling circuses that perform across Indonesia, according to The Black Fish.

In Semarang, west of Jakarta, crowds pay very little to watch a man command dolphins to do tricks with balls, jump through hoops and perform flips.

A family watched one of the many dolphins held at an Indonesian travelling circus

The dolphins are captured from the wild and trained to do flips and tricks for audiences

After a show is complete, the dolphins are put inside plastic tanks on the back of a truck and driven across bumpy and dusty roads to the next show in another town

At one recent show, audience members took pictures on stage with the dolphins, who are trained to 'pose' for the camera.

When a show is complete, the animals are taken from the plastic pools and put inside plastic tanks on the back of trucks and taken to the next town.

The dolphins are often driven along bumpy roads to their next show, confined to tiny tanks for torturous journeys that can last up to to 30 hours.

Most of the dolphins die early as a result of their poor living conditions and need to be replaced with more from the wild, according to the Jakarta Animal Aid network.

These travelling shows are also known to exhibit animals that are protected species such as orangutans, sun bears, small clawed otters and yellow-crested cockatoos.

Audience members posed for pictures with the dolphins after the show

Besides dolphins, travelling circuses also use a collection of other protected species, such as sun bears (background on tricycle) and cockatoos

Animal rights organisations have condemned these travelling animal circuses and have demanded the animals be rehabilitated and released

Animal rights organisations such as the Jakarta Animal Aid Network and Ric O-Barry's Dolphin Project have long condemned these operations, calling for the rehabilitation and release of the animals.

Ric O-Barry's Dolphin Project said: 'The transportation is so stressful for the animals that many of the dolphins die due to this stress and lack of proper care.'

There are three circuses (Wersut Seguni Indonesia, Taman Safari Indonesia, and Ancol) that continue to operate across the main island of Java.

Animal rights organisations have been fighting to ban these illegal operations

The woman in her early twenties with her head bandaged and several bruises on the right side of her body was one of a family of three on whom a small section of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre’s (JPMC) boundary wall on Rafiquee Shaheed Road fell on Monday morning. As a result of the incident, Samrina’s father, Ali Asghar, died and her mother, Rasheeda Bibi, was injured.

“I had been complaining of pain in my kidneys for several days, so my parents brought me to the Kidney Centre for a check-up. We live in Landhi. It was a long way back and we were just resting on the footpath when the wall behind us just collapsed. At first I didn’t even understand what had happened. Then I frantically looked to see if my parents were okay. They were not moving, even when people around came running to our assistance. It must have been around 11am then,” she said before drifting off.

Samrina’s elder brother Yasir Ali, standing next to his sister’s bed, said he was at his bicycle shop at Bhains Colony when he got his sister’s call from the hospital informing him about the accident and the death of their father. “In my rush to get here, I forgot to lock my shop. Now I learn that our mother also received a severe head injury and it is touch and go for her, too,” he said quietly.

“My father ran his own slippers and sandals shop in Bhains Colony. We had only been concerned about Samrina’s complaining of chronic pain in the kidney area. And now suddenly we are orphans,” he said.

Asked if they had complained to the hospital authorities about their negligence regarding building maintenance as a result of which the wall fell on them, Yasir Ali shook his head. “What happened is unfortunate but it was God’s will,” he said.

Meanwhile, a police officer, interviewing Samrina while documenting evidence, remarked that the wall was weak. He added that people had told him that the wall also had a notice pasted on it for passers-by to not lean or push too hard against it. “But uneducated people couldn’t read it, of course,” he remarked.

“I can read but I don’t remember seeing any such notice on the wall,” said Samrina on hearing what he said. “Besides, none of us were leaning against the wall. We were just sitting on the footpath.”

JPMC executive director Prof Anisuddin Bhatti was not available for comment. His mobile phone was also switched off on Monday.

The story which has been passed down from generations tells of three migrations that have occurred over many thousands of years, one of us coming to this ancient land first, then another at a period after the last Ice age which saw the formation of the Great Barrier Reef, the other is of a migration out of Cairns that went back through the Cape into the Torres Strait to PNG and further.

Equally, scientific narratives of Aboriginal origins have presented different accounts. But these have been difficult to establish in part due to the difficulty and limitations of the science involved.

It’s also because of the social context that both science and archaeology work in within Australia.

The first few decades of modern archaeological research into Australia’s ancient past was conducted with very little to no involvement of Aboriginal Australian people.

This was followed by decades of debate over ownership of the past. Initial DNA research proposals floundered because little to no consultation was undertaken.

A new period of community based research with Aboriginal people was forged through the sensitive and highly consultative approach pioneered by geneticist Sheila Van Holst Pellekaan. Her work with Aboriginal people set the standard for later scientific studies in Australia.

We can now provide an example of work undertaken in partnership with Aboriginal Australian people from all parts of Australia, from the deserts to urban and regional centres. The details of the research are published today in Nature.

The First Australians

Our results show very clearly that Aboriginal Australian people living today are the descendants of the First People to enter Australia, who lived between 25,000 to 40,000 years ago.

There is substantial evidence of admixture or intermixing with Asian, Oceanic and European people within the last 200 years. But in the Aboriginal DNA is an ancient story of migration into this continent, far deeper in time than any other population group has so far revealed.

It shows ancient contact and gene flow between the ancestors of the First Australians and now extinct populations of Neanderthals and Denisovans. This is very similar to the gene flows reported between Neanderthals, Europeans and Asians.

Tom Cebula, Wall to Wall Media

Our paper supports the results of earlier genomic research. This includes the foundational study on the first Aboriginal Australian genome from Western Australia and ancient DNA recovered from fossil remains from Lake Mungo.

Our research discounts the political agenda of some individuals who have claimed that Aboriginal Australians may not have been the First Australians.

The research also helps clarify a number of key points that archaeologists have been debating since the 1960s, such as where the ancestors of Aboriginal Australian people likely first entered the continent.

The first migration

There has been considerable debate as to whether the First Australians took the northern route (through Papua and then down into Cape York) or a more southerly route, crossing from Timor into north-western Australia.

Our evidence reveals a picture of population expansion from north east Australia.

Around 10,000 years ago, sea levels rose and the land bridge between Papua and Cape York was flooded. Based on this, the genetic separation of Papuans and Aboriginal Australians was generally believed to have been initiated after this time.

But using large-scale genome data from Australians and Papuans we estimate the time of divergence between the two groups to be 37,000 years ago. This is much earlier than previously predicted.

This also suggests that barriers to intermarriage between Australia and Papua occurred much earlier than the creation of the barrier of Torres Strait.

Interestingly a significant barrier to gene flow within Australia also seems to have occurred at the time of the last great ice age, known as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

East and west Australians

We see significant divergence between Aboriginal Australian people of north east and south west Australia. These groups are more genetically different than, for example, Native Americans and Siberians are from each other.

They are all Aboriginal Australians of course, but the onset of the LGM seems to have limited gene flow between east and west. As a result, the formation of a different population structure began some 31,000 years ago.

Further subdivisions among eastern and western Aboriginal Australians appeared to have occurred later. The phylogenetic relationships based on our genetic data correlated well with the divisions based on the Aboriginal (Pama-Nyungan) languages spoken by the people.

Some researchers have maintained for many years that the archaeological record shows significant population expansion in the last few thousand years before the arrival of Europeans.

Other archaeologists have disagreed, stating that demographic expansion can be a very difficult thing to prove from a record of carbon dates, stone tools and shell middens.

These signatures are very prone to destruction by such things as erosion and sea level change. Much of the first coastline initially colonised by the First Australians now lies beneath the waves, locked in a drowned landscape.

The genetic evidence for population increase in north east Australia, one area that some archaeologists have argued was subject to significant population expansion, is actually earlier than expected. It seems to begin some 10,000 years ago, which is several thousand years earlier than evidence provided by archaeology.

Also our genome data do not show any significant gene flow events into Australia from India around 6,000 years ago, suggested by previous research.

Desert life

What we did find was unique genetic variations specific to Aboriginal Australians that might have given them an improved ability to withstand cold and dehydration – potential adaptations to life in the desert.

Previous studies have shown the potential of DNA in understanding the ancestral relationships of Aboriginal Australian people. Genome sequencing in the past few years has revealed a far more complicated picture than first thought.

We can now tackle questions that have been debated for decades using the actual evidence from the biology of the First Australians.

It is crucial that we continue to make sure that such research is done in partnership with Aboriginal Australian people.

As noted by one of the key researchers in the project, Dr Craig Muller, who said:

We have developed close relationships with many individuals throughout the project, and collaborated closely with Aboriginal Elders in each language group who provided important cultural information. The Elders also guided us to the appropriate people to participate.

A great example of how things have changed since the early years is that there are now new generations of young Aboriginal Australian researchers undertaking DNA research.

In parallel is the interest shown by many indigenous groups who are interested in this research and keen to partner with us. This suggests a wonderful future might lie ahead.

38,38,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Hardy made-in-Singapore 'Temasek Rice' hits shelves - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hardy-made-in-spore-rice-hits-shelves,"There is a new brand of rice on the shelves, and it is made in Singapore.

Called Temasek Rice, it is the first - and only - rice variety to be created and sold here.

That is not the only thing special about it. It is specially formulated to be a hardy breed that is able to withstand floods - for instance, it ""hibernates"" for up to two weeks when submerged in water - and droughts.

Following eight years of research and field trials, Temasek Rice is now ready for the ultimate test - the taste test.

It was launched at Meidi-Ya supermarket in Liang Court last month.

Its lead inventor Yin Zhongchao says his grains are of good quality, softer and as tasty - or even tastier, compared with other brown rice varieties.

DINNER TABLE WORTHY? It is chewier than normal brown rice and a little bit harder than regular white rice... In fact, it reminds me a little of the crust you get when you cook rice on the stove - the bits that get a little burnt around the edges. Some people like those bits because they are actually quite flavourful. I really like this. STRAITS TIMES FOOD CRITIC WONG AH YOKE, giving his take on Temasek Rice.

The senior principal investigator at Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory said the new grain represents a piece of the puzzle in the global quest for long-term food security.

The rice is bred to withstand extremely dry and wet weather for extended periods of time.

It is also fortified against fungal and bacteria attacks, and bred to produce a higher yield.

He hopes Temasek Rice will yield benefits for both farmers and consumers in the long run.

Crop aimed at a more stable food supply

""Farmers work very hard and their income is very low, so we want to create good rice that allows for stable production, and produces grains of good quality so that they can be sold for high prices,"" he said.

""As for the consumers, rice that can survive poor weather conditions would ultimately mean a more stable food supply.""

Rice is the main staple food crop for more than half of the world's population of 7.4 billion people, but studies have predicted that increasing demand will require its production to grow by 30 per cent by 2025.

Temasek Rice was created by cross-breeding a type of jasmine rice grown in South-east Asia with five other types grown in the region, or what Dr Yin calls donors.

The process, which is simple but tedious, uses the age-old method of cross-pollination where pollen from the donors is transferred to the original fragrant rice plant.

Temasek Rice produces six tonnes of rice grains per hectare on average, nearly four times more than the original type.

Its rice stalks are also shorter, making them sturdier and less likely to topple from strong winds.

Dr Yin said he is looking to partner more rice companies to increase the production of Temasek Rice, which is being grown in Tasikmalaya, Indonesia, on a small scale.

If so, it can be sold at other supermarkets here. Currently, it is sold only at Medi-Ya. Each 1kg packet sells for between $6.95 and $7.45.

Professor William Chen of Nanyang Technological University's School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering said Temasek Rice will help address the challenges of climate change, such as longer and more frequent droughts and floods in many food-growing countries.

However, the food science expert noted that there might be a need to consider ways to tackle the emergence of new bacteria strains, which would become resistant to Temasek Rice over time.

39,39,FL-2016-000103-IDN,"Disaster Recovery Framework: Tropical Cyclone Winston, 20th February 2016 - Fiji - ReliefWeb (www)",https://reliefweb.int/report/fiji/disaster-recovery-framework-tropical-cyclone-winston-20th-february-2016,"Tropical Cyclone (TC) Winston, an extremely destructive Category 5 cyclone, struck Fiji on 20th February 2016. It was the first Category 5 cyclone to directly impact Fiji, and the most intense tropical cyclone on record to affect the country. Maximum average wind speeds reached 233km/hour, and wind gusts peaked at around 306km/hour, making Winston one of the most powerful cyclones ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere.

Introduction

In addition to the extreme wind speeds, many islands were flooded by storm surges, which, in some cases, inundated areas almost 200 meters inland.The cyclone caused widespread damage and destruction impacting 540,414 people or 62 percent of the total population. Approximately 80 percent of the nation’s population lost power, including the entire island of Vanua Levu. TC Winston caused 44 fatalities and entire communities were destroyed and around 40,000 people required immediate assistance following the cyclone.

30,369 houses, 495 schools, and 88 health clinics and medical facilities were damaged or destroyed. Destruction of crops has compromised the livelihoods of almost 60 percent of Fiji’s population.

Humanitarian Support and Coordination

The Fiji Government successfully led the overall humanitarian response to TC Winston. The government-led efforts were undertaken with strong support from the international community, including the coordination of assistance from foreign governments, UN agencies, the Red Cross, national and international NGOs and the private sector. Immediate emergency efforts were supported with military logistical assistance primarily from Australia and New Zealand, but with support also from France, India, and Indonesia. As of 30 April international donors had pledged assistance valued at approximately $142 million, with approximately 75 percent of this being in kind and 25 percent in cash. Major contributors include Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union, with contributions also from a wide range of other countries and organizations. Private businesses have also contributed approximately $10 million for relief support to victims.

On 4th March the Fiji Government and the United Nations jointly launched an emergency humanitarian “Flash” appeal seeking US$38.6 million for the first three months of the TC Winston response. Needs identified for this appeal included the provision of emergency shelter; access to health, water and sanitation; food and livelihood support; access to education and rehabilitation of schools; and protection and support to vulnerable groups. Approximately 42 per cent of the needs outlined in this appeal have been funded to date through donations totalling more than US$16 million from Australia, Canada, the European Commission, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund.

The response was coordinated at the national level by nine sector specific Clusters. The Clusters are joint coordination forums with representation from all the agencies involved in that sector. Each Cluster is led by a Government Ministry, with an international agency as Co-lead.

The “Flash Appeal” followed the structure of the Government-led Cluster system, with specific projects submitted and approved by Government leads under each Cluster.

Post Disaster Needs Assessment

A Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), led by Government, was conducted in March/April. Damage and losses as a result of the disaster were estimated at F$ 1.98 billion (PDNA Table 1). Of this, F$1.28 billion is classified as damage (i.e. destroyed physical assets), and F$ 0.70 billion as loss (i.e., changes in the economic flows of the production of goods and services). The combined damage and losses are about 20 percent of Fiji’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015.The PDNA estimated recovery needs at F$1.98 billion, of which F$1.69 billion will be focused on reconstruction, F$218 million will be focused on recovery needs, and F$46 million will be focused on resilience activities (PDNA Table 5). In some sectors, such as agriculture, fully recovery will take many years.

Recovery Defined

For the purposes of this Framework, “recovery” does not mean returning Fiji to how it was just before 20 February 2016. Recovery includes both restoration and enhancement. There will be opportunities during recovery to ‘build back better’ when repairing and reconstructing buildings and infrastructure. These opportunities need to be considered where they lead to increased resilience and/or functionality, or are cost-effective according to life-cycle analysis; provided that they do not come at the expense of the repair or replacement of essential infrastructure and services elsewhere.

Disaster Recovery Framework

Given the scale of the impact of TC Winston it will be several years before production and livelihoods can be restored to pre-cyclone levels. Full recovery,and building greater community resilience, will be a long term effort needing well targeted and sequenced assistance to communities. Recovering and rebuilding from the impact of the strongest cyclone to hit Fiji is Government’s priority.

In recognition of the share of disaster effects between the public and private sectors (PDNA Table 1), government recovery efforts will be focused on restoring public assets and services, providing assistance and support to affected individuals, households and communities to recover from the disaster and to restore livelihoods and economic activities and increasing resilience to future disasters.

This Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF) sets out a Vision and Guiding Principles for medium-term recovery over the next two years (from mid-2016 to mid-2018). In recognition of the long-term nature of recovery and reconstruction, recovery efforts beyond two years will be integrated into Fiji’s National Development Plan. While the programmes and financing presented in this DRF are based the sectoral needs and recovery programmes identified in the PDNA, the figures in this Disaster Recovery Framework are necessarily a sub-set of the overall recovery needs identified in PDNA Table 5.

This DRF will guide the planning and implementation of recovery programmes and projects, providing overall direction to individuals and organizations that have a role in recovery activities including government, the private sector, development partners, civil society and communities. The implementation of the recovery programmes is an opportunity to restore livelihoods, improve lives, upgrade assets, strengthen communities, and lay the foundation for making Fiji more resilient. Recognizing the evolving nature of the recovery effort and the need to revise estimates as new information becomes available and is discussed with implementing agencies and affected people, the detailed recovery Programme will be refined and updated over the coming months.","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/634056-DRF_Draft_6.png?itok=JWm--_HZ,"['pdna', 'million', 'tropical', 'framework', 'needs', '20th', 'assistance', 'support', 'cyclone', 'fiji', '2016', 'disaster', 'recovery', 'winston']", 
40,40,FL-2016-000103-IDN,East Timor Takes Maritime Dispute With Australia to UN Court - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/east-timor-takes-maritime-dispute-australia-un-court,"SYDNEY - East Timor has accused Australia of being a bully as the International Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands prepares to hear a decade-long dispute over the sharing of oil and mineral wealth in the Timor Sea.

East Timor — also known as Timor Leste — wants the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to decide which country owns a large undersea oil and gas field. The East Timorese government believes Australia is receiving more than it is entitled to under an international convention.

The court has said it will oversee a compulsory conciliation between the two countries on their disputed maritime boundary, rejecting objections from Australia.

The judicial process could decide on which side of the maritime border lies a large oil and gas field over which the two nations have a revenue-sharing agreement.

Both sides will now enter into a negotiation process that will take place behind closed doors over the next 12 months.

Jose Ramos Horta, the former East Timorese president, says his country is standing up to a bully.

“Throughout the Pacific region, Southeast Asia, people [are] looking at Timor Leste with admiration. Wow, they have the courage, the guts to stand up to this bullying regional power [and] taking immense risk,” he said.

Australian officials have said that existing bilateral treaties between the Asia-Pacific neighbors had been ""hugely beneficial,” but that Canberra would accept the court’s decision.

The case has strained relations that have previously been close after Australia supported East Timor’s successful campaign for independence from Indonesia in the late 1990s. The young nation is beset by serious economic problems, with annual per capita income estimated at around $5,600.

In July, the U.N. Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled against Chinese claims to rights in the South China Sea, supporting a case brought by the Philippines. In that case, Beijing refused to participate and has said it does not recognize the ruling.","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/921DE368-EAE1-4121-AB26-77589E5E473E.jpg,"['court', 'arbitration', 'case', 'timorese', 'international', 'takes', 'process', 'timor', 'maritime', 'dispute', 'east', 'oil', 'australia']",

NNCI Arauco fire

Recent ship fires have caused the International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI) to call for a reevaluation of the fire-fighting equipment used on container ships.

The call comes just as the Wan Hai 307 container ship suffered a fire in Hong Kong on Monday. The ship’s crew were unable to extinguish the fire, and local salvage tugs were deployed to help.

Uwe-Peter Schieder, Vice Chairman of IUMI’s Loss Prevention Committee explains how he sees recent incidents:

“At sea, below-deck fires cannot be fought with water and so CO? is used instead to displace the oxygen and extinguish the fire. However, if the fire is burning within a container, the box will protect it from the CO? and so this method of fire-fighting is rarely successful. Currently there are no other methods of fighting a container ship fire below deck. Even on deck, the crew only have access to hoses and nozzles. They do not have sufficient monitors or foam and so cannot cool the vessel’s structure”.

IUMI is concerned that seafarers are being asked to tackle onboard fires with inadequate equipment. The Association highlights the incident on MSC Flaminia where three seafarers lost their lives. The vessel burned for almost six weeks, 70 percent of the cargo was destroyed and the ship was declared a Constructive Total Loss.

IUMI is well aware of the SOLAS regulations but is calling for further dialogue involving IMO, class, shipbuilders and shipping companies to further improve firefighting capabilities onboard container ships.

Two recent container ship fires referenced by IUMI are:

NNCI Arauco - September 1, 2016: A fire broke out whilst alongside in Hamburg during welding operations and 300 firefighters were deployed. The hold was sealed and flooded with CO?, this was unsuccessful. Water was then used for flooding the hatch and stopped before stability problems occur. Finally, foam was used to bring the fire under control.

Maersk Karachi – May 13, 2016: A fire caused by welding operations needed more than 100 firefighters to control the blaze. Water monitors were needed to flood the hold to extinguish the fire.","Tue, 20 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Wreckage_Salvage/Cropped/ccni%20arauco%20fire%2016x9.jpg,"['firefighting', 'welding', 'extinguish', 'fires', 'recent', 'ship', 'seafarers', 'used', 'rethink', 'water', 'container']", 
42,42,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Fossil fuel reserves would crush climate goals: report - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2016-09-fossil-fuel-reserves-climate-goals.html,"Developed oil, gas and coal reserves, if exhausted, are enough to push Earth well past the threshold for dangerous climate change, according to a report published Thursday

Developed oil, gas and coal reserves, if exhausted, are enough to push Earth well past the threshold for dangerous climate change, according to a report published Thursday.

Fossil fuels from active fields and mines allowed to operate through their projected lifetimes would punch through the two degree Celsius cap for global warming laid down in the Paris Agreement, said the report, based on industry data.

The analysis by Oil Change International was released the day after world leaders gathered in New York to speed the global climate pact, signed by 195 nations in December, into force.

That is likely to happen before the end of the year, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday.

As climate change impacts—heat waves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas—hit earlier and harder than predicted, pressure has grown to accelerate the transition away from carbon-intensive fossil fuels.

The coal industry has been hit hardest, with moratoriums on new plants put in place this year in China and Indonesia, along with one covering federal land in the United States.

The Paris Agreement calls for holding global warming at ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-Industrial Revolution levels, and under 1.5 C (2.7 F) if possible.

Existing reserves of oil and gas alone, even without coal, would be enough to breach the 1.5 C barrier, according to the 60-page report.

The coal industry has been hit hardest, with moratoriums on new plants put in place this year in China and Indonesia, along with one covering federal land in the United States

""If the world is serious about achieving the goals agreed in Paris, governments have to stop the expansion of the fossil fuel industry,"" said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International.

Many of 200 climate scientists gathered in Oxford, England this week at a conference on the more stringent climate change goal have said that staying under 1.5 C may be out of reach.

An incentive to continue

The planet has already heated up 1.0 C (1.8 F), and could see its first year above 1.5 C ""within a decade,"" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre in England.

The new analysis compares the projected emissions of burning fossil fuels from current operations to the carbon ""budget""—the sum total of CO2 that can be emitted without exceeding the 2C limit.

Scientists calculate that budget to be less than 1,000 billion tonnes of CO2.

Previous studies of these limits have focused more on the consumption of oil, gas and coal rather than the potential for supply.

""Once an extraction operation is underway, it creates an incentive to continue so as to recoup investment and create profits,"" Greg Muttitt, lead author of the report, said.

As climate change impacts—heat waves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas—hit earlier and harder than predicted, pressure has grown to accelerate the transition away from carbon-intensive fossil fuels

This is how carbon emissions get ""locked in"", he added.

Projected investment in new fields, mines and transportation infrastructure over the next 20 years is $14 trillion (12.5 trillion euros), according to industry figures.

Some of the biggest projects in the pipeline are in the United States, Canada, Australia, India, Russia, Qatar and Iran.

For coal—the dirtiest, or most carbon-polluting, of the major fossil fuels—two countries, Australia and India, are moving forward with large-scale new mining development.

In 2015, India set a target of tripling national coal extraction to 1.5 billion tonnes per year by 2020, though some commentators say the country will be hard put to reach that goal.

Historically, India has not been a major contributor to climate change, and even today its population—on a per capita basis—produces far less carbon pollution than Western nations, or even China.

The report's findings were based on data from Rystad Energy, a leading oil and gas consultancy.

""We wanted to beat the Italian record. We succeeded and now we have the magic number of 404 meters,"" Miroslav Lukas of the Czech Speleological Society told the AFP news agency.

The cave, called the Hranicka Propast, or Hranice Abyss, was uncovered by a Polish-Czech team in an eastern part of the Czech Republic. Divers have been exploring the underwater cave's murky depths for decades, but its depth had remained unknown.

Starnawski (L) dove to 200 meters to launch the robot that ran out of cord before reaching the cave's bottom

Krzysztof Starnawski, a Polish explorer who led the team, scuba dived to a narrow opening 200 meters down on Tuesday. He then positioned a remotely operated underwater robot to take measurements further down, he told the Associated Press.

Even with the help of a robot and its long cord, the explorers were still unable to reach the cave's bottom. The robot ran out of cord at 404 meters.

""It was as deep as its rope could go, but the bottom was still nowhere in sight,"" the Czech Speleological Society said in a statement. The Hranice Abyss is likely much deeper, the explorers added.

Diving in the flooded Czech cave is difficult due to muddy areas and a chilly water temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit). Additionally, water in the limestone cave has a mineral composition that damages equipment and exposed skin, Starnawski told AP.

""But that is the only price to be paid for this discovery, and it was worth paying,"" he said.

The Polish explorer plans to dive down again to 200 meters on Saturday in order to bring the robot back to the surface.

The project was co-financed by the National Geographic Society, which broke the story late on Thursday night.

By Nikolai Dobrott

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN is a political and economic organization of ten Southeast Asian countries. Formed in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, membership has since expanded to include Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Covering more than 4.5 million square kilometres and comprising a population of more than 600 million people, ASEAN is about the size of the European Union. But these are probably the only similarities the two economic unions share.

While the EU currently has more economic power, is further developed and is a politically more integrated trade zone, when it comes to GDP growth, ASEAN, is by far the more dynamic. For the last five years, its annual GDP growth averaged around 6%. In 2015, the organization’s combined nominal GDP had grown to more than USD 2.6 trillion. If ASEAN were a single entity, it would rank as the seventh largest economy in the world behind the USA, China, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. With such economic growth levels expected to continue, ASEAN is fast becoming a major economic force in Asia and a driver of global growth.

Energy-related challenges driving renewable energy growth

Installing sufficient additional power generation capacity is one of the most pressing issues for ASEAN countries to solve. Despite the rapid economic development, many parts of ASEAN remain under-electrified – 160 million of its people still do not have access to electricity today. For those that do, prices of grid electricity are high at 0.18 USD/kWh or more in some markets.

The insufficient power generation structures currently in ASEAN are characterized by their strong reliance on fossil sources, such as natural gas, coal and oil, and the absence of nuclear power. ASEAN, one of the regions with the strongest growth in CO2 emissions in the last decade is also the region expected to experience some of the most harmful effects of climate change – more intensive storms, variable precipitation, a rise in sea levels, as well as more severe droughts and floods.

Like many emerging economies with sizeable populations, ASEAN must solve numerous economic and energy-related challenges such as providing sufficient energy services, improving industrial productivity and reducing poverty, and on top of that, adapting to global warming. As a result, ASEAN is increasingly turning to renewable energy.

Renewable energy: Immense potential, sound economics and extensive rollout underway

Rather than transitioning from existing, reliable and adequate fossil and nuclear energy infrastructure towards renewable energy sources driven by political will, as we have experienced in developed markets such as Europe, the USA or Japan, renewable investments in Southeast Asia are first and foremost driven by the need to increase energy capacity. Happily, ASEAN’s excellent natural resources coincide very well with this objective.

The most common and historically advanced form of renewable energy has been hydroelectric power, most prominently from the lower Mekong River, which flows through or along the borders of Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. In the lower Mekong, more than 3,235 MW has been realized via facilities built largely over the past ten years, while projects under construction represent an additional 3,209 MW. A further 134 projects are planned for the lower Mekong, which will effectively exhaust the river’s hydropower generating capacity. Although the overall hydroelectric potential of the region is estimated to range between 170 GW to 250 GW, there are major concerns about the environmental impacts of damming the Mekong River system and other rivers in Southeast Asia. An independent assessment prepared for the Mekong River Commission recommended a 10 year delay in the current hydroelectric project schedule to evaluate environmental concerns.

The highest geothermal potential of any country in the world with more than 27 GW is in Indonesia. Although ASEAN’s largest country by population and economy contains 40 percent of the world’s total geothermal reserves, it currently only utilizes five percent of its capacity. The Indonesian government plans to increase its geothermal capacity to 6 GW by the end of this decade. So far its main challenge has been to attract the necessary foreign investment. The current administration has undertaken some reforms to lower the barriers in this regard with the result that Enel Green Power has recently kicked off its 55 MW geothermal development in Indonesia’s Lampung province.

Wind energy has been a relatively low priority renewable sector in ASEAN. The region’s best wind potential lies to the north in areas of Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines and Thailand. Of these, only the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam have started to substantially promote the wind energy sector. The Philippines now has an operational wind energy capacity of 400 MW, more than any other country in Southeast Asia. Vietnam recently – after years of delay – moved towards its announced wind power targets with the long awaited corresponding FiT programme. During the visit of President Obama to Vietnam in May 2016, a MoU with General Electric was signed according to which GE will develop new wind farms with a capacity of 1,000 MW.

The largest and most unlimited potential for ASEAN in renewable energy is, of course, in solar power. With annual solar radiation levels ranging from 1,460 to 1,900 kWh/m2 per year the region has some of the highest yields in the world. Thailand began substantial implementation of solar power in 2011 with an attractive subsidy “adder” scheme. Although Thailand with about 2.8 GW has currently more solar power cumulatively installed than all other ASEAN countries combined, the Philippines is expected to install the most PV this year. However, while Thailand and the Philippines dominate the market today, in just a few short years, four countries will be competing for the title of the top PV market in ASEAN’s rapidly growing solar power region, as can be seen in Figure 1.

Next to Thailand, Malaysia has run a smaller FiT programme for solar in the last few years amounting to a little over 220 MW up to now and has announced another 250 MW to be approved for FiT by 2020. Most dynamic in the last year, however, has been the Philippine solar market. Driven by attractive FiTs, 800 MW has been built – more than 90% of that within the very short timeframe of Q4/2015 and Q1/2016. Most interestingly, the FiT for projects had to be secured after the project’s commissioning and was subject to a 450 MW cap for the FiT capacity. This highlights another big difference to developed RE markets such as Europe and the USA: The market demand for PV is not dependent on a subsidized FiT in the Philippines because of growing demand for electricity and PV’s cost competitiveness compared with other power generation options. Project financing has been available in spite of the uncertainty about securing a FiT.

In recent months, both Vietnam and Indonesia announced the implementation of FiT programmes for 850 MW and 250 MW of solar respectively, which are to be carried out in 2016/2017.

Another substantial difference to a developed solar market in for example, Europe or the USA, is the market segmentation. While residential solar represents a substantial share of solar power capacity in markets such as Germany or the USA, in ASEAN, utility-scale solar accounts for more than 95% of all capacity added to the grid. Although there are some initiatives and programmes to enhance residential solar, the market fundamentals of often state-owned national utilities are in favour of utility-scale solar applications in the medium-voltage power-grid sector. Residential has been slow to take off due to low household income, lack of necessary financing for residential applications and shorter amortization expectations by ASEAN customers.

Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam are the five big markets driving PV development. Combined, they represent 90% of ASEAN’s population; they have capacity targets in place and policies taking shape. According to Apricum’s high case scenario, over 15 GW of PV capacity is expected to be installed by 2020 in these five markets alone, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Even though the end of FiTs are in sight, sustainable market conditions are within reach

FiTs in markets such as Thailand and the Philippines have succeeded in opening up the market for solar in these countries, however, as these programmes come to an end, market players must turn towards the natural potential and economics of utility-scale power provision to utilities or commercial off-takers.

Utility-scale solar will compete with mostly LNG or other renewables, rather than with new coal power plants, which face strong public opposition and have recently been subject to political scrutiny. On the commercial off-taker side, renewable generation will need to be competitive with electricity prices (including those that are subsidized in some markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam) from the utility at peak-times or diesel generation on site – which it already is in most cases.

Market entry for international players: Success requires careful preparation and on-the-ground commitment

In contrast to Asian markets such as China or Japan, ASEAN features much lower market-entry barriers for international renewable energy developers, EPCs or financiers. Solar markets such as Thailand and the Philippines demonstrate an almost equal balance between competent new local players and international renewable energy companies who are establishing a strong, even leading, market position.

There are several key factors that are vital for international renewable energy companies wishing to successfully build a business in Southeast Asia. These include time-to-market, the level of commitment to the market, the in-depth understanding of the regulatory environment, the local organizational execution capabilities and the level of integration of the business model.

Apricum offers a range of services to support companies in successfully expanding into new markets. These include identifying the most promising markets, developing business models and entry strategies tailored to these specific markets, finding the most suitable local partners and facilitating local business development.

47,47,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Lightning kills at least 18 people in northern India - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/9/21/lightning-kills-at-least-18-people-in-northern-india,"Eighteen people have been killed after being struck by lightning in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh, India.

Uttar Pradesh has been hit by a number of severe thunderstorms over the past week and more are expected over the next few days.

The storms killed eight people on September 16, and 10 more only 48 hours later.

A number of other people are still in intensive care, fighting for their lives.

Monika Rani, a district magistrate, said that the families of those who died will be given 400,000 rupees ($6,000) in compensation.

Lightning kills a surprising number of people in India. In Uttar Pradesh alone, lightning caused 59 deaths in August, and it’s estimated that it kills more than 2,000 people across the country every year.

Most of those who die are farmers who are struck as they work in open fields. They are often working in rice paddy fields, vast expanses of flat, flooded lands without shelter.

However, some people are also killed while they sleep in their beds. This is due to the rustic nature of their houses.

In order to offer protection from lightning, a building must have plumbing or electrical wiring. This conducts the lightning’s electricity and keeps the occupants safe.

Lightning kills a disproportionately large number of people across Southeast Asia, but the problem is not confined to the region.

In June, more than 80 people were injured by lightning at Germany’s Rock am Ring Festival, and in France 11 people were killed, including eight children, when lightning struck Paris.

Global estimates of the number of deaths caused by lightning strikes vary dramatically because many countries have no reliable statistics. The estimates vary from 6,000 to 24,000 people each year.

52,52,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Obama Demands That Security Agencies Consider Climate Change - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obama-demands-that-security-agencies-consider-climate-change/,"President Obama moved toward solidifying his climate change legacy this week by requiring federal defense and intelligence agencies to consider the effects of a warming planet on national security in the policies, plans and doctrines they develop.

The executive order, issued yesterday, comes in the form of a presidential memorandum requiring 20 federal agencies to collaborate to make sure decisionmakers have the best available information on climate change impacts and their potential threats to national security (E&ENews PM, Sept. 21). The agencies are as varied as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which gather scientific observations on climate, and the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense, which analyze intelligence and develop national security policy.

It’s no longer enough to work on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, said John Holdren, assistant to the president for science and technology as well as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

The facts dictate it, Holdren said. The warmest year on Earth in the modern record, 2015, occurred during Obama’s presidency, and the past 10 years have been the warmest on record.

Those temperature changes aren’t just about readings on a thermometer, he said. There are national security threats in the increasing amount and intensity of heat waves, droughts, wildfires, torrential downpours and floods. There are threats, as well, from the spread in geographic range of tropical pathogens, like the Zika virus, and the coastal erosion, flooding and saltwater intrusion brought about by sea-level rise. Even ocean acidification and warming have an effect on the food source, and therefore security, of billions of people worldwide.

“It’s gratifying to have the Paris agreements serving as the global policy framework for limiting climate change and its impacts,” Holdren said, “but it’s clear nonetheless that climate is going to continue to change for some time to come in ways that will negatively impact our security at home and abroad.”

Obama this week was on something of a climate victory lap in New York as he used his final address to the U.N. General Assembly to warn a global audience that climate change would worsen the sort of unrest and inequality that many experts say have spurred a refugee crisis worldwide.

The memo came the same day the National Intelligence Council released a report suggesting climate change and its resulting effects are “likely to pose wide-ranging national security challenges for the United States and other countries over the next 20 years.”

“We’re already beginning to see the devastating effects of weather-related disasters, drought, famine, and damaged infrastructure on communities around the world,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. “Add to that an increased risk of conflict over water and land, and the large-scale displacement due to rising sea levels, and it’s not hard to see why the Pentagon has deemed climate change a ’threat-multiplier,’ exacerbating the pressures and challenges far too many countries are already facing.”

The president and his top advisers have repeatedly described climate change as a threat multiplier that could foment conflict as desperate populations compete for scarce resources. But the administration has had mixed results at connecting climate change into a national security framework.

Kerry was ridiculed in 2014 after a speech in Indonesia in which he described climate change as the “world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.” Conservatives widely panned his speech, and Kerry was forced to defend his remarks to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

A ‘step in the right direction’

The president’s memo requires a working group to develop in the next 90 days a Climate Change and National Security Action Plan. Among its tasks: identifying the areas worldwide most vulnerable to current and projected impacts of climate variability over the next 30 years. After that, individual federal agencies are expected to develop implementation plans that address climate-related hazards and threats to national security, that identify economic considerations and threats arising from climate change, and that identify risks to regional stability.

“Ninety days is very short if these agencies and departments were just starting, ... but in fact they are already focusing on it,” said Geoffrey Dabelko, director of the Environmental Studies Program at Ohio University’s Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs.

Some defense and intelligence experts have been clamoring for nearly a decade for climate change to be considered a national security threat.

Last week, a bipartisan group of defense experts and former military leaders released a consensus statement spearheaded by the Center for Climate and Security, warning that climate change presents a risk to national and international security and saying the United States should advance a comprehensive policy for addressing the risk.

The center also offered a briefing book that urges the next president to assign a Cabinet-level official to lead on domestic climate change and national security issues.

Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of Defense who signed the consensus statement, said it will require leadership by the next administration. Obama’s memo begins the work of institutionalizing climate change as a national security threat, said Goodman, who has long argued that climate change is a threat multiplier.

“What we’re talking about is making mainstream or more routine the integration of both the data that’s collected and the analysis of it,” she said, “and also giving it a higher priority. No longer should there be a major Middle East task force that doesn’t think about how climate is fueling conflict in that region.”

Retired Navy Rear Adm. David Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Pennsylvania State University, called the president’s move a “step in the right direction” in how the security community analyzes and responds to the increasing risks of climate change.

“I look forward to seeing how the next administration will work with the Congress to move beyond administrative actions and enact laws and budgets to allow our defense and security forces to fully recognize and respond to the risk of climate change,” he said in an email.

Tying Trump’s hands?

Obama’s memo could be undone by the next administration, but national security and intelligence experts urged the next president to take seriously the threats of climate change.

The work over the next 90 days is based on an existing threat, said Alice Hill, senior director for resilience policy at the National Security Council. Scientists and analysts and defense personnel at every federal agency want to protect against that threat and are likely to continue on that path, she said.

Holdren said the next president, whether he or she is Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, will have no choice.

Climate change can affect, and already is affecting, the availability of food, water and energy, Holdren said. Such impacts can affect the economic, political and social stability of countries.

All of those could strain the U.S. military’s ability to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, he said.

“There’s every reason for the next administration to follow this blueprint,” Holdren said. “The facts on the ground and in the atmosphere and in the oceans are not going to change. In fact, the impacts of climate change on national security are only going to grow, and there will therefore will be every incentive for the next administration to deal with those challenges, utilizing the framework that has now been laid out.”

White House spokesman Brian Deese said the president directly and his national security team have been making a strong case for some time that climate change is having an immediate and growing impact on national security.

But this is the first time the intelligence community is institutionalizing how it assesses climate change and its impact on national security, whether it’s the effects that already are apparent, such as sea-level rise, or longer-term anticipated impacts. There’s now a comprehensive policy to ensure that future impacts are fully considered in the development of national-security-related doctrines, policy, assessments and plans, he said.

Dabelko said the scope of the memo normalizes the national security risks of climate change as something federal agencies must now not only understand but analyze.

“I think it’s a big step on top of an already active administration profile on these issues,” he said. “It’s not the first step, but this is a big one that goes wide and goes deep in terms of the topics it includes, activities it demands and ultimately the impact it is likely to have.”

58,58,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Myanmar's forests face myriad problems as logging ban continues - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/09/myanmars-forests-face-myriad-problems-as-logging-ban-continues/,"Between 1990 and 2015 Myanmar lost nearly 15 million hectares of forest and other wooded land.

Approximately 527 mainly UN-led forest user groups manage around 40,000 hectares of in-country forest.

Illicit cross-border trade of illegal timber continues despite the logging ban set to expire in April 2017.

YANGON – Myanmar’s forests are rich. They are rich in variety, in natural resources, and in wildlife. But they are also rich in danger.

“Myanmar’s forests are more in crisis than ever before,” said Faith Doherty, lead forest campaigner at the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency. “If you just look at what’s happened in the last five years, natural resources are one of the biggest issues this country is facing.”

The crisis is not new.

According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which tracks forest cover globally, in 2010 Myanmar had the third-highest rate of forest reduction in the world. Only Brazil and Indonesia rank higher.

Between 1990 and 2015, the country lost nearly 15 million hectares of forest and other wooded land. Since 2010, half a million hectares of forest has been lost every year, or an area about the size of Brunei. In total, there are 29 million hectares of forest still standing in the country, and the FAO suggests that this means that just under half of Myanmar is still covered in forest (43 percent) and wooded land (23 percent).

In particular, there are large, globally significant expanses of forest in Tanintharyi, in the south of the country, and in Kachin, Shan and Sagaing divisions in the north, but as FAO puts it: “Time is running out as deforestation continues at a rapid pace.”

For Myanmar, losing its forests would spell catastrophe on several different levels, from exacerbating the effects of climate change – already a huge threat, which only promises to worsen – to the loss of habitat for animals and livelihood for humans.

Around 70 percent of Myanmar’s rural population, around 30 million people, rely on the forests for their basic needs in some way, and wood is the most common rural fuel source.

Saw Htun, deputy country director at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Myanmar, said protecting the forests is critical.

“Myanmar is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots on earth, from the Himalayas to the tropical rainforest down south,” he said.

“For the long-term existence of human beings on this planet, and to maintain a functional, healthy ecosystem, we must protect our forests.”

But the threats to the forests in Myanmar are manifold, from excessive logging both legal and illegal, to clearance for agriculture or other development.

In fact, the threats are so serious that even the government is listening. It put in place a one-year logging ban this summer, which will be lifted in April 2017. Myanmar’s previous military-backed government put in place the first real attempt to address the issues with logging with a ban on timber exports in 2014.

Yet as EIA’s Doherty explains, there are various complications.

“What we have here is increased pressure on the forests in that they are being commercially used for so many different reasons,” said Doherty. “Rampant illegal logging still exists, we still have China’s ferocious appetite for teak and hardwoods from Myanmar, and then all of these countries that want to dig in the ground.”

This means that it is not just this generation of trees under threat.

“There’s timber extraction but once the timber is gone, there’s mineral extraction, then there are other driving forces, such as forest conversion for plantations,” said Doherty.

“So the forests are really in crisis. It’s not a positive message, but it’s the truth.”

Precious wood and conflict

Back in the 1850s, when Myanmar (then Burma) was part of the British Empire, a robust forest management system was put in place. And while the profits from Burma’s bounteous teak and hardwood supplies went to British coffers and not Burmese, the system did at least seem to protect the future of the source of those profits: the trees.

However, after independence in 1948 and a slide into decades of isolation under a brutal military junta, the same could no longer be said of the system. Instead, “Burma’s rich forest resources have lined crony pockets for decades,” as it was bluntly described in a 2014 British government report.

Things have improved for Myanmar’s citizens since the junta handed over power to a military-backed government in 2011, a moment which marked the start of the country’s journey towards diplomacy and a re-entry onto the world stage.

But it has not been quite the same story for the forests.

State ownership and corruption

All forests, whether they are classed as reserved forests, protected public forests, or unclassed, are owned by the state of Myanmar and overseen by the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry.

Logging is run by a government-owned monopoly, Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE). More than one EU-backed report has shown that the system remains wide open for corruption, involving either companies with ties to the same cronies as in the junta-era, the Burmese military, or ethnic armies.

Yet that isn’t the biggest problem. Myanmar’s timber trade is massive, with demand from China and India leading the way, followed by markets including the EU and US, which have some trade restrictions in place. In total, the wood trade is officially worth $550 million a year, according to the World Bank’s most recent figures.

However, experts suggest that figure makes up only around one quarter of the actual total, because 75 percent of timber exports from Myanmar are not official, and in fact they are actually illegal.

Some illegal trade takes place in areas outside the control of the government, where ethnic conflicts are still under way. Indeed, many of these ethnic conflicts are actually linked to who has ownership rights over natural resources like forests.

It is a particularly serious problem in Kachin State, which borders the Chinese province of Yunnan. China is the world’s biggest illegal wood importer.

Trade in timber products, mainly logs, between Myanmar and China reached record levels in 2013, according to the findings of an EIA investigation. Of that trade, 94 percent came through the customs office in Yunnan, meaning it was transported overland across the border with Kachin State in contravention of Myanmar’s forest laws and China’s official policy changes.

Glimmers of hope

But amid all of this grim data, there are signs of hope for Myanmar’s forests. In 2015, the country held its first democratic election for decades, bringing human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), to power.

In the summer of 2016, the new government put a one-year countrywide logging ban in place, and a 10-year ban in the densely-forested Pegu Yoma region, building on the previous administration’s ban on raw timber exports, established in 2014.

Experts cautiously welcomed the ban, which was later scheduled to be lifted in April 2017.

“Myanmar’s timber trade has been fraught with problems for decades, including contributing to the armed conflict in ethnic minority territories,” said Kerstin Canby, director of Forest Trends’ Forest Policy, Trade and Finance Program. “Reform is critically needed to make the sector environmentally and economically sustainable, as well as socially equitable, and to ensure that it contributes to peace rather than war.”

Canby added that the pause in official logging could represent a chance to put stronger, more effective policies in place.

“This moratorium could represent a good stopgap measure, if it is used to allow time for the national government to make necessary institutional reforms.”

However, she said more work needs to be done, particularly on illegal logging, to really ensure that Myanmar moves toward a better future for its forests. It’s not just about a ban, but better governance, the inclusion of all stakeholders, and tackling the problem at its source: the demand from trading partners.

“In order to be a step toward meaningful change, the moratorium must be tied to key reforms in the sector that must be implemented before the resumption of logging,” said Canby.

There are other positive steps being taken in Myanmar, including high-level discussions over a new forest law to replace the old version, and even the reform of the logging company, the MTE. Its director Saw John Shwe Ba told Mongabay this was welcome.

“Just like neighboring countries, the logging ban is a good thing to reduce the dependency on natural forests and to get a chance for reforming as well, I think,” he said.

Global help

The international community and trading partners are working with Myanmar too. Illegal trade with China has dropped from its 2013 peak, when 1.7 million cubic meters of timber products worth $621 million were imported by China from Myanmar. As aforementioned, an EIA investigation has shown that 94 percent of this 2013 trading was likely to have been illegal.

The European Union began a project in 2014 to prepare Burmese civil society to engage in the development of a Forest Law Enforcement Governance Trade (FLEGT) process for Myanmar. The FLEGT process could represent the first steps toward a system which could mean full European trade with Myanmar’s logging industry.

Community forestry initiatives are also being tested, with around 527 mainly UN-led forest user groups managing around 40,000 hectares of forest at the latest count, and the UN’s REDD+ program, which Myanmar joined in 2011, also under way.

Representatives are advocating at the ministerial level to try to implement change, as well as leading capacity-building training on sustainability forestry management and effective management tools, including the use of satellite imagery.

In April, the UN reiterated its commitment to Myanmar’s forest sector, describing collaboration between Myanmar and the UN as something that “represents hope for the future.”

Activists remain watchful. For Burmese environmentalists, it’s not a moment too soon.

Devi Thant Cin runs the Myanmar Green Network and believes now is the moment to save Myanmar’s forests – and its future.

“The cronies cut down our forests. The government gave them permission, and all the money is now in their pockets,” she said. “Think of parts of Myanmar – the mountains are gone, the trees are gone, the rivers are damaged. It is all poisoned. Every season now we have flooding.”

“It all depends on the new government. We must cure this now.”

By Lou Del Bello in Nairobi

Strolling through the small town of Lamu, the main town on an island of the same name surrounded by a coral-rich archipelago off Kenya’s east coast, visitors are mesmerised by its classical architecture and pristine beaches, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

What they might not notice is how the beautiful landscape has been, and still is, shaped by one plant family that could soon disappear from the island altogether: mangroves.

This is not only bad news for the locals, but also a step backwards when it comes to curbing climate emissions.

Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds have long been recognised for their ability to protect communities from floods and contribute to marine biodiversity, but it’s only recently that their extraordinary capacity to sequester carbon has been acknowledged.

They form a key element of what is known as “blue carbon” – the carbon captured and stored by the world’s oceans and coastal ecosystems.

As he describes his hometown, Atwaa Salim, project coordinator of the Lamu Marine Conservation Trust, explains how byproducts of the dense mangrove forest lining the coast can be spotted everywhere in town: almost all the roofs are made of mangrove wood, as well as the traditional boats that locals use for fishing and to carry tourists around the smaller islands in search of coral. The forest also acts as a nursery for species such as the jumbo prawn and the snapper which are a key source of income. “Mangroves are everything for us,” he says.

While foreign fishing companies cruise past, sticking around only while the catch is plentiful, “local fishermen with their small boats can’t move more than three miles away from the coast, and it’s crucial for them that the coastal environment remains healthy. They have nowhere else to go.”

The Lamu coast is home to 70% of Kenya’s mangroves, and hosts eight of the nine tree species present in the country. Industrial development is now threatening their survival, as well as that of rural Lamu. Growing tourism and a planned new coal power plant are putting more pressure on the ecosystem.

Lamu is far from alone in its struggle. All over the world mangroves are being destroyed at an alarming rate.

“The projections show that we are losing somewhere between 0.7 and 2% of the global coverage every year, so another decade goes by and we will have lost somewhere between 8 and 20% of these habitats,” says Ariana Sutton-Griers, ecosystem ecologist with the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

“By the end of the century we could easily have no mangroves left,” she says.

In 1985, Kenya had 55,280 hectares of mangroves. Fast forward 25 years and in 2010 the coverage was down to 45,590 hectares.

“The annual carbon sequestration rate for coastal wetlands is greater than 10 times that of forest systems,” says Sutton-Grier. Because of this, even though coastal wetlands are fairly small strips of land, they represent a carbon sink capable of capturing an amount of CO2 roughly equivalent to all the world’s forests.

Mangroves grow faster than trees, capturing a greater amount of carbon. They also grow on soils that are largely anaerobic, or without oxygen, which helps store carbon for longer, as it decomposes slowly underground and can persist for hundreds, or even thousands of years. But when mangroves are uprooted, carbon stored in their soil oxidises and becomes a source of emissions.

In Lamu, one big threat to the mangroves is household rubbish. “Imagine you have a forest just beside you,” says Salim. “All the rubbish dropped on the beach is washed away towards it and before you know it the mangroves have become a dumping site. In those conditions they won’t survive.”

Salim, who is in charge of the finance department of Lamu County, has introduced a waste management scheme. Citizens pay a small fee to have their rubbish collected and carried by donkey to a disposal site. “This way we keep the forest healthy,” he says.

The planned coal plant, due to start operating in 2020, poses another threat. Seawater will be used to cool down the machinery, and the discharge put back into the sea will be dangerously warmer, altering the organic balance of the mangrove swamps.

“Waterway and port development is going to impact the mangrove systems severely [in East Africa],” says Carl Trettin, a soil scientist with the US Forest Service who has spent the last five years researching mangroves in Mozambique and Tanzania. “One of the great uncertainties is whether the damages can be offset. Say you have to destroy a certain area, but you are going to restore somewhere else, how sustainable is that? Is it going to produce the same kind of ecosystem services you are wrecking?”

The question troubles the people of Lamu. There seems to be a clash of priorities between the local and national governments, with the latter more worried about creating wealth to distribute nationwide, sometimes at the expenses of the local, impoverished communities.

“We need our environment to be healthy to support our business,” says Salim. “Without the mangroves, we would have no fish and no building materials, it would be our end.”","Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2016/09/DSC00278-e1474571796258.jpg,"['coastal', 'loss', 'forest', 'small', 'plant', 'threatens', 'climate', 'mangroves', 'communities', 'kenyan', 'mangrove', 'carbon', 'rubbish', 'lamu', 'coast']",

1. Yuanyang Rice Terraces, Yunnan, China

Located in the mountains above Yunnan province in southwest China, the Yuanyang Rice Terraces are comprised of the forest at the hilltop, the stockaded villages below the forest, the terraced fields below the villages and the Honghe water system below the terraced fields, according to UNESCO. The rice terraces, considered some of the most picturesque, have been cultivated by the Hani people for at least the past 1300 years. In 2008, China submitted the terraced fields for World Heritage Site status, stating ""Integrating the terraced fields into the unique landform, forests and plant covers, valleys and streams and other natural landscapes [the Hani people] have developed a unique masterpiece of ethnic art which has organically fused the ethnical art, landscape art and agricultural techniques."" The photos above were shot by Italian photographer Enrico Barletta during a business trip to China. ""“It’s an amazing place and an amazing experience,"" he said. ""I plan to go back as soon as the harvest happens.""

2. Longji Rice Terraces, Longsheng, China

Longji (""Dragon's Backbone"") Terraced Rice Fields received their name because the rice terraces are said to resemble the scales on the back of a dragon, especially during spring, when the paddies are full of water. The fields are beautiful all-year round though, changing colors as the rice grows. Construction and cultivation of the rice terraces began in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and continued during the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), according to TravelChinaGuide.com. Today, the rice terraces cover an area of 66 square km (about 25 sq miles) with the steepest slope standing at an angle of 50 degrees.

3. Banaue Rice Terraces, Philippines

Perhaps the most famous of rice terraces, the 2000-year-old Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Ifugao province in the Philippines are commonly referred to as the ""Eighth Wonder of the World."" The terraces, built largely by hand and considered an engineering feat, are located 5,000-feet above sea level and cover about 10,360 square kilometres (about 4,000 square miles) of mountainside. The Ifugao people used stone and mud walls to construct the terraces that could hold flooded pond fields for the cultivation of rice. They also established a system to water these plots by harvesting water from rainforests above the terraces, according to the National Geographic. Today, guided tours and hikes of the terraces are available for visitors.

4. Sa Pa Rice Terraces, Vietnam

Advertisement Located approximately 1700m above sea level, in Vietnam's remote northwest mountains near the Chinese border, Sa Pa is a picturesque town known for its rugged scenery, lush vegetation, and Fansipan, the highest peak in Vietnam. Tourists are also flocking to the town to see its eye-catching rice terraces, which change hues throughout the year. During the months of April and May, farmers fill the fields with water to prepare for a new crop, causing the terraces to shine like glass. In June and July, the fields feature fully-grown rice, greening the entire area. In September and October, the fields are a lush golden brown.

5. Bali Rice Terraces, Indonesia

Bali may be best-known for its beaches' blue waters and white sands, but it is also known for its vibrant, emerald-green rice terraces, especially in the Ubud and Tegallalang areas. The region uses the ""subak"" system, a water management system for paddy fields which has been developed more than a thousand years ago. Balinese paddy fields were built around water temples and the allocation of water is made by a priest. However, this age-old system is being threatened by the region's thriving tourism. Estimates indicate that about 1,000 hectares of paddy fields are converted into tourist facilities and hotels annually.

6. Rice Terraces, near Annapurna Base Camp, Nepal

Annapurna is the 10th highest peak in the world, and the first 8000-metre peak ever summitted (in June 1950 by a French expedition), according to Lonely Planet. The trek to Annapurna Base Camp, however, is one of the most stunning treks in the world, especially because of the scenic views of the terraced farmlands surrounding the camp.

AN ADELAIDE Hills man who captured the drama of last week’s wild storms with his astonishing photo of a saturated koala is using the image to raise much-needed cash for sick marsupials.

Stirling plumber Russell Latter’s image of “Jimmy the soggy koala” stranded on a fence post in flash floods went viral on social media and was published around the world after it first appeared on the front page of The Advertiser.

“I was thinking with all this news attention and lovely positive comments and people worried about the koala all around the world — which has been so overwhelming — we should try and do something positive,” Mr Latter said.

He contacted Fauna Rescue of SA’s 24-hour Koala Rescue Hotline — a volunteer organisation which cares for sick, injured and orphaned koalas — hoping to support their efforts.

“I thought they would be good people to help out so I set up a gofundme page to try and generate some funds to help them,” he said.

“They don’t get any government funding and they have to buy all of their own equipment.”

The organisation relies solely on donations. Volunteers purchase expensive rescue equipment, cages, feed and formula as well as enclosures to secure recovering koalas.

“Most people that are donating are doing so because they feel sorry for Jimmy,” Mr Latter said. “Some people have given $100 which is very generous. Anything is wonderful.”

So far, more than $780 has been raised. Since snapping the iPhone photo Mr Latter said it had appeared around the world in countries including India, Indonesia, Holland, Poland, the UK and US.

“It’s been crazy, I never actually thought it would go this far,” he said.

Koala Rescue Hotline team member Jane Brister said the organisation was delighted with Mr Latter’s support. “He’s obviously a very lovely bloke ... we are absolutely thrilled to have his support because as volunteers, it’s a costly passion,” she said.

Floodwaters near where Jimmy was last seen — high up in a tree near Woodhouse Scout Camp on Old Carey Gully Rd at Stirling. — have since receded.

The Bureau of Meteorology predicts more showers in Adelaide today but then it should remain dry until Saturday.

Typhoon Megi's bands of heavy rain and 162-kilometers- (100 miles-) per-hour sustained winds blanketed the island by midafternoon as the eye of the storm made landfall on the east coast. Authorities had raised alert levels for the island prone to landslides and flooding, said National Fire Agency Director-General Chen Wen-lung.

The 268 injuries include eight Japanese tourists hurt in tour bus that turned on its side in central Taiwan. Three people suffered fatal falls and a fourth person died in a truck crash, said Lee Wei-sen, a spokesman for Taiwan's Central Emergency Operations Center. Many of the injuries were from falling and wind-blown objects.

Megi is 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter, and rainfall had topped 300 millimeters (12 inches) in the south and eastern mountains.



""The rainfall problem will get increasingly severe as the storm passes over,"" Lee said. ""We've got to see whether the amount of rain has a big impact. The only good news is that it's moving fast on its way over Taiwan.""

More than 8,000 people had been evacuated, mostly from mountainous areas at risk of landslides or floods. About 2,800 went to shelters, Chen said.

More than 2.9 million households lost power, though 976,000 had been restored by late evening, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency.

More than 121 flights were delayed and 253 canceled at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport, and seven were diverted to other airports. Authorities had closed schools, offices and most of Taiwan's railway system.

Megi is the fourth typhoon of the year to hit Taiwan.

On the Chinese coast, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from Taiwan at its nearest point, fishing boats were ordered back to port, the country's official Xinhua News Agency said.

This included thousands of songs, stories, chants and poems that could take hours to recite in full.

Today we are pretty spoiled. Practically the whole of human knowledge is conveniently available at our fingertips. Why worry about memorising something when we can simply Google it?

The answer seems pretty evident when we go into a panic after losing our smartphones!

Long before the ancient Celts, Aboriginal Australians were recording vast scores of knowledge to memory and passing it to successive generations.

Aboriginal people demonstrate that their oral traditions are not only highly detailed and complex, but they can survive – accurately – for thousands, even tens of thousands, of years.

Yet I struggle to remember what I did last Tuesday. So how did they do it?

Researcher Lynne Kelly was drawn to this question while investigating Aboriginal knowledge about animals for her PhD.

It was evident to Kelly that Aboriginal people catalogued huge scores of information about animals – including species types, physical features, behaviour, links to food and plants – and wondered how they do it.

A memorable thing

Aboriginal elders explained to her how they encode knowledge in song, dance, story and place. This led to a theory that may revolutionise archaeology.

It has long been known that the human brain has evolved to associate memory with place, referred to as the method of loci. This means that we associate memory with a location. How often do memories come flooding back to us when we visit our childhood haunt?

Loci (Latin for “place”), can refer to landscape features, ceremonial sites, abstract designs – anything with distinct features where information can be linked to memory.

Duane Hamacher , Author provided

Kelly developed this into a framework that may explain the purpose of famous sites such as Stonehenge, the Nasca lines and the Moai of Easter Island.

The meanings of these sites have been a topic of controversy for decades. What Kelly proposes in her new book The Memory Code is that sites such as Stonehenge and the Nasca lines are actually memory spaces.

Knowledge is power

In oral cultures, knowledge is power. It is imperative that the most important knowledge be maintained and preserved by a few select custodians who have proven their worth.

In Indigenous cultures, elders who have passed the highest levels of initiation hold the deepest levels of knowledge.

This is reflected in ceremonial sites where knowledge is passed down. Aboriginal initiation sites include a secret area where the most sacred knowledge is discussed.

We also see this at Stonehenge, where the perimeter of standing stones shields the centre of the ring, where the most important aspects knowledge are passed on through ceremony.

These sites include features that are unique in shape and form. At Uluru, the Anangu elders associate every crevice, bump, and notch around the perimeter of the mountain with knowledge that is stored to memory.

Star maps and memory

But loci is not only linked to places you can touch or visit. Indigenous people also use the stars as memory spaces.

For example, groups of stars can represent features on the landscape. Aboriginal Law Man Ghillar Michael Anderson explains how the Euahlayi people were able to travel long distances for trade and ceremony.

The Euahlayi would memorise star maps at night and learn the songs that talk about their relationship to the land. Each star was associated with a landscape feature, such as a waterhole.

Later in the year, they would sing the song as they travelled across country by day. These songline routes became the foundation of some of our highway networks that criss-cross the country.

Rather than navigating by the stars, the stars themselves serve as a memory space.

Robert Fuller and Google Maps , Author provided

In The Memory Code, Kelly provides new insights into how oral societies are able to store vast quantities of knowledge to memory without it degrading over time.

It may explain how Aboriginal memories of land that existed before it was flooded by rising sea levels during the last Ice Age survived in oral tradition for more than 7,000 years.

To test it herself, Kelly used the technique to memorise all of the world’s countries in order of population by linking them with features around her neighbourhood, including buildings and gardens – making up her own stories for each one. And she can now recite them flawlessly.

71,71,FL-2016-000103-IDN,14 strengths that make the Rafale a key addition to IAF’s fleet - India TV,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-14-strengths-that-make-the-rafale-a-key-addition-to-iaf-fleet-349455,"14 strengths that make the Rafale a key addition to IAF’s fleet

Equipped with latest missiles and weapon systems, Rafale, the ""gust of wind"" and ""burst of fire”, is well known for its air supremacy, in-depth and anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence missions.

India on Friday signed the much-awaited deal with France to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets worth Rs 59,000 crore (7.87 billion euro).

The deal is crucial for the Indian Air Force as it will give India a dominant status in the air.

Here are some key factors that put the jet’s strength into better perspective:

Here are key points explaining the strength of Rafale jet:

1. Available in three main variants, viz., the land-based Rafale C single-seat and Rafale B twin-seat versions and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based versions, the Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.

2. The Rafale can touch speeds of Mach 1.8 (1,912 km/h) in high altitude and Mach 1.1 (1,390 km/h) in low altitude. The Rafale C, Rafale B and Rafale M variants can carry loads of 9,850 kilograms, 10,300 kilograms and 10,600 kilograms respectively.

3. Great emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations. Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls.

4. The Rafale can carry more ordnance than any of its competitors, hands down. By contrast, the F-35 can carry only 4 munitions (e.g. missiles) while in its stealthy mode; the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the F-16 can carry only 11, and the Su-35 twelve.

5. The Rafale has the biggest gun on the market, equally placed with Sukhoi aircraft. It is laced with a hefty 30mm GIAT gun firing incendiary rounds. This makes the Rafale an excellent choice for both air to air and air to ground combat, as its 30mm rounds would provide excellent support for troops on the ground.

6. The Dassault Rafale is a relatively small, light airplane, which makes its wing loading ratio (the ratio of its weight compared to its wingspace) just 306 kg/sq m, the second lowest ratio on the market after the JAS-39 Gripen. Its combat radius is also impressive – 1,852 kilometers, again, the second-best in the market trailing only the F-15C/D. The Rafale also has an excellent rate of climb – 304 m per second, which means the plane can climb to its service ceiling (55,000 ft) in a minute.

7. Its speed of Mach 1.8, compared to Mach 2 or more for most other fighters could be one let down, but it fares better when compared to its principal competitor, the F-35, which is much worse at just Mach 1.61. This, however, is the product of a deliberate design aimed to optimise the Rafale for close, within visual range combat.

8. Rafale jets will come equipped with state-of-the-art missiles such as the Meteor and Scalp. With these missiles, Rafale will be a big strategic weapon under IAF’s umbrella. The Rafale is equipped with an RBE2 passive electronically scanned radar developed by Thales and has both look down and shoot down capabilities.

9. The Rafale engine features several advances including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures.

10. According to Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications. However, industry sources have highlighted the high cost its operational cost, which hovers above the Rs 11 lakh range for every flight-hour.

""The world sends us garbage. We send back music,"" said Favio Chavez, leader of the ""Recycled Orchestra,"" during a recent visit by the group to Los Angeles.

Chavez hit upon the idea of using trash to make music 10 years ago.

Orchestra members, impoverished children from Cateura, play violins fashioned from oven trays and guitars made from dessert dishes.

One cello is made from an oil barrel with wooden spoons and a stiletto heel for tuning pegs, while a discarded x-ray serves as the skin for a drum.

The orchestra provides the youngsters an outlet and an escape, a chance to transcend the squalor of their slum through the music of Mozart, Vivaldi and even Sinatra.

""In the beginning, it was difficult to play, but Favio helped me learn over time. From Favio, I have learned to be more responsible and value the things I have,"" 10-year-old violinist Celeste Fleitas told AFP.

Cateura, a shantytown of 40,000 people on the outskirts of the capital Asuncion, is one of the poorest communities in South America.

- Gang violence -

The destination for more than 1,500 tons (three million pounds) of waste each day, the community has no safe drinking water and little access to electricity or sanitation, so disease is rife.

Impoverished slum-dwellers -- many just children themselves -- rummage through the dump on the floodplains of the Paraguay River for scraps they can sell.

Illiteracy is rampant, and the children of the township often fall into drugs, gang violence and delinquency.

Chavez, a musical prodigy who was directing his church choir by the age of 11, came to Cateura as an environmental technician in 2006 and started a youth music school.

He knew shop-bought instruments were beyond the means of villagers whose shacks are worth less than a violin, so he approached carpenter Don ""Cola"" Gomez to make one out of debris from the dump.

It worked, and soon Gomez was manufacturing cellos, guitars and even double basses.

The orchestra caught the eye of Paraguayan filmmaker Alejandra Amarilla, the ex-wife of former LA Lakers basketbal player Steve Nash, who began filming the young musicians in 2010.

Amarilla uploaded a short clip of the orchestra to YouTube in 2012, hoping to secure crowdfunding for what would become ""Landfill Harmonic,"" a theatrical documentary being released across the US this month.

Within days, millions of people around the world had seen the footage, and donations poured in as the youngsters were catapulted onto the world stage.

""Landfill Harmonic"" follows the children -- many of whom had never left the slum -- as they embark on a tour of the world's music halls, playing for European royalty and even Pope Francis.

- 'Brighter future' -

Co-director Brad Allgood told AFP he wanted audiences to go away feeling inspired and motivated by Chavez's idea that you have to be dedicated, willing to work hard and be a team player.

""There is one line in the film that stands out for me, which is where he says 'To have nothing is not an excuse to do nothing',"" the Los Angeles-based director told AFP.

The orchestra has opened for heavy metal group Metallica, jammed with Stevie Wonder and Megadeth and spawned copycat projects across the world.

Toby Armoa, 15, has been a member for four years, practicing his saxophone fashioned from a drainpipe, bottle tops and coins for two hours every day.

""The community has changed a lot, because now kids are thinking about finishing school and staying away from drugs. Now they want to have a brighter future,"" he told AFP.

The ""Recycled Orchestra,"" which is building a music school in Cateura, has given the community a newfound respect for the importance of education and the sanctity of childhood.

""Before, kids would stop studying or they'd have to go to work but now education has become an important aspect of the community,"" Chavez said during the orchestra's Los Angeles trip.

""They may have fallen into drugs or other vices if this opportunity had not been there,"" he added.

""Music is a powerful force not only for the musicians. It unites people. It transcends linguistic barriers.""","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/newdesign/assets/images/bg/world/images_world_1.jpg?v=0.1,"['music', 'recycled', 'community', 'favio', 'told', 'world', 'gold', 'turns', 'los', 'orchestra', 'garbage', 'children', 'cateura']", 
73,73,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Indian farmers facing a Frankenstein moment? - Daily Pioneer,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/columnists/indian-farmers-facing-a-frankenstein-moment.html,"The US was perhaps the first country to see the rise of agri-businesses, which now wield enormous market power. Other developing countries, including India, too have followed suit. But they must learn lessons

A prominent international daily carried a full-page advertisement last week with a bold headline stating ‘How hard can it be to feed 8.5 billion people in 2030IJ’ This page was bought by the Global Agri-business Alliance, which it was explained involved over 35 agri-businesses and an alliance which was growing. Their mission was stated as being “to tackle the issues that jeopardise the future of millions of people around the world”, and this was elaborated on to include food security, water security and climate change.

The US was perhaps the first country to see the rise of agri-businesses, which now wield enormous market power, not just in that country but worldwide, but now other countries too have followed the suit. Concurrently, farms have also grown in size, and there is no place for small farmers in many economies, given the evolution of technology and mechanisation in agriculture, and the growth of industrial activity with employment in other sectors.

To some extent, similar trends are in evidence in India, and it would not be long before global agri-businesses will find ways of encroaching on the Indian agricultural sector in a big way, which given the size of the population engaged in this sector, is in for major social upheaval as a result. India has as much of a stake in preventing the growth of unhealthy market power being assumed by agri-businesses at the global level as it has within this country, simply because as time passes, global trends will make inroads into India as well.

In material terms, however, India can do little to curb developments in other countries, but there is need to utilise every forum to raise the concerns of the small farmer in India, Africa, Indonesia and even China. It is also the responsibility of the Indian media to study global developments which have the potential of causing harm to the welfare of small farmers in India and their counterparts elsewhere who similarly lack political or economic clout.

One particular development in this field which has aroused considerable concern worldwide and has triggered a fierce debate on its implications is the $66 billion takeover of Monsanto by Bayer. It is reported that the chief executive of Bayer has been stating in various interviews that this merger is nothing less in importance than saving the world. It is claimed that by improving agricultural yields, the combined company would meet the challenge of feeding a world population that is expected to grow by three billion by 2050.

It is claimed that the new giant company would be a one-stop shop offering seeds, crop sprays, digital solutions and advice to farmers across the globe. In Europe, in particular, it is Monsanto, which is seen as the undesirable part of this merger. In most of Europe, and in Germany, in particular, Monsanto is seen as the company identified solely with genetically modified seeds and crops — ‘Frankenfoods’, a term derived from Frankenstein.

Solutions developed by the merged juggernaut would be marketed and pushed down the throats of farmers across the globe, without regard for dietary preferences, the benefits of maintaining diversity and the needs of the small farmer, which may be at considerable variance with the interests of large landholders. In fact, large farmers too are concerned about this new development which is taking place against the backdrop of serious financial distress being faced even in the US. A particular farmer from Kentucky, interviewed by the media, estimated that his profit this year would vanish due to falling crop prices and rising costs of seeds and other material.

Farmers across the US are facing the impacts of the global downturn in agricultural product prices. Since they are saddled with a surplus in production, they are forced to slash prices in order to sell their produce. Financial distress is the major cause of farmer suicides in India, often exacerbated by prolonged drought or unseasonal rainfall. The impacts of climate change in the future would be manifest in the form of drought and extreme precipitation events in several parts of the world. These phenomena would have very special local characteristics, and solutions cannot be implemented with a one size fits all approach. While it is claimed that the new entity would be able to invest larger resources in research, it would not be optimal for a large company to spread itself into R&D activities specific to a diverse set of local conditions across the globe. It is for this reason that India set up the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under the leadership of BP Pal as its first Director General. An extensive network was established to assess local problems and priorities with specific focus on the needs of the small farmer, and the ICAR’s extension services performed remarkable service in the initial period, which is how the Green Revolution came about. But in future, with the power of multinational agri-businesses and decline in the innovative capacity of the ICAR system, the needs of small farmers would likely remain unmet.

In a globalised world, and with billions more mouths to feed, innovation in agriculture would have to be carried out extensively in every part of the globe. But improvements would have to focus on organic methods, the reduction in use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, efficient use of water and improved soil management. Such an approach would require significant involvement of the farmer himself, which given the dispersed nature of agricultural activities, would require public sector orientation.

Inputs from private enterprise would have to come at the demand of the public sector, and not at the behest of private interests. This is an area in which the major developing countries must take the lead in their own countries and at the same time shape public opinion in the developed world as well. The stakes are so high that if the interests of hundreds of millions of small farmers in the developing world are to be protected then a passive approach would be out of place.

Authorities on the Dutch Caribbean islands had urged residents to reinforce their homes and stock up on emergency supplies. Some streets flooded on Aruba and Curacao in the early hours of the storm's pass-by, though there were no reports of evacuations.



Matthew's approach prompted long lines at gas stations and supermarkets on the so-called ""ABC islands.'' Authorities in Aruba ordered government offices closed Friday and Curacao's parliamentary elections were postponed until next week.



The hurricane also was headed for a brush with the Colombia-Venezuela border area near the Maracaibo oil region on Friday.



Matthew was turn north on Saturday and head toward Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti as a major hurricane, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. It grew into a Category 2 storm early Friday with maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph) and forecasters said it could become even stronger before reaching Jamaica early Monday.



Matthew was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) northeast of Punta Gallinas in Colombia and 520 miles (840 kilometers) east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, Friday morning. It was moving west-southwest near 14 mph (22 kph).



Hurricane-force winds extended out for 45 miles (75 kilometers) and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 185 miles (295 kilometers).



Matthew caused at least one death when it entered the Caribbean on Wednesday, with officials in St. Vincent reporting a 16-year-old boy was crushed by a boulder as he tried to clear a blocked drain.

75,75,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Malaysia: Kelantan Indigenous Group Vows to Stop Logging - benarnews,https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/malaysian/logging-protest-09302016170747.html,"A spokesman for indigenous people in Malaysia’s Kelantan state vowed Friday to block a logging road in a protected forest until state officials stop granting licenses to cut down timber in the area.

Members of the Kelantan Network of Orang Asli Villages (JKOAK) set up the blockade earlier this week in an area they claim as their ancestral land, and rebuilt it late Wednesday after a tense standoff with loggers in which shots were fired, according to the activists.

“I cannot say how long we will be here but my friends and I will continue this blockade as long as the loggers don’t leave, as long as the forest clearing and logging doesn’t stop,” JKOAK secretary Mustafa Along told BenarNews on Friday.

“Our demand now is that for the state government to open their eyes, listen to our complaint and stop and withdraw all the licenses. As long as there is logging, our blockade will continue.”

According to footage of the confrontation Wednesday published by The Star, a Malaysian newspaper, a man used a chainsaw to tear down the bamboo structure while activists were still clinging to it.

A man also fired shots at the activists, according to one of them, identified only as Halim.

“A vehicle with two people inside stopped in front of us, and one took out a rifle and fired. After that, we didn’t have a chance to take a picture, we ran down into the forest. He got down, he put in another round and he fired again,” Halim said on camera.

Three of the men were briefly detained in a truck, according to Mustafa Along. He said the trio filed a complaint Wednesday night at the district police station in Gua Musang, a town in southern Kelantan about two hours from where the confrontation took place.

Gua Musang police deputy Sow Sing said Wednesday’s incident was being investigated.

“The situation is not as bad as reported. There were no shots fired,” he told BenarNews.

No contact

Malaysian indigenous rights activist and lawyer Siti Kasim told BenarNews that no state official had made contact with the indigenous activists since their protest began.

She claimed that contracts issued by Kelantan state government specify that logging companies should resolve any issues with indigenous people themselves.

“I saw a clause in one of the logging contracts. So as far as the state government is concerned, I suppose, they have protected themselves already, if any problem occurs. It’s really up to the contractors to sort it out with Orang Asli over any problems on the ground,” she told BenarNews.

She said the protesters were not against logging but wanted it to be done appropriately without “destroying the jungle and the mountain.”

Kelantan Deputy Chief Minister Nik Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah, who is in charge of the state’s regional development, land affairs and natural resources portfolio, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BenarNews.

An official with the Malaysia Chinese Association Kelantan Liaison Committee said Friday he had witnessed first-hand how rampant logging in the region had triggered soil erosion that cut road links and the access of Orang Asli to towns and food sources.

“It is baffling how the loggers obtained licenses for felling logs in Permanent Reserve Forest (PRF), when the land was purportedly meant to be conserved for ecological services such as water catchment protection and soil stabilization,” said the statement by Lua Choon Hann.

In December 2014, the East Coast state of Peninsular Malaysia was hit by the worst flooding in the past decade, displacing more than 100,000 people from their homes. At the time, the National Security Council secretary blamed rampant logging activities for worsening the flooding and landslides, according to Malaysian media.

On Thursday, Kelantan Forestry Director Zahari Ibrahim said that 7,248 hectares of more than 600,000 hectares of permanent forest reserves in Kelantan have been illegally occupied since the 1980s, according to Bernama, the state news agency.

The illegally cleared forest land was being used for agriculture, including palm oil production, and settlements, he said.

But on Friday, Natural Resource and Environment Minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar denied that permanent forest reserves in Kelantan had been cleared, according to the Malay Mail Online. “The Kelantan Forestry Department is actively monitoring developments on this issue,” it quoted him as saying.

76,76,FL-2016-000103-IDN,'Orphanage tourism': fears of child exploitation boom as Myanmar opens up - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/orphanage-tourism-fears-of-child-exploitation-boom-as-myanmar-opens-up,"There are several activities for tourists in the riverside villages south of Myanamar’s biggest city Yangon. Some take rickshaw rides around the fruit market or visit local pagodas. Others go to a private orphanage and spend the day unsupervised with a child.

“Tourists take the children out, to the zoo or downtown,” said the head of one orphanage of 16 children, a small wooden house built on stilts in flooded fields.

As Myanmar braces for mass arrivals following decades under military rule, Unicef is warning against the spread of “orphanage tourism”, whereby the institutionalised care of minors turns into a business, with children from poor families recruited to pose as orphans and extract money from well-meaning foreigners.

Already firmly established in Cambodia and Indonesia, children separated from their families are exploited as fund-raising tools, and in some cases their living conditions are kept deliberately unsightly to extract donations from visitors.

In its worse form, sexual predators have exploited the unrestricted access to children.

“Myanmar could see an exponential increase in the number of orphanages over the coming decade, especially in tourist destinations,” Aaron Greenberg, Unicef Myanmar’s chief of child protection, told the Guardian.

“Such an increase in orphanage care could violate the rights of tens of thousands of Myanmar children,” he added. “We need to act before orphanages dot the landscape.”

The country already has a culture of children from impoverished backgrounds being placed in government-run facilities, called training schools, where their parents believe they will receive a better education. And many thousands of others go to live in monasteries.

There is no data on how many unregistered private orphanages there are in the country but guides and hotels report that tours are in demand. One five-star hotel in Yangon had an orphanage visit on a stop for its river trip but has since ceased.

Many of Myanmar’s visitors are socially minded backpackers or retirees wanting to help the developing country, donating their dollars or euros to a worthy cause.

But Unicef points to nearly 100 years of research which it says shows that even the best institutionalised care puts children at risk of abuse and makes them vulnerable to psychological and developmental disorders.

It says the levels of violence in orphanages are known to be higher than in families; children raised in orphanages are known to have problems making healthy social attachments in adulthood; are more likely than their peers to have problems with substance abuse or come into conflict with the law; and children’s intellectual and emotional development is negatively impacted by orphanage care.

Even the word orphanage can be a misnomer, as in most cases of institutionalised care around the world the children still have one or both parents alive, Unicef says.

Of the 17,322 children at registered orphanages in Myanmar, only 27% are actual orphans, Unicef found. It fears that the growth of orphanage tourism could separate many more minors from their families.

The children at the facility visited by the Guardian appeared to be in good health, drawing pictures in books on the floor and playing games. The owner, a Christian pastor, said he established the orphanage 18 years ago to help children from all over the country.

However, immediately on entering, he made clear that donations were normally given and lamented the poor conditions of the orphanage — the small kitchen with a wood-fire oven, the single toilet, the one room where all 16 sleep. And he lauded how tourists had donated considerable sums of money. Some had bought bags of rice laid out in the room, he said.

The children had been found from across the country, he said, taken from “aunts, uncles and grandparents” deemed unable to look after them. “Sometimes the father is a drunk,” he said.

Unicef and other aid organisations promote kinship care, whereby children are looked after by living parents or extended families, who are provided with financial support as well as frequent supervision by social workers. The cost, Unicef says, is still much lower than institutionalised care.

But these alternatives do not exist in Myanmar, Greenberg said. “Currently there is no strategy in Myanmar for preventing children growing up in institutions,” he said, although he added the government has shown an interest in getting this issue on the agenda.

Leaflets warning visitors not to visit orphanages are placed in hotels and airports. And to show the government the industry’s damaging impact, Unicef arranged for a delegation of senior officials to visit Cambodia in 2014 where 15 years of orphanage tourism has led to an entrenched crisis.

The damage to the lives of thousands of children in Cambodia is a startling case study for Myanmar.

Unicef says that as the numbers of tourists in Cambodia grew by 75% over the last few years, the number of orphanages also grew by 75%, sprouting up around tourist areas.

Sinet Chan, a 26-year-old Cambodian whose parents died from Aids, was taken to an orphanage by her neighbours when she was nine but was immediately put to work on a nearby farm and was often punished and denied food.

The director of the orphanage raped her, she said.

Foreign tourists would make day trips to the orphanage of around 100 children and leave donations, which the director pocketed. If they gave books, clothes or food, he would sell them back to the market, Chan said.

“The director wanted us to dress up poorly,” she said. “We needed to perform to make the tourists happy, like a dance or a show.”

Some tourists would volunteer for several months and she developed strong attachments. When they left, she felt abandoned.

One volunteer was Tara Winkler, an Australian woman who subsequently rescued Sinet and others and set up a the Cambodian Children’s Trust to help reintegrate children with families from institutions involved in orphanage tourism.

“We realised that these kids weren’t orphans at all. They missed their parents,” she said.

“The important thing to note is that institutions that are corrupted and keeping children in poor conditions, that is the worst of the worst. But even the very best institutions are harmful to children. It kind of doesn’t matter how bad the institution is. It’s causing child-parent separation. The damage lasts generations.”

Myanmar plans to conduct more research into orphanages with Unicef’s support over the coming months and senior officials will meet again with their Cambodian counterparts at a conference on child rights in Malaysia in November.

After the Myanmar delegation returned from its Cambodia trip, the government issued a temporary moratorium on registering new orphanages, although in practice it is still possible to set up an unregistered facility.

Swiss child relief agency Terre Des Hommes is already working to reintegrate children back into their families. Starting with government-run training schools it has moved more than 700 children home, some of whom were picked up by police on the streets and considered to be orphaned.

And Swe Zin Oo, secretary general of the Myanmar Tourist Guides Association, a body of around 4,000 guides, said her group is now trying to stop travel agents from selling orphanage visits.

In one part of Yangon, she said, there was an orphanage run by a Korean man.

“He was working it as a business,” she said. “There were 20 to 30 children trapped in a house.”

But with an emergent tourism industry, she says, many guides work alone and do not know how harmful the tours can be.","Thu, 29 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3481189158c0afbeefe193d1c03224011fdbf262/0_118_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5acf9e789d88715638c13ed2d7a2017f,"['orphanages', 'fears', 'parents', 'boom', 'families', 'care', 'child', 'orphanage', 'exploitation', 'visit', 'tourists', 'unicef', 'tourism', 'opens', 'children', 'myanmar']",

78,78,FL-2016-000103-IDN,How Public-private Partnerships Can Help Build Nations' Brands - Knowledge@Wharton - Knowledge@Wharton,https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-public-private-partnerships-can-help-build-nations-brands/,"Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have gained popularity in recent years as a way to address social and economic problems that are difficult or impossible for a single entity to tackle — such as alleviating poverty, increasing access to education or building resilience to floods. Often aided by multilateral organizations like the World Bank or the World Economic Forum, PPPs bring together national governments, private businesses, civic organizations and donors. As the participants pool resources and expertise to address the problems, they also help create and strengthen their own brands — be it companies or nations.

Those benefits sustain the attractiveness of PPPs with multiple stakeholders, according to Gilbert Probst, managing director, Leadership Office and Academic Affairs and dean of the Global Leadership Fellows Program at the World Economic Forum in Geneva. He works in the area of managing growth, learning organizations and knowledge management, and consults with major companies worldwide. In this podcast, Wharton marketing professor David Reibstein, who has done extensive research on the growth of nation-brands, interviews Probst on key PPP issues. The discussion comes ahead of the Wharton Nation Brand Conference that Reibstein will host on October 28 in Philadelphia.

An edited transcript of the conversation appears below.

David Reibstein: I want to talk to you about public-private partnerships because you’ve done a lot of work in that area. How do you go about defining a public-private partnership?

Gilbert Probst: I don’t want to make it too academic. In general, there is a new collaboration paradigm. I truly believe that collaboration is the paradigm of the 21st century. [The origin of] public-private partnership goes back to the early 1990s. All over the world, both at strategic and operational levels, key players from the public sector, business and civil society are working out how to [collaborate] as partners to find long-term solutions to the most intractable problems facing us environmentally and socially, but also economically.

Reibstein: Could you give us a couple of examples?

Probst: Sure…. Public-private partnerships were commonly associated with tender-based infrastructure projects and contracting out. But in the last [few] decades, we have seen a trend towards public and private actors more collaboratively addressing societal challenges that one of them alone cannot solve. The areas are health, education, water [and] poverty — where we need all the different stakeholders to collaborate.

At the World Economic Forum, we have one [initiative] called “New Vision for Agriculture,” where you have 33 global companies, 19 governments, international and donor organizations, civil society organizations and farmer associations, and the idea is to build a leadership commitment to action, where you try to improve productivity, sustainability and economic benefits in agriculture. [It also aims to] improve whole value chains, and that’s typically where you have to include all the stakeholders. Most of the projects are in Asia and in Africa. It is a committed, multi-stakeholder network that tries to solve the problem of food security, and this includes the need for a new vision for agriculture.

The Tropical Forest Alliance (hosted by the World Economic Forum) is a new one that goes in that direction [of public-private partnerships], where again, one country alone, but also, business alone cannot solve such problems.

“I truly believe that collaboration is the paradigm of the 21st century.”

Other [public-private partnerships] are in water distribution and water use. That is a worldwide problem and probably one of the top problems. Much more important than oil and gas in the future will be water — where, again, a country alone or business alone cannot solve the problem.

Reibstein: Often, what I see is some coalition of countries working on a particular problem … like agreements about the environment. I’m trying to think about the role of companies in that, as well. In the New Vision for Agriculture, are there specific companies that are involved?

Probst: Oh, yes, there are. [It includes] BASF, Bayer, Cargill, banks like Rabobank and others. You [also] have Monsanto, Nestle, Unilever and Wal-Mart. They all are corporate champions that invest a lot of time, their experience and their knowledge. Then you have the countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines and India. You also have Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and others. You have global platforms and funding that come from countries like the U.S., Switzerland and the Netherlands. Then you have international organizations like the FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization), the High Level Task Force and the WFP (World Food Program). You have civil society organizations like the WWF (Worldwide Fund for Nature), Oxfam and GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition). They all agree that one alone cannot really solve a problem. That’s where public-private partnerships became so important.

Reibstein: We’re addressing big, public issues [with such partnerships]. I’m curious — are your companies participating in this out of philanthropic interests, PR interest or is there some economic aspect for those firms that is behind their motivation?

Probst: Well, there is an economic interest. There are a lot of different interests, actually, that come together. It can be because you have the experience and you see that you can contribute. Or you see the necessity. Necessity can be responding to investor or shareholder demands, and that’s something that is growing. It can be because you want to meet host government requirements. It can be because you can only fund or finance projects in collaboration with a nation. But it’s also creating legitimacy, in a sense — protecting or creating corporate brand and reputation.

I could say the same, by the way, for nations. It can be because you want to commit to values and principles and you want to show that you live up to them. One that comes more into play is attracting and motivating talented employees. There are several cases where we could see that — where at the beginning the company or the employees were reluctant to work for because they felt this is maybe not the core business or these are not the projects that have most visibility. And then, they got a lot of motivation and positive feelings out of it — also, a feeling that companies are contributing.

Another one is LET, or the Logistics Emergency Teams, where logistics companies got together to help in flooding or any catastrophic situation. (LET is an alliance formed by logistics and transportation companies Agility, UPS and Maersk and facilitated by the World Economic Forum to support the U.N. World Food Programme.) They invest in it because they get access to governments. Also, it is motivating for their employees. They can develop new services or new procedures.

Reibstein: I am hearing a multiplicity of motivations, one of which is that it’s good image-building for the company – within, for employees, to make them feel better about the company they work for, but also externally. Do some nations participate in these alliances because it’s good for their nation’s brand to be associated with these endeavors?

Probst: Absolutely. Nations participate, of course, when there is a need — when there are real problems. That’s one…. If you have a catastrophe, if you have a shortage of water and you can solve the problem, you go into public-private partnerships.

Reibstein: So that’s clear when we think about some of the African nations and some of the water shortages that might be there, as well as in electricity, et cetera.

Probst: Exactly. There should always be a problem that you want to solve. But it can also be that you realize that it is good for your brand, for nation branding…. If we think of the EU Commission [for example], you could see that [its president Jean-Claude Juncker in his State of the Union 2016 address] showed the investment plan for 315 billion euros through co-financing by the private sector in the European Investment Plan. And the plan [is part of] of a brand building approach for Europe.

The same is [the case with] sustainability. CSR (corporate social responsibility) contributes to the branding of a company, but it also does that for nations. An example that comes to my mind is Grow Africa, a platform created in 2012 to promote African agriculture through development partnerships. The acceleration of investments through public-private partnerships helps, of course, a nation also to look good, to [answer the question], “What is it that we really do, that we contribute?” And they need the multi-stakeholder platform [for those efforts].

“[In] the last [few] decades, we have seen … public and private actors more collaboratively addressing societal challenges that one of them alone cannot solve.”

If I take the Grow Africa platform — there is Unilever and Heineken and Cargill, but the interesting thing is that these are initiatives that help nations get a better image or get another brand. I remember there was an initiative within Grow Africa called The Growth Enhancement Support Scheme that was applied in Nigeria. [Akinwumi] Adesina, who was [Nigeria’s] minister of agriculture and rural development, invested a lot in that … to overcome corruption in the fertilizer and seed distribution channels. It aimed at connecting farmers directly to private suppliers by means of mobile phone technologies, and by doing that, bypassing the middlemen. This innovative initiative is a success thanks to the speed of the leadership of the [former] minister of agriculture. (Adesina has been president of the African Development Bank since September 2015).

It showed, of course, that they live up to what they promised. But at the same time, they created a trusted platform that not only spurred collaboration and development, but also created much more transparency. That is, of course, the impact of a national brand – [it] is there as a result, but has, also, an impact.

Reibstein: It’s a wonderful example. I’m assuming that what happened was that — first of all — food became more available and at a cheaper price within Nigeria.

Probst: Exactly.

Reibstein: So, it made [Nigeria] a better nation because of more abundance, healthier citizens and a little bit more affordable [food]. In that way, it helps Brand Nigeria — not just helping the brand, but it also helping the people of Nigeria. Were there other countries that were involved in that?

Probst: Yes; I think 16 countries were involved. This is a collaboration between, also, countries where they have to exchange. I just gave you an example [of Nigeria] because it was one country that also worked directly on its own brand in that sense, or created a much stronger brand.

Reibstein: In many of these partnerships, who’s really in charge? I am trying to think about the brand and the image that results from any of this. Everybody’s got their own particular interests, be it BASF, [which] is interested in trying to do something good and positive, but also, concerned about its brand, or Monsanto or any of the others. Then, [you have] the multitude of countries. So who’s really in charge of the project? And then, does everybody independently work on their nation’s brands and corporate brands — how does that work?

Probst: If it is one nation, an industry or if companies are involved — you create a contract or a partnership in an easy way. What you often have there is a broker, and this could be the World Bank or the World Economic Forum. Typically, that means the World Economic Forum plays the role of a broker bringing [stakeholders] together, creating structures and helping them to build a governance system. Then, it flies on its own.

GAIN, by the way, a typical one that came out of it, has become a big organization nowadays. Grow Africa is one that is still halfway now with the World Economic Forum, but on its way to being run afterwards as an independent alliance. But you’re right, the risk is that someone – say, countries, want to take over or want to take all the credit, or companies want to get more credit out of it. We have to [ask], “How can you create this?” And, “How can you make sure that it remains a partnership, and [each partner] stays as a partner and contributes?”

“We have to [ask], ‘How can you create this?’ And, ‘How can you make sure that it remains a partnership, and [each partner] stays as a partner and contributes?’”

Reibstein: Are these public-private partnerships addressing major societal issues on the rise? Or do these just episodically occur?

Probst: They’re on the rise. [From] the 1990s when it started, it doubled every three to four years, and there’s a huge [number] now of public-private partnerships. I think because people see the reason, they see there is much more experience, and of course, there is much more support. There’s huge support. If you take the World Bank, they are the largest broker, and there are hundreds of public-private partnerships — if you go on the website of the U.N., you can look them up. The same is true for the World Economic Forum as another typical broker.

But there are also much more in smaller cases. I have one that we just did research on — the Zurich flood resilience program — where a Zurich company goes with regions or nations like Nepal who have these problems. By the way, that includes the Wharton School. (The Zurich Flood Resilience Program is an initiative that includes Zurich Insurance, the Wharton School, the International Institute of Applied System Analysis, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Practical Action.) The Wharton School was brought in because they carry a strong emphasis on the behavioral aspects of risk management. Zurich Insurance had this vision, and [realized] we can do much better by building public-private partnerships. They [want to] expand it now. The Nepal example is very successful and they want to roll it out now [in other communities].

Reibstein: It’s interesting because you can identify a number of issues that call for these partnerships to exist. The latest one that just came to my mind is about different diseases that might be going around the world currently. There is some fear about the Zika virus, and you can imagine the World Health Organization working with various companies to try and address this issue. It affects the brand of certain nations, where Zika might be more prevalent and people worry about the risk of being in those particular countries. Gilbert, I find this to be a very, very interesting area. You’ve been doing a lot of work in this area, and as you say, it’s an absolutely growing domain. You have been contributing a lot – and through the work that you have been doing with the World Economic Forum that has been addressing some of the issues you note. Thank you very much for joining us today. And good luck with your work.

Probst: Thank you. There is a lot that we probably could continue to discuss. Nation branding is not something that most people are aware of…. But I think governance can do a lot there. It helps them to engage business in the policy dialogue. It provides all the stakeholders with better information and coordination.","Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PPP.jpg,"['nations', 'countries', 'world', 'companies', 'lot', 'build', 'help', 'publicprivate', 'partnerships', 'forum', 'brand', 'economic', 'brands']",

The Supreme Court today issued notices to Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav and former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in connection with the murder of Siwan journalist Rajdeo Ranjan.

Expressing grave concern over the alleged politician-criminal nexus in Bihar, the apex court also sought the response of Nitish Kumar government in this case.

The Supreme Court issued notices to Tej Pratap, son of RJD supremo Lalu Yadav, and Shahabuddin while hearing a plea of slain jounalist's wife seeking ransfer of the case to Delhi.

Rajdeo Ranjan's wife told the court that the case should be transfered to Delhi because she will not get a fair trial in Bihar.

The apex court issued notice to Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap for allegedly protecting the killers of Siwan journalist. The court issued notice to Shahabuddin who is accused of sending a sharpshooter to kill Rajdeo Ranjan.

Tej Pratap's picture with one of the accused in Siwan jounalist's murder case had recently gone viral which prompted opposition parties to accuse him of protecting the killers of Rajdeo Ranjan.

Mohammad Kaif alias Bunty, the accused in Siwan journalist murder case, is an alleged associate of Shahabuddin. He was absconding before being seen in photographs with Shahabauddin after the former RJD MP was released from the Bhagalpur jail.

Reacting to the SC notice, Tej Pratap Yadav said that BJP leaders who have a picture with Mohammad Kaif should also be sent out a notice.

BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was also seen with Mohammad Kaif in a photograph.

“So many people take pictures with me, we dont know everyone do we? They dont have it written on their faces, Tej Pratap Yadav said.

The apex court also asked the CBI to file a status report in this case by October 17.

The court also directed the Siwan SP to provide protection to the wife of the slain journalist.

80,80,FL-2016-000103-IDN,Colombo to become a smart city - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/colombo-to-become-a-smart-city/a-35900910,"Sri Lankan capital Colombo has been an important port city along the Indian Ocean for centuries. There is a natural port in the west of the island which was first used by the Portuguese and later on by the British. In the center of Colombo, buildings from the British colonial period can be found. Now the city also has modern offices and apartments as well as a financial complex in its heart.

The modern World Trade Center is only one aspect of the city. With a population of two million people, Colombo is a small city compared to other South Asian capitals. But Colombo's infrastructure has become outdated. Traffic jams and electricity shortages are frequent. Several slums have sprouted in the east of the city, where approximately 70,000 people live.

Several slums have sprouted in the east of the city

Urban chaos

Colombo is a typical South Asian city. Urban growth is often as chaotic as it is hidden, according to a recent report published by the World Bank.

Experts point to a lack of planning and hidden urbanization. The municipal administrators have insufficient statistics and knowledge of informal housing areas on the periphery of the city. Nobody knows exactly how many people live in shanty towns or have at least a rough idea about how many people need sanitary facilities, drinking water or electricity. In addition, the tropical climate, frequent typhoons and flooding are make the lives of the inhabitants quite difficult.

Colombo is one of the 30 least livable cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Livability Survey, which is released every year. The ranking is based on the level of stability, health, culture, environment, education and infrastructure. Compared to other South Asian cities, only Bangladesh's capital Dhaka is placed lower on the international livability list, placed 139 out of 140.

The mega project

But the World Bank experts believe Colombo has the potential to be a modern city. The port city is located halfway between Europe, Africa and East Asia, so it could become an international business and trade hub. But before this is going to happen, the city will have to modernize, a World Bank spokesman told DW: ""Sri Lanka's future success largely depends on how the Colombo Metropolitan Region is managed and positioned, not only within Sri Lanka, but also regionally and globally.""

The Colombo Metropolitain Area is the brightest spot on Sri Lanka's western coast

The Sri Lankan government is determined to take up the challenge. In 2015, it initiated the Megapolis project. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are planning to invest $40 billion (35.6 billion euro) to modernize the capital and its surrounding districts in the next 15 years.

Colombo is to become greener also. More pedestrian zones and parks have been planned and the city wants to showcase its historic landmarks. Social housing is aimed to improve the lives of people living in slums on the outskirts of the city. Additionally, the government hopes to attract foreign investment.

Forward-looking planning

Among others, German technology giant Siemens is involved in the planning of the mega project. In 2012, the company started its ""Global Center for Sustainable Urban Development."" In India, Siemens has been advising decision makers on a project launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi which aims to modernize 100 Indian cities, making them more attractive for their population. This project could be replicated in Sri Lanka, Martin Powell, director of the London-based Siemens urbanization center, told DW.

Experts point to a lack of planning in Colombo

""Developers of projects like the Megapolis need to understand that the decisions they are making around infrastructure investment have major consequences and that they need to come to a decision as early as possible,"" Powell asserted.

Siemens has come up with a special software, which allows developers to simulate different options and its ramifications.

""So, for example, if you put in a low emission zone, we can model what impact that would have on air quality and how much additional jobs this technology would create,"" he added.

At the same time, the software helps calculate costs and the amount of work involved, or if unpopular political decisions have to be made. Siemens' consultants also offer alternatives, but in the end the urban planners in charge have to decide what they want and what they can afford.

Sustainability and resilience

""Basically, any development project where you have more than 4000 or 5000 houses with businesses, industry and anything else associated with it, you can begin to get the 'economies of scale.' You can then really start thinking of energy and mobility solutions in a way that add value to these projects,"" Powell explained.

The 'economies of scale' is the cost advantage that comes with increased output or a larger scale of an urban solution. If you plan a decentralized power supply system for only four buildings, you have to invest a lot of money. But if you establish the same decentralized power grid for 4000 houses, you have to invest only slightly more, while getting the same service a thousand times over.

""Then planning really pays off,"" Powell emphasized. According to the Siemens expert, the biggest challenge for Sri Lanka will be building ""a really resilient and capable infrastructure.""

Resilience in this context means that the power supply has to withstand even extreme weather conditions like typhoons and floods. Businesses and enterprises will only come to Colombo if the city is able to guarantee that they can work and produce without any interruptions. And in order to take the traffic load off the city's streets, there will be the need to build a railway connecting the north and the south of Sri Lanka's capital, Powell underlines.

Planning ahead will definitely save money and prevent costly improvements afterwards, so the 'economies of scale' can be maximized.

However, Siemens is already looking ahead and is getting ready for the similar tasks. ""As soon as the tenders are made public for different projects, we will bid for the ones we feel we can successfully win.""","Tue, 27 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19557501_6.jpg,"['project', 'powell', 'smart', 'world', 'colombo', 'urban', 'sri', 'planning', 'south', 'city', 'siemens']",

India is the world’s third largest salt producer. More than 80,000 smallholder producer families harvest the salt in the Surendranagar district, its most prolific salt-producing region, in the dry months from October to May.



The farmers, many of them women and teenage girls, pump dense, briny water up to the desert plains through handbuilt wells and rake it constantly to form salt crystals as the water evaporates in the blistering sun. This year, the temperature in Gujarat reached a record-breaking 48.4C, making working conditions even harsher on this ancient, desiccated seabed.

Scientists predict that climate change is also likely to increase rainfall in the region: “If the rain falls in intense, irregular downpours, with extended dry periods in between, this could introduce a level of unpredictability to the traditional salt farming season, potentially disrupting production,” says Dr Friederike Otto, senior researcher at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.

Unseasonably heavy rains are already denting production, according to Reema Nanavaty, director of the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a trade union for smallholder female producers in India, with farmers losing up to a quarter, or 200 tonnes, of total production each season. Irregular monsoons can also cause delays to the season, and increased incidences of windy storms muddies the salt pans, compromising product quality and price.

By the time the farmers have paid for diesel to fuel their pumps, and services such as transport and fresh water to supply their makeshift villages on the edge of the salt flats, it can cost them up to $1.55 to produce each tonne of salt.

This means there’s often little left of the money they receive from middlemen per tonne of salt - approximately $1.78. Middlemen sell on the salt for a market price of around $4.15 per tonne, despite little additional processing beyond some refining.

But life for salt farmers is gradually changing. The Salt Workers Economic Empowerment Program (SWEEP), a joint initiative between the non-profit Global Fairness Initiative (GFI) and SEWA, is working to help female salt farmers in Gujarat gain the commercial and technical knowledge to farm salt more sustainably and profitably as the risk of erratic, extreme weather looms.

Founded in 2012, the programme currently supports 2,500 farmers. It provides technical training to improve farming techniques and salt quality, covering aspects such as drilling boreholes, improving salt pan layout and managing pumps more efficiently.

SWEEP also helps farmers collaborate to engage directly with more reliable buyers, such as the Indian government, to secure a better price for their salt. In this way, the women can achieve an average 64% increase in price (to $2.78 per tonne), according to Caleb Shreve, GFI’s executive director.

However, to truly improve the farmers’ livelihoods, Shreve says, it is vital to cut input costs. With this in mind, SWEEP has been helping farmers replace their diesel pumps with solar-powered ones over the past two years to lower the cost of production. Although solar pumps have a high upfront cost of $3,750, the women save an average of 45% on running costs annually compared to diesel pumps by reducing maintenance and fuel costs, according to Shreve.

Some 500 farmers have invested in the new pumps to date, taking a 90% loan from SEWA. The association provides the loans with interest rates of 14% and it is expected most farmers will repay the loan over four years, largely through diesel savings. India’s microfinance interest loan rates, in comparison, can exceed 26%.

With their improved income, Surendranagar’s salt farmers often invest in more salt pans, as well as further equipment and transport to run their farms independently, without needing to rely as much on third parties. Many also invest in education for their children, as well as better housing, food and clothing.

“The beauty of this scheme is that it helps one of India’s poorest traditional communities have a better quality of life in the face of climate change, while simultaneously cutting carbon emissions,” says sustainability expert Martin Wright.

Rosey Hurst, director of ethical trade consultancy Impactt, agrees that SWEEP is highly innovative, but cautions against writing off middlemen.

“Solutions that combine technology and market access are terrific, but our experience shows that middlemen in India can add a degree of flexibility to informal supply chains. Despite their sometimes exploitative nature, they can access new markets and insulate producers from market instability. It’s important not to close off this avenue, particularly given that helping smallholders build their capabilities to access new markets is challenging.”","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf56459c2c94b909c0fbd40c8f65fa9669656b82/435_814_2933_1760/master/2933.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70d8beab04fc194fcc3aa3a60d66dba8,"['pumps', 'tonne', 'production', 'martin', 'diesel', 'indian', 'farmers', '48c', 'farming', 'salt', 'edge', 'women', 'india', 'water', 'coping', 'producers', 'heat']", 
85,85,FL-2016-000103-IDN,"By focusing on its nuclear weapons and disasters, the West misses a lot about North Korea - The Conversation AU",https://theconversation.com/by-focusing-on-its-nuclear-weapons-and-disasters-the-west-misses-a-lot-about-north-korea-65436,"North Korea essentially has two international images: the bellicose nuclear provocateur run by a mad dictator, and the impoverished country in dire need of humanitarian aid. At the moment, both faces are on depressing display.

North Korea recently conducted its fifth nuclear test. As on previous occasions, talk of how to resolve the nuclear crisis ensued, with debates about sanctions, regional co-operation, and the rationality (or irrationality) of the Kim Jong-Un government.

This is of course a matter of huge international concern. But another major event hit North Korea around the same time as the nuclear test: Typhoon Lionrock caused widespread flooding that put over 140,000 North Koreans in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. International organisations and NGOs stepped in to provide aid. The Kim government acknowledged “great suffering” and deployed labour teams to assist affected communities.

These events evoke the famine of the mid-1990s, during which somewhere between 600,000 and 1m people died. As then, the irony of recent events wasn’t lost on outsiders: as North Korea’s people struggle, their government expends vast resources on a nuclear program that only isolates them further.

How do we navigate between these two images of North Korea? Is the country a serious threat to global security, or a weak state unable even to care for its population – or both?

On the move, slowly

North Korea often gets only sporadic Western attention, usually in the aftermath of a military advance or humanitarian crisis. Other noteworthy developments crucial for understanding the country, meanwhile, are overlooked.

Avoiding nuclear catastrophe in East Asia (and beyond) is essential and urgent appeals for aid are necessary and laudable. But between these extremes, North Korean society is changing, with serious implications for the country’s politics.

For example, North Korea’s economic system is far more market-based than the country’s communist political structures suggest. The mid-1990s famine shattered the state’s centralised rationing system, and most North Koreans have spent the 20 years since participating in one way or another in the country’s various (and often illegal) markets.

Time will tell what political impacts these processes will have. But what’s clear is that there are a number of vested interests that stand to gain from marketisation. Illicit trade along the border with China and even Russia has a big impact on the North Koreans living in those areas, and can help alleviate chronic shortages – in turn relieving a little pressure on the regime.

Political science research on sanctions shows that their record of actually achieving political goals (such as forcing authoritarian governments to liberalise) is spotty at best. As an alternative, perhaps the West should start coming up with another plan – such as finding a way to harness China’s economic success as a means to help ordinary North Koreans prosper.

After all, North Korea is well-known among Western governments for being the “land of lousy options”. If the economic equation changed substantially, a process border trade might speed up, better new pathways to dealing with the country could open up.

From the outside in

There’s another force with the potential to change the balance. The mid-1990s famine and its aftermath led tens of thousands of North Koreans to take the decision to leave their country. High-level defections like that of the deputy ambassador to the UK justifiably receive international attention, but it’s generally less well-known that there are now more than 27,000 North Koreans living in South Korea.

While the South Korean government offers some support to new settlers, many northerners still face serious challenges, among them the onerous task of adjusting to a new society, psychological distress, and unemployment.

But North Koreans living abroad can still influence the politics of their home country. They can speak out through memoirs, form civil society organisations in the South, and share their knowledge about North Korean society with researchers and journalists. Many can also communicate with family members who remain in the North, and send them information they would struggle to obtain in a highly restrictive and propaganda-rich country.

Nuclear and non-nuclear developments in North Korea are very much intertwined, and the outside world needs to understand the latter if it wants to take an informed approach to dealing with the Kim regime.

It’s not that issues between the extremes of a nuclear North Korea and a poverty-stricken one are entirely overlooked. To be sure, there are numerous journalists and academics who provide valuable insights into North Korea, even if rumour still muddies the water and concrete information remains scarce. Rather, the challenge for those who hope to change North Korea is to understand the social developments already underway and connect them with opportunities for political progress.

Thrilling footage shows the 200-pound male lizards rear up on their hind legs and grapple and wrestle with one another in a fight to assert their dominance.

The evenly matched contest went on for more than half an hour, according to witnesses, as neither animal could gain the upper hand.

The evenly matched contest went on for more than half an hour, according to witnesses, as neither animal could gain the upper hand

At one point one of the predators can be seen spitting his venomous saliva at his opponent.

The footage was taken at Rina Island, Komodo National Park in Indonesia by Australian wildlife photographer Chris Bray, 33, from Sydney.

'As is often the way in dominance battles fighting males are not trying to kill each other; just doing whatever's necessary until one finally realises that he's not as powerful as the other, and then it'll throw in the towel and run away,' he said.

'If they are evenly matched like here then it can go on for some time and become more vicious than normal.

'The ranger said sometimes in these battles one can be thrown awkwardly and break a leg or similar that can end up in the dragon subsequently dying, but usually they both survive.'

92,92,FL-2016-000103-IDN,How the moon and big tides could be a trigger for big earthquakes - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-quake-tides-20160924-snap-story.html,"It’s one of the most enduring mysteries in earthquake science: Why do small earthquakes stay small, while others grow into monsters?

A group of researchers offered a partial, but tantalizing answer this month: The moon and big tides.

How does this work?

The scientists zeroed in on times of high tidal stress, which can occur twice a month, during the full moon and new moon. During these moments, high tides are at their highest — flooding the tallest reaches of a beach — and about six hours later, low tides are at their lowest for the month, with seawater retreating to the farthest point toward the ocean.

This produces massive movement of ocean water and produces high tidal stress. And that tidal stress can change the stress on the fault, and, these scientists suggest, help push small earthquakes that happen to grow into very large earthquakes.

“When tides are very large, small earthquakes tend to grow,” Satoshi Ide, lead author of the report and professor of seismology at the University of Tokyo, said in an interview.

“This suggests that the probability of a tiny rock failure expanding to a gigantic rupture increases with increasing tidal stress levels,” Ide and his coauthors wrote in the report, published this month in the journal Nature Geosciences.

Or put another way: The tidal forces give a slight nudge to a fault on the cusp of rupturing.

“It could be just the amount of stress that is the ‘straw that breaks the camel’s back,’ so to speak,” said Nicholas van der Elst, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist. “So it makes sense that an earthquake would be more likely to happen, and coalesce into a larger earthquake, if there is just a little, additional, push.”

As a result, when tidal forces are at their largest, under this idea, “earthquakes have a slight tendency to grow larger than they would otherwise,” van der Elst said.

What are some examples of these types of quakes?

The magnitude 9.1 Indonesia earthquake in 2004 and magnitude 8.8 earthquake in Chile in 2010, which both produced damaging tsunamis, occurred around the time of a full moon, close to the peak time of tidal stress, the study said.

The research adds to a growing body of research investigating how tidal forces can affect the earth’s movement. Tidal forces — which besides the oceans also affect solid rock — are also believed to be related to small tremors deep underground along the central San Andreas fault in Monterey County, according to a study earlier this summer, which was coauthored by van der Elst.

Tidal forces, of course, are not the central reasons why an earthquake ruptures. The primary cause of earthquakes is the Earth’s moving tectonic plates, which are constantly grinding against each other. Between the tectonic plates, strain builds up on faults until the pressure is released suddenly by an earthquake.

Indeed, Ide said, many earthquakes will still happen when tidal stress is low.

“Earthquakes are nearly a random process,” Ide said. “Tidal forces are just a factor in a complex process. There are a lot of other factors.”

How can this research help earthquake safety in California?

While the Japanese study offers an idea why large earthquakes can occur, it does not help scientists predict the exact time and locations when a deadly earthquake will hit. That is widely seen as impossible to predict.

But work like this study is important to help scientists achieve a very important goal: understanding how and why large earthquakes happen.

“One of the outstanding questions in seismology is: How do you get from a small earthquake to a big earthquake?” said seismologist Lucy Jones.

One idea is that they all start the same way, and whether they continue to grow depends on what they stumble into, such as tidal stress.

Another theory is that there are some other physics involved, and how large earthquakes begin is inherently different than how small earthquakes start.

Whatever the answer is, a solution would offer big rewards for the public and would improve the speed and accuracy of an earthquake early warning system for megaquakes.

How would an early warning help?

The earthquake early warning system works well in calculating, moments after an earthquake begins, the magnitudes of moderate earthquakes. Within a second of rupture, the system would calculate a magnitude of up to 4.5, and moments later, the system can calculate quickly up to a magnitude of 6 with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Beyond that, however, there’s a problem.

“The great San Andreas earthquake is going to take two minutes to happen,” Jones said. In one hypothetical scenario, she said, “at the very, very beginning of it, we’ll see that it’s at least a 6, at the Salton Sea. Forty-five seconds into it, we need to be able to recognize that we’ve now grown to a 7.5, and the fault has extended up to the San Bernardino Mountains — it’s now a lot closer to a lot of other people.”

During the 2011 Japanese earthquake — a magnitude 9.0 — that nation’s earthquake early warning system underestimated the intensity of shaking in Tokyo moments before more intense shaking waves hit the capital, Jones said.

“If we can ever solve this problem, of what makes an earthquake big — we’ll make a huge advance in what we can predict during an earthquake as it’s going on,” Jones said.

Ajit, 38, studied MBA (marketing) but quit his job to pursue his passion for photography. He studied postgraduate diploma in photography from Light and Life Academy, Ooty, in 2007 to take up photography as a profession.



He developed interest in underwater photography when he went scuba diving in Sri Lanka. He decided to get specialised training in underwater photography and enrolled at the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) in Sri Lanka. He trained in deep sea diving, technical diving, wreck diving among other types of sea diving at the PADI in 2007.



After training, there was no looking back for Ajit. He has a diverse collection of images, from marine life to the historic World War II wrecks besides ship and plane wrecks. Some of his collections are displayed across the globe. His passion has taken him to several places in the world. He has also done underwater photography in Komodo Islands (Indonesia), the Antarctica and Mexico.



Ajit says that underwater photography is more challenging and sometimes life-threatening. He once had a near-death experience while exploring the world under water at a depth of about 120 feet in the sea. “Underwater photography is difficult. Sometimes, strong ocean or sea currents can drift a diver several kilometres away. Venomous marine life and killer whales also pose a threat,” he says.","Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/2020/05/19/572449-1169905593-1474866361.jpg,"['diving', 'shipwrecks', 'underwater', 'world', 'life', 'bermuda', 'photography', 'wrecks', 'went', 'shutterbug', 'shoots', 'training', 'sea', 'bengaluru', 'triangle', 'studied']",

Former Sydney resident Jessica Kumala Wongso, 27, took the stand on Wednesday for the first time since being charged with the premeditated murder of her friend, Wayan Mirna Salihin.

Ms Salihin died on January 6 after sipping a Vietnamese iced coffee ordered by Ms Wongso, whom police allege spiked the drink.

Prosecutors peppered Wongso with questions at Central Jakarta Court yesterday, demanding details of her movements at the cafe immediately before the alleged murder.

'We were just sitting and chatting, until Mirna drank her coffee,' Wongso was quoted as saying by The ABC.

'And then she said that the coffee tastes awful, it all happened so fast, so if you ask me the details of how it happened I can't answer.'

Her lawyer later said Ms Wongso appeared relaxed during proceedings because she was telling the truth.

'A little lie needs to be covered with a bigger lie and so on, and so we did not make up anything,' he told the ABC.

Both Ms Wongso and Ms Salihin studied together at Billy Blue College of Design in Sydney, but Wongso stayed to work in Australia after her graduation in 2008.

Australian police and forensic experts have been providing assistance to Indonesian investigators in the case, which has captivated Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation.

Earlier in the week the court heard that Ms Wongso's former Australian boyfriend, Patrick O’Connor, requested an urgent restraining order against her, the Jakarta Post reported.

Senior Constable John Torres, from NSW Police, told the court that Mr O’Connor felt he was in danger due to Ms Wongso's deteriorating psychological condition and that she was threatening self harm.

Mr Torres also read the court more than a dozen police reports about Ms Wongso between 2014 and 2015, most of which detailed self-harm incidents but one which concerned a drink driving charge, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ms Wongso has denied the charges and Australian forensic pathologists presented by the defence have said that it was unlikely that cyanide was the cause of Ms Salihin's death.

Over the last 30 years, floods and earthquakes alone caused 50,000 fatalities, affected nearly 25 million people, and resulted in US$80 billion in damage. While disaster profiles and vulnerabilities vary across Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan; all three countries, however, share in common a predominant seismic risk.

Given the seismic profile of several countries in the ECA region, the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), with support from the Government of Japan and other donors, recently invited government representatives from Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan to take part in an Experts Visit to Japan. This visit provided an opportunity for participants to improve their respective crisis management systems by learning first-hand about Japan’s experience in disaster preparedness and response systems at national and local levels. Japan, a country that has accumulated much knowledge and operational experience in disaster risk management (DRM) through its own experience with recurring natural disasters, has actively promoted cooperation at a global level to reduce the number of disaster-related victims. Through ""Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in Developing Countries"", the World Bank DRM Hub, Tokyo, GFDRR, and the Government of Japan have been working closely to mainstream DRM in national development planning and investment, including World Bank operations, by capitalizing on Japanese expertise and best practices.

The level of coordination and dedication displayed during public awareness activities in Japan was one of the most impressive features of the visit, according to visiting delegates from the ECA region. In Japan, these can also be included within wider commemorative events such as disaster simulation drills. The Government of Japan held the National Simulation Drills at state level and 36th Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Drill of Nine Prefectural and City Governments, hosted by Saitama City on September 1, 2016, a coordinated effort to simulate a comprehensive emergency response to a major earthquake in the Nankai Trough (off the central and western coast of Japan). This important exercise is normally taken place on ""Disaster Prevention Day"" in Japan, commemorating the devastated earthquake happened in Kanto region in 1923. On the same day, various disaster simulation drills were taken place in 36 out of 47 prefectures, and mobilized 1 million participants across the country.

Over the course of a week, Armenian, Kyrgyz, and Tajik officials engaged in discussions with a wide range of national agencies and municipal authorities in Japan, which are involved in several DRM activities:

In Tokyo, delegates also had a Courtesy Call with the State Minister (in charge of disaster management) from the Cabinet Office of Japan – an agency responsible for supervising disaster management efforts at a national level – to discuss challenges and opportunities in implementing DRM measures. Based on observations of the simulation drill in Saitama City, the delegates committed to propose a similar exercise once they return to their respective countries. In terms of follow-up steps, the State Minister offered further collaboration between the DRM Hub, Tokyo and the Cabinet Office in disseminating Japan’s knowledge and expertise in disaster risk management.

The delegates also met with officials from the Urban Safety Division of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) to discuss lessons learned from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and learn more about the national system of municipal subsidies, which are used for building more resilient urban fabric.

In their meeting with the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA), participants were particularly interested in J-ALERT, which can instantly transmit emergency information, such as earthquake and tsunami early warning, both via satellite and online from the central government to the local governments and designated communication hubs such as major media and mobile operators. The information is then immediately disseminated to local residents through various devices such as outdoor broadcasting systems and cellphones (via emails and text messages).

The visit also featured concepts of resilient urban planning, and showed how these have evolved in Japan – also known as Bousai Machidukuri . Delegates were also able to meet with the Kobe City Government to study how the City of Kobe was able to learn from the disastrous consequences of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, and re-think their approach to improve municipal preparedness measures and streamline post-earthquake city redevelopment efforts.

Delegates were also able to meet with the Kobe City Government to study how the City of Kobe was able to learn from the disastrous consequences of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, and re-think their approach to improve municipal preparedness measures and streamline post-earthquake city redevelopment efforts. To better understand the function of risk communication measures in Japan, delegates were able to interact with a group of residents in Bunkyo neighborhood in Tokyo, which proactively promote “self-help” approach to improve emergency response capacity at the community level. The delegates also visited the Maiko High School in Kobe City to observe unique initiative to foster young leaders in the community through disaster resilience education is fully integrated into the high school curriculum.

This visit offered valuable insights that will support at-risk countries in the ECA region in mainstreaming disaster preparedness measures and urban resilience considerations into their respective policies and programs. Acknowledging the proactive approaches to DRM, which are undertaken in countries like Japan, the World Bank and GFDRR, are committed to expanding such efforts on seismic risk reduction and management in the ECA region and will continue to support the Governments of Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan as they shift away from a reactive disaster response system to a more integrated disaster risk management and resilience-building approach.","Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2016/sep-1/jp-event-090116-02.jpg,"['countries', 'urban', 'kyrgyz', 'delegates', 'disaster', 'tajikistan', 'drm', 'earthquake', 'city', 'practices', 'national', 'shares', 'republic', 'region', 'improve', 'resilience', 'management', 'preparedness', 'japan']",
