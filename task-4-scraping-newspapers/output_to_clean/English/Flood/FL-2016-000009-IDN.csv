Jakarta, the world’s second largest city, is regularly devastated by flooding during the annual monsoon. The global proliferation of smartphones has meant citizens increasingly take to social media networks to share information during emergency events like these.

That’s why PetaJakarta.org (Map Jakarta) was born: it’s an online platform that transforms Twitter into an emergency data gathering and critical alert service during flooding in Jakarta. Last February, by asking residents to confirm the flood situation where they were, PetaJakarta.org was able to map 1,000 flooding sites across the city in real-time. The resulting flood map was used by the general public and emergency services alike and was viewed more than 160,000 times.

As far as we know, it is the first site of its kind to produce a real-time map of flooding in a city, driven by social media reporting. It allows citizens to contribute information without requiring them to learn a new technology, and provides answers to critical questions such as: “should I leave work early today?”, “is the evacuation shelter open yet?”, “which routes to my child’s school are flooded?” and “has the flood in my neighbourhood receded?”

Perhaps the most significant success of the system was its use by the Jakarta emergency management agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta). In 2015 the agency used PetaJakarta.org as an early warning system, allowing it to identify and cross-verify locations of flooding, speed up its response, and communicate with residents in flood-affected areas in real-time.



Reports from PetaJakarta.org were also fed directly to the Jakarta Smart City dashboard and to the office of the governor to provide a city-wide overview. At the launch of the platform in December 2014, the governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, called on government employees and residents to report flooding as part of their civic duty.

Bantu kami memetakan banjir. Jika daerahnya kena banjir bisa lapor via twitter ke @petajkt dgn tanda #banjir cc: @BPBDJakarta — Ahok Basuki TPurnama (@basuki_btp) January 23, 2015

Governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, encourages reporting of flooding using PetaJakarta.org and Twitter.

Jakarta’s citizens are keen users of smartphones and social media - a 2012 study found Jakarta the most active city in the world on Twitter.

A Jakarta resident reports flooding, including water height, using Twitter and the PetaJakarta.org platform.

This month PetaJakarta.org has begun to train 1,001 government employees how to use the platform during flood events and a second version of the platform has been launched, which integrates reports from the government-sponsored citizen-reporting app Qlue and Pasangmata, a citizen journalism app created by the Detik news agency.

The new version of the map will integrate flood reports with official government data, including river gauge readings and flood heights. This will provide a single point of reference for the emergency management agency to identify and alert residents to locations of flooding in real-time.

Rising river levels are reported on the site.

While previous funding initiatives have focused on networks of digital sensors to measure changes in the environment as part of the drive for smart cities, on their own these sensors do not create resilience. Digital sensors cannot provide context, convey urgency, or describe where aid is required.



Resilience is built by communities and agencies before, during and after a disaster. Resilience includes the work of volunteers, such as those in northern England who, following recent flooding, organised to clean streets, clear debris, and distribute aid to those in need.

In the information vacuum that follows disasters, residents the world over are organising themselves using social media. With extreme weather emergencies becoming more common because of climate change, cities and governments will need to harness that power.

Tomas Holderness and Etienne Turpin are co-directors of PetaJakarta.org, a project led by the SMART Infrastructure Facility

Linkedin Marguerite Afra Sapiie (The Jakarta Post) Purwakarta, West Java ● Mon, January 18, 2016

Hotel operator Archipelago International has recently grand launched its latest establishment in Purwakarta, West Java.



Situated two kilometers away from the Sadang toll gate, part of the Cipularang toll road that connects Jakarta and Bandung, the three-star Harper Purwakarta particularly targets corporate business players as it stands near industrial areas, says Archipelago International CEO John Flood.



""The location is strategic and provides a good market. There are many businesses and industries in the area and it's easily accessible,"" Flood recently told a press conference in Purwakarta.



Harper Purwakarta is the third Harper hotel in the country after Harper Kuta in Bali and Harper Mangkubumi in Yogjakarta. It has been operating since being soft opened in Sept. 15, Flood added.



The property infuses rustic warmth and a homey residential feel with a combination of wood, stones and fabrics that dominate the interior design. It provides 130 rooms, ranging from 110 superiors, 16 deluxes and four suites, as well as seven meeting rooms, one ballroom and two swimming pools.



The Rustic Bistro and Bar, the main restaurant, features local foods with Sate Maranggi Kuah (roasted skewered meat with watery sauce) as its signature dish that represents Purwakarta's tourist attraction, as Harper aims to take Sate Maranggi to the international level, the hotel manager Rini Resniawati said.



""We have coordinated with the Purwakarta tourism agency to feature the regency's culinary signatures and highlight its traditional food as a tourist attraction,"" said Rini.



She said that Harper would also cooperate with the local administration to promote tourism in general, which was in line with Purwakarta Regent Dedi Mulyadi's vision to promote the regency as a tourist destination where people could take leisure breaks.



Harper Purwakarta sales and marketing manager Chrisantus Louis added that, in the future, Harper would expand its outdoor facilities such as its outbound attraction and the Waterbom park behind the hotel, where up to 75 percent of the four-hectare property was still underdeveloped.

Enlarge this image Joseph Daniel Fiedler for NPR Joseph Daniel Fiedler for NPR

Maybe El Niño isn't as bad as its reputation.

El Niño is an ocean-warming phenomenon in the Pacific that crops up every few years and alters world weather patterns. And the world is in the middle of a big El Niño that roughly began in May 2015 and will continue for at least several more months this year.

This El Niño has already been linked to a series of weather-related disasters: Massive flooding in Paraguay. Drought in Ethiopia. Another looming food crisis in Madagascar and Zimbabwe.

But for all the doom and gloom, scientists say there's also a silver lining here.

To understand why, you need to go back to the last time the planet was hit by an El Niño this big — in 1997. That event, which lasted through 1998, seemed particularly devastating to poor countries.

""A lot of people were looking around at the climate impacts and starting to create lists of how expensive that El Niño event was, how much damage it was costing,"" says Columbia University climate scientist Lisa Goddard.

Then, as now, there was a lot to add up: flooding in Peru, drought-fueled wildfires in Indonesia, a severe malaria epidemic in Kenya caused by excessive rainfall. The tab reached into the tens of billions of dollars.

""The conclusion that was coming out was that El Niño events were very costly, were very damaging, were very extreme,"" she says.

But Goddard, who heads Columbia's International Research Institute for Climate and Society, had her doubts. After all, she notes, ""Different parts of the world experience extreme climate in any year.""

Were extreme weather disasters really more likely to occur across the world during El Niño years?

""What we found was that they weren't,"" says Goddard.

In fact, what she and a colleague concluded after an extensive review of the data is that what distinguishes climate disasters during an El Niño isn't that they're more severe or more numerous. It's that El Niño-produced disasters are more ... predictable.

Goddard explains that scientists know an El Niño is coming when — for reasons that are not fully understood — the waters of the Pacific become unusually warm. That warming ""reorganizes the seasonal pattern of weather — like where the jet stream is carrying the storms,"" she says. The signature pattern of an El Niño has been well-documented.

How El Niño Changes Weather Patterns El Niño conditions produce a well-documented shift in seasonal weather patterns. Over a roughly 14-month period that often starts in May, certain regions of the world receive far less rainfall than usual, while others receive far more. This map shows the areas affected during at least some point in the cycle. However, the specific impact varies from one El Niño to the next.

What's more, the stronger the El Niño, the more pronounced the effect — and therefore the more accurately scientists can predict the impacts. So this current, extra-powerful El Niño has offered governments and aid agencies a rare chance to prepare.

Take the United Nation's World Food Program. Richard Choularton is overseeing a groundbreaking shift there. They're monitoring the El Niño forecasts to identify places where a natural disaster might hit so they can send aid money proactively.

For example, explains Choularton, ""If you need a certain amount of rainfall for a maize crop to grow, and the forecast says there's a 60 percent chance that you'll get less than that, we trigger funding for communities to do things that will help them deal with a drought.""

Now, in this scenario that would mean there's a 40 percent chance there won't be a drought. The WFP could end up spending money that wasn't needed. But Choularton says it's worth the risk because preventive aid is so much cheaper than emergency aid.

""In fact, this is what's given us the confidence to be able to say we should be able to act before something happens based on the forecast, because we know that we'll save money in the long run.""

WFP is setting up this pilot effort in five countries where El Niño-related weather could create food shortages in the coming months: Guatemala, Niger, Sudan, Zimbabwe and the Philippines. The International Red Cross has launched a similar program for Uganda.

""That's never happened before,"" says Choularton. ""It really is changing the fundamental way we do our work from one which is reactive to one which is anticipatory.""

Still, forewarned hasn't always meant forearmed in this El Niño.

Especially in Indonesia. Every fall, everyone from small farmers to big companies there set fires to clear land for palm oil production. It's always a problem. But this past year, the El Niño created extra-dry conditions. Any fires were bound to get out of control. And the government did spread the word.

""Of course they told people about the situation,"" says Rizaldi Boer, director of the Center for Climate Risk and Opportunity Management at Indonesia's Bogor Agricultural University.

But Boer says in many cases the warnings only encouraged people to set fires. They thought it would be the ideal year to do it, says Boer, because the fires would burn more easily and they could clear land more quickly. ""They really made use of the situation to get more land.""

The result was fires that raged for weeks, choking the region with smoke, sickening hundreds of thousands.

Boer says the solution for the next El Niño will be to give people a better reason not to set fires — cracking down on offenders, of course, but just as important is offering financial rewards to villages that resist the temptation.","Fri, 22 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/01/19/el-nino-illo-final-50_wide-ce684076329360dc1d7884a156302a77ffb47897.jpg?s=1400,"['niño', 'theres', 'does', 'world', 'fires', 'drought', 'bring', 'el', 'weather', 'disasters', 'lining', 'choularton', 'floods', 'silver', 'set', 'climate']",

6,6,FL-2016-000009-IDN,"A historically xenophobic metaphor has been used by Trump, Limbaugh, Obama —and us? - PRI",https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-01-29/historically-xenophobic-metaphor-used-trump-limbaugh-obama-and-us,"There is a metaphor so embedded in the discussion of refugees and migrants that everyone from Donald Trump to Barack Obama uses it. The New York Times has put it in headlines, and Rush Limbaugh has wielded it like a hammer in his full-throated style.

It’s the image of refugees or migrants as water, as in “waves of refugees” or “the flow of migrants.” It can also become a “flood” or a place can be “swamped” by recent arrivals. Professor Gregory Lee at the University of Lyon calls this the “inundation metaphor.” His research has led him to conclude that it has racist, xenophobic baggage and should generally be avoided.

We know this at PRI because Lee didn’t hesitate to point it out to us on Twitter.

@pritheworld 'flowing', like 'waves', an emotively charged word pertaining to racist imaginary which sees people as a ""flood"". Pls avoid it. — Gregory Lee 利大英 (@GBLee) January 6, 2016

Lee came to this conclusion while studying media about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1892. The bill, which was the first law to ban a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the United States, was passed amidst a fervor of anti-Chinese immigrant sentiment.

“I noticed that the press had been instrumental in bringing about that shift in public opinion, and so I started looking at elements of language that were recurrent,” Lee says.

The common theme he found in the news and popular culture of the time was the “trope of inundation,” as he described it in an academic paper published in 2007. Over and over again, “unwanted immigrants of color” were described as ""pouring in,"" ""swamping,"" ""flooding in,"" or as “as coming in ‘tides’ and ‘waves.’""

One example he cites is a New York Daily Tribune report from Sept. 29, 1854. The piece refers to the growing Chinese migration as an ""Asiatic horde"" and weaves in the flood metaphor:

They are pouring in upon California. Their great companies are shipping them to that region by thousands as coolies... Already there are 40,000 there, and the cry is still they come. If the tide continues they must yet outnumber whites on the Pacific; and they are not like the European immigration to the Atlantic States, for they have no sympathy with Americans, whether in religion, habits or language.

As Lee dug deeper, he found other examples of the same imagery being used in explicitly racist and xenophobic contexts. German sociologist Klaus Theweleit, for instance, studied the role of the indudation metaphor in the rise of facism and Naziism. A passage from one particularly prominent fascist writer, Edwin Erich Dwinger, described Germany after its defeat in World War I like this:

The whole world poured out over Germany: Americans and New Zealanders, Australians and Englishmen, Portuguese and French. The bitterest pill to swallow was the stationing of blacks everywhere by the French: Moroccans and Senegalese negroes, Indochinese and Turks.

Fast-forward to now, and the metaphor is still being used in full force.

“We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don’t know if they’re ISIS, we don’t know if it’s a Trojan horse.” - Donald Trump on “This Week,” Nov. 22, 2015. Have you by now seen the massive amount of refugees flooding all parts of Europe? Now, why is that happening? It's not immigration. It's not immigration or illegal immigration or what have you. It is an invasion, and it is the direct result of things. - Rush Limbaugh, Sept. 4, 2015.

And it's not just being used in conservative circles. President Barack Obama has himself used the “inundation metaphor.”

“....even without ISIL, even without al Qaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa, and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.” President Obama, State of the Union, Jan. 13, 2016.

There are, of course, degrees. “Flow” is generally less aggressive than “wave,” and wave is mild compared to “flood,” but Lee maintains that that the metaphor should be avoided all together. He cites an article published last September in the the Los Angeles Times by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist David Horsey as a particular egregious example.

When comparing the current refugee crisis to historic ones, Horsey wrote: “Today’s much larger crisis could be the first gush of a human tsunami that will swamp the continent.” The accompanying cartoon depicts Europe as castle, whose outnumbered defenders are surrounded by a dense cloud of people labeled “refugees” and “immigrants.” The outsiders have a speech bubble that reads, “Let us in,” while the castle’s defenders are saying, “We need a bigger moat.”

Horsey is generally not an anti-immigrant writer or cartonist. He has lampooned anti-immigrant sentiment in the US, and in one striking image, compared Trump’s singling out of Muslims to the treatment of the Jews in Nazi Germany. But Lee argues, at least in the September cartoon, he should have been more sensitive to the larger discourse. He would say the same of PRI when we’ve used terms like “waves” or the “flow” of refugees.

“It’s not a question of if it’s incorrect. It’s a question of how it reinforces an image of people, in this instance, immigrants or refugees, which can then be twisted and manipulated by people,” Lee says. “There is this whole set of words that just become banal and seem to be normal. We have to remember that it is a metaphor. People don’t flood, and people don’t flow. People migrate, they move, they arrive, they pass through, they travel.”

There are, though, people who are just as vigorous in their defense of refugees who disagree. Sonny Lê, a 51-year-old Oakland resident, was among the first so-called “boat people.” About 2 million refugees left Vietnam from 1978 through the mid 80s. Many were ethnic Chinese fleeing persecution. Lê was only 15 when he boarded a boat in 1980, and spent nearly two years in refugee camps in Singapore and Indonesia before resettling in the US.

While attending a nearly all-white high school in Clayton, a suburb east of San Francisco, he was mocked and bullied for being “VC” or “Viet Cong,” even though he fled the Vietnam to avoid being drafted to fight for the communist regime.

Lê finds that little has changed in how the situation for refugees is framed. He finds words like “hoard” or “swarm” to be clearly derogatory, but he takes a more nuanced view of the “inundation metaphor.”

“I would object to 'flood,' but wave has been used so much I don’t think it has the same sting as 'hoard,' because when you have a massive group of certain individuals come in a certain given time, figuratively, a wave seems to describe it. ... I don’t have any problem with that term,” he says.

But what about Lee’s argument that just using the metaphor reinforces a negative stereotype?

“We can sit here and philosophically wax about it, but listeners, they don’t really get that far. When it’s on the news, in the news story, the average news consumer isn’t going to make that connection,” Lê says.

One journalist who has done a lot of thinking about the language media uses when talking about migrants and refugees coming in search of asylum by boat is Ben Doherty, the Guardian’s correspondent in Australia. From 2008 to 2011 he was a reporter in Southeast Asia, where he often covered refugee crises and forced migration, such as the the Hmong fleeing Laos, the Rohingya's exodus from Myanmar and the flight of Tamil people from Sri Lanka. In Austalia in 2014, he found the refugee issue was increasingly at the center of political discussion there, and not always in a good way.

""It was very apparent that the language was being used to manipulate public opinion, to frame and shape the direction of the discourse,” he says.

When it comes to the “inundation metaphor,” Doherty cautions against being too prescriptive, and creating rules about which words writers can and cannot use. Instead, he urges journalists to think carefully about the words they use. Last year, as a visiting fellow at Oxford, Doherty wrote a paper that details the history of “The semantic struggle over seeking asylum in Australia.” Many of the issues will be familiar to people who follow the immigration debate in the US, such as the tension over the use of the word “illegals” to describe immigrants who arrived in the country illegally.

“If someone’s an 'illegal,' as a government, it gives you not only the right but also the imprimatur to then detain someone, to lock them up, or to send them for offshore processing, because this person has done something wrong,” he says. “If you describe someone as an asylum seeker, they are someone looking for sanctuary. So the language, I think, actually provides a framework that you can then create a government policy around.”

That's one area where Gregory Lee, Sonny Lê and Ben Doherty all agree — this discussion, about the language we use when we talk about refugees and migration, is an important one to have.

“Language matters, and that’s why you need to be precise, and break it down and explain it in a way that people understand it, without having to make assumptions about what you say,” Lê says. “You have to consider what comes out of your mouth. As the saying goes, your tongue is connected to your heart.”

This week, nine Aceh citizens filed a class action lawsuit against the plan.

The plaintiffs call the plan illegal, and they want Jakarta to follow up on its promise to revoke it.

With the filing of a class-action lawsuit today in Jakarta, a bitter fight over the future of one of Sumatra’s last intact rainforests will move to the courts.

Registered by nine Indonesian citizens from the country’s westernmost province of Aceh, the suit — lodged three months after a warning letter sent to the home affairs ministry went unanswered — challenges the legality of a set of zoning laws passed by the Aceh parliament at the end of 2013.

Those land-use laws, known collectively as a spatial plan, were ordered to be revised by the home ministry back in February of 2014.

More than two years later, the unrevised spatial plan remains in force.

“This case is clear-cut,” Nurul Ikhsan, attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “All we ask is for the minister of home affairs to uphold its own legal authority and cancel the Aceh spatial plan, and for the Aceh government and parliament to revise it.”

The 2.6-million-hectare Leuser Ecosystem — a stretch of pristine, biodiverse rainforest widely deemed one of the most precious landscapes left on earth — lies at the heart of the dispute. At the national level, the ecosystem has been designated a protected area. But Aceh’s spatial plan fails to mention Leuser, leaving it open for development.

The plan “effectively legalizes numerous new roads, many of which have already been cut and constructed illegally through vast areas of the forests, fragmenting the sensitive ecosystem and opening up new pathways for destruction,” said Farwiza Farhan, chairperson of the NGO Forest, Nature and Environment of Aceh (HAkA), and a plaintiff in the case.

Leuser contains some of the best remaining habitat for the Sumatran varieties of elephant (Elephas maximus sumatrensis), orangutan (Pongo abelii), rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), all critically endangered species.

The lawsuit, however, seeks to illustrate the human costs of exploiting Leuser’s forests, which are falling at a rate of about 5,500 hectares a year, according to 2011 estimates by the Leuser Ecosystem REDD Project.

From South Aceh district, which overlaps with southern sections of the ecosystem, plaintiff Sarbunis will testify to the devastating floods that 23 mining operations have unleashed on his community.

Abu Kari, an indigenous leader from coffee-rich Gayo Lues district, will discuss the sudden vulnerability of his people’s customary lands, which he says can now be cleared with a single signature from a local government official.

On the other end of Leuser, says Dahlan, the plaintiff from North Aceh, healthy forests are essential to the welfare of the hundreds of thousands of citizens who live in or near the ecosystem.

The “countless ecosystem services” provided by Leuser, he said, “serve as an irreplaceable life-support system for the people of Aceh and North Sumatra, providing clean water supplies … in addition to preventing environmental catastrophes such as flash floods and landslides.”

Some observers have wondered if the prospect of aggravating relations with the Aceh government, which enjoys special autonomy as part of a 2004 peace deal that ended a decades-long separatist conflict, might be behind Jakarta’s reluctance to revoke the spatial plan. Farwiza, the HAkA activist, believes such a perspective is too simplistic.

“It is true that the Aceh [government] has this aura because it is ‘special,’ or untouchable, and therefore can do whatever it wants,” she said. “But in reality, the central government has been pretty firm about things like the [separatist] flag and this year’s budget. For some reason they haven’t been that way about the spatial plan. It could be because [the central government] has its own interests at stake.”

Dozens of oil palm companies have already obtained permits to operate in Leuser, but the scale of industry there pales to that of, say, Tesso Nilo National Park in Sumatra’s Riau province, which has been mostly destroyed by illegal plantations.

In the near future, the panel of judges will examine the class action suit and attempt to initiate a process of mediation. But Abu Kari, the plaintiff, is playing a long game, one for which he said the stakes could not be higher.

The bank withdrew a total of 445,000 fake banknotes from circulation in the second half of the year, down 2 percent from the first half of the year, which witnessed 454,000 counterfeit notes removed for a total of 899,000.

The number was approximately 61,000 more than 2014, and nearly 40,000 more than the previous record set in 2009, which stood at 860,000 notes.

The majority of the counterfeit bills discovered to be in circulation were 20-euro notes, comprising 46.2 percent of all those removed in the second half of the year. Fifty-euro notes were the second-highest denomination removed from circulation.

However, despite the unprecedented number of fake banknotes in circulation, the ECB that the number is ""still quite small"" compared to the amount of real notes.

""The number of counterfeits remains very low in comparison with the increasing number of genuine banknotes in circulation (over 18 billion during the second half of 2015),"" the ECB said in its biannual report on counterfeiting in the eurozone.

In November, the ECB introduced a new 20-euro banknote that featured improved security features to curb counterfeiting.

MY WIFE and I recently arrived at Grantley Adams Airport after a 15-hour journey and were relieved that the queue through Immigration, although long, was processed quite smoothly.

However, our pleasure was short-lived as after picking up our luggage we were horrified to be confronted by a line of at least 200 people, also laden with cases, waiting to hand to a single Customs official a copy of the immigration form.

Since we had previously queued and handed to Immigration the top copy of the same form, what is the point of this exercise? As far as I could see, Customs was not actually looking into anyone’s luggage, which in any case had already been examined and X-rayed at the point of departure.

It took a long time for the single officer to deal with each person’s forms – a long wait for passengers who were already hot and tired and anxious to meet prearranged pick-ups or find a taxi.

For first-time visitors this was not a good welcome and did not give a good impression.

My wife and I have been coming to beautiful Barbados for many years and love the island, and this letter is written in the spirit of constructive criticism.

Two Australian brothers who run a chain of chiropractic clinics in Indonesia have been arrested for allegedly working illegally.

Jakarta police detective chief Krishna Murti said Thomas and Anthony Dawson tried to escape through the roof of their office in Permata Hijau in South Jakarta when they were arrested on Wednesday night.

Senior Commissioner Krishna said they did not have the correct work permits.

He said the brothers, who had opened five Chiropractic Indonesia clinics in Jakarta, could face up to five years in jail.

The clinics, most of which were in upmarket shopping malls, have been closed.

Senior Commissioner Krishna said the men could be detained for up to 20 days at Jakarta police station - with the option of an extension - before they are handed over to the Jakarta prosecutor's office.

Police have cracked down on chiropractic clinics in Indonesia following the death of Jakarta woman Allya Siska Nadya in August last year.

Ms Allya died after she was treated for neck pain at an unrelated chiropractic clinic in Jakarta by American practitioner Randall Cafferty, who has since fled the country.

There is no suggestion any patients were harmed at Chiropractic Indonesia clinics.

On the Facebook page of Chiropractic Indonesia Pacific Place Clinic, dated January 7, Anthony Dawson, wrote that patients may have heard of ""a death of a young lady that may or may not have been related to chiropractic care"".

""Although she was not a patient in our clinic, our hearts go out to that family and we hope they find resolve.""

Dawson, who police said was the director, wrote that the profession had been established since 1895 and was in all major countries. ""We think that this incident is more related to an individual who should not have been practising anywhere in the world.""

Dawson wrote that he encouraged patients to make sure their friends who went to other clinics had standards of the high level patients received from Chiropractic Indonesia.

""In Chiropractic Indonesia, our doctors are qualified with adequate experience, plus degrees and we have working permits to work in Indonesia.""

Head of the law enforcement unit of the South Jakarta Immigration office Toto Suryanto said it appeared as though there was a problem with the work permit of Thomas Dawson.

""In the work permit it says he was a consultant. In reality he is also helping with giving services to the patient,"" Toto said.

Senior Commissioner Krishna said the Australian Federal Police had been contacted after the men were arrested.

""This afternoon AFP will come to see us. We have to coordinate with them, we want to get more information,"" he said.

Senior Commissioner Krishna said a taskforce was set up with Jakarta police and the Jakarta manpower, health and immigration ministries after Ms Allya's death.","Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/9/g/v/i/o/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.19gvju.png/1453981921365.jpg,"['australian', 'jakarta', 'krishna', 'arrested', 'commissioner', 'chiropractor', 'brothers', 'patients', 'wrote', 'chiropractic', 'clinic', 'work', 'running', 'illegal', 'indonesia', 'clinics']",

Some come from Calais, where it is now impossible to cross through to England because of increased security at the port of Calais and the Eurotunnel site which includes strict security measures such as devices that detect heartbeats. Others arrived after being expelled from Teteghem camp in Dunkirk which was dismantled. People also come from further afield, for example Germany but each person comes because they want to reach Britain.

What are the nationalities?

The Grande-Synthe camp is mostly populated by Iraqi and Iranian Kurds, with some Syrian Kurds. There are also Iranians, Kuwaitis, Iraqi Arabs and Vietnamese. Unlike Calais, where there are Eritrean and Sudanese communities, there are no people of African origin in Grande Synthe. The majority of people in Grande Synthe are either from active conflict zones, were discriminated against in their own country, or were targets of political violence.

Why was a decision taken to move the camp?

It is impossible to make improvements at the current site, because it is too small, overcrowded and prone to flooding. The mayor also wants to use the land to build a new eco-development. The 2,500 people who are at the camp are in danger, in poor conditions and exposed to subzero temperatures.

Why is MSF working in Grande-Synthe?

Faced with the influx of migrants and refugees in his borough, the mayor asked the French government for help to improve the appalling conditions. When the government refused, he asked MSF to step in. MSF is now forced to compensate for the deficiencies of the state.

Because improvements are not possible at the site, the first priority was to find a new, more appropriate place to set up the temporary camp. Land that can accommodate 2,400 people was identified by the mayor and is now being rented by MSF.

The mayor said that he felt he had to act because he feared waking up to the news that a child had frozen to death.

How will MSF develop the new site?

The objective of the new camp, which will be built by MSF with support from the municipality of Grande Synthe, is to provide people with acceptable conditions that allow them to maintain their health and dignity.

500 tents, 23m2, each big enough for five people, will be installed, as well as toilets and showers in sufficient numbers to meet minimum humanitarian standards. The tents will be appropriate for winter and heatable.

Community spaces will also be provided, which can be used for cooking or for children to play in.

When will the camp open?

Work started on the site as soon as MSF got permission. It will take 4-5 weeks to complete. Major work is needed, including levelling the ground, building an access road, installation of water and sewerage pipes as well as electricity cables. The tents will not have electricity.

We will also need to prepare and install the toilets and showers - there will be 126 toilets and 66 showers.","Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.msf.org/AssetLink/833y31g47ef3wt35ly6g7t7363mqsmsb.jpg,"['msf', 'conditions', 'synthe', 'msfs', 'grande', 'questions', 'camp', 'mayor', 'work', 'frequently', 'france', 'tents', 'site', 'toilets', 'showers', 'asked']",

SINGAPORE (AFP) – Indo nesian extremist groups received international financing from Australia and Syria, the country’s security minister said Monday, adding to fears that jihadists are targeting the world’s most populous Muslim nation.



Luhut Panjaitan was speaking at a defense forum in Singapore less than two weeks after coordinated gun and bomb attacks in Jakarta left four civilians dead.



He said about $800,000 were found last week to have been sent to Indonesian extremist groups.



The Islamic State group (IS) has claimed responsibility for the January 14 attacks, spurring concerns it is getting a foothold in Southeast Asia.

“We are tracing right now… how they (Indonesian extremist groups) get finance,” Mr. Panjaitan said.



He said about $100,000 came from the Syrian city of Raqa, the capital of IS’s self-styled caliphate, to support extremist activities in Indonesia, and about $700,000 came from Australia.



He said it was not known where the money had come from in Australia.



“Right now our agencies are working very hard, trying to monitor this financing support, because without financing I don’t think they can move more aggressively,” Mr. Panjaitan said.



He did not give other details about the funds.



Mr. Panjaitan stressed the need for greater international cooperation, saying no country could fight the threat alone.



He cited information shared by Australia with Indonesia on the flow of funds, in addition to a communication hotline with Singapore as examples of “good cooperation” between countries.



Mr. Panjaitan also said the weapons used in the Jakarta attacks were smuggled from the southern Philippine island of Mindanao to the Indonesian town of Poso.



Mr. Panjaitan and Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said financing and logistics support from overseas were evidence that terror groups in the region were improving their coordination.



“There is an international financing network which you must try to strangle and choke to cut off the flow of funds,” Mr. Ng told reporters at a joint news conference with Mr. Panjaitan.



“The more we cooperate the stronger we become. This is a fight that may last many decades, we need many partners in this,” Ng said.



Singapore last week disclosed it had arrested 27 Bangladeshi construction workers last year for supporting “the armed jihad ideology” of militant groups like IS and deported 26 of them.



Officials said that while the workers were being groomed to carry out attacks in their home country and elsewhere, they could have easily turned against Singapore.

24,24,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Contraception Drones Are The Future Of Women's Health In Rural Africa - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/contraception-drones-are-future-womens-health-rural-africa,"BALI, Indonesia -- In late 2014, a group of public health experts and philanthropists were grappling with the problem of how to improve contraception access for women in the most remote, hard-to-reach villages in rural Africa, where a flood can shut down the roads for days and cut off medical supply chains. It occurred to them to borrow an idea from Amazon: Unmanned delivery drones.



""We thought, 'Hang on a minute. We can use this for something else!'"" said Kanyanta Sunkutu, a South African public health specialist with the United Nations Population Fund.



The idea grew into a successful pilot program called Dr. One, which has for months been successfully flying birth control, condoms and other medical supplies to rural areas of Ghana on 5-foot-wide drones. The pilot program, which is jointly funded by UNFPA and the Dutch government, is now expanding into six other African countries in hopes of revolutionizing women's health and family planning across the continent. The drone operator simply packs the vehicle with contraception and medical supplies from a warehouse in an urban area and pilots it over to places that are difficult to access by car. There, a local health worker meets the drone and picks up the supplies.



""Delivery to the rural areas used to take two days,"" Sunkutu said at the International Conference on Family Planning in Bali, Indonesia. ""It will now take 30 minutes.""



Access to birth control is a massive problem in Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, where fewer than 20 percent of women are using modern contraceptives. The World Health Organization estimates that 225 million women in developing countries around the world would like to delay or stop childbearing, but lack reliable birth control methods. The lack of access leads to exceedingly high rates of unintended pregnancy in these areas, which prevents women and girls from finishing school or becoming employed. And roughly 47,000 women a year die of complications from unsafe abortions.



The idea of using drones to improve reproductive health options is not a new one. In June, a Dutch organization called Women on Waves used a drone to fly medically approved abortion-inducing pills from Germany to Poland. The purpose of the flight was to raise awareness of Poland's restrictive abortion laws. But so far, Project Last Mile is the first to develop a sustainable, long-term program for contraception delivery by drones.



Sunkutu said he expected the pilot program in Ghana to encounter significant obstacles. He was worried that residents receiving the shipments would associate the contraception drones with war drones. As a result, UNFPA and its partners exclusively refer to the tiny planes as ""unmanned aerial vehicles"" in their program materials. ""We don't want that link between war and what we are doing,"" Sunkutu told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""But the resistance we thought we would get has not been there.""



The pilot program in Ghana has been so successful and cost-efficient -- each flight costs only $15 -- that the governments of several countries have offered to take over the program and pay for it themselves. Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Ethiopia and Mozambique have all expressed interest in using the drones for family planning. Sunkutu hopes that at some point in the future, the vehicles will revolutionize many other areas of life in rural Africa.



""They can deliver ballots after elections, or exams for school,"" he said. It becomes a logistics management solution for hard-to-reach areas. We're going to use family planning as an entry and make it sustainable.""

They are not involved.","Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/768x600/public/01-27-16/kenya_abortion.png?h=252f27fa&itok=flUmFWW2,"['future', 'health', 'women', 'pilot', 'family', 'sunkutu', 'contraception', 'womens', 'areas', 'drones', 'rural', 'africa', 'planning', 'program']", 
25,25,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Cambodia making a play for more factories - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Cambodia-making-a-play-for-more-factories,"There are growing expectations that the Southern Economic Corridor, which cuts through the lower part of the Indochinese Peninsula, will soon buzz with activity. The corridor is a highway linking Bangkok with Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City. It also stretches west from Bangkok, to Dawei, Myanmar, a city that opens to the Indian Ocean.

Thanks in part to the ASEAN Economic Community, which officially kicked off in December, factories are beginning to sprout up in Cambodia, the corridor's biggest beneficiary.

Border towns

About a two-hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City, along a 70km stretch of highway with two lanes in each direction, is Moc Bai, a town along the border with Cambodia. After stepping out of our Vietnamese taxi, which would only go as far as Moc Bai, I walk to Bavet, on the other side of the border.

The Tsubasa Bridge, which opened to traffic in April, has 121-meter-tall towers and is 1,500 meters long. Except for the bridge, there are no streetlights along the highway between Bavet and Phnom Penh.

Unlike the European Community just before its integration, the border's existence cannot be missed. Travelers have to go through immigration and customs on both sides.

Bavet has about 10 casinos, including Le Macau and the Las Vegas Sun. With only foreigners eligible to access casinos in Vietnam, Vietnamese cross the border and gamble away their dong in Bavet.

The town, however, has another face -- that of a special economic zone which hosts foreign export companies. Special economic zones are one-stop industrial parks that provide a variety of services -- investment project registration, help with export and import procedures as well as other assistance in cutting through red tape. They also promise necessary infrastructure, such as water supply and sewerage systems.

An arrangement between Vietnam and Cambodia allows Vietnamese vehicles, including trucks, to go 20km into Cambodia. SEZs have been created along Cambodia's Route 1, part of the Southern Economic Corridor, for export convenience and to allow companies to dip into the cheap labor pool.

Since Cambodia has been exempted from tariffs and import quotas by Japan, the U.S. and Europe, labor-intensive sewing industries have assembled in the area, hailing from China and Taiwan. Taiwanese and Chinese bicycle parts factories have also been set up; they use the tariff incentives and export their products to Europe.

Watch-related companies are also getting in on the action. Nihon Seimitsu, a Japanese company based in Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture, started producing bezels in Bavet's Dragon King SEZ in March 2014. It is trying to create a ""watch village"" by inviting related companies to set up factories around its plant. Of Nihon Seimitsu's 130,000-sq.-meter site, its factory only takes up 40,000 sq. meters. A Hong Kong watch band maker took over another 50,000 sq. meters for a factory of its own, shifting its production from China.

Three other companies are expected to start operations there. Nihon Seimitsu also plans to invite final assemblers to its growing village.

""We will take care of companies starting production here in all aspects, including recruitment of employees and provision of meals,"" said Tomiyuki Arai, president of Nissey (Cambodia), Nihon Seimitsu's local subsidiary.

It is often the case that a finished product maker brings subcontractors to an overseas location where it has a plant, and a cluster of factories grows organically. Nihon Seimitsu has taken the opposite approach.

Bavet is said to have created 50,000 jobs in total, but its future is not altogether rosy. The area has seen severe labor disputes in the past several years. The legal minimum wage spiked from $61 a month in 2010 to $140 this month.

The current minimum wage ""is about the same level as in Moc Bai,"" said Yukio Higashimoto, president of Nakayama (Cambodia), Osaka-based Nakayama Shoji's local subsidiary that handles sewing of baby clothes. Moc Bai is right on the other side of the border.

""In Vietnam, there are no strikes and there is no need for customs clearance,"" Higashimoto said, appearing envious of a Taiwanese factory beyond the border.

Phnom Penh SEZ

Phnom Penh is about 170km from Bavet. About equidistant from each is Neak Loeung, a Mekong River town. In April, the Neak Loeung Bridge, also known as the Tsubasa Bridge, was completed with official development assistance from Japan, smoothing the way for transportation between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh. The bridge also helped to draw interest to the corridor.

Before the bridge was built, the Mekong split the highway. It could only be crossed by ferry, and sometimes drivers had to wait seven hours just to catch one. The road between Bavet and Phnom Penh is narrower, one lane each way, but its surface condition is good, and Phnom Penh can be reached in about three hours.

It has no streetlights, however, and it is said transport companies avoid sending drivers out at night.

In Phnom Penh, traffic congestion has become part of everyday life. Lexuses and other large cars fill the pavement. Some places have high-rise buildings. The capital, not long ago ravaged by civil war, has revived splendidly and is somewhat reminiscent of its former self, when it was called the Paris of the Orient.

The vigor of its economy can be seen inside Aeon Mall Phnom Penh, which opened in June 2014. It is the country's first mall-type shopping center. When I dropped by Aeon Phnom Penh Store, the mall's anchor tenant, one recent night around 8, a light-meal restaurant on the first floor was filled with diners.

The Aeon group plans to open its second Phnom Penh mall in the summer of 2018.

This is the entrance to the Phnom Penh SEZ. Toyota Motor and Denso have secured sites just inside.

On the consumption side, Phnom Penh is full of life, but the city is also accumulating industry at a remarkable clip. The draw is the Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone. About eight years after shovels first began getting the 3 million-sq.-meter zone ready, in 2007, a little vacant lots remained.

Ajinomoto led the way in moving into the zone in 2010. In 2011, Minebea started producing small motors at a factory and Sumitomo Wiring Systems began operating a wiring harness plant.

The following year was big for the SEZ. Japanese companies operating in China and Thailand had begun looking for alternative production centers after anti-Japanese protests erupted in China and floods left many factories in Thailand under water.

That year, a record 15 companies started operating factories in the Phnom Penh SEZ. More recently, Coca-Cola has begun constructing a plant and Toyota Motor has secured a temporary storage site in the zone.

At present, 73 companies are listed as operating in the SEZ, and 18,000 people work in it.

There are now plans to expand the SEZ by 570,000 sq. meters.

The Southern corridor between Phnom Penh and Bangkok consists of three main routes, two of which pass Poipet, a boomtown on the Cambodian side of the border. For Thais, Poipet means casinos. But the town has Bavet-like aspirations and hopes to lure companies wishing to expand their operations in Thailand.

As such, a movement to develop SEZs that would accept ""Thailand Plus One"" investments is gaining momentum. The company that developed and operates the successful Phnom Penh SEZ plans to open an SEZ in Poipet at the end of this year.

Sanco Poipet became the city's first SEZ. An automotive seat cover factory of Yokohama-based NHK Spring is under construction; it is to be the zone's first factory. ""Labor costs here would be about $200 a month per worker, including the minimum wage, transportation and lunch,"" said Tomoshige Yamada, SEZ general manager at Phnom Penh-based Sanco Cambo Investment Group, which developed and operates the SEZ. ""In Thailand, employment would cost at least $350 per worker.""

The SEZ sits about 3km from the border.

On a site adjacent to the NHK Spring factory, Toyota Tsusho plans to develop a park and fill it with factories it hopes to rent out to small and midsize autoparts makers.

One of the first things that struck Ethiopia's outgoing ambassador to Australia upon arriving in Canberra was the kindness of his new neighbours. Whether at the embassy in Red Hill or at his home in O'Malley, His Excellency Arega Hailu Teffera noted how readily the people on his street welcomed him and offered support. ""All of [the neighbours] knew us and were very ready to help us; the Australian people are humble and supportive,"" he said. The first resident Ethiopian ambassador to Australia, Mr Teffera started his country's Canberra mission in December 2013. He will soon leave for a new role in Indonesia, but said he was proud of presiding over a period that included the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations between Australia and Ethiopia. Receiving international attention during a widespread famine between 1983 and 1985, Ethiopia has looked to Australia for dry climate agriculture collaboration. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 10.5 million Ethiopians were food insecure as recently as December, due to an El Nino system causing drought conditions in East Africa. Another 315,000 were flood-affected in the south of the country. Mr Teffera said this drought's impact on the country, however, would be nowhere near as devastating, thanks in part to trials of new agricultural methods. ""The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research has been working in Ethiopia to develop greater diversity in agriculture and different kinds of dry land agriculture,"" he said. Mining and tourism have also been major aspects of the Ethiopia-Australia relationship over the last two years. Mr Teffera visited Western Australia and Victoria to attend forums on oil, gas and minerals to promote investment in Ethiopia. ""I was very much welcomed by mining companies and able to get the message out that Ethiopia is open for business,"" he said. ""About 127 companies have expressed an interest and, if it were not for the economic slowdown, I believe more would have visited."" Ethiopia is also interested in promoting itself as a tourism destination, boasting nine UNESCO World Heritage sites, varied landscapes and cultural attractions. Mr Teffera said part of his mission involved working with Australian tourism operators to encourage the introduction of holiday packages to Ethiopia. ""No other country has the same number of historical, archaeological, natural and cultural attractions asEthiopia,"" he said. Bilateral relations between Australia and Ethiopia were formalised in 1965, though the relationship dates back to the 1890s when eucalyptus trees were imported to Addis Ababa for timber. A new Ethiopian ambassador is expected to move to Australia later this year.

Humanitarian agencies are monitoring and responding to droughts and food insecurity in an area from Indonesia and the Philippines to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands.

“El Niño is peaking at the moment, and we expect the impacts to come up after the peak,"" said Krishna Krishnamurthy, a regional climate risk analyst for the World Food Programme.

Krishnamurthy visited East Timor earlier this month and saw areas that were parched even though their rainy season was supposed to have started in November.

“Rivers are completely dry in several parts of the country,"" he said, noting some hard-hit areas were deceptively green.

“I saw green paddy fields, but it’s not rice - it’s weeds and grass. It’s difficult to monitor remotely (from satellite images). That’s why the post-harvest assessment will be quite critical.""

The El Niño phenomenon, occurring every few years and caused by unusual warming of the Pacific Ocean, triggers heavy rains and floods in South America and dry, scorching weather in Asia and East Africa, and usually lasts about one year.

Unicef launched a $62 million appeal on Tuesday to help children affected by drought, conflict and other crises, focusing on areas such as nutrition, health, water and sanitation.

Unicef has called for $25 million for its work in conflict-affected Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states in Myanmar; $18 million for North Korea; $10 million for conflict-affected Mindanao province in the Philippines; and $5 million for Pacific Island countries.

Here are updates on El Niño and drought from across the region.

East Timor

The ministry of agriculture and fisheries reported 50% less rainfall than normal. In southern Viqueque district, farm animals are falling sick and dying due to lack of feed and dwindling water supplies, though there has been some rain since 15 January which may alleviate the situation, it said.

Philippines

On Mindanao island, lack of rain has damaged more than 500 hectares of farmland in Zamboanga city, with rice, corn, vegetables and bananas “lost with no chance of recovery"", according to the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha).

In North Cotabato, also on Mindanao, authorities declared a state of calamity because of $5 million of damage to crops, Ocha said.

Papua New Guinea

An estimated 2.7 million people—more than a third of the population—are affected by a combination of drought and frost, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said, adding that priority needs are food, water and agricultural recovery.

An IOM survey last month found 85% of communities assessed in Enga, Simbu and Jiwaka provinces rely on unprotected water sources, and 47% of respondents had a household member who had had diarrhoea within four weeks of the survey.

Pacific Islands

Drought warnings or alerts are in force for Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, Vanuatu and Palau, according to Unicef, which said more frequent and intense storms are expected in 2016, with Pacific Islands suffering the most.

School attendance rates have dropped in the Pacific Islands, where children are hungry and dehydrated, and face a high risk of malnutrition due to crop failure, water shortages and poor sanitation, Unicef said.

North Korea

Severe drought in four agricultural provinces in 2015 has led to smaller harvests and reduced access to clean water, impacting the health of women and children, Unicef said.

In drought-hit provinces, 25,000 children are suffering severe acute malnutrition and require immediate treatment, and there has been a 72% increase in diarrhoea among children under 5, it said.

30,30,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Building climate resilience in cities: lessons from New York - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/building-climate-resilience-in-cities-lessons-from-new-york-52363,"We live in an urbanizing world. Up to two-thirds of the world’s population – some six billion people – may live in cities by 2050.

Cities have emerged as first responders to climate change because they experience the impacts of natural disasters firsthand and because they produce up to 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

To protect urban dwellers from climate change impacts, such as more frequent and more intense heat waves, heavy downpours and coastal flooding, cities need to make themselves more resilient.

That’s why cities figured so prominently at the Paris climate conference last month, where hundreds of mayors pledged to reduce emissions and improve city resilience. As of today, 447 cities have signed on to the Compact of Mayors, a coalition of city leaders who have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, track progress and prepare for climate change impacts.

We codirect the Urban Climate Change Research Network (UCCRN), a group of over 600 experts who provide climate science information on adaptation and mitigation to urban leaders and practitioners from governments, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations and the community. At the Paris conference, the UCCRN released the Summary for City Leaders of its Second Assessment Report on Climate Change and Cities.

Based on our work with UCCRN, we believe that cities have great potential to lead on climate change solutions, but must be transformed in order to do so.

We also believe that New York City’s experience in rebuilding after 2012’s Hurricane Sandy offers useful lessons for other cities.

Adaptable plans

UCCRN has identified transformative strategies that cities can pursue to become climate leaders.

They should link preparations for near-term disasters and long-term climate change; meld activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience; involve multiple stakeholder groups and scientists in the planning process; focus on protecting the most vulnerable; enhance local credit worthiness and management skills; and look outward by joining city networks.

New York City is already pursuing these objectives, motivated largely by the damages it has already suffered from extreme weather.

On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy hurtled ashore in the New York metropolitan region, killing 44 people and causing US$19 billion in damages in New York City alone. The flood inundation zone in New York City encompassed approximately 88,700 buildings, which contained 300,000 homes and 23,000 businesses, and left two million people without electricity.

Sandy was a wake-up call that showed how vulnerable New York City was to extreme climate events. In its wake, city leaders resolved to take steps that would make New York stronger and more resilient in the face of climate change.

New York’s experience in rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy highlights three main messages that are transferable to other cities.

First, there is enough information to act on climate change today based on the best-available science. Cities can update their climate projections and urban climate change action plans as scientific understanding improves and city leaders learn more about resiliency, but there is no reason to delay climate action planning.

In New York City, the New York Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), a body of experts first convened by Mayor Bloomberg in 2008, developed a concept of Flexible Adaptation Pathways that the city adopted in its long-term planning. Originally conceived in London, this approach calls for agencies to start adopting resiliency measures immediately, monitor how well they work, and continually update their understanding of climate risk information and responses as the climate system and resilience actions evolve.

If cities do not start acting now, many of the world’s vulnerable cities and populations will endure significant impacts from heat waves, heavy downpours and coastal flooding due to sea level rise.

The second important priority is to plan across entire metropolitan regions. In preparing for climate change, the city of New York is taking an approach that encompasses the entire “infrastructure-shed” of the city.

For example, the New York City climate action task force includes regional transportation providers who manage the subways, buses, and railroads that run within and around the city into the extended metropolitan region. Plans must also consider how extreme droughts and inland floods can affect the watershed that supplies New York City’s drinking water.

Disasters and extreme events do not respect political boundaries, so steps to make cities more resilient cannot stop at city limits. Instead, they need to encompass the interconnected energy, water, transportation, telecommunications, sanitation, health, food and public safety systems that extend beyond municipal borders to the wider metropolitan region and beyond, including national and international supply chains.

New York City’s third key step is bringing together city decision-makers, infrastructure managers, citizens groups and other key actors with researchers to develop shared understanding of New York’s specific climate change vulnerabilities and climate science needs.

That’s because climate change will not impact every city in the same way. For example, some cities will be exposed to repeated and worsening droughts, while others may be more exposed to flooding or extreme heat events. Scientists and stakeholders need to work together to understand the risks that are relevant for each city so that they can find effective ways to prepare for climate change.

Critical vulnerabilities

The most critical vulnerability in New York City that Hurricane Sandy spotlighted is coastal flooding. Currently, an estimated 400,000 New York residents, 71,500 buildings and much of the city’s critical infrastructure are located within the 100-year flood zone – that is, the area that has a one percent chance of flooding in any given year. Sea levels in New York City are rising at almost twice the global average rate, and the NPCC projects that sea levels will continue to rise in the coming decades, which will put more residents, buildings and infrastructure at risk.

New York City Panel on Climate Change, 2015

Coastal cities across the world are vulnerable to sea level rise and more intense coastal storms. And cities everywhere face risks including more frequent and more extreme heat waves and increasing heavy downpours.

Critical infrastructure systems in cities exposed to these changing hazards include energy, transportation, telecommunications, water and waste. These systems are interdependent, so impacts on one of them can cause cascading effects onto other infrastructure systems during an extreme event.

For example, Hurricane Sandy caused gas shortages in the New York metropolitan region: loading docks on the water were physically damaged, refineries and terminals lost power and pipelines shut down, making it impossible to receive or ship fuel.

This caused major failures in the gasoline supply chain, forcing drivers to wait in line at gas stations and limiting New Yorkers’ mobility. Fuel shortages also made it more challenging for ambulances to respond to emergencies, for utility workers to restore electricity and for relief workers to reach the hardest-hit areas of the city.

Certain groups of people in cities are disproportionately vulnerable. For example, more intense and longer-lasting heat waves threaten people with underlying health problems, the young and the elderly, and low-income residents.

Investing in resilience

The UCCRN recommends that cities should take a portfolio approach to investing in resilience measures that spreads resources across multiple categories. They include implementing citywide policies, such as upgrading building codes; hardening critical protective structures; investing in green infrastructure, such as green roofs and bioswales; and strengthening social safety nets.

C. Rosenzweig , Author provided

In order to develop specific, localized climate action plans, stakeholders and scientists need to work together to learn about climate risks, brainstorm strategies and prioritize implementation. This process should include groups that represent a cross-section of the city’s population, including the most disadvantaged citizens, as well as the private sector.

The Paris Agreement signals a new era for climate change, and cities are generating positive energy for this new phase. Early-adopter cities such as New York need to continue to strengthen and share their actions and lessons learned.

Cities that have not yet started need to begin planning and preparing for climate change. The good news is that many urban leaders are committed to meeting these challenges, and there is a great deal of knowledge that researchers can share on how to proceed. By starting to plan and invest now, cities can lead the effort to avoid dangerous climate change and adapt to a warming world.","Fri, 22 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/108356/original/image-20160117-20924-1q2lg8f.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C32%2C2400%2C1164&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['extreme', 'vulnerable', 'infrastructure', 'lessons', 'cities', 'change', 'need', 'city', 'resilience', 'leaders', 'building', 'york', 'climate']",

In the courtyard of Myanmar's Islamic University in Thetkaypyin village, half a dozen teachers sit around the courtyard while classes change.

It's the worst of times for the Buddhist-majority country's leading madrassa, now surrounded by refugee camps and villages that have been under prison-like conditions for three years.

At present 400 students are attending the university, the largest school in Rakhine State. Founded in 1951, some of the college's graduates go on to serve as imams or go abroad for further studies, says Kyaw Zaw La, university professor.

Observers suggest that the abysmal living conditions in the refugee camps and the abject poverty of its residents are ripe for radicalization. Rohingyas, who lack basic rights in Myanmar, are denied citizenship, stripped of voting rights and denied access to adequate health care and education.

The Jan. 14 attacks on the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, have amplified fears of recruitment by radicalized elements.

Aung Win, a Rohingya community leader in the district raised concerns that Myanmar could be a target of the so-called Islamic State by recruiting young, unemployed Muslims.

""I can't guarantee that all Rohingyas are moderate and some might be radicals and get contact with terrorist groups such as the IS. This is a serious concern and the plight of the Rohingya must be addressed by the government,"" Aung Win told ucanews.com.

Yet Kyaw Zaw La, like his university colleagues, bearded and dressed in Myanmar's traditional longyi, says Rakhine's Muslims reject the violent acts of the Islamic State and al-Qaida terrorist groups and he had no concerns of recruitment among the state's Rohingyas.

""We, Rohingya Muslims, have faced discrimination and have been targeted by the majority Rakhine Buddhists, but we have no interest in going against the government,"" Kyaw Zaw told ucanews.com.

Hatred and bigotry toward the minority Rohingya have been deeply rooted in Rakhine state. Since 2012, hard-line Buddhist groups, like Ma Ba Tha, have led an anti-Muslim campaign that culminated in violent riots, harassment and discrimination.

Ma Ba Tha also has pushed for a restrictive religion law that targets minority Muslims, who comprise about 4 percent of the 51 Myanmar's million population.

U Parmaukkha, a Yangon-based monk and member of Ma Ba Tha, defended the group, saying their actions were meant to protect Myanmar's Buddhist culture.

He said the group feared a prevailing belief that Islam seeks to dominate the world. ""So it is a threat to our country and we have many concerns in Rakhine state so we are closely observing (Muslims) with suspicion,"" U Parmaukkha, told ucanews.com.

Al Haj Aye Lwin, chief convener of the Islamic Center of Myanmar, said he had no concerns with Muslims in Myanmar becoming radicalized, but noted that historically, the oppression of minority communities is a root cause of radicalization.

Extremistmessages

Pe Than, a lower house lawmaker from the hard-line Buddhist Arakan National Party, said that he believed there were some extremist messages being preached at mosques.

""We can't guarantee 100 percent that an IS attack can't happen in Myanmar so we need to take precautions,"" Pe Than told ucanews.com.

In a June 2015 report in the Economist, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq, referred to the ""1 million of the weak Muslims who are all without exception being exterminated in Burma,"" and asked what the Muslim world would do about it.

But Thomas Hegghammer, a Norwegian expert on Islam, said that Rakhine has not turned into another Chechnya or Kashmir — a big draw for angry, young jihadists — for three reasons.

""First, foreign fighters these days are drawn mainly to join the IS in Syria and Iraq, which offers them a more glamorous cause: fighting for a caliph rather than defending poor farmers and fishermen. Second, Myanmar secures its borders well, making it hard for foreign jihadists to reach the would-be battlefield. Third, militants don't go to where Muslims suffer; they go to where Muslims fight,"" Hegghammer told the Economist.

Khin Mg Myint, a displaced Rohingya in Sittwe, told ucanews.com that no one he knows is talking about joing a terrorist group despite so many being unemployed and impoverished.

""I have high expectations that new government of Myanmar will improve our situation in Rakhine,"" he said.","Fri, 22 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2016/01/1453459042.JPG,"['islamic', 'rohingyas', 'radicalization', 'potential', 'rakhine', 'ponders', 'rohingya', 'university', 'concerns', 'told', 'myanmars', 'myanmar', 'state', 'muslims']",

There has been recent renewed interest and discussion in the public domain around Timor-Leste’s prospects for joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the country’s prospects in general. Timor-Leste would like to offer its perspective.

Timor-Leste was blessed to come into nationhood at the dawn of a new millennium in 2002, on the back of the Pacific Century, in the midst of the Information Age when knowledge is increasing and spreading at exponential rates. When we began our struggle for independence in 1975, we could not have anticipated that the Occupation would last so long (24 years), that the human toll would be so high (one-third of our population perished), nor that Timor-Leste would achieve statehood at a time where Asian economies are expanding at some of the fastest paces on the planet.

To be geographically situated in Southeast Asia at this time, in the midst of such a vibrant region of innovation and commerce, brings many opportunities as well as challenges: Opportunities to leverage upon the expertise and capital resources in the region, and the challenge to rapidly upgrade Timor-Leste’s human and infrastructure capacity, to become competitive in the marketplace, and to carve a niche for itself in the world.

Shedding a quarter of a century of isolation, and now into its second decade as a sovereign state, Timor-Leste is ready to take its place in the community of nations, to learn and to share from its resources and unique experience. Rising from the ashes of war, Timor-Leste possesses firsthand experience in effective peace-building as a precursor to nation-building and development.

Today, Timor-Leste is politically stable, and its relationship with former occupier Indonesia is warm, understanding, and strong. In fact, Indonesia was the first country to endorse Timor-Leste’s inclusion in ASEAN. All ASEAN member states have now expressed their support for Timor-Leste’s admission to the Association. In 2015, Timor-Leste fulfilled one of the Association’s key entrance requirements with the establishment of embassies in all 10 ASEAN countries.

As recently as late 2015, a senior Singapore official confirmed to Timor-Leste Minister for Planning and Strategic Investment Xanana Gusmão that “Timor-Leste belongs in ASEAN.” Timor-Leste remains sanguine that its accession to the Association will take place sooner rather than later. This view is informed by three driving forces: the growing threat of transnational crime and terrorism, the increasing menace of climate change and environmental hazards, and the great powers’ jostling for influence and dominance in the Asia Pacific.

Terrorism is a peril that threatens all of Southeast Asia. Even as authorities investigate the January 14 multiple bombings in Jakarta, it is clear that terrorism has gone global. Attacks carried out in one nation can be planned on the opposite side of the world, and involve citizens and funding from numerous countries. Sleeper cells may lodge in a remote hamlet or in the middle of a pulsing urban center. It has become crucial to close the gaps of communication and information exchange between countries, to head off dangers and to nip terror in the bud.

Climate change, floods, droughts, fire, and pollution are no respecter of borders. Neighbor countries need to coordinate responses to environmental adversities, as well as harmonize the management of shared water and other resources in order to avoid and minimize conflict.

Cross-border crimes and fraud have gone high-tech. Tackling cybercrime, human and contraband trafficking, piracy, kidnapping, and thievery across the region’s territories requires multilateral cooperation.

The final factor relates to powerful countries’ perpetual drive for influence and control. A founding aim of ASEAN was for the countries of Southeast Asia and Indochina to join hands to create an environment of friendship, peace, and stability conducive to national economic and social development. This imperative remains relevant today. It is valuable to remember the rewards of this cohesiveness, and to resist and prevent Southeast Asia from becoming a proxy battleground for the larger regional and global powers.

Timor-Leste believes in the vital importance of a strong, independent and united ASEAN for the security and prosperity of the region, and looks forward to contributing to the continued success of this family of nations.

Timor-Leste has much in common with ASEAN countries in intertwined history and cultures, in shared values and traditional practices, in cuisines and arts. These bonds are reflected in Timor-Leste’s population: Timorese faces are Malay, Chinese, Indian, European, Melanesian, and every possible combination thereof.

Melanesian ties connect Timor-Leste to the Pacific. The country maintains close cooperation with the Pacific nations and is preparing to join efforts with the Pacific Community, a grouping of 22 Pacific Island countries and territories plus the four founding countries, Australia, France, New Zealand, and the United States.

Its colonial past bestows on Timor-Leste one of its official languages – Portuguese – and links the country to the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) of over 260 million people across four continents. Timor-Leste currently holds the presidency of the CPLP for a 2-year term through 2016, chairing all ministerial and working group meetings.

The engagement between Timor-Leste and ASEAN is already well in motion. In addition to taking part in sporting events such as the Asian Games, Timor-Leste has been a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum since 2005, when it signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of Southeast Asia. This formalized Timor-Leste’s participation in consultations on political and security issues of common concern. As Timor-Leste continues to build these long-term relationships, it also redoubles efforts at developing the country’s domestic economy.

In December, 2015, the Timor-Leste Government granted land rights to a Singapore-based international company to build a hospitality complex which will include a 5-star hotel with over 460 rooms. The construction phase is expected to generate 1,500 jobs, with hotel operations estimated to create and maintain 1,300 jobs. The high-end facilities will attract greater numbers of visitors to the country, support the hosting of international conventions and events, and spur the growth of the tourism industry.

Dutch brewer Heineken’s new US$40 million beverage plant in Timor-Leste is expected to start producing beer and soft drinks at the end of 2016 for export and domestic consumption.

Timor-Leste is forging alliances with its immediate neighbors, with plans to form a Trilateral Economic Zone with Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province and Australia’s Northern Territory to combine resources to create critical mass for commerce and infrastructure, and to provide services and opportunities to the regional populations of the three countries. This is in addition to the existing cooperation under the Coral Triangle Initiative, of which both Australia and Indonesia are members.

There are many synergies to tap between Timor-Leste and its neighbors in the management of neighborhood security and health, in the exploitation of marine and natural resources, and in the building of shareable infrastructure and services.

As evidence of how far bilateral relations between Indonesia and Timor-Leste have come, Jakarta has committed to work with Díli to complete the demarcation of the two countries’ land borders (now 98 percent drawn) and thereafter, to commence the delimitation of maritime boundaries.

Australia, however, has been unwilling to engage on the delimitation of permanent boundaries in the Timor Sea. Timor-Leste remains hopeful and optimistic that Canberra will come to see the long-term benefits – to both our countries – of establishing a more equitable and sustainable governing regime in the Timor Sea in accordance with the principles of international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

As 2016 gets underway, Timor-Leste extends its hand and renews its invitation to Australia to come to the table to map a better and more just path forward in the Timor Sea.

The cyclical El Niño pattern of devastating droughts on some regions and catastrophic floods in others that can affect tens of millions of people around the globe, is already leading to even worse drought across southern Africa, affecting this year's crops.

With little or no rain falling in many areas and the window for the planting of cereals closing fast or already closed in some countries, the outlook is alarming.

“Driving through southern Zambia, I saw fields of crops severely stressed from lack of water and met farmers who are struggling to cope with a second season of erratic rains,” WFP Executive Director Ertharin Cousin said at the end of a visit to drought-prone southern Zambia.

“Zambia is one of the biggest breadbaskets in the region and what's happening there gives serious cause for concern not only for Zambia itself but all countries in the region.”

Worst affected by last year's poor rains are Malawi with 2.8 million people facing hunger, Madagascar with nearly 1.9 million, and Zimbabwe with 1.5 million and last year's harvest reduced by half compared to the previous year due to massive crop failure.

In Lesotho, the Government has declared a drought emergency and some 650,000 people, a third of the population, do not have enough food. As elsewhere, water is in extremely short supply for both crops and livestock. Also causing concern are Angola, Mozambique and Swaziland.

Food prices across southern Africa have been rising due to reduced production and availability. The price of maize, the staple for most of the region, is 73 per cent higher in Malawi than the three-year average for this time of year.

“I'm particularly concerned that smallholders won't be able to harvest enough crops to feed their own families through the year, let alone to sell what little they can in order to cover school fees and other household needs,” Ms. Cousin said.

WFP is working with Governments, regional organizations and other partners on contingency, preparedness to secure food supplies and protect people's livelihoods.

WFP assessment analysts estimate that more than 40 million rural and 9 million urban people in the region live in geographic zones that are highly exposed to the fall-out from El Niño. South Africa, the major breadbasket of the region, has indicated that this El Niño-induced drought is the worst the country has suffered in more than half a century.

One particularly worrying symptom of southern Africa's vulnerability to food and nutrition security is the alarming rate of chronic malnutrition. Levels of stunting among children in Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia are among the worst in the world.

This affects children's physical growth, cognitive development, as well as their future health and productivity.","Mon, 18 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2015/05/21913/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['southern', 'region', 'funding', 'threatens', 'million', 'particularly', 'drought', 'counter', 'malawi', 'food', 'africa', 'niñoexacerbated', 'harvest', 'shortfall', 'efforts', 'el', 'zambia']", 
37,37,FL-2016-000009-IDN,nbsp; Feature Global deforestation is decreasing. Or is it? - Ensia,https://ensia.com/features/global-deforestation-is-decreasing-or-is-it/,"It started, as many things do, with a rumor. In 2013 Matt Finer, a researcher with the Amazon Conservation Association, heard from locals that someone was cutting down rainforest deep in the Peruvian Amazon, far from prying eyes. So Finer and colleagues did something that would have been unheard of 10 years before: Using high resolution satellite imagery, they found a couple hectares of felled trees in a seemingly impenetrable sea of forest.

“You could just see this little smidge of forest loss and we said, ‘maybe that’s it,’” says Finer.

Over the next few years, the team watched the destruction spread from just a few hectares to more than 2,000. It eventually connected the loss to United Cacao, a company based in the Cayman Islands with ambitions to become the “world’s largest and lowest cost corporate grower of cacao,” according to its website. Armed with dramatic satellite images, Finer and colleagues took the story to the Peruvian government and press, hoping to make a difference. The case is now in Peruvian court to determine if the company undertook the proper steps before clearing the forest. In the meantime, according to Finer, the agriculture ministry has responded by slapping United Cacao with a “paralyzation” order to halt its operation. But, says Finer, weekly satellite imagery shows United Cacao is not complying. “The deforestation is happening as we speak,” he says.

The world has struggled for decades to stem deforestation through a variety of means. In 2008, biodiversity expert Norman Myers said that deforestation in the tropics was “one of the worst crises since we came out of our caves 10,000 years ago.” Ongoing loss is driving fears of mass extinction. But the loss of forests — both tropical and temperate — also plays a big role in the global climate crisis: Experts estimate that 10 to 15 percent of current greenhouse gas emissions are due to land use change. Not only that, but forests are vital to mitigating soil erosion, stemming floods, maintaining precipitation and even boosting human health and happiness.

The world has struggled for decades to stem deforestation through a variety of means, including setting aside new protected areas, improving laws and enforcement at the national level, creating international programs such as REDD+, and making corporate commitments to cut out deforestation altogether.

Yet nothing has changed how we approach deforestation like satellite monitoring. In recent years, this has revolutionized our ability to track deforestation. Instead of relying on local government statistics, researchers and activists are now able to monitor changes in the forest from their laptops and smartphones.

What does this information tell us about how we’re doing at beating deforestation — and what we might do to make further progress toward this global goal?

Global Assessments

Last year, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released its latest Global Forest Resources Assessment. According to the assessment, we have seen a net loss of forests of 129 million hectares since 1990, an area about the size of Peru. But the report, released every five years, also found that the rate of deforestation had slowed recently: forests experienced 56 percent less net loss annually in the past five years than during the 1990s. The Global Forest Resources Assessment found a significant slowdown in deforestation in the tropics, while net forest cover in temperate regions was either stable or rising.

Anssi Pekkarinen, leader of the FAO’s Forest Monitoring and Assessment Team, says the team is “quite confident” that deforestation has slowed in the tropics. Between 1990 and 2000, tropical forests lost more than 9 million hectares (20 million acres) annually, but over the past five years annual losses slightly exceed 6 million hectares (10 million acres), according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment. Critics, however, contend the FAO data are marred by dependence on local governments with varying abilities — and desires — to accurately monitor or report forest cover. Moreover, definitions of forest vary depending on the government and the time period, making comparing forest loss over decades difficult.

Meanwhile, one of the most rigorous studies in recent years found that forest loss actually accelerated by 62 percent in the tropics from 1990 to 2010.

Lead author Do-Hyung Kim, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, says the study, published in 2015 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, was meant to provide an “alternative” to FAO data based on “a consistent definition and methods.” To do the analysis, Kim and colleagues analyzed 5,444 Landsat satellite images, comparing past and present forest cover using the same definitions.

“Brazil is the exception, not the rule at all, in reducing its rate of deforestation.” – Matt HansenKim’s conclusions are buttressed by findings from a 2013 study in Science that found forest loss in the tropics jumped by more than 200,000 hectares every year from 2000 to 2012. The research declared that Brazil’s recent crackdown on deforestation was negated by rising destruction in other tropical countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

“Brazil is the exception, not the rule at all, in reducing its rate of deforestation,” says lead author Matt Hansen, a remote sensing scientist at the University of Maryland.

There is little disagreement, however, that deforestation has slowed in temperate regions. For one thing, the data are generally more reliable in these regions. According to the Global Forest Resources Assessment, net forest cover has actually risen in countries such as the U.S., Russia and China over the past 15 years. This doesn’t mean these nations aren’t continuing to clear-cut forests, but the total amount of land devoted to forests has grown. China, for example, has undertaken ambitious forest planting programs to combat desertification and soil erosion (although most of these are monoculture plantations rather than diverse forests).

Apples and Oranges

Worldwide, Global Forest Watch — an interactive mapping tool online — has found that tree cover loss has steadily increased (with some fluctuations) between 2001 and 2014. But Rachael Petersen, a research analyst for World Resources Institute, which operates GFW, says comparing the FAO and GFW data is like “comparing apples to oranges.” This is because FAO largely measures land use change, while GFW covers tree cover loss. For example, clear-cutting a forest in the southern United States is not considered deforestation by FAO so long as the land remains designated as a production forest — that is, clear-cut and regrown at regular intervals. But GFW will detect loss for that year, because the satellites see felled trees — even if forests will soon grow there again.

FAO says it does not include oil palm plantations or fruit tree monocultures under its definition of forests, but it does include pulp and paper plantations as well as replanting efforts that usually depend on a single species.“Taken together, [the GFW and Global Forest Resources Assessment] data give us a more complete understanding of how forest landscapes are changing,” says Petersen.

Another major issue plaguing the data today is whether monoculture plantations should be counted as forests. FAO says it does not include oil palm plantations or fruit tree monocultures under its definition of forests, but it does include pulp and paper plantations as well as replanting efforts that usually depend on a single species. And most analyses of satellite data sets don’t distinguish between forest plantations and diverse forests, meaning that research dependent on satellites usually counts mature oil palm, rubber, acacia or other plantations as forest simply because from the a bird’s eye view they look like forest.

But the idea that any monoculture plantation is a forest drives ecologists crazy.

“They’re about as biologically similar to native forests as my front lawn,” says William Laurance, an expert on tropical forests with James Cook University in Australia.

Indonesia vs. Brazil

In the end, no measurement of deforestation is without fault. But, ultimately, we may be missing the point by focusing on relative rates of global deforestation. Even if we go with the best-case slowdown scenario, deforestation is still happening at an unsustainable pace. Every year, our planet has less forest than it did before — and much less primary forest. Every year, more species — many of them not even named — become threatened with extinction or go extinct. And every year more planet-warming carbon enters the atmosphere from destroyed forests.

This is nowhere more evident than in Indonesia, which in 2015 saw 2.1 million hectares (5.2 million acres) of land — much of it peat and rain forest — go up in smoke.

During the dry season, farmers and plantations routinely clear peat and rainforest in Indonesia by burning it, creating a toxic haze that blankets the wider region. But last year — due in part to El Niño and global warming — the fires proved particularly fierce and long lasting. Erik Meijaard, an Indonesia-based ecologist, dubbed them “the biggest environmental crime of the 21st century” even as the months-long crisis failed to capture anywhere near the global media attention as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

In all, the disaster resulted in the direct deaths of 21 people, at least half a million acute respiratory infections, hundreds of cancelled flights and immeasurable impacts to wildlife. The World Bank estimated a total loss to the Indonesian economy estimated at more than US$16 billion. It also released a carbon bomb: At the height, the fires emitted more carbon dioxide on a daily basis than the entire U.S. economy.

For those who have followed the turmoil of Indonesia’s forest policies, none of this was surprising. Suffering from decades of corruption, lax laws, decentralized governance and powerful industrial players, Indonesia’s forests are in crisis.

But, maybe Indonesia should look to Brazil. The Amazonian country was once the global pariah when it came to rain forest destruction. Now experts repeatedly point to it as a model for how to really take on deforestation. A leader in the application of satellite monitoring, Brazil has combined the new technology with strong governance, tough forest laws and vast protected areas. And it’s working: Deforestation in Brazil slowed 70 to 80 percent from the early 2000s to today — though it has risen slightly in recent years.

“Brazil is the best to date in intervening in an ongoing deforestation dynamic and actually greatly reducing it,” says Hansen, who points to the country’s “vigorous civil society, government mandates and an engaged private sector” as key to the initial success. In a nutshell, Brazil’s many stakeholders came together to take on a hugely complex, but not unsolvable, problem. The battle is not over there, but it is moving in the right direction.

“Replicating those conditions elsewhere may prove challenging,” Hansen says. For instance, in Indonesia, the palm oil industry routinely plays down the problem and the government still sends mixed messages on the importance (or lack thereof) of protecting forests, even going so far as to criticize recent zero deforestation pledges by corporations.

Moving Forward

Many hold out hope that the Paris climate agreement, signed by virtually every nation in the world in December, could point to a new era for the world’s forests. Included in the agreement is a request that countries conserve and enhance forests in order to mitigate carbon emissions.

Every year more of the world’s biggest corporations and industries are announcing “zero deforestation” pledges.The Paris agreement also lent considerable support to REDD+, a long-debated program that establishes a mechanism by which wealthy nations pay poor tropical countries to keep their forests standing. Under discussion for a decade, the program has yet to prove itself and still faces a number of critics. But a commitment of $5 billion by Norway, Germany and the UK to REDD+ announced on day one of the Paris talks should see the program finally kick into high gear.

At the same time, every year more of the world’s biggest corporations and industries are announcing “zero deforestation” pledges, a trend started in Brazil in 2008. Many of these pledges don’t go into effect for 5 or even 15 years and, even more problematic, such pledges often only apply to so-called high conservation forests, a definition that remains under heavy debate but basically means forests with high carbon content or rare species. Still, such pledges show that at least some in the private sector are beginning to view deforestation as no longer permissible.

Finally, experts say that recognizing the rights of local people and indigenous groups to their traditional forests could be one of the easiest, cheapest and most effective ways to protect standing forests from razing. Many indigenous groups still lack legal tenure to their traditional lands in tropical countries, but where they have secured their rights — for example in parts of Brazil — research often shows that forests are well protected. In some cases indigenous groups were even better at halting deforestation than government sanctioned protected areas. Efforts to achieve indigenous rights to forests are ongoing, but sluggish for many of those groups who are watching their forests — and their way of life — vanish to chainsaws.

Concerned citizens elsewhere are also doing their part by being conscientious about purchases that may come with deforestation baggage, including everything from paper to timber and beef to palm oil. Just as important is to support courageous groups and individuals putting pressure on world leaders to protect our remaining forests amid the twin climate and biodiversity crises. If Brazil is any example, we’ll need all hands on deck — governments, industry and citizens — to truly end deforestation.","Thu, 21 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://ensia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/feature_deforestation_main_cr.jpg,"['loss', 'data', 'forest', 'deforestation', 'global', 'plantations', 'million', 'hectares', 'decreasing', 'forests', 'satellite']",

January 21, 2016—The Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the World Bank jointly announce their intention to form a new panel to mobilize urgent action towards the sustainable development goal for water and sanitation (SDG 6) and related targets. [1]

The announcement comes as countries experience water stress and water-related disasters that will grow worse due to climate change without better policy decisions.

“Water is a precious resource, crucial to realizing the SDGs, which at their heart aim to eradicate poverty,” said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. “The new Panel can help motivate the action we need to turn ideas into reality. The United Nations system, including through UN Water and the United Nations development system’s universal operational presence, is committed to promote inclusive and country-led action on SDG6 and related targets.”

The panel, to be co-chaired by the Presidents of Mauritius and Mexico, will comprise a group of heads of State/Government from developed and developing countries, convened by the United Nations Secretary-General and the President of the World Bank Group to:

Motivate Action – Focus public policy dialogue, private sector models and practices and civil society initiatives towards the Water SDG; and

Advocate on financing and implementation – Promote efforts to mobilize financial resources and scale-up investment for the Water SDG, including through innovative financing and implementation strategies.

“Achieving the water global goal would have multiple benefits, including laying the foundations for food and energy security, sustainable urbanization, and ultimately climate security” said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. “My hope is that this panel accelerates action in many countries so that we can make water more accessible to all.”

The World Bank and UN will facilitate access to a variety of technical organizations to support the panel, including OECD, Stockholm International Water Institute, World Economic Forum, World Water Council, and World Resources Institute.

Data released by NASA and NOAA (National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration) show that in 2015, the global mean surface temperature – the yardstick scientists use to measure air temperature year to year – was the warmest on record by far.

The data show not only that 2015 is the hottest year on record, but also that the increment over the previous hottest year (2014) was perhaps the largest on record.

It is readily apparent that global warming is alive and well (not that this is a good thing). These latest temperature figures also indicate that the so-called global warming hiatus is due to natural variability, rather than a slowdown or reversal of global warming from the buildup of greenhouse gases.

So how did this play out in last year’s weather events?

Signs of a hotter planet

As might be expected, record high temperatures were observed in many places around the world last year. Severe drought and accompanying wildfires were widespread.

Perhaps not so obvious, torrential rains also occurred, at least in part as a consequence of the warming. Warmer air can hold greater amounts of water vapor, at a rate of about four percent per rise in temperature of one degree Fahrenheit, which can lead to heavy precipitation.

These tangible signs of the effects of climate change are to be expected and have been predicted by climate scientists because of the continuing increases in heat-trapping greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, from the burning of fossil fuels.

Kevin Trenberth/John Fasullo , Author provided

Indeed, as the figure above shows, throughout the years records have been broken time and time again. This is very much in tune with what the climate models have been suggesting.

The latest data should also dispel all the suggestions that there was no global warming because of the pause, or “hiatus,” in the rise of global mean surface temperature (GMST). There may have been a pause in the rate of warming from 1999 to 2013, but such things are expected from natural variability.

Role of El Niño

The year 2015 stands out because of the unusually strong El Niño that has been under way, only the third El Niño categorized as “very strong” going back as far as records allow (into the late 1800s). In fact, the higher temperatures from El Niño could account for most of the difference from 2014, which had been the warmest year on record until last year.

El Niño plays a major role regionally in affecting where the hot and dry spots are and where the torrential rains and hurricanes occur. Global warming makes all of those effects more brutal.

Although there are always a lot of other facets of natural variability and weather at work, the combination of global warming and the El Niño dominated what was experienced last year. This combination played out in a number of outstanding weather events throughout the world last year.

Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu in March 2015 with category 5 strength. Indeed, the Northern Hemisphere tropical storm season was a record-breaker, mainly from enhanced activity in the Pacific and record numbers of category 4 and 5 hurricanes or typhoons. In turn, these made landfall with devastating consequences, including flooding, in the Philippines, Japan, China, Taiwan and other areas. Now a vigorous hurricane season is already under way in the Southern Hemisphere with several Pacific islands falling victim to the strong winds and heavy rains.

In the summer, there were deadly heat waves in many places throughout Eurasia: Europe (Berlin 102°F; Warsaw 98°F; Madrid 104°F); Egypt; Turkey, Middle East (Iran 115°F); Japan: Tokyo longest period over 95°F; India 122°F (2,300 dead; May-June).

What we have seen this past year will likely be routine in about 15 years, although regionally the details will vary considerably. Indeed, we have had a glimpse of the future under global warming.

It is yet a further reminder of the importance of the recent Paris Agreement that sets a framework for addressing climate change: slowing it down or stopping it and planning for the consequences.","Wed, 20 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/108794/original/image-20160120-26125-15sqq7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C516%2C3000%2C1455&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['hottest', 'niño', 'strong', 'global', 'warming', 'climate', 'signals', 'temperature', 'weather', '2015', 'record', 'el', 'alive']",

There are thousands of children enslaved on Dublar Char and other islands in Sundarbans as well as the wider Bay of Bengal. Some process fish, others work the shrimp farms or process shrimp in makeshift factories. Fifty years ago there were no shrimp farms or camps like his carved out of the protected forest. In the past local fishermen worked the waters and took their catch to the markets in nearby river towns. At that time, the Sundarban islands, already a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the great mangrove forest, the largest carbon sink in Southeast Asia, was protected more by its wild remoteness than by the laws setting it aside as a national park.

All that changed when seafood went global.

In America and Europe it was a slow, barely noticeable change. In the 1950s a fancy meal might start with shrimp cocktail, four or five shrimp arranged around the rim of a cocktail glass filled with sauce. It was country club food, it cost more than steak, and you turned up your pinkie as you ate it and got to think of yourself as sophisticated in the bargain. Unless you happened to be near the Gulf of Mexico, those fresh little shrimp would have been rushed over a long distance at enormous cost. Adjusted for inflation, those five little shrimp around a cocktail glass in 1950 cost over a dollar each. Today three dollars will buy you a whole pound of shrimp brought all the way from Bangladesh to your refrigerator.

In the USA and Europe shrimp and frozen fish are everywhere, big bags in the freezer, popcorn shrimp by the bucket, cheap, conve­nient, and maybe even healthy. When cargo ships were turned into floating freezers the size of office buildings, shrimp and fish became freight. And unlike the declining stocks of wild deepwater fish like cod or tuna, shrimp can be farmed. All you need is a flat and flood­able coastline that can be turned into pools like giant rice paddies.

As demand for cheap fish and shrimp ramped up, a gold rush began in Bangladesh, Southern India, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. “Worthless” swamp was converted into monoculture shrimp farms, fish processing camps sprang up, and the great freezer ships were always hungry for more. Hearing of work, poor families flooded into the Sundarban wilderness. Some people were able to make a fresh start, and some landowners working in fish and shrimp were honest and treated their workers well. But criminals were already using child slaves on fishing platforms out in the ocean, and for them it was an easy step to enslave more workers to rip out mangrove forests and farm the little wrigglers that would make such a fine profit.

From a camp, dried fish flow mainly into local markets, for pet food and livestock feed and human food, such as fish stock cubes. You don’t think of organized crime being involved in stock cubes, but a wilderness island like Dublar Char makes a perfect slave-based processing site.

Not all seafood is touched by slavery, of course, but across the region children are enslaved to catch, clean, pack, and sometimes dry, fish and shrimp. Americans import around 2.4 billion pounds of seafood a year, which makes up about 85 percent of the seafood Americans eat. And when it comes to shrimp, the United States imports significantly more than other countries. Americans love shrimp, and almost half of all US seafood imports are shrimp. Ninety percent of this shrimp comes from Southeast Asia. Asian shrimp is also the second-largest imported seafood to Great Britain (after cod) and is increasing every year. The amount of shrimp imported from Bangladesh and the Sundarbans was down in 2009 after Cyclone Aila crashed into the area, but the trend in 2011 and 2012 was up sharply as farms recovered.

The cyclone reminded everyone that the border between ocean and wilderness can be a dangerous place. Aila brought a storm surge ten to twenty-five feet high that swept over low clay dikes, washed away villages, and destroyed some 6,000 shrimp farms in the area just above the Sundarbans. The surge generated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was about the same size, but unlike New Orleans, the Sundarbans had no large-scale levees or concrete sea walls. For enslaved children on fishing platforms or in fishing camps along the shoreline, there was no warning or protection. A shrimp farm worker many miles upriver from the ocean told me, “When the surge reached all the way to us, we only had a few minutes to climb as high as we could. I stood on the roof of a house that was up on stilts and it still flooded above its windows. The incoming flood water was full of floating bodies.”

Put simply, without the mangroves, people die. Old maps and satellite images taken over time show how true this is. In the 1950s, villages in the region had, on average, five miles of mangroves between themselves and the waters of the delta and ocean. By the late 1990s that had been reduced to less than a mile, and often none at all, as rice fields reaching toward the sea met the shrimp farms crawling up the shore. Today villages encrust the tops of the clay dikes, the water lapping at their toes.

Like hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclones of the Bay of Bengal come every year. The question is not if there is going to be a cyclone, but how big will it be? In 1991 a major cyclone plowed into southern Bangladesh, the storm surge was about twenty feet high, comparable to Hurricane Katrina, but in this low-lying land with the mangroves stripped away, the death toll was an astounding 138,000 people killed by the storm. The highest mortality was among children and the elderly. As many as 10 million were made homeless. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 1,836 deaths. In 1999, another major cyclone passed near, but did not collide with the Sundarbans. When it made landfall in India, the death toll was around 15,000, but the distribution of death was geographically uneven.

Researchers from Duke University explained that there was: “a clear inverse relationship between the number of deaths per village and the width of the mangroves located between those villages and the coast . . . villages with wider mangroves suffered significantly fewer deaths than ones with narrower or no mangroves.” They added, “This is a measure of the life-saving impact of the mangroves that remained in 1999 . . . they cut the death toll by about two-thirds.” When the tsunami struck in 2004, the same effect was seen to the south in Burma and Thailand, where more than 80 percent of coastal mangrove forests had been removed and slave-based shrimp farming is common; around 250,000 were killed in the region.

As the mangroves disappear each storm sets off a cycle of flight and further forest destruction. Without the mangrove belt the cyclones flood the shore, killing crops with salty seawater and washing away the shrimp farms along with the villages. After Cyclone Aila in 2009, 400,000 people, having lost everything to the storm surge, pushed into the protected forests. As the people push in more trees are cut, more islands are taken over, and more children and adults are enslaved to do the work. Some act in desperation, others from greed, but the cycle means that more and more of the forests that protect both people and the rich ecosystem are destroyed.

The loss to nature is profound. Nearly half of the amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds living in mangrove forests are threatened with extinction. These animals, for the most part, aren’t found anywhere else: their range is restricted to the mangrove forests of Asia and Australia. At the current rate of forest loss, the forests and all they hold will all be extinct in one hundred years.

The country of Bangladesh is one of the flattest places on earth, and the most susceptible to sea level rise. If the sea level increases three feet, the Sundarbans are gone, the entire 12,000 square miles are underwater, and 20 million people are refugees. Add to that the increased ferocity of cyclones and a thirty-foot storm surge and what happened to large parts of the city of New Orleans can happen to almost the entire country of Bangladesh. Americans’ energy-rich lifestyle, and the by-products of livestock farming contribute the most to global warming, but every slaveholder cutting down mangroves for shrimp or fish camps in the protected forest is increasing the likelihood of that catastrophe as well.

Slavery and environmental destruction are doing a deadly dance. The scale of their joint disaster is so great that it has simply been too big to see, until now. It is also subtle, a creeping erosion of life wrought by the hands of millions of slaves compelled to destroy their own livelihoods even as they destroy any chance of arresting global warming. Yet, it is precisely the role slaves play in this ecological catastrophe that opens a new solution, one that unleashes the power of abolition to save and preserve the natural world.","Fri, 15 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/E6C25D04-9E4F-427B-88AEF4F53FA60195.jpg,"['villages', 'sundarbans', 'storm', 'surge', 'shrimp', 'slavery', 'farms', 'destroy', 'mangroves', 'seafood', 'fish', 'hunger', 'excerpt', 'forests']",

If 2015 touched the surface when it came to the CSR initiatives undertaken by law firms in Asia, 2016 provides a clearer view. The list has been expanded from 10 to 25 to accommodate the veritable flood of entries that ALB received this year, and such was the quality of the submissions that it was extremely hard to decide which firms to leave out of the list.

In the interests of space, we’re only highlighting notable CSR work by a few firms on the list. For the full picture, we urge you to reach out to each of the respective firms in the list opposite for details. Three firms from Malaysia made the CSR List this year. Of these, Azmi & Associates, which describes itself as a “progressive law firm [that] continues be a strong believer of CSR programs and giving back to society,” has sponsored scholarships for students in its home country.

Meanwhile, MahWengKwai & Associates was involved in a fundraising campaign in aid of the Nepal earthquake relief, raising 450,000 ringgit ($102,000) in the process. It also supported an organ donation drive in Malaysia, and participated in a conference on strengthening birth registration in Sabah.

As for Thomas Philip, the firm’s initiatives last year included bringing electricity to an off-grid rural village of about 50 households in Long Pakan, Ulu Baram in East Malaysia’s interior Sarawak. In South Korea, Bae, Kim & Lee’s numerous CSR initiatives this year included providing assistance for asylum seekers and foreign migrants; working with related NGOs, government agencies, and corporations to provide support related to issues faced by social enterprises; and offering assistance and advice to women, youth and the differently abled.

As for Yoon & Yang, it has offered legal representation for foreign migrant workers; hosted a pro bono conference; advocated on behalf of patients suffering from Hansen’s diseas; and provided legal aid for the homeless, among others. The firm’s work earned it the “Grand Award for Attorneys Dedicated to Public Interest” from the Korean Bar Association.

According to of counsel Hong Hoon Lee, Yoon & Yang the firm“has a long and rich tradition of public service that is an integral part of its history.” In May 2012, Yoon & Yang established a Pro Bono Committee, combining and strengthening several existing pro bono and charity programs that had been launched since 2003, when the firm was established. And in order to pave the way for continuous pro bono activities, the Yoon & Yang Public Interest Foundation was established in November 2014.

As of Dec. 4 last year, Yoon & Yang’s attorneys dedicated had dedicated 4,771 to pro bono work or community service in 2015, or an average of 20.5 hours per lawyer. Additionally, 29 percent of firm’s attorneys participated in more than one activity during the year.

On July 21, the firm held its inaugural pro bono conference in South Korea, which drew some 40 lawyers and doctors. At the conference, attorneys presented seminars on the legal issues surrounding infectious diseases including MERS, an outbreak of which occurred in the country.","Thu, 28 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.legalbusinessonline.com/sites/default/files/pictures/og-image-alb200.jpg,"['yoon', 'legal', '2016', 'bono', 'pro', 'kingdom', 'work', 'united', 'alb', 'list', 'csr', 'yang', 'firms']", 
44,44,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Jail to jihad: Prisons a breeding ground for militancy - Deccan Herald,https://www.deccanherald.com/content/523896/jail-jihad-prisons-breeding-ground.html,"Afif was an inmate in a high-security Indonesian jail when he transformed from aspiring radical Islamist to soldier for Islamic State, ready to sacrifice his life for a group based thousands of miles away in the Middle East.





His journey ended with his death last week on a busy intersection in central Jakarta, after the gun and suicide bomb attack he launched with three other militants that brought Islamic State's brand of violence to Southeast Asia for the first time.



Afif's graduation from jailbird to jihadi shines a light on a prison system where staff shortages, overcrowding and corruption have allowed extremists to mingle and emerge as determined killers in the name of Islam.



Security officials say Afif, also known as Sunakim, was sentenced to seven years in prison for taking part in a militant training camp in the province of Aceh, where Islam is generally practiced in a stricter form than other parts of Indonesia.



Once behind bars, he refused to follow deradicalization programs, the officials added.



Akbar Hadi, spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, declined to comment on whether Afif's activities were monitored after he was released last August.



Police said he planned the Jakarta siege with the three other attackers, one of whom was also a former convict. Four civilians died in the attack along with the militants.



A report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last year said that 26 prisons across Indonesia housed about 270 ""convicted terrorists"", but Islamic State supporters accounted for only a small minority of them.



National Police Chief Badrodin Haiti told Reuters that at least five jailed militants were believed to have been in communication with the plotters in the lead-up to the attack.



COURIERS, CELL PHONES



While inside Jakarta's Cipinang prison, Afif was one of some 20 convicts heavily influenced by fellow convict and firebrand Islamist cleric Aman Abdurrahman, experts said.



From behind bars, Abdurrahman heads an umbrella organization formed last year through an alliance of splinter groups that support Islamic State.



""They shared the same cells, they prayed together, they cooked together,"" said Taufik Andrie, Jakarta-based executive director of the Institute for International Peacebuilding.



Abdurrahman regularly spread ""takfiri"" doctrine, a belief among Sunni militants who justify their violence by branding others as infidels, through his sermons and lectures.



Abdurrahman was moved to a maximum security prison in Nusakambangan in Central Java in 2013, but continued to communicate with Afif and a growing group of around 200 followers using couriers and cell phones.



A lawyer for Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, another high-profile radical inmate at Nusakambangan, told Reuters it is easy to convey messages to the outside world from inside prison.



""Any kind of visitor is allowed and even if they don't exchange any cell phones, there is still an exchange of information and the visitor can interpret that,"" said Achmad Michdan.



SOCIAL MEDIA A KEY TOOL



Experts say radical inmates like Abdurrahman still get away with disseminating sermons by email, Facebook, and hard copies. Despite being behind bars, Abdurrahman was able to make an online pledge of allegiance to Islamic State in 2014.



""Those with more radical thinking can also hold religious sermons on a regular basis and it is very easy to convey radical ideas to others,"" said Farihin, a former militant who participated in a government deradicalization program during his time in a prison in Palu on the island of Sulawesi.



Indonesia's counter-terrorism chief, Saud Usman Nasution, told Reuters in November that prison officials were unable to halt this type of communication because of overcrowding.



""We are aware that there is a problem with convicts being allowed to communicate using the Internet and cell phones. There is definitely room for improvement,"" said Ministry of Law and Human Rights spokesman Hadi, adding that inmates cannot be forced to join deradicalization programs.



Experts say access to social media and messaging apps like Telegram is a large part of the problem.



Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.



He may also have transferred thousands of dollars to accounts here, police said.



Since the attack, Indonesia has blocked websites and sent letters to social media networks Twitter, Facebook and Telegram, asking them to take down radical content.","Tue, 19 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/2016/01/19/523896.jpg,"['islamic', 'radical', 'ground', 'jihad', 'media', 'militancy', 'afif', 'prison', 'cell', 'told', 'breeding', 'attack', 'abdurrahman', 'state', 'jail', 'prisons']", 
45,45,FL-2016-000009-IDN,House with Creative Ceilings and Glass Floors - Trendir,https://www.trendir.com/house-with-creative-ceilings-and-glass-floors/,"Located in Jakarta, Indonesia, F+W House was designed by DP+HS Architects around a central corridor created with glass floors and ceilings that allow natural sunlight to spill into the center of each of the 3-stories. The house utilizes the central corridor as a horizontal and vertical circulation passage with rooms on either side of it on each of the 3 stories. With the corridor centrally located, the sunlight passively lights up the otherwise windowless area.

On the main floor, the corridor is a long void with the living, dining and kitchen areas on one side.

F+W House is located on a cul-de-sac.

F+W House shares an exterior wall with its neighbor.

While the side of the home shares a wall with its neighbor, the back of the home overlooks a lush green space.

A private and quiet glass room on the roof offers views to the sea a few km to the north.

The pool is located on the 2nd floor, next to the social zone.

The ceiling of the social zone is designed to resemble the water ripples on the pool’s surface.

A mirrored section above the media center reflects the ceilings water ripples, continuing the pattern onto the vertical realm.

On the opposite side of the social zone is the central corridor with its glass floor and ceiling. There are also air outlets in the glass roof for hot air removal and cross ventilation.

Aside from letting daylight flood into the center of the home, the glass floor and ceiling offer views to the other levels.

Downstairs the corridor is more contained with doorways leading to separate, smaller rooms. With each room completely separate to the corridor, DP+HS Architects where able to create a different design scheme per room.

The master bedroom features its own unique relief pattern within the ceiling. The pattern is decidedly geometric as is the zig zag pattern in the headboard and the 6 square etchings in the mirrored panel above the bed.

A second bedroom has a more abstract design within its ceiling detail of grey voids and white positives.

A third bedroom is “super” fun with its vintage wall motif.

The master bath has a quieter almost Zen like atmosphere.

A second “just for men” bathroom is a minimalist design of just the necessities.

A family room amps up the volume by wrapping the wallpaper up and across the ceiling.

The home theater takes advantage of a deep relief pattern in the ceiling for acoustical enhancement.

46,46,FL-2016-000009-IDN,How Europe Can Help the Rohingya – Foreign Policy - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/27/how-europe-can-help-the-rohingya/,"How Europe Can Help the Rohingya

When the dry season brings calmer seas to Southeast Asia, scores of Rohingya Muslims are likely to take to rickety boats to flee oppression in their homelands. As this sailing season looms again in the region, so does a refugee crisis that follows with equally seasonal regularity.

The Rohingya are a distinct, Muslim minority in Southeast Asia, whose presence in the region stretches back some 1,000 years. Since 2012, over 100,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to religious discrimination, typically fueled by Buddhist agitators. Many have been shut out of nearby countries where they sought shelter. Today, there are sizeable Rohingya communities in Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Despite their historical roots in the region, the Rohingya are largely viewed as foreigners and denied basic rights.

Looking back, 2015 could be summed up as the year of the global refugee crisis. Civil war in Syria has increased the global rate of displacement due to persecution and war to the highest recorded levels in history. Europe has yet to develop a coordinated, region-wide response to refugee floods. While Europe’s refugee crisis has taken center stage in global politics, Asia has long been home to the largest number of asylum seekers and refugees on the planet. The United Nations estimates that the number of displaced persons in Asia skyrocketed by over 30 percent in 2014. Though there is an obvious need for leadership and strategies for supporting refugees, there remains a policy vacuum in the region.

Few Asian countries have signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which defines who qualifies as a refugee, the rights guaranteed to refugees, and the responsibilities that states have to them. The agreement could be beneficial in Southeast Asia, both for states and for refugees. By signing, states receive guidelines on how to address refugee inflows, and if they abide by the definition of who qualifies as a refugee, they also get political cover for rejecting individuals who do not fit the decades-old definition. Refugees, in turn, are guaranteed at least some basic rights.

In 2015, The New York Times described China and India, Asia’s two top-league powers, as “sitting out” of the Rohingya refugee crisis. This inaction was largely the result of putting moral concerns second to political calculus. Countries see no positive outcome in the short-term for touching a tinderbox issue.

If strong leadership cannot be found in Asia’s most powerful countries, the best tool to address the crisis might be the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia’s most inclusive intergovernmental organization. In 2012, after much debate, ASEAN adopted a Human Rights Declaration that explicitly enshrined the right to asylum.

Ironically, however, human rights activists are wary that this declaration may actually undermine human rights gains in the region, because it states that “the realization of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context.” This clause can be interpreted as allowing states to use their national context – i.e. religious background– as a pretext to reject certain refugees. The declaration will likely not encourage a sense of shared responsibility.

With hopes of a regional approach waning, the Rohingya may benefit from the approach recently adopted by France and other European countries working to address the root cause of migration. Fearing that it can’t take another year of heavy migrant influx, Europeans are leaning toward a retooled refugee strategy, one that devotes key resources to quelling the war in Syria to stem refugee flows at the source.

In Southeast Asia, fostering reconciliation, especially in Myanmar, between the Rohingya and their oppressors would be a serious step forward. Recent fieldwork conducted by Anthony Ware and Ronan Lee suggests that domestic compromise can be attained. Both minority Rohingya Muslims and majority Rakhine Buddhists in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, where some 800,000 Rohingya Muslims live, believe that peace could be achieved if the government would provide the political leadership and resources necessary to ensure each community’s human rights. Following a thumping victory by the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Myanmar’s historic November election, all eyes have turned to NLD chairwoman Aung Sang Suu Kyi to bring attention and action to the plight of the Rohingya. Regrettably, the democracy icon has so far fallen short on addressing the widespread discrimination against the Muslim community, drawing criticism for what many see as bowing to political pressure from the country’s overwhelmingly Buddhist voters.

Regional leaders have a chance to prevent the next chapter of Southeast Asia’s refugee crisis. ASEAN nations may be able to solve their refugee problem by using a judicious combination of carrots and sticks to entice governments to dismantle the anti-Muslim frameworks that have made the Rohingya one of the most persecuted minority groups in the world.

Working toward a solution to the region’s substantial refugee challenges will require a bold response at the regional level to address the large numbers of refugees and the root causes of displacement. One or more regional governments must take up the mantle to support these efforts and funds must be provided to ultimately integrate Rohingya refugees into their new host countries or back into society in Myanmar.

2015 has taught us that there is no silver bullet for refugee crises. If 2016 is to be different, and if fewer Rohingya are to lose their lives in the pursuit of safety, ASEAN countries must accept their responsibility and work together toward a sustainable solution.

47,47,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Weird weather? Blame the North Atlantic - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/weird-weather-blame-the-north-atlantic-53271,"Whether dubbed “climate extremes” or “global weirding”, we have been witnessing some surprising and concerning weather events. In Europe, seasons seem to be changing, but not consistently. Since the turn of the millennium, the UK in particular has experienced record-breaking summer heatwaves, extraordinary rainfall in different seasons, and winters extreme in both warmth and cold. Something seems wrong, and we don’t have a complete understanding of what is going on.

In 2003, much of western Europe endured the hottest summer on record and July 2006 was the hottest month ever recorded in England – both periods were defined as heatwaves.

From 2007 onwards, the UK ran into a sequence of relatively cool, wet summers, with exceptional rainfall and widespread flooding in 2007 and 2012.

Winters have been likewise variable. Mild winters dominated the 2000s until a sequence of two remarkably cold and snowy seasons in 2009-10 and 2010-11. The epic stormy winter of 2013-14 then saw destructive waves at coastlines around the western UK and record rainfall in southern England.

Most recently, in late 2015, the UK experienced exceptionally mild conditions, accompanied in November and December by record-breaking rainfall and devastating floods. December 2015 was the warmest on record in central England (these records date back to 1659, and also smashed previous records in Germany and Switzerland. This coincided with exceptional December warmth along the East Coast of the US with cities like New York and Boston experiencing their warmest Christmas on record.

Many of the above are warm weather events, the sort you might expect to happen more frequently thanks to our changing climate. However, the extent to which standing records have been shattered – in such a short space of time – is astounding. This suggests some sort of regional effect may have amplified the extremes experienced around the North Atlantic.

Atlantic anomalies

So what’s behind all this extreme weather? Some have sought links to changes in the Arctic, in the tropics, or in solar activity. And all of these do influence the “jet stream” high in the atmosphere that guides and drives weather over Europe and North America.

But there’s a more local factor: temperature patterns in the North Atlantic. To appreciate the extent and speed of recent changes, consider these maps of some recent sea surface temperature anomalies. Since our climate has warmed, the anomalies are calculated relative to a “new normal” – average conditions over the millennium to date (2000-15), rather than earlier cooler times. This emphasises the recent warm-cool swings.

We’ve witnessed striking changes. The winter of 2009-10 saw the development of a classic “tripole” pattern comprising positive (warm) anomalies in the tropics and subpolar latitudes, sandwiching negative (cool) anomalies in between. The temperature anomalies were clearly established by the end of that winter, in March 2010. This well-known pattern disappeared at the ocean surface through summer 2010, but persisted beneath the waves and re-emerged in the early winter of 2010-11.

The “tripole” partly explains the UK’s record low temperatures and snowfall during those two winters, by helping to establish weaker low and high pressure centres around Iceland and the Azores respectively. With this change in pressure pattern, the UK is more dominated by cold Arctic and Eurasian air.

The ‘cold blob’

Very different conditions unfolded through winter 2013-14. By March 2014, a “cold patch” had developed in the Atlantic south of Greenland. It proved resilient. The cold patch again survived summer and not only re-emerged but remarkably intensified through last year, peaking in August, and persisting into November and December of 2015. In fact, across the two hottest years on record, that region of the Atlantic has stood out for actually being colder than usual.

This has a big knock-on effect elsewhere. The cold patch may have displaced and invigorated the jet stream and exposed the UK to a flow of mild and moist Atlantic air from the south-west, which links it to the very unusual recent weather.

It’s not just the UK, either. These changes in the Atlantic coincided with extremes across eastern North America and Europe – those warm Christmases – though other influences, such as the current El Niño, are clearly important too.

It’s too early to say how much the Atlantic may have influenced strange weather elsewhere, but anomalous warmth in the western subtropics and the Gulf of Mexico late last year is also noteworthy, and may be linked to those balmy conditions in the eastern US.

Changes in weather extremes are both breathtaking in scale and serious in consequence. And it’ll get worse before it gets better. Despite agreements aimed at limiting global warming to 2°C, we still face dangerous climate variability. As shown in the maps above, rapid “unseasonal” temperature fluctuations already often exceed 1-2°C across large regions of the North Atlantic.

So as the world warms, we are carefully monitoring our oceans, and how they are interacting with the atmosphere – this is key to a better understanding of extreme weather and seasonal predictions. There has never been a more important time to get to grips with our volatile climate.","Fri, 22 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/108587/original/image-20160119-29783-1yhsvmo.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=101%2C726%2C4025%2C1955&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['atlantic', 'record', 'anomalies', 'cold', 'climate', 'weird', 'weather', 'uk', 'winter', 'temperature', 'north', 'blame']",

But an underground fissure in scorching-hot Death Valley is the only natural habitat for the endangered Devils Hole pupfish, a silvery blue creature about the size of a pet goldfish.

The water inside Devils Hole is consistently a toasty 32°C, hot enough to kill most other fish. For 2 months of the year, the cavern—which opens into a deep subterranean lake—receives no direct sunlight. And yet scientists believe a small population of pupfish has lived there for 10,000 to 20,000 years, hardy survivors from the days when Death Valley was a fertile oasis.

Now, evidence is growing that these fish might be far younger than previously assumed: A new study suggests that the Devils Hole pupfish actually colonized its watery cavern somewhere between 105 and 830 years ago, making scientists rethink how it got there in the first place.

“Our new estimate of the younger age in a way makes this species even more fascinating because it has so many of these unique traits relative to other pupfish,” says Christopher Martin, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who led the study.

Pupfish first arrived in Death Valley during a wet period, probably when water joined the area to lakes or rivers elsewhere. But as the water dried up and the area turned to desert, the pupfish became isolated in a smattering of springs. Like Darwin’s finches, pupfish in different pools have evolved different traits and become distinct species over the years. They’ve mixed with each other only occasionally, when floods temporarily join isolated pools.

Devils Hole is especially isolated, and the pupfish population there is particularly small, ranging from 35 to 548 fish in the remote cavern since official recordkeeping began in the 1970s. Their survival has been heralded as an evolutionary anomaly, as such populations usually become severely inbred and die out. “All we know about conservation genetics suggests that these populations of very small size should not be able to survive in the long term,” Martin says.

But the long estimate for the Devils Hole pupfish’s survival (and by extension, that of their relatives throughout Death Valley) was based on when events like floods could have brought them there, not their evolutionary history. Martin and his colleagues turned to genetics instead.

To figure out just when the Devils Hole pupfish diverged from its kin, the researchers sequenced 13,000 different stretches of DNA from 56 pupfish from around Death Valley and the world. Those data allowed them to reconstruct the area's pupfish family tree and calculate when the different species emerged.

Although scientists previously believed the first pupfish species came to Death Valley several million years ago, these analyses suggest they arrived around the time of the valley’s most recent flood, just 10,000 years ago. The analysis also suggests the Devils Hole pupfish became isolated from other pupfish in Death Valley fewer than a thousand years ago, much more recently than expected—long after floods could have carried them into their remote cavern, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The findings build upon those of several smaller studies also suggesting a more recent emergence of the Devils Hole pupfish. ""The agreement is striking. I would say there’s mounting evidence that they are younger than we originally envisioned,” says Craig Stockwell, a biologist at North Dakota State University in Fargo who published a similar but smaller genetic analysis in 2014.

“One of the major questions we’ve had about this species for years is how this species originally made it into Devils Hole,” says Sean Lema, a biologist at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who was not involved in the project. “To date, this is really the best attempt to figure out from the genetic evidence, the divergence of this [species].”

Despite its suspected youth, the Devils Hole pupfish has developed some unique features. It’s smaller and less aggressive than its kin. It has larger eyes and darker scales, and it lacks the pelvic fins found on every other desert-dwelling pupfish. If Martin’s analysis is correct, the fish has evolved these traits all within the last thousand years or less—remarkably quickly on an evolutionary timescale.

“I think what’s driving the uniqueness of the Devils Hole pupfish is the uniqueness of the Devils Hole habitat,” Martin says. “It’s one of the most extreme fish habitats I’ve ever seen in nature.” The fish spawn only on a submerged shelf that’s just a few meters on each side, the smallest natural habitat of any vertebrate. Food is scarce in the dark cavern. Such a challenging environment could put extra pressure on the pupfish to change more quickly, although it’s unclear how all of the adaptations are beneficial.

Martin emphasizes that the findings are preliminary, and that further studies are necessary to untangle the evolutionary history of the Death Valley pupfish. For instance, it’s still unclear how pupfish colonized Devils Hole in the first place if floods didn’t wash them in. Martin suggests human intervention could have played a role—Native Americans in the area ate pupfish and might have moved some of them between springs. Birds, too, could have inadvertently transferred fish eggs from one pool to another.

It’s unclear what the future holds for the Devils Hole pupfish—its already small numbers have dipped in recent years, and scientists aren’t sure why. But for now, it’s still holding on. “When I look at this habitat,” says Martin, “I’m amazed.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-desert_0.jpg?itok=ZCBc_6ln,"['desertdwelling', 'bizarre', 'suggests', 'valley', 'ago', 'evolved', 'martin', 'devils', 'pupfish', 'fish', 'hole', 'species', 'small', 'death', 'couple']",

Take note of some important indicators before you make a purchase.

Tips on how to judge the originality of a weave:

1 The best way to determine if a particular handcrafted product is from India or not is to buy from brands that have certifications from local agencies like Craft Mark.

2 To judge whether the chikankari on your cloth is by machine or not, it is suggested that one should see the kind of embroidery the piece of art boasts of. If it is handcrafted, the cloth will have French knots, shadow stitch, criss cross embroidery. In the machine made ones, you do not find these embroideries.

3 Patola weaving technique has travelled far overseas and some countries like Indonesia and Japan still have fabrics woven with this technique. However, there is quite a difference in the colours and motifs in India. Patola from Gujarat has an overdose of colour and intricacy. Although both double and single Ikat is being practised elsewhere, but design is something that can be copied assuming that the technique has been well mastered.

Authentic Banarasi weaves can be judged by looking at the reverse side of the sari. The ones done by hand will be heavy on thread work at the back and will look very different from the front. (Shutterstock)

4 When it comes to Assam silks, the silks used here are Muga, pat, eri. Pat is a very soft silk and to differentiate between handwoven and machine made, is by the locking system noticeable at the back of the sari.

5 Also, in machine made saris, there are a lot of limitations like colour and sharpness of the designs. The special aspect of handwoven Assam saris are that the border is woven separately and stitched on the sari.

6 One can differentiate a machine made sari from a handwoven one by the pallu and its border. In a handwoven piece, the backside of the pallu or border is a replica. In a machine made one, you will find a lot of threads hanging. Also in machine made, there are a lot of limitations like colour, sharpness of the design and intricacy.

7 Authentic hand block prints will have small flaws in the printing and drops of extra colours here and there. There will also be very distinct designs in bright colours whereas printed designs will be 100% consistent.

8 Authentic Banarasi weaves can be judged by looking at the reverse side of the sari. The ones done by hand will be heavy on thread work at the back and will look very different from the front. Also, only an original sari would have floats.

Read: Our never-ending love affair with saris

9 Another way to identify a real Banarasi sari is to check for a six to eight inch long patch of plain silk on the pallu of the Banarasi saree.

10 An original sari will mostly carry Mughal patterns like amru, ambi and domak. A fake Banarasi saree wouldn’t have these Indian hand made Persian designs on it.

The 38,000 hectare Spyglass Research Station north of Charters Towers was established by the Bligh Government in 2011 when two properties were bought and merged to create the new research station.

Ms Donaldson toured the station today, inspecting the results of a reported $8.5 million on stock yards, water infrastructure, access roads, staff quarters, data connection and offices.

The latest stage of the significant infrastructure upgrade for the property will involve the creation of a 300 megalitre water storage dam in the north east of the 38,000 hectare facility, where limited water is currently available.

The dam will be constructed with earth walls and two spillways, to enable it to handle a one in 100 year flood.

It will provide an estimated three-year supply of storage.

Tenders are currently being called for construction of the project, which is expected to be completed in May.

Ms Donaldson said the facility provides crucial support for North Queensland’s beef industry.

With a record 86.11 per cent of Queensland in drought, work at the station is designed to help producers to combat dry conditions.

“As any producer in a drought-declared area would know, a cattle business is only as good as its grass, and Spyglass also hosts a range of feed base research including better pasture and legumes, grazing land management, fire management and the application of new technologies,” she said.

“The Palaszczuk Government remains committed to ensuring Spyglass stays at the frontline of the North Queensland beef industry’s research and development.

“The establishment of this facility is no small feat, and I congratulate facility manager Stephen Anderson and his team who have made this happen.”

Minister Donaldson also praised Spyglass for its research into genetics, reproduction, nutrition, welfare and husbandry in consultation with Meat and Livestock Australia and northern beef producers.

“This includes a major five-year genetic research project exploring early-in-life female reproductive performance across three tropical beef breeds – Brahmans, Droughtmasters and Santa Gertrudis,” the Minister said.

A reader asks whether mass incarceration exists in Nevada?

•Short answer: Yes. Nevada incarcerates people at a higher rate per capita than the United States, and it imprisons African-Americans at more than three times their proportion in the general population.

Full question

The topic arose after a reader challenged an opinion writer in the Reno Gazette-Journal.

Abigail Polus of the community health center Northern Nevada HOPES wrote a column urging U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, to support the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act. The proposal would give judges more discretion in sentencing, allow mandatory minimum sentences only in more serious cases, and allow some individuals currently in prison to have their sentences reduced.

Ask the RGJ: Does using marijuana jeopardize pain meds?

How would Obama�s gun plan affect Reno-area cases?

A Reno reader who goes by the pen name Oliver Howard wrote in questioning the column:

“Abigail Polus claims that ‘Mass incarceration has destroyed communities across Nevada and the country....’ While I'm not too curious about the country, I am skeptical about this assertion in Nevada. So does her assertion have any merit locally? Is there mass incarceration here? My guess is that Abigail may have conflated mere overcrowding, cited in her first graph, with the more cynical notion of mass incarceration. … I'm not curious about the feds or other states. Abigail has charged Nevada with a serious wrong. But is she right?”

Full reply

First, a definition is important. Christopher Wildeman —an associate professor of sociology at Cornell University — defines mass incarceration this way in his introduction to the subject for the research site Oxford Bibliographies:

“Whether called mass incarceration, mass imprisonment, the prison boom, the carceral state, or hyperincarceration, this phenomenon refers to the current American experiment in incarceration, which is defined by comparatively and historically extreme rates of imprisonment and by the concentration of imprisonment among young, African American men living in neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage.”

To determine if this label applies to Nevada, a few statistics need to be determined: the rates of imprisonment in Nevada and America and the percent of black Nevadans who are imprisoned compared with the percent of Nevadans who are black.

America is the poster child for imprisonment. The United States imprisons more Americans than China imprisons Chinese, even though four times more people live in China. According to the latest figures from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, the U.S. prison population is 2,217,000 while in China’s is 1,657,812.

Ask the RGJ: Can new Reno bridge withstand �05 flood?

But what we care about is the rate of incarceration. The U.S. imprisons 698 out of every 100,000 people. For comparison, Cuba imprisons 510 out of every 100,000 people, the Russian Federation 445, Iran 287, United Kingdom (England and Wales) 148, China 119, Canada 106, Indonesia 64, Sweden 55 and Nigeria 31.

The United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, but holds more than 20 percent of its prisoners, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies.

Nevada’s rate of imprisonment is 712 per 100,000 — higher than the U.S. rate of 698 — according to a Wikipedia entry that combines data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics with U.S. Census Bureau state populations.

Nevada ranks 15th highest among states. Louisiana is No. 1 at 1,082 per 100,000 and Maine has the lowest rate at 285. In other words, the U.S. state with the lowest incarceration rate has one about the same as Iran.

A February 2015 report by the Nevada Department of Corrections shows that over 10 years from 2003-13, Nevada’s reported crime rate fell 30.1 percent while its prison population increased 23.7 percent.

The Nevada Department of Corrections responded to a request by the Reno Gazette-Journal with prison statistics broken down by race and ethnicity based on the prison population as of Jan. 4.

The data show a total prison population of 13,286, with 5,858 whites; 3,887 blacks; 2,793 Hispanics; 365 Asians; and other races and ethnicities represented by smaller numbers.

The Kaiser Family Foundation website shows state populations broken down by race and ethnicity using the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 Current Population Survey. According to it, whites make up 50 percent of Nevada’s population, blacks 9 percent, Hispanics 28 percent and Asians 9 percent.

Combining this data, we can look at whether blacks are disproportionately represented in Nevada’s prison system compared to their representation in the general population, as well as how other groups fare.

•Blacks represent more than 29 percent of Nevada’s prison population vs. 9 percent of the general population.

•Whites represent 44 percent of prisoners vs. 50 percent general.

•Hispanics represent 21 percent of prisoners vs. 28 percent general.

•Asians represent less than 3 percent of prisoners vs. 9 percent general.

When asked about reasons for these disparities among prisoners, a spokesperson for the Nevada Department of Corrections said, “We are in the business of housing people, we have no ability to estimate the reasons people arrive at our door.”

To recap, general rates of imprisonment higher are in Nevada than nationally and African-Americans are disproportionately represented in Nevada prisons. Wilderman, who defined mass incarceration, was asked if these statistics make Nevada a mass incarceration state.

“Yup, that would qualify it,” he said.

The reader who asked if Nevada is a mass incarceration state also wondered if the label applies locally. It does.

Before people are sent to prison, they go through the jail system, where they are held after arrest.

The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office gave a racial and ethnic breakdown of the county jail’s population on Jan. 7. The jail holds people brought in by all law enforcement jurisdictions in the county, including Reno and Sparks.

The emailed report for the RGJ includes a comparison between jail detentions and the county population, based on the 2010 Census. It says, “There were 9,814 African Americans residing in Washoe County, which equates to 2.6% of the overall population” and “The Washoe County Detention Center in-custody snapshot has a total of 148 African-Americans, which equates to 13.7% of the overall in-custody demographic.”

In other words, blacks are held in the Washoe jail at more than 5 times their representation in the county.

Whites are 85.3 percent of the county population and 58.6 percent of the jail population, while Hispanics make up 23.5 percent of the county population and 22.4 percent of the jail population.

In response to questions about this disparity, the report says, “While the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office manages the regional detention facility, the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office is responsible for a small percentage of the arrests discussed in this report and, as such, cannot speak to arrest rates or practices for other agencies.”

The report also broke down the current jail population by whether detainees were local residents: 56 percent of inmates had an address inside the county, 20 percent outside the county and 24 percent had no fixed address or unknown.","Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dca9fb715c2f8c172b5c16babedc9db6e830596b/c=0-262-5383-3290/local/-/media/2016/01/25/Reno/B9320657072Z.1_20160125163210_000_G9JD8U9MB.1-0.jpg?width=3200&height=1801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,"['imprisonment', 'population', 'rate', 'mass', 'higher', 'imprisons', 'washoe', 'prison', 'county', 'incarceration', 'nevada', 'jail']",

But behind the successful brand Milk & Co is a company that combines the best of both worlds.

Former Olympian Michael Klim was already splitting his time between Australia and Bali - where he lives with his wife Lindy and three children Stella, Rocco and Frankie - when he founded the successful skin care line.

While he regularly travels to Melbourne for business, time spent on the tropical island is not wasted.

'It's not like we come here and disappear. But we run our own hours. I can sit by the pool and do my emails while the kids play,' Michael previously told In Style magazine.

Sydney Morning Herald reported MIlk & Co has more than 12 staff, turns over more than $5 million a year and is available in 13 countries.

'It requires a fair bit of commuting but ultimately for me it creates a really good work-life balance,' Klim told SMH.

'I've got a really great team here in Australia and I feel confident that I can go away and things will still run well.

'Living in Australia you can be time poor trying to fit everything in and the natural pace in Bali is much more relaxed.'

Data of virtual water trade are based on the commodity trade dataset of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (Faostat)44. Detailed international trade matrices, , are available at the annual time scale from 1986 to 2011 and express the quantity of agricultural commodity i traded in year from country a to country b. Trade data are converted into virtual water flows by multiplying traded quantities by the crop virtual water content, , assuming that commodities are produced in the countries of origin of the flows. The total VW trade matrix, , is then obtained by summing across all commodities, i.e.

The considered crop virtual water content is the sum of green and blue water, i.e. rainfall and surface-/groundwater, contributing to crop evapotranspiration and data are provided by the global assessment of the Water Footprint Network45,46 as an average for the period 1996–2005. The centrality of such period with respect to our datasets grants the virtual water content to be reliable for our analysis, while variations due to interannual fluctuations are not accounted for.

Agricultural production data are available from the same Faostat database44 at the annual time scale for the period 1961–2011. Production data, , express the quantity of agricultural commodity i produced by country a in year ; data are then converted into virtual water volumes using the country-specific and commodity-specific virtual water content45,46, including green and blue water. The overall production, to be included in the virtual water balance (1), results from the sum across all primary commodities, m i , in order to avoid for double-counting of water volumes involved in secondary products47, i.e.

The Faostat database has also provided the population data for all countries over the period 1986–201144, while the total volume of actual renewable water resources are given by the Aquastat database maintained by the Land and Water division of FAO48. The per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices in US Dollars is obtained from the national accounts section of the United Nations49. All data are available upon request to the corresponding author.

The propagation model

The method bases on the virtual water balance of country c (Eq. (1)) where import, and export, , can be expressed through the virtual water trade matrix, VWT, as

being the virtual water flow from country a to country b. Knowledge of the virtual water embedded in production and trade (see the Data section) and choice of a prescribed year of data, enable the establishment of initial virtual water balances in all countries. The VW internal availability in each country is derived from Equation (1) and countries having negative availability are discarded from the analysis, as well as inactive countries without trade, for the impossibility to run the model in such cases (the number of remaining countries is 200–210, depending on the year and discarded population is less than 1/1000 of world population). The country-specific VW availabilities obtained averaging over the period 1996–2005 compare well with the consumption data provided by Hoekstra and Mekonnen14 from the same period. Per capita VW availability in 2011 are shown in the Supplementary Material (Figure S2).

The network perturbation is represented by a local crisis inducing a decrease of the VW used for agricultural production in country x, which can be caused by environmental or socio-economic events. The decrease of production is expressed as a fraction, β, of the initial production value and reads

where τ is an iterative index and identifies the unperturbed condition. β may vary from 0, identifying an absence of perturbation, to 1, identifying an interruption of the country agricultural production (see the following assessments).

The decreased production of agricultural commodities in country x, expressed in VW volume, will affect partly the national availability and partly the country exports. The partition between the two terms is chosen to be proportional to the relative weight of availability and export in the country and the modified terms of the country VW balance read

Where Parameter quantifies the export propensity of each country and tunes the impact of the perturbation on the network varying within the range [0,1], where 0 identifies a disturbance completely absorbed by a decrease of national availability and 1 identifies a disturbance totally reflected into a reduction of exports, preserving the national internal availability. In the following, a data-based evaluation of such parameter is shown.

The reduction of export (Eq. (9)) is propagated towards all trading partners of country x proportionally to the existing flows towards each of these countries. Following Eq. (7), the VW trade from country x to all partners, k, thus becomes

All trading partners will find themselves with a reduced volume of VW in the balance, similarly to country x but due to a reduced import rather than a reduced production. The disturbance affecting each importing country is then

which, assuming that production does not change, will have to be partitioned between internal availability and export according to Eqs (9,10), where substitutes and substitutes . Export reduction is again propagated towards all trading partners and the procedure is repeated iteratively, reproducing the propagation occurring in the network as a result of the initial crisis in country x. The recursive expression of the VW balance terms for country c at the n-th iteration reads

Iterations are interrupted when results reach a prescribed precision, that is when all terms in the trade matrix change less than a fraction ε of the previous values, i.e.

where is the final iteration step and ε is here taken equal to . At the end of the simulation, the reduction of production occurred in country x reflects into a reduction of VW availability in all countries, satisfying the relation

with a geographic distribution of reductions that depends on the trade network. The total iteration time is assumed to be shorter than the temporal scale of data, which is annual, because simulations mimic the continuous adjustments of trade to meet the equilibrium conditions between demand and supply. It is worth noticing that all variations of agricultural production and trade are referred to overall VW volumes, without tracking the composition in terms of commodities.

Model assumptions and parameter calibration

The propagation model bases on some assumptions and calibrations which are here supported by specific statistical analyses. These analyses are based on the variations of VW import, , VW export, and VW in agricultural production, , measured in subsequent years within the period 1986–2011 (1961–2011 when only P is considered) in all world countries with population greater than 1 million people.

Variations of export vs. production

The model assumes that a decrease of agricultural production in a country induces a decrease of export in the same country. Such hypothesis has been verified with a sign test considering the sample of and the corresponding (same country, same years) sample of values. The one-tail sign test confirms that when the production decreases (increases), that is , the median of is significantly lower (greater) than zero, with test p-value equal to . This supports the model assumption that a decrease of production is associated to a decrease of export.

Variations of export vs. import

Similarly, the model assumes that a decrease of import in a country is related, to different extents, to a decrease of export in the same country. The sign test is thus applied to the sample of values and the corresponding (same country, same years) values; the test confirms that when the import decreases (increases), that is , the median of is significantly lower (greater) than zero, with test p-value equal to . This supports the model assumption that a decrease of import is associated to a decrease of export.

Variations of import vs. production

Implicitly, the model assumes that a decrease of production induces a decrease of export, rather than an increase of import. A sign test is then applied to the sample of values and the corresponding (all countries, all years) values. Again applying the one-tail test, one finds that when the production decreases (increases), that is , the median of is not significantly lower (greater) than zero, with test p-value equal to 0.84. This supports the model assumption that a decrease of production is not generally associated to an increase of import.

Calibration of the parameter β

The β parameter represents the entity of a crisis and equals the percentage variation of the VW in agricultural production of the hit country. An empirical distribution function is built for the negative percentage variations of the VW production recorded in all countries and all years from 1961 to 2011 (time span of production data) to guarantee a better definition of the curve tail (see Fig. 7a). The parameter value, , used in the Result section represents a critical event with 2.3% of exceedance relative frequency among all recorded decreases, thus a rare but not unlikely crisis. Considering all years and countries without conditioning to decreases of production, such crisis has an exceedance relative frequency of 0.8% thus, on average, every year one country experiences a similar event, if i.i.d. events are considered.

Partition of the crisis within each country

Both a decrease of VW in agricultural production (in the country hit by the crisis) and of VW import (in all countries reached by the crisis propagation) determine a decrease of VW volume in the balance of the country (Eq. (1)). This decrease, measured generically with , needs to be partitioned between a variation of internal VW availability and a variation of country VW export, provided that , according to Eq. (1). The partition is expressed by the country-specific parameter α, or country propensity for export. The parameter is assumed to be proportional to the relative weight of availability and export before the crisis (Eqs (9,10)), i.e.,

Figure 7b shows the ratio of VW export variations over the summed decrease of internal availability and export (increases are left out) as a function of the country- and year-specific α values. Points are depicted with different grey levels according to the population of countries they refer to, to differentiate between large and small countries.

Points are rather scattered due to the variety of country conditions and behaviors. The 1:1 line represents the model assumption that the partition of crises within countries depends on their export propensity (Eqs (9,10)). Although a common pattern does not emerge in country behaviors, the proposed model fits reasonably well with most points and in particular with those corresponding to large countries. The least-square regression line, weighted by country populations (dashed red line in Fig. 7b), is found very close to the model line, supporting the model assumption.

It may also be noticed that several cases exist in which countries increase their exports despite a reduction of summed internal availability and export (negative vertical axis). In such cases, losses are compensated by the reduction of VW availability and likely by stocks alone, which are mainly devoted to compensate for variable/uncertain food availability.

Propagation of the crisis towards the partners

The model assumes that VW export variations of a country are propagated towards trading partners proportionally to the virtual water flows exchanged before the crisis. This has been assessed on a sample of cases identified by a decrease of country VW export larger than 10 km3 from one year to the following, provided that such decrease represented at least 10% of the initial export. This identified 20 cases in 26 years. In each case, initial fluxes towards the trading partners were normalized by the total VW export and the variations of flux were normalized with respect to the total variation of export. These values are then plotted in Fig. 7c, where the model rule of proportionality is represented by a single line (red solid line) and it compares well with data (coefficient of determination, , equal to 0.501) and with the least-square linear regression fitted to data. The same analysis performed with a less restrictive threshold of export decrease (1 km3) identifies 226 cases; the model fitting is still very good .

The propagation of an export decrease among trade partners has been investigated using also other variables than the initial VW export flux. Both direct and inverse relationships have been sought with destination-country per-capita GDP, total GDP and population; however, none of these variables explained globally or locally more than 10% of the variance of flux variations .

Indicators of impact and vulnerability

The proposed propagation model allows one to distribute an initial local perturbation to the whole network accounting for the network topology and virtual water flows. The procedure can be repeated applying the same initial perturbation to each of the N countries, obtaining a matrix of resulting internal availability in country c, , due to a perturbation in country x. Notice the addition of the apex x to identify the country hit by the crisis.

Some indicators are then useful to investigate the effects of local crises in the virtual water trade network. The absolute impact of a perturbation occurring in country x can be expressed through Eq. 2, where and and it depends on the country VW exports and the VW volume losses induced by the crisis. The normalized impact divides by the uniform percentage variation of VW availability induced in the world by the crisis, excluding the country of origin (Eq. (3)). Such normalized impact, , is independent on the crisis entity and it takes identical values if -for example- crises are defined by a given variation of VW export, rather than the loss of a given fraction of agricultural production. This normalized impact highlights the role of the network in defining the effects of crises. This is because it differentiates crises according to the most/least affected countries, taking values close to (or different from the) unit if countries are affected proportionally (or not proportionally) to their VW internal availability. Both absolute impact and normalized impact values are quantified for all countries in the Supplementary Table.

Measures of impact characterize the countries of origin of the crises, thus their active role in the propagation, as opposed to the passive role with respect to crises originated elsewhere, described by the country vulnerability. Vulnerability can be measured by the average percentage reduction of VW internal availability induced in country c by the perturbations triggered in all other countries, (Eq. (4)). In this case no population weight is necessary, as the percentage reduction within the summation term are referred to the same country.

The world-average population-weighted formulation of the variables (normalized impact and vulnerability), in a given year, are

where is the world average value, are the country-specific values of the considered variable and is the country population. The sum is extended to all countries in the world, N, that are active in the considered year.","Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fsrep18803/MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep18803_Fig1_HTML.jpg,"['availability', 'water', 'export', 'global', 'local', 'vw', 'foodproduction', 'model', 'virtual', 'decrease', 'crises', 'country', 'countries', 'production', 'effects', 'perspective']",

A former soldier of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), Mohamed struggles to find his balance using a single crutch and curses the refugee camp where he's been stuck for the last four months.

""This place is for animals, not for humans,"" he says. ""France is not good for us. If I don't go to England, I go to Germany.""

He is standing just outside Dunkirk, in Grande-Synthe swamp, where a camp of predominantly Kurdish refugees has grown from 700 inhabitants in October to more than 3,000. Few NGOs are on site, and French police guard the entrance, turning away any building materials to prevent the settlement from expanding.

Omed Mohamed must struggle to reach his tent through ankle-deep mud

The restriction has created a camp with two water faucets and one toilet per 115 people, forcing inhabitants to occupy backpacking tents pitched in unsanitary mud that floods each time it rains, which happens often in northern France.

Thirty-five kilometers (22 miles) from the Calais ""Jungle,"" the Dunkirk camp has conditions unseen anywhere else along the migration trail and could easily be declared Europe's worst, said Angel Muller, project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Grande-Synthe.

""It's more easy in South Sudan with 80,000 people in a camp coordinated by the UNHCR,"" Muller said. ""Here we have 3,000 people in a rich country, and it is a complete disaster. It is really a shame for me [as a French citizen].""

Volunteer Mecha den Houdyker removes rubbish from a drainage ditch to increase the outflow of contaminated water

In response to the situation and the town mayor's pleas for help, MSF is now building a 3.5 million-euro ($3.8 million) camp, with costs split between the NGO and the municipality, according to Muller. Five hundred weatherized tents will provide shelter for 2,500 people on dry ground.

Some camp volunteers criticize the facility as insufficient.

""The MSF camp is a Band-Aid and won't resolve the problem,"" said Maddie Harris, a Bristol native who has been coordinating volunteers in the camp for four months. ""It's just tents in a field again that may or may not be heated. Not to mention, it's the middle of winter and it won't be ready for another month.""



Desperate straits

Until now, MSF has provided the few sanitation facilities in the existing camp, but independent volunteers, mostly from England and Belgium, have been distributing food and sneaking in tents and building materials through the surrounding forests.

""If we weren't here, these people would have to break into houses and steal to survive,"" said Alain Meuleman, a Belgian volunteer who recently installed a water pump in an effort to reduce water levels in the camp. ""What we don't get from the pictures is the terrible smell and the sound of babies crying.""

Some volunteers have taken extraordinary measures to improve conditions in the camp. Every weekend, Mecha den Houdyker submerges waist-deep in adjacent drainage ditches, often used as bathrooms, to remove garbage and improve the outflow of water from the camp, in hopes of decreasing the spread of disease.

Rubber boots are a fact of life in Grande-Synthe

Scabies, a contagious skin infestation of microscopic mites, is a common problem in the camp, along with respiratory illnesses and burns among people huddling too close to fires when trying to stay warm at night.

""All the governments are not acting, and all of them have their reasons,"" den Houdyker said after pulling two dead rats from the water, ""but, for me, those reasons aren't justified when they create a place like this.""

The well-intentioned efforts of the inexperienced independent volunteers currently sustaining the camp are not always properly executed. Twenty-kilo (55-pound) bags of potatoes and onions lie throughout the camp, lost to the mud as casualties of unorganized food distribution.

Smugglers have the clean shoes

The camp in in Grande-Synthe, not far from France's second largest port, grew in response to discrimination faced by Kurdish refugees. Bedouins and Iranians are also present and negotiate with smugglers who charge 3,000-4,000 pounds (3,900-5,200 euros) per person for a chance to reach England, according to multiple sources.

Smugglers are easy to spot in the camp as their clean shoes give them away, but many young males try to sneak into trucks bound for England via the ferry terminal. Hama, a 20-year old Iraqi Kurd, said he studied his tactics online, and some of his friends have made it through by rubbing black pepper on their bodies to avoid detection from police dogs.

""I cut an 'L' into the plastic [tarp on the truck],"" Hama said. ""I put my foot in first and then my head. When I am inside, I use the tape to close the hole and stay quiet.""

So far, Hama has yet to make it to England, but he does not worry about getting caught.

""The police is good for us because they bring us back to the 'Jungle,'"" he said with a smile, holding a roll of electrical tape in his hand.

But these methods have proven fatal as Masu, an Afghan minor, died of suffocation earlier this week while hiding inside a truck in Dunkirk. He was 15 years old.

61,61,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Energy in 2016: five highlights from World Bank commodities report - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/energy-in-2016-five-highlights-from-world-bank-commodities,"In the wake of tumbling oil prices, an onslaught on coal and a year of geopolitical tumult, the World Bank has released its 2016 report on the outlook for the world’s commodity markets.

Carbon Brief looks at the five key takeaways for climate change and energy.

There’s all-round bad news for coal

The report makes grim reading for coal industry executives. Coal prices are expected to continue their tumble downwards in 2016. Having fallen by more than 60% since 2011, prices are expected to drop a further 13% in the year ahead. This is attributed to a number of factors, which have, in turn, led to weak demand and oversupply.

The US and Europe, in particular, are turning away from coal, as they pursue cleaner forms of energy.

China’s imports are falling, thanks to slowing industrial activity, other sources of energy coming online, and government policies to limit coal use. The nation, with its smog-plagued cities, intends to reduce coal’s share of energy consumption to 62.6% this year, down from 64.4% in 2015, and has suspended the approval of new coal mines for three years in order to achieve this.

This decline will only be partly offset by demand in India and other emerging markets, the report says.

Despite this decline in demand, ample coal supplies are likely to still be available, as past investments lead to a ramp-up in new capacity. Spare capacity in Australia and Indonesia could also come online.

Geopolitics will continue to affect energy markets

The energy market is not immune to the slings and arrows of wider geopolitical events. Oil and gas prices are highly susceptible to external conflicts and debates.

Iraq’s costly conflict with so-called Islamic State, alongside low oil prices, means that it is unlikely to continue its 2015 record crude oil production in the coming year. In 2015, the lifting of sanctions in Iran forced oil prices down further, in expectation of its oil further flooding the market — a larger-than-expected increase in exports could suppress prices in 2016, the report warns.

It also says that oil production could rise in Libya, following a UN-brokered agreement to form a new national government. After the deal was rejected by its parliament yesterday, this is an even more uncertain prospect.

The report points to the risk of supply disruptions in other key oil-producing countries, such as Nigeria and Venezuela, due to internal conflicts.

Warm weather depressed oil demand growth, which will continue to shrink

2015 was the hottest year on record, and consumption of oil and gas reflected this.

While overall growth in oil consumption reached a five-year high in 2015, it weakened in the fourth quarter of the year due to a mild winter in the northern hemisphere.

Mild weather was not the only pressure on oil consumption. Weakening economic growth, particularly in emerging markets, also slowed consumption growth. But it was shored up overall by the magnitude of the drop in oil prices, which encouraged consumption.

Oil consumption growth is expected to slow further in 2016, as oil prices begin to recover. Meanwhile, the UK’s Met Office has forecast that the coming year will once again break previous records.

It’s not just oil consumption that was impacted by the mild weather. Consumption of gas also weakened, helping to push US gas prices down by 23% in 2015. Natural gas prices globally are projected to continue to fall in 2016, with US prices specifically expected to drop by 4%.

US shale gas production could sharply decline

Growth in global oil production slowed sharply in 2015. Most of this occurred in non-OPEC countries, bucking the trend of the last two-and-a-half years, during which US production of shale oil boomed.

This is unlikely to be the case for much longer, according to the World Bank’s report. US shale oil production could drop sharply in 2016. The amount of oil flowing from each drilled well drops sharply over time — by some 70% in the first year — and the US is unlikely to offset these losses with new drilling.

US crude oil production is also expected to accelerate its downward trend in 2016, as non-OPEC producers attempt to sustain oil prices of below $40 per barrel. Production from OPEC countries, on the other hand, is expected to rise.

Oil prices are expected to gradually recover

The world watched on as oil prices continued their inexorable slide downwards in 2015, thanks to the lifting of sanctions on Iran, deteriorating growth in major energy-importing countries, and OPEC’s refusal to cut oil production.

2016 promises some small relief, with the World Bank projecting that crude oil prices will average $37 per barrel. While this represents a decline by 27% on last year, it mean that the price would rise from recent lows of below $30 per barrel. This is because demand is expected to strengthen with a modest pickup in global economic growth, while high-cost oil producers are likely to cut production as they sustain increasing losses.

However, this recovery is likely to be less dramatic than historic rebounds after sharp drops in 2008, 1998 and 1986, says the report. This is because of large stocks, continuing ample supplies and low demand.

GENEVA, 26 January 2016 – UNICEF is launching a US$2.8 billion appeal to reach 43 million children in humanitarian emergencies worldwide.

For the first time ever, the largest portion of the appeal – 25 per cent – is going towards educating children in emergencies. This year UNICEF plans to dramatically increase the number of children in crises who are given access to education – from 4.9 million at the beginning of 2015 to 8.2 million in 2016. More than half - 5 million – will be Syrian children inside the country or in neighbouring countries.

“Millions of children are being robbed of their education,” says Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s Director of Emergency Programmes. “Education is a life-saving measure for children, providing them with the opportunity to learn and play, amidst the carnage of gunfire and grenades. This year, a quarter of our appeal is devoted to education. By educating the minds of children and young people we are building hope so they can envisage a better future for themselves, their families and their societies and help break the cycle of chronic crisis.”

UNICEF’s 2016 appeal has doubled since this time three years ago. The twin drivers of conflict and extreme weather are forcing growing numbers of children from their homes and exposing millions more to severe food shortages, violence, disease, abuse, as well as threats to their education.

Around 1 in 9 of the world’s children is now living in conflict zones. In 2015, children living in countries and areas affected by conflict were twice as likely to die of mostly preventable causes before they reached the age of five, than those in other countries.

Climate change is a growing threat, with over half a billion children living in extremely high flood occurrence zones and nearly 160 million living in high or extremely high drought severity zones. One of the strongest El Niño weather events on record poses further risk.

The number of people forced from their homes continues to grow, with Europe alone receiving more than 1 million refugees and migrants in 2015.

“In the past few months I have seen with my own eyes children pushed beyond the boundaries of human suffering in Burundi, northeast Nigeria and along the migrant and refugee route in Europe,” says Khan. “Across the world, millions of children have been forced to flee their homes due to violence and conflict. The global refugee crisis is also a protection crisis for children on the move, who are at increased risk of abuse, exploitation and trafficking.”

UNICEF’s Humanitarian Action for Children 2016 appeal targets a total of 76 million people, in 63 countries.

The largest section of the appeal – US$1.16 billion – is allocated to life-saving aid needed for Syria and the Syrian refugee crisis in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Key needs include safe water, immunizations, education and child protection.

US$30.8 million is being requested by UNICEF to respond to the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe.

UNICEF is calling for US$180 million for children in Yemen where almost 10 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian aid in a conflict which is heading towards its first anniversary.

UNICEF is appealing for US$25.5 million to help protect children in Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, and to provide aid to Burundian refugees who have fled to Rwanda and Tanzania.

UNICEF is asking for US$188.9 million to respond to the humanitarian needs in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad, including addressing the consequences of the violence in northeast Nigeria.

UNICEF’s appeal also covers severely underfunded emergencies – including protracted crises in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan which were all less than 40 per cent funded in 2015.

Funds raised by UNICEF will be used for immediate humanitarian response, as well as longer term work to prepare countries for future disasters.



In 2015, UNICEF reached millions of children with humanitarian aid – including providing 22.6 million people with access to safe water, vaccinating 11.3 million children against measles, treating 2 million children for the most serious form of malnutrition, offering 2 million children vital psychological support and giving 4 million children access to basic education.

He moved back to China because his parents were unwell—a common reason for returning—and found a job in a bank, but did not enjoy it. So he left and started his own company. He now manages TNT Partners and CareerFrog, firms that help Chinese who study abroad find jobs back in China.

Young adults like Mr Teng are more mobile than any other age group. They are old enough to leave the parental home but have not yet acquired a family of their own to tie them down. They can fit their lives into a small bag—especially now that their book and music collections are stored in the cloud—and catch the next bus to adventure. A global Gallup poll found that 19% of 15-29-year-olds wanted to move permanently to another country—more than twice the proportion of 50-64-year-olds and four times the share of over-65s who felt the same way (see chart). Young adults are more footloose within their own country, too. The average American moves house 6.4 times between the ages of 18 and 45 but only 2.7 times thereafter, the census shows. And in developing countries, young people are 40% more likely than their elders to migrate from the countryside to a city. Such mobility is a good thing. In the absence of a war or flood, it is voluntary. People move because they think they will be better off elsewhere. Usually they are right. If they are wrong, they can always return home. Moving tends to make people more productive, especially if it is from a poor country to a rich one. Michael Clemens of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank, estimates that if a typical migrant from a poor to a rich country is allowed to work, he can earn three to five times more than he did at home. (And this assumes that he learns no new skills, though he probably will.) To win such a prize, migrants will take huge risks. A study by Linguère Mbaye of the African Development Bank found that those heading from Senegal to Europe were prepared to accept a 25% chance of dying in the attempt.

Moving tends to make people more productive, especially if it is from a poor country to a rich one

If all international borders were completely open, global GDP would double, Mr Clemens estimates. For political reasons, that is very unlikely to happen. In America, liberal immigration bills die in Congress. In Europe, the surge of refugees from Syria and the Paris terror attacks have reinvigorated xenophobic political parties and jeopardised free movement within the EU.

Voters fret that some immigrants might be terrorists, which very occasionally turns out to be true. They also fear that the incomers will poach jobs from the native-born. Some studies find that unskilled migrants depress pay by a tiny amount for unskilled locals. But overall immigrants bring complementary skills, new ideas and entrepreneurial zest, so they tend to boost growth. Also, because they are mostly young, healthy and working, they typically pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits.

Movement within countries follows a similar pattern. Migrants, again mostly young, go where the best jobs are. This has led to rapid urbanisation. Today 54% of the world’s people live in cities, up from 30% in 1950. The UN predicts that by 2050 the proportion will rise to 66%. Poor countries are urbanising fastest because they started off more rural. In sub-Saharan Africa 64% of young people who work scratch a living from the soil; in South Asia it is 45%. Almost any city job pays better than work on the land: in developing countries, non-farm workers add four times as much value as agricultural workers. In China, urban wages are three times rural ones.

Westerners looking at the crowded shantytowns around Manila or Nairobi cannot imagine why anyone would leave a picturesque village to live there. Migrants see it differently. They are giving up lives of back-breaking toil, stifling tradition and periodic hunger. They are moving to places with bright lights, better wages and infinite variety. Victor Daniel left Yobe, a cotton-growing state in Nigeria, and moved to Lagos, the country’s commercial capital, when he was 18. Now he works in a bar for $110 a month plus a bed. “I needed to find my own freedom,” he says. “Life is better in Lagos.”

In rich countries young people—especially the brightest—are clustering in big, vibrant cities. A quarter of Londoners are aged 25-34, for example, nearly twice the share in the rest of England. A survey of students at Harvard found that only 26% planned to return to their home state after graduation; 64% planned to work in New York, California, Massachusetts or Washington, DC.

Networks and soulmates

In the knowledge economy, it pays to be close to lots of other bright people to bounce ideas off. It also pays to be plugged into global networks—and the cities that are most attractive to native youngsters are often also the most attractive to immigrants. Nearly half of Canada’s immigrants live in Toronto, for example, and 40% of America’s live in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago or San Francisco. Another attraction of big cities is that they house vast numbers of single adults, so they are great places to meet a soulmate.

Both internal and cross-border migration are often temporary. Migrants may stay for a few years and then take their savings, experience and contacts home with them, as Mr Teng did. But governments try to discourage them from moving in the first place. Most obviously, they erect barriers at national borders to keep foreigners out. More surprisingly, they try to deter internal migration, too. China’s hukou system is the most egregious example, but there are many others. When the UN surveyed 185 countries in 2013, it found that 80% of governments had policies to reduce migration from the country to the cities.

Some such policies—such as promoting rural development—are benign. Others are not. India makes it hard for poor people to obtain public services if they move to a new state. Indonesia used to move inhabitants from densely populated Java to more remote islands, stopping only in June 2015.

More subtly, onerous planning rules in almost all countries block the construction of new homes in the cities where young people most want to live. Property owners, who tend to be older, favour these rules because they make their homes more valuable. (Christian Hilber and Wouter Vermeulen estimate that they double the cost of property in Britain, for example.)

Hence the refrain heard from young people everywhere: that housing is unaffordable. Hence, too, the large number who still live reluctantly with their parents. American women aged 18-34 are more likely to live with parents or relatives now than at any point since 1940. “I don’t know anyone my age who lives in central London without [parental] support,” says Peter Fuller, an intern at a bank. “I’m 24. I need a sense of independence. It’s hard to get that when you’re living at home.”","Thu, 21 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20160116_SRP016_0.jpg,"['fences', 'times', 'parents', 'young', 'cities', 'work', 'meet', 'high', 'country', 'countries', 'live', 'migrants', 'hopes', 'poor']",

70,70,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Philippines: Modernizing Landfills to Reduce Harmful Methane Emissions - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/01/21/philippines-modernizing-landfills-to-reduce-harmful-methane-emissions,"MANILA, January 21, 2016 – Towns and cities in the Philippines now have incentives to invest in technologies to capture methane from municipal wastes, thereby reducing emissions of this harmful gas that contributes to climate change.

Through its Carbon Finance Support Facility, Land Bank of the Philippines (LANDBANK) provides funding and technical assistance for installing methane recovery systems in sanitary landfills. Local government units (LGUs) and operators of sanitary landfills availing of this program can earn “carbon credits” or certificates of emission reductions (CER) that they can sell for extra income.

In a new agreement signed Thursday with LANDBANK, the World Bank commits to buy these carbon credits, providing LGUs and landfill operators more financial incentives to upgrade their facilities. Working with LGUs and landfill operators, LANDBANK commits to deliver 1.7 million carbon credits until 2020.

“This partnership with LANDBANK will help the Philippines achieve its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets while contributing to the global efforts to address climate change,” said World Bank Country Director Motoo Konishi. “Without firmer action, climate change can worsen poverty in many countries and put prosperity out of reach of millions people.”

Experts say climate change makes communities more vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather events like strong typhoons, floods and storm surges, among other impacts.

Under Republic Act 9003 (the Philippines’ solid waste management law), local governments are responsible for proper waste management within their constituencies, ensuring segregation at source, composting, recycling, efficient collection, and environmentally sound disposal.

However, compliance with the law among local governments varies widely due to constraints like limited financial resources, limited markets for recyclable materials, and lack of technical capacity.

According to Gilda E. Pico, President and Chief Executive Officer of LANDBANK, the new agreement can help LGUs comply with the ecological solid waste management law while improving the finances of their waste management operations.

“With rising population and incomes in many cities, local governments are hard-pressed to collect and dispose of increasing volumes of wastes that could cause higher methane emissions,” Pico said. “Together with the World Bank, we are pleased to work with local governments to help address this challenge while strengthening our role as lender to micro-, small and medium enterprises, and environment-related projects.”

Globally, landfills and dumpsites are the third largest sources of methane. In the Philippines, the latest available information (2000) shows that 60 percent of greenhouse gases from waste are generated by towns and cities. The rest is from municipal wastewater (14 percent), industrial wastewater (13 percent), and human sewage waste (13 percent).

The new agreement, technically called emission reduction purchase agreement or ERPA, utilizes the Clean Development Mechanism or CDM set by the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which commits countries or parties to reduce greenhouse gases emissions.

CDM allows industrialized countries and companies to fulfill part of their greenhouse gas reduction commitments through the purchase of carbon credits in clean-and-green projects in developing countries like the Philippines.

With CDM, investments in climate-friendly projects displace more carbon-intense technologies, resulting in measurable reductions in greenhouse gases, and yielding CERs or carbon credits. Each unit of CER is equivalent to a metric ton of carbon dioxide.

In October 2015, the World Bank provided a grant of US$410,000 (about 19 million pesos) from the Carbon Partnership Facility to LANDBANK to help build its capacity to implement CDM in the Philippines.

In May 2015, LANDBANK and the World Bank signed an ERPA for the purchase of CERs from livestock farms. This has encouraged 70 pig farms to introduce wastewater biogas systems to capture methane. Two pig farms are now scheduled to deliver on their CERS while 8 more are identified for inclusion in the next 18 months. Also, more farms are adopting cleaner technologies to deliver least 2 million CERs until 2020.","Thu, 21 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['carbon', 'bank', 'harmful', 'waste', 'world', 'local', 'philippines', 'credits', 'landfills', 'methane', 'emissions', 'landbank', 'reduce', 'greenhouse', 'modernizing']", 
71,71,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Post-sanctions Iran split between euphoria and caution - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/post-sanctions-iran-split-between-euphoria-and-caution/a-18998168,"It is President Hassan Rouhani's first visit to Europe since the EU lifted sanctions against his country.

For years, Iran has been struggling under the impact of these sanctions, imposed by the US, the EU and the UN in an attempt to curb its nuclear activities. With the major sanctions now lifted, there is huge excitement among both potential investors and Iranian businesses about a new market opening up.

""Iran's economy has declined so much due to sanctions and other problems that any opening, no matter how small, would make a positive difference,"" said Farhad Alavi, an Iranian-American lawyer and Managing Partner of Akrivis Law Group in Washington, D.C., which focuses on trade sanctions law.

""There is a lot of hype around this but it will take quite a while for us to witness a real deep change in Iran's economic and trade situation,"" Alavi told DW.



Potential market

On paper, Iran is in many ways an investor's dream. With the second-largest population in the Middle East after Egypt, the country offers a huge potential market.

On top of its wealth of natural resources, Iran boasts a young, tech-savvy and highly educated prospective workforce. According to World Bank estimates, the country has the second-highest number of Internet users in the region, just behind its neighbor, Turkey.

Around 60 per cent of Iran's population are under 30, transforming the country's traditional society

However, poor transportation and accommodation options pose a problem to international investors, while the country's complex economic structure - with large parts of the economy owned by the government - can seem impossible to navigate.

Lifting the sanctions will not automatically solve local issues like corruption and a lack of transparency in regulations - factors which will have to be tackled if the Iranian government wants to meet its ambitious target of 8-percent annual growth for the next five years.

Financial and political challenges

""Iran has practically no foreign debt, so actually it would be a dream client for international banks,"" said Michael Tockuss, Managing Director of the German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce in a press release.

But it is the banking sector which poses one of the biggest challenges for international trade. After the nuclear deal, the US Treasury issued guidance, reminding Americans that ""US persons - including US companies - continue to be broadly prohibited from engaging in transactions or dealings with Iran or its government.""

This also means using US-based payment services - be it credit cards or online services such as PayPal - won't, in most cases, be an option when dealing with Iran.

Iran and the US have had difficult relations for more than 60 years

""Banks still don't feel safe enough to go back to Iran, because of both the ambiguity of the law and the instability of the situation,"" said the Iranian-American lawyer, Alavi, who has been fielding a flood of inquiries about doing business in Iran ever since the landmark deal.

Political tensions are also an issue. ""What if the present political course between the two countries takes a U-turn after the presidential elections in the US?"" Alavi theorized. The Republican Party, which controls the US Congress, has been fiercely opposed to the deal.

But according to Reuters, international banks are preparing to re-establish links with their Iranian counterparts using the European SWIFT transaction system. But it's likely to take at least two weeks before the connections will be set up which will allow Iranian lenders to engage with the global banking world for the first time since international financial restrictions were imposed in 2012.

New opportunities, new ambitions

In Germany, there is great excitement about the possibility of re-energizing its once booming trade with Iran. Prior to the sanctions, Germany was Iran's second-biggest business partner after the UAE, according to the Iranian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

But when the EU agreed the sanctions and Germany withdrew, China was quick to fill the gap in the Iranian market. Today, for Europe's leading exporter to win back its place, it will have to compete with the low prices offered by China and India.

Still, Germany's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) expects exports to Iran to increase to 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in the coming years. In the long term that figure is likely to double, projects the DIHK.

German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel was the first top Western official to visit Iran after the nuclear deal was agreed in 2015

For his part, President Rouhani aims to boost the private sector by attracting some $50 billion dollars in foreign investment annually.

However, some are concerned that Iran's ambitions could be at odds with those of its potential partners abroad. ""Germany is putting more efforts into exporting goods to Iran rather than investing in production inside the country,"" said Golverdi Golestani, a Tehran-based entrepreneur and former president of the country's Auto Parts Manufacturers' Association.

""Iran on the other hand is looking forward to expanding domestic production to create jobs for its youth and polish its own industry,"" Golestani told DW.

Confidence boost

For lawyer Alavi, it's also a question of time. ""The law can change overnight, but for the actual implementation to happen we will have to wait for at least another two years or so, and that is being optimistic,"" he told DW.

For now, anyone looking to do business with or from Iran will have to do tread carefully and be patient.

But despite the practical difficulties, the positive psychological effects of lifting the sanctions are significant. The move will boost confidence on both sides in terms of spending, investment and trade. It will also enable previous successful relationships, like those with Germany, to rekindle.

""There are strong ties between Iran and Germany's economy and industry,"" said businessman Golestani. ""For me, the improvement of relations is a matter of course.""","Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/18985874_6.jpg,"['caution', 'irans', 'germany', 'trade', 'international', 'split', 'told', 'sanctions', 'euphoria', 'iran', 'iranian', 'postsanctions', 'economy', 'alavi']",

Cabbies claim they have had riders who 'disappeared' during the journey

Japanese taxi drivers working in one of the areas worst affected by the 2011 earthquake disaster has reported picking up 'ghost customers'.

Cab drivers in Ishinomaki, where 6,000 people died when a tsunami hit the town after earthquake, say they have taken fares from people who have then vanished during the ride.

There have been a number of reports of survivors of the March 2011 disaster seeing 'ghosts', a known side effect of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Ghost rider: Cab drivers in Ishinomaki (pictured after the disaster) have reported picking up 'ghost customers' in the years after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami

The earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 killed more than 19,000 people.

Ishinomaki was hit by a 30ft tsunami wave which wiped out much of the port city, with 29,000 people losing their homes. Some 3,100 people were confirmed dead, but 2,770 have never been found.

A number of taxi drivers working in the now-rebuilt city, which has a population of 145,800, claimed to have had ghosts in their cars.

The drivers have been interviewed as part of a study at Tohoku Gakuin University, Sendai, which has found that all drivers were convinced they were picking up genuine people.

One driver explained how he had picked up a woman who wished to go from Ishinomaki Station to the Minamihama district, the Telegraph reports.,

When he told her the area had been wiped out in the disaster, he claims the woman said: 'Have I died?'

Ishinomaki drivers said in the wake of the destruction, they have picked up riders only to turn around and see the back of their cab empty

When he turned to speak to her, there was no one in the back seat, according to the paper.

Another driver said he had picked up a young man and driven him to a location across the city, and found that his car was empty when he got to the destination.

A U.S. study on PTSD sufferers found that one in five sufferers reported 'seeing something that others could not see'.

The study, carried out by researchers at the University of Manitoba, Columbia University, and the University of Regina. also found that those most likely to experience seeing 'ghosts' were those who suffered PTSD as a result of being in a flood or natural disaster.

In addition, seeing ghosts was also most strongly connected to PTSD stufferers who had seen someone get killed, or 'experienced tremendous shock as a result of a traumatic event that happened to a close relative, friend, or significant other'.

In Ishinomaki, locals have reported seeing 'ghosts' waiting in line outside supermarkets, or walking down the streets where they used to live.

'The places where people say they see ghosts are largely those areas completely swept away by the tsunami,' said Keizo Hara, a psychiatrist in Ishinomaki said in an interview two years after the disaster.

In Tokyo, shares plummeted 3.7 percent, their worst performance in nearly 15 months, after the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate slipped to a new 12-year low of $27.42 (25.05 euros) a barrel. Traders' risk aversion pushed up the yen against the dollar, putting pressure on Japanese exporters.

Meanwhile in Seoul, markets dived 2.3 percent, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index tumbled 3.82 percent to a 4-year low.

""Drown in oversupply""

But the worst may not be over yet. The International Energy Agency (IEA) added fuel to the fire on Tuesday when it warned that the oil market ""could drown in oversupply"" in the wake of Iran's highly-touted return to international trading floors.

Freed from years of isolation and crippling sanctions, the energy giant has announced plans to immediately ramp up oil production and flood the market with an additional 500,000 barrels per day. The aim, Tehran says, is to double that amount within a year.

The combination of China's slowdown, weak commodity prices and turbulence in a number of emerging economies also prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut its growth outlook for the global economy by 0.2 percentage points to 3.4 percent.

""We may be in for a bumpy ride this year, especially in the emerging and developing economies,"" Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF's chief economist, said on Tuesday.

77,77,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Report: Pakistan signs coal mining deals with China - Climate Home,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/01/19/pakistan-signs-coal-mining-deals-china/,"Tharparkar opencast mine will produce 3.8 million tonnes of coal a year, under agreements signed in the past month

By Kieran Cooke

Pakistan has some of the largest coal reserves in the world and it is starting to use them for power generation.

Within the last month, Islamabad has signed a number of financial and technological agreements with China aimed at exploiting massive coal reserves at the Tharparkar mine in Sindh province, in the south of the country.

Under the terms of the agreements, 3.8 million tonnes of coal will be produced each year at the Tharparkar opencast mine to fuel a 660MW power plant and other facilities.

The estimated cost of the project is US$2 billion: China’s banks and private companies will supply US$1.5bn in loans, while Pakistan will contribute US$500m in private and public finance.

High risk

Scientists say the mining and burning of coal is one of the main drivers of climate change from human causes. The coal at Tharparkar is mainly lignite – one of the least energy-intensive and most polluting types of coal.

Pakistan is thought to be one of the countries most at risk from climate change: in recent years it has endured a number of floods and droughts, and in the summer of 2015 more than 1,200 people died in a searing heatwave.

Despite government declarations that it would prioritise climate change, Pakistan has shown little appetite for tackling the issue.

At the recent climate summit in Paris, Pakistan pledged to reduce its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by 5% over 2012 levels by 2030 – a figure sharply criticised as being far too modest by a number of the country’s own climate experts.

The energy produced by the lignite deposits at Tharparkar will be mainly directed at helping alleviate serious power shortages in Karachi, a city of more than 20 million people which is Pakistan’s main industrial centre.

Oil and water

At present Pakistan depends on fossil fuels for 65% of its electricity, while hydro makes up 30% of the mix. There are also three nuclear power plants, and wind and solar are fast-growing energy sources.

Environmentalists say the new coal-powered power plants will only worsen the country’s serious pollution problem. Karachi is already among the world’s most polluted cities.

The development of the Tharparkar coal field is part of an ambitious multi-billion dollar Pakistan/China economic development programme aimed at linking the remote western provinces of China to Karachi and other ports on the Arabian Sea.

China – the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases – has pledged to cut back on the use of coal for power generation.

But critics say Beijing is pursuing contradictory policies – cutting back on pollution at home, while encouraging heavily polluting projects abroad.

The report examines the fossil fuel reserves around the world that, if developed, would push the globe past 1.5C and then 2C of warming, the threshold beyond which the effects of climate change would make the Earth unlivable.

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to keep the world's remaining fossil fuels in the ground. That means moving away from coal, oil and natural gas and towards a renewable energy future. Photo credit: Greenpeace

Fresh off a series of victories in 2015, these groups and others are taking on many of the challenges identified in the Keep It In the Ground report as part of a global push to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and accelerate a just transition to 100 percent renewable energy.

“Climate change is already bringing flood waters and wildfires right to our doorsteps,"" May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, said. “At this point, continuing to burn fossil fuels is truly lethal. The effort by fossil fuel companies to dig up and burn coal, oil and gas despite the consequences is the biggest threat our planet faces. All around the world people are now mobilizing to keep fossil fuels in the ground.""

Keep It in The Ground lays out the carbon risk of fossil fuel deposits in Africa, the Arctic, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S., measuring each against a global carbon budget meant to prevent catastrophic climate change. The report also assesses the changing public policies surrounding each fuel source, fossil fuel industry efforts to develop them and citizens' ongoing efforts to keep them in the ground.

“With the historic climate accord set in Paris last year, nearly 200 nations from around the world set an expiration date for fossil fuels,"" Lena Moffitt, director of Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, said. “Now we must rise to the occasion by transitioning to 100 percent clean and renewable energy sources and leave dirty fuels where they belong—in the ground.""

According to the report, unless Canada's government implements strong environmental protections, the country's tar sands projects could add an expected 420 million metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere each year by 2020—more than the entire annual emissions of Saudi Arabia. Tar sands are the fastest growing source of emissions in Canada and the Trudeau government has yet to present a plan to reconcile new tar sands mines and pipelines with international commitments on greenhouse gas reductions. Beyond spewing an additional 700 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, expanded mining activity in Australia's Queensland region would devastate the Great Barrier Reef, which is already under severe stress from rising temperatures.

""The global climate movement is stronger than ever and we've seen important progress in the effort to keep fossil fuels in the ground, from Arctic oil to Powder River Basin coal,"" Kelly Mitchell, Greenpeace U.S. climate director, said. “We can't undo the damage that fossil fuel companies have caused already, but we can prevent further harm and build a more just world in the process. Our lives depend on it.""

Held every five years, the closed door session will end on January 28th with the naming of the new general secretary, the prime minister, the president, the chairman of the National Assembly and other top functionaries.

Analysts said that an internal power struggle had been wrapped up before the congress, with current General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong expected to keep his job for at least half of the next five-year term.

Around 1,500 delegates are participating from all over Vietnam

Tussle for control

Trong's rival, the 66-year-old Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung had also vyed for the position but is now expected to retire. But two of Dung's allies are expected to be announced as prime minister and president, according to a leak cited by The Associated Press.

Dung's apparent ouster has caused jitters within Vietnam's business community, as he was credited with economic reforms that have brought a flood of foreign investment over the past decade. But his rivals have accused him of economic mismanagement.

By contrast, Trong is seen as closer to Communist neighbor China, Vietnam's biggest trading partner. The opening of the event has also been overshadowed by Beijing moving an oil rig into waters claimed by Hanoi.

The party congress will also approve a five-year economic roadmap, to help the country build on recent impressive economic growth of nearly seven percent annually, a rate that is one of Asia's strongest.

Banners have been hung in Hanoi in preparation for the Communist Party congress

Security was tightened in the capital Hanoi on Thursday as the meeting got underway. More than 5,000 soldiers were deployed along with helicopters and tanks to ensure public order is maintained.

Hanoi smartened

Outside the meeting hall, armed riot police were standing guard. Many streets were closed off and decorated with flowers and red banners proclaiming ""Long Live the Glorious Communist Party of Vietnam!""

Vietnam is one of the last remaining communist nations in the world with a party membership of 4.5 million from a total population of 93 million.

Similar to China, the government operates a quasi-free market economy alongside a strictly controlled society.

(UCAN Series: Best of 2016)

Hoping for a better future, Tak Kumari Khadga's family left their remote mountain village and moved to Sundardanda, a small hilltop village located near a road network and market area.

While Sundardanda may mean ""beautiful hill"" in Nepali, life in their new home was not easy for the family of six.

""The biggest challenge we encountered was the acute shortage of water for drinking and irrigation facilities,"" said Tak Kumari.

""The situation gets even worse during the dry season between November and February,"" she said.

When her family arrived at Sundardanda, the village was already suffering water stress due to its natural springs being dried out by expanding dry seasons.

""I had to walk for an hour from my house to reach a spring source to fetch drinking water for my family. On average, I had to walk 3-4 hours on a daily basis for drinking water,"" she said.

""And when there were guests in our place, I had to fetch water five times a day. This left me with no time to do other work,"" Khadga added.

During the rainy season, June to September, the locals grow seasonal crops like buckwheat and maize. Because of a lack of adequate irrigation water, arable land was left unutilized during the dry season.

""For the most part of the time, we traveled outside the village, to Kathmandu to work as daily wagers to support our family,"" said Tula Bahadur Khadga, 43, Tuk Kumari's husband.

""The seasonal food crops we grew, would last for 5-6 months and then we were dependent on the money we earned working as a laborer to support our family,"" he said.

One of the reasons the remote areas in the hills have a high youth migration rate is the lack of livelihood options left in the village. In Sundardanda, almost 90 percent of the young people have left the village in search of work.

Coping with water stress

It has been 16 years since the Khadga family moved to Sundardanda and over time the village has implemented measures to cope with water shortages. They have restored water catchments, constructed canals, and put in plastic ponds and installed water recharge tanks.

These measures have allowed many households to grow vegetables besides the regular seasonal crops, which has led to an increase in income for many households.

Fellow villager, Bholanath Bajgain, said things still could be better.

""The water is not adequate but it's not as scarce as it used to be in the past,"" Bajgain said.

The 47-year-old has lived in the village his entire life and he's witnessed changes in the area's climate, which he said became apparent from the early 1990s onward.

""The availability of water both for irrigation and drinking has been hit hardest,"" Bajgain said.

Water availability has become so scarce, he said, that some locals who discover a natural water source in their land are reluctant to share it while others sell it at high prices to a neighboring village in need.

Bhawani Dongol, a program manager from the World Wildlife Fund Nepal, said many districts like Sundardanda are facing water shortages due to the changing weather and rainfall patterns.

""Though the annual volume of rainfall has not changed significantly, the variation in timing and intensity has changed over the last two decades,"" said Dongol.

Experts say that the changing climatic pattern will further decrease groundwater levels during dry seasons while increasing the probability of life-threatening flash floods and inundation in the rainy season.

Affects on society

Madhukar Upadhya, a watershed management expert, said the shortage of water has emerged as a key issue for many Nepalese.

More than 70 percent of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture, which contributes to 36.8 percent of the country's total gross domestic product.

""The availability of water is directly linked with the socio-economic development of the country,"" Upadhya said.

""Local farmers are at the front line of any impact from climate change,"" he said. ""So, the intervention being carried out in some hilly villages with the construction of plastic ponds, recharge tanks and waste water management is praiseworthy and needs to be extended and made sustainable.""

As the impacts of climate change are becoming more pronounced, various adaption programs have been implemented across the country.

One project titled ""Strengthening adaptive small scale farming systems in rain-fed areas in Nepal, Bangladesh and India"" has been operating since 2011.

Supported by the European Union, the project is being undertaken by Caritas Austria and other partners in South Asia, including Caritas Nepal. So far the project has helped 1,335 smallholder farmers adapt to changing climatic conditions.

""The project has not only provided a much-needed platform for farmers to voice their concerns in front of government bodies and concerned partners and find solutions, but it has also helped to improve food security among poor and underprivileged farmers,"" said Chintan Manandhar, the program's national project coordinator in Nepal.

84,84,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Kerry urges China to press North Korea on nuclear program - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/kerry-urges-china-to-press-north-korea-on-nuclear-program/a-19006532,"Following Wednesday's four-hour meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, both sides spoke of ""constructive"" and ""candid"" talks.

Topping the agenda was how the two countries should react to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Earlier this month, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear bomb test.

The United States believes North Korea should face sanctions over its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and has urged China to join in on punishing North Korea. China has condemned North Korea's nuclear program but has taken little concrete action as a result.

Kerry and Wang were able to agree that a new UN Security Council resolution against North Korea would be prudent, but differed on whether or not it should include sanctions.

Watch video 00:33 Kerry: Goal of sanctions is to start negotiations

Kerry called for the Security Council to draft ""significant new measures"" of punishment for North Korea, while Wang said a ""new resolution should not provoke new tension in the situation"" and added that ""sanctions are not an end in themselves.""

In an editorial in China's official Xinhua state news agency on Wednesday, commentators said the United States pursuit of ""unceasing defaming, sanctions, isolation and provocation of the DPRK, [flare] up the country's sense of insecurity and thus [push] it towards reckless nuclear brinkmanship.""

Observers say that China refrains from really pressing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as North Korea is officially known, on the nuclear issue because it fears an eventual collapse of Kim Jong Un's regime. This could have unwanted consequences for China, including a Korean peninsula that is strongly allied with the United States and a flood of refugees from North Korea into China.

Kerry and Wang also addressed the issue of disputed territory in the South China Sea. The islands in question are claimed in part or wholly by a number of nations, including China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. China has recently made renewed claims on some of the islands and started construction of airstrips. This, said Kerry, needed to stop as it was contributing to instability in the region.

Wang repeated China's long-standing assertion that it is merely protecting its sovereign territory and rejected claims that China was deliberately stirring the pot.

""We cannot accept the allegation that China's words are not being matched by actions,"" Wang said, referring to the accusation that China was not interested in maintaining stability in the region.

Kerry's trip to Beijing comes at the end of a trip through Asia that saw him make stops in Laos and Cambodia prior to China. He has been meeting with officials in those countries to discuss the upcoming US-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit in Sunnylands, California, which is scheduled for February 15 and 16.","Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19006469_6.jpg,"['chinas', 'urges', 'china', 'press', 'korea', 'states', 'sanctions', 'united', 'kerry', 'program', 'wang', 'north', 'nuclear']", 
85,85,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Oil below $30: what does it mean for action on climate change? - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/oil-below-30-what-does-it-mean-for-action-on-climate-change,"The oil price slide below $30 a barrel is reverberating through the global economy. With sanctions against Iran being lifted, prices face further downwards pressure.

The new lows come after prices spent much of the past year around the $50 mark, as Saudi Arabia’s attempts to win back market share from US shale firms produced limited results.

There are recessions in Russia and Brazil. Saudi Arabia is burning through its reserves, its stock markets are in freefall and its population is feeling the squeeze, as it looks for new sources of cash.

Fossil fuel subsidies are being cut, from Saudi Arabia to India and Bahrain. The UAE is looking towards a life beyond oil. Oil majors are facing hard times, too, with BP set to axe 4,000 jobs as the total of shelved oil investments breaches $400bn since the price slump began in late 2014.

For all that, some papers have found reason for optimism.

An editorial in the Times says cheap oil is “bolstering Britain’s recovery”. The Financial Times says cheaper oil “may not be good for the prospects of reducing carbon emissions in the near term, but it is certainly of significant net benefit for the global economy and employment”.

With some predicting oil could fall as low as $10, an article in the Guardian looks at the tax, consumer and jobs effects for the UK.

From a global perspective, cheap oil might raise demand as well as putting pressure on oil producers. If oil remains cheap, the incentive to keep burning it could be stronger.

So, what does $30 oil mean for efforts to tackle climate change in the wake of the Paris agreement signed in December? Carbon Brief asked a range of experts for their views.

Laszlo Varro, chief economist, International Energy Agency

“Oil, gas and coal prices have all declined due to interconnected factors like the success of shale production or the decline of energy intensity especially in China. The impact on decarbonisation is a glass that is both half full and half empty.

“Investment in renewable energy – primarily wind and solar – have accelerated with further improvements in technology. Most of this is driven by policy: mandates, contracts and pricing have protected renewable investment. However, there is a risk that low prices could impact renewable energy policy ambitions, thereby pressuring further growth.

“Fifteen percent of all energy efficiency improvements are also at risk. In the transport sector, cheap oil hinders electric car deployment and can lead to increased sales of high-consuming SUVs. Further technology improvements and strong policies will be needed to break oil’s century old stranglehold on transport.

“However, low fossil fuel prices also lead to massive fossil investment cuts. Some projects that have already been cancelled were long-lifetime, high-carbon assets that would have been very problematic in later stages of decarbonisation. Cancelling or delaying such projects offers an opportunity to steer energy demand in a permanently cleaner direction.”

Nick Butler, Financial Times commentator on energy and power and chair, King’s Policy Institute, King’s College London

“$30 oil changes very little. The political will to act [on climate change] will be confirmed (or set back) by the outcome of the US presidential election, which is the most important event of the year for the climate agenda.

“The actual response to the climate issue will come from science and technology, and progress across a range of possibilities from solar to storage continues and looks encouraging. A fall in oil prices – temporary or more permanent has very little impact on that.”

Abyd Karmali, managing director, climate finance, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

“Low oil prices create broader macro-economic uncertainty that may distract some oil-revenue reliant governments from the commitments they have made in their INDCs [intended nationally determined contributions to the Paris climate deal]. In general, however, low oil prices provides governments that are heavy subsidisers of fossil fuels an excellent opportunity to rein in those subsidies and this should accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

“One key negative impact might be a slowing in the penetration of electric and hybrid vehicles. For example, in the US, there is already a slow down but this has not been seen in other automobile markets where fuel taxation is more material. As the price and range of new electric vehicles continues to become more favourable relative to petrol-based cars, the adoption of electric vehicles will continue to dampen demand for oil despite low oil prices.

“In terms of other market impacts, continued oil price volatility could remain a factor influencing solar stock valuations. There is, however, no fundamental connection between the price of oil and solar market fundamentals in most regions and so savvy investors may also look at this as an opportunity to enter the market for stocks that are weighted towards climate solutions.”

Tom Burke, chairman, E3G

“Oil resources deplete at about 10%/year which means that to maintain its reserve ratios the oil industry has to find and bring into production 10%/year of new resources. The $30/bbl. has cut just under $400bn from future investment and there is more to come. This is going to make replacement difficult.

“Prices will bottom at some point and then begin to recover but investment might not as in the meantime investment in efficiency and renewables, and social change, continue to undermine growth projections. Furthermore, I suspect it will turn out that a lot of oil assets were over-valued and many investors and bankers will have been burnt by the price collapse.

“The world is likely to continue to become more turbulent. This will lower the appetite of investors for high risk, high capital projects with a long lead time to revenues flowing. This appetite will be further lowered if, as seems to me likely if prices do not rise rather rapidly, the oil companies have to cut their dividends. Since investors have to invest in something I suspect we will continue to see rising investment in renewables as a safer bet.

“In other words we could be seeing the top of a death spiral for the international oil companies.”

Peter Kiernan, lead analyst, energy, Economist Intelligence Unit

“Low oil prices are unlikely to have a sustained impact on global efforts to tackle climate change. The cost of renewables is also falling and policy drivers to lower the carbon intensity of power generation in the US, EU, China and elsewhere are still in place.

“Oil is also not a direct competitor to renewables, although prices for gas and coal, which are direct competitors, have plunged too. Nevertheless, last year global emissions stalled (as in 2014) and clean energy investment reached a new high: despite the fall in oil prices since mid-2014. Low oil prices are not good for EV sales or biofuels, but the transition towards lower carbon energy systems overall will survive the oil price plunge.”

Jonathan Grant, director, sustainability and climate change, PWC

“High oil prices force governments and consumers to think about alternatives, low prices take the pressure off.

“Energy companies are acutely aware of the importance of cost reduction right now and probably have less time to think about the low carbon transition. The lower crude price in regions with high production costs will also accelerate decommissioning of older production infrastructure, but companies will seek to maximise production and cashflow in the short run. Governments which subsidise fossil fuels are finding it easier to cut these subsidies.

“From an investor perspective, we may see them start to question what proportion of their portfolios should be in fossil fuel companies and this could have a knock on effect on sectors such as asset management and pensions for example. Many are already asking how exposed energy companies are to changes in climate policy.

“For consumers, cheaper petrol means drivers may be less concerned about fuel economy and driving longer journeys. As the performance and ‘cool’ factor of electric and hybrid vehicles on the market improves, the total cost economics of buying them becomes less of an issue. But with low oil prices people may still be less inclined to take this option.”

Shane Tomlinson, senior research fellow, energy, environment and resources, Chatham House

“The low oil price provides a window for countries to implement fossil fuel subsidy reform, currently estimated at around $550bn annually by the International Energy Agency. The collapse in prices means governments can now look again at these subsidies while still keeping prices for consumers lower than when oil was closer to $100 per barrel. The savings in fossil fuel subsidy expenditure could be channelled to support low carbon development.

“Low oil prices, which also impact natural gas contracts that are indexed to oil, have led to the cancellation of plans to develop new fossil fuel reserves. To the extent that this creates a shift of capital into low carbon technology, as banks such as Goldman Sachs and Barclays have indicated, this will enhance the implementation of the Paris deal. However, cheap oil may also increase demand and impact the relative competitiveness of renewables in the short-term. How these two effects play out will be critical for shaping the future business environment for energy investment.”

Alasdair Cameron, renewable energy campaigner, Friends of the Earth

“For renewable electricity, oil is sufficiently decoupled from the market that it’s possible renewables will be relatively unaffected. If natural gas follows the oil price though, that could put pressure on renewables, underlining the need for a robust carbon price.

“In the UK the way the Levy Control Framework it is calculated means lower wholesale gas prices make it seem more expensive, despite the fact that consumer prices are not affected. Perhaps more importantly though, in the wake of Paris it’s clear that business-as-usual cannot continue, and countries which previously relied on oil to support their economies will need to find a new way forward, and many may start to look towards renewables.”

Helen Mountford, programme director, New Climate Economy

“The smart money will continue to flow into renewables, regardless of the price of oil. Despite last year’s low oil prices, solar and wind attracted a record $329bn dollars in investment. They are increasingly cost-competitive, even with low priced fossil fuels. Moreover, we’ve seen oil prices go dramatically up and down, often without warning, and that volatility is making investors cautious.

“With the costs of building renewables falling, and zero (and stable) costs for wind and solar fuel, there’s just no contest for forward thinking investors. And, finally, $30 oil has now made production of more polluting unconventional oil uneconomic.”

Richard Nourse, managing partner, Greencoat Capital

“$30 oil is a threat if it leads to higher energy use and less focus on low carbon alternatives but could be used to make the transition to low carbon – with associated cost reductions – relatively painless for consumers. In the UK, the levy control framework mechanism needs to be looked at again to prevent low fossil energy prices disrupting the money available for low carbon generation.”

Stephen Devlin, economist, natural resources, New Economics Foundation

“Primarily, [$30 oil] means trouble for oil producers, casting doubt over the profitability of new investments and potentially leaving more oil in the ground than otherwise might have happened – a climate win.

“The countervailing concern is that low prices lead to a surge in demand, thereby bolstering those companies. But this seems unlikely based on current events: the source of the low price is not just a supply glut but also an economic slow down and booming renewables – not conditions that are conducive to surging oil demand, even when prices are low. 2016 will still be a record year for renewables.”

Luke Sussams, senior researcher, Carbon Tracker Initiative

“Much is made of the likelihood that the collapse in the oil price serves to incentivise greater consumption and delay the ongoing low-carbon energy transition. However, one must not overlook the impacts that support this transition.

“For example, Wood Mackenzie showed this month that oil majors have cut spending on new projects by $400bn since the oil price crash, keeping these reserves in the ground. At the very least it delays their production to a future where the regulatory and market landscape may be less favourable.

“Furthermore, Bloomberg New Energy Finance also showed this month that the lower oil price has not impeded investments into renewable technologies in any way – 2015 saw a record $329bn investment into renewables such as solar and wind.”

Richard Howard, head of environment and energy, Policy Exchange (comments drawn from a longer blog on $30 oil)

“All else being equal, economic theory would suggest that the falling price of oil and gas would lead to an increase in consumption of oil and gas, with people driving their cars further, and heating their homes more. This could increase, or slow down the fall, in greenhouse gas emissions. However, the evidence suggests that it takes quite a while for people to respond to movements in energy prices and change their behaviour – energy use is relatively price inelastic, at least in the short term.

“There is significant inertia towards improving energy efficiency and reducing energy use in the UK – for example consumption of electricity and gas in homes has dropped by 23% over the last decade (or by 28% per person if you strip out the effect of population growth). It remains to be seen how consumers respond to the new lower energy price environment over the long term.

“Low fossil fuel prices should also in theory have a negative impact on investment in low carbon energy sources, as they become relatively more expensive compared to fossil fuels. However the evidence seems to suggest otherwise: data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance shows that global investment in clean energy hit a new record of $329 billion in 2015, up 3% on the previous year.”

Patrick Bonin, climate and energy campaigner, Greenpeace Canada

“The low price of oil creates two major opportunities to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. First, it creates a political opening for governments to put a significant price on carbon.

“A carbon price would make the price of oil better reflect its true societal costs (including global warming impacts, health cost due to air pollution, as well as other environmental costs). It would also level the playing field so that cheap oil doesn’t undercut investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions.

“Second, the low price of oil means less investment in the exploration and exploitation of the dirtier and costlier ‘extreme oil’ like the tar sands, Arctic, shale and deepwater oil reserves.”

Prof. Kornelis Blok, director of science, Ecofys

“Not only oil prices are low, but also those of coal, natural gas and electricity. Sometimes this is related to the development of the oil price, sometimes there are other mechanisms as well. It is something we need to get accustomed to: moving away from fossil fuels will inevitably lead to low demand and low prices.

“Low energy prices will not disrupt the evolution towards more energy efficiency and renewable energy. These are still primarily driven by government incentives like energy efficiency standards and feed-in schemes renewable energy. But of course lower prices will lead to more consumption: people may drive more, drive less economical, shower longer, etc. To make up for this, it is important that we seriously embark on carbon pricing. Much advocated by both business and government leaders in Paris – but now we need to get it done.”

Under this agreement, MGS Breweries and Carlsberg formed a Joint Venture – Myanmar Carlsberg Co., Ltd. – with plans to set up a new greenfield brewery and distribute Carlsberg beers in the local market. The joint venture is 51% owned by Carlsberg.

“We have followed the developments in Myanmar closely and are encouraged by the recent political developments in the country. We believe that the timing is right for us to invest in the country. We expect that the Myanmar beer market will grow strongly in coming years as the economy expands. MGS Breweries is one of the leading soft drinks producers in Myanmar and a partner we have known for many years. This partnership is a pivotal development in expanding our presence in the country,” said Roy Bagattini, Sr. Vice President of Carlsberg Asia Region, in a press release back then.

“We are delighted to partner with Carlsberg, bringing together one of the world’s leading brewery groups to combine with MGS Group of Companies – one of Myanmar’s leading industrial groups. This collaboration provides us with the opportunity to play a key role in developing the beer category in Myanmar. As an industry leader, Carlsberg is bringing in its expertise, innovation and international standards. This, combined with MGS Group’s already well-established capabilities and local position in the market, will enable us to capitalize on the significant growth potential of the beer category,” commented Thant Zin Tun, Vice Chairman of MGS Group of Companies at the same time.

The factory had its first product ready in early 2015. Today, Carlsberg has a fully operational brewery that follows high international standards. During the establishment of the greenfield brewery, the Danish consulting company ALECTIA has acted as an adviser and project manager. ALECTIA has been involved in feasibility studies of land and water services, project execution method, tendering, procurement strategy, conceptual design, site development, construction, installation and the commissioning phases.



In a press release on the company’s website, ALECTIA states that “The greenfield project was complicated by the fact that, initially, the only resource which could readily be made available on site was the power supply. No water sources or disposal systems for wastewater existed in the area. Therefore, besides levelling the rough land to make space for the brewery as well as for roads and infrastructure, a very important part of the project consisted of finding fresh groundwater sources. Additionally, the brewery itself was designed with a full wastewater treatment plant.”

The weather conditions such as the monsoon season, high humidity levels and occasional floods also posed as obstacles towards the construction and installation work. One of the solution was to prevent the brewery from beeing flooded was to set the brewery site above the levels of local roads and adjoining lands to keep floodwater from running to the site.

As the adviser and project manager ALECTIA also made sure, that the project lived up to international standards, which also came with challenges in an underdeveloped country as Myanmar, where there has been long separation from international business.

“In terms of health and safety, one of the main challenges was getting the local workforce to adopt international standards for clothes and footwear instead of coming to work in their typical attire. ALECTIA helped establish standards for personal protection and safe working practices and developed a construction safety plan for the entire site including utilities and packaging lines, etc,” ALECTIA states on the company website.

The international standard included that quality, budget, safety and environmental protection were met.

The brewery has its opening ceremony on the 7th of May 2015.","Thu, 21 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://scandasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/myanmar-brewery-e1453375142137.jpg,"['alectia', 'establishes', 'standards', 'project', 'international', 'local', 'carlsberg', 'brewery', 'mgs', 'myanmar', 'site', 'greenfield']",

The whole country was colder than minus 10 C (14 F) on Tuesday, and the North's official weather forecaster predicted that Pyongyang would sink to minus 16 C (3 F) on Wednesday.



""This kind of cold can come once or twice a year,'' said Ri Yong Nam of the State Hydro-Meteorological Agency. ""It seems that the 'Taehan' has not forgotten and now it's here.''



Taehan means ""great cold,'' and North Koreans are quite familiar with it.



Small groups of men brave the cold to squat on the frozen Taedong River running through central Pyongyang in hopes of catching a few fish. They hack holes through 40 centimeters (16 inches) of ice to send thin lines into the water below.



A man pulls out a tiny reward, a fish called sokari in Korean, golden Mandarin fish in English.



Surviving the cold



Thermal underwear, multiple layers, big coats, hats and hoods, scarves and gloves to cover any remaining exposed skin are necessary to survive the winter in Pyongyang. And there is only so much one can do to come in from the cold: North Korea's power shortages mean that few public buildings, homes and offices have much heating.



Strong winds have made the cold much more biting in Pyongyang over the past few days, but Wednesday was a relief from the wind and much calmer. Ri said this winter is colder than the last, and the worst is still to come, with temperatures expected to drop further over the weekend.

The NGO ""Save the Children"" puts the international aid at ""less than one third"" of the requested sum, and last week stated that the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia is ""a code red emergency and it needs to be treated like one.""

""Apart from receiving, and listening to, information on [drought] from time to time, donor countries' immediate response is very sluggish"" Alemayehu Berhanu, spokesperson with Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture, told DW's Amharic service. He added that over 60 of Ethiopia's donor partners knew of the looming crisis when the number of needy was still at 3.5 million people compared to the 10 million today - but few responded.

Syria or Ethiopia?

Mitiku Kassa, the commissioner in charge of Ethiopia's Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Agency, sees a connection between the slow trickle of emergency funds to his country and the response by donor countries to international crises in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. With many refugees entering European countries, in particular Germany, aid budgets are being diverted. ""They [the donors] probably assume that the magnitude of the hunger problem in Ethiopia is less serious"", Mitiku said in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

Ethiopia's northeastern Somali region has not received rainfall for two consecutive seasons

One of the biggest recipients of foreign aid, Ethiopia has been accused of misspending aid money in exchange for political favors, causing a furious, if short-lived, outcry from donors.

Scientists say the current drought in Africa's second most populous nation has been triggered by El Nino - a warm weather phenomenon originating from the Pacific Ocean.

Generation hunger

New figures released by humanitarian agencies and the government of Ethiopia show that more than 2.5 million children are expected to drop out of school as a result of the drought, whereas 1.7 million children are in need of nutritional support.

NGO Save the Children last week warned that 350,000 babies are expected to be born into drought-stricken communities in the coming six months.

""If emergency funding doesn't escalate very soon, there is a real risk of reversing some key development progress made in Ethiopia over the past two decades, including the reduction of child mortality rates by two thirds, and halving the percentage of the population living below the poverty line"", Country Director John Graham said.

The looming hunger crisis in Ethiopia is also trending on social media, with critics lashing out at the government for posting double-digit growth figures when at the same time millions of people go hungry. Kennedy Tamirat wrote on DW Amharic’s Facebook page: ""This [the food crisis] is the real picture of our country. This is truth. But our government officials never want to see it.""

Witnessing drought on the ground

After visiting Ethiopia's badly-affected Eastern Somali region, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) spoke of a ""disaster in the making.""

Ahmednur Abdi, NRC's Country Director told Deutsche Welle that the area had not received rainfall for two consecutive seasons. ""In all my life, I have never experienced a worse drought,"" a 90 year-old woman in Sitti, a zone in the Somali region of Ethiopia, told the NRC team. Other residents recalled memories of the 1984 drought that left two million people dead.

The Ethiopian government has been criticized for embarking on huge infrastructure projects while ignoring the poor

""It is crucial that the drought-affected communities in Ethiopia are provided with timely assistance,"" said Geir Olav Lisle, NRC's Deputy Secretary General. “We cannot risk that the drought in Ethiopia is overshadowed by the Syria crisis and other ongoing emergencies,"" he added. ""The outlook for 2016 is very grim,"" according to the Rome-based UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). ""Food overall will become harder to access if we continue to see prices rise, food stocks deplete and livestock become weaker, less productive, and perish."" it said.

94,94,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Education for sustainability's sake | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/education-for-sustainabilitys-sake/,"In sunny Singapore, atop the roof of the United World College South East Asia’s (UWCSEA) sports hall sits rows of solar panels. It’s a sight increasingly common in Singapore, where the solar industry has been rapidly expanding, but this project is different because it was entirely student-driven.

The project began in 2012 when then-15 year-old Raghav Shukla (Class of 2015), inspired by a research project on sustainable energy, started mobilising his classmates to find ways to make the school greener. In August, the first panels went up in the international school located at Dover and over the next two years, a total of 860 panels will be installed.

When completed, the solar installations across the 11-ha school will prevent 137,500 kilogrammes (kg) of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere every year, and meet as much as 50 per cent of electricity needed for lighting.

The project, partly funded by donations from parents of the students and partly from the UWC Foundation, is just one example of student-led sustainability projects at the school, which has a unique philosophy about education, Simon Thomas, Director of Operations and Facilities at UWCSEA tells Eco-Business. “It’s teaching the kids to act and behave in a sustainable way,” he explains.

“The definition (of sustainability) is broadly the conservation of resources and making sure that the needs of the next generation are taken care of. We believe that if we educate students this way, they will become better citizens. So, we have to build a school with the least impact,” he adds.

This ethos can be seen in not just the buildings but also in the school’s curriculum.

With the campus as a living laboratory, students are taught how everything in the school, from the water systems to energy efficiency to even safety such as alarm and fire systems, work – so that they get a well-rounded education. They are also encouraged to think critically about everything around them, Thomas says.

A campus built for scale

As one of Singapore’s largest international schools, UWCSEA offers a wide range of specialist facilities such as a 400-seat multi-purpose hall, theatre halls, laboratories, boarding houses as well as an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

With more than 3,000 students and staff within the Dover campus, it was vital for UWCSEA to optimise the performance of all its systems throughout the day. The core principle is to minimise resource use, Thomas says.

It is this principle that drives the need to have what Thomas calls “high performance” buildings.

UWCSEA operates two campuses in Singapore – one in Tampines in the east that has a won a Building and Construction Authority Green Mark Platinum. Now, the school is aiming to get its older Dover site certified Platinum as well.

This means making all the functions - from heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, room automation, energy management, fire safety and security services – as efficient as possible.

Running the system

A suitable building management system (BMS) that runs these complex systems centrally and automatically is key to making sure that everything runs smoothly.

For this, UWCSEA has chosen Siemens to supply Desigo CC, its latest BMS, because of its functionalities and flexibility, says Thomas.

Desigo CC is able to collect data from the school’s sprawling campus and present it on a single platform. This solution also allows the school to acquire data from the system easily, so it can inform the decision making around the management of the buildings, says Thomas.

“Desigo CC will provide us with huge amounts of streaming data in real time and it also comes with an application that allows you to plug in other modules that aren’t necessarily from Siemens,” he says. “It’s an open system which allows us to make sound decisions to safeguard the students, staff and assets at all times”.

Peter Halliday, Head of Siemens Solutions and Service Portfolio for the Middle-East/Asia Pacific Region added: “Our partnership with UWCSEA is one built on common values. We understand their need for solutions which not only improve the performance and energy efficiency of the entire facility, but also create an environment which facilitates learning and constant innovation.”

In addition to Desigo CC, Siemens provided the school with the web-based energy management platform Navigator™.

“We’ve essentially put the UWCSEA team in control of their campus by giving them the transparency to monitor their systems’ performance and energy demand and supply more effectively,” Halliday explains. “At the same time, our energy engineers within Singapore’s Advantage™ Service Center provide the necessary analysis support with insights on how to further improve the buildings’ performance.”

Thomas adds that the students are educated on how the school is run. For example, if you asked a ten-year old student what the biggest use of water is on the entire campus, he will be able to tell you the correct answer – air-conditioning.

Research and development

UWCSEA is taking its leadership in green buildings a step further. It is partnering with Siemens and Singapore-ETH Centre Future Cities to develop and build what will be Singapore’s most energy-efficient office space.

The partners are applying commercially for the first time the ‘3for2’ concept, which allows building developers to construct three floors within the standard space of two floors, without any impact on perceived floor-to-ceiling heights.

In new typical commercial buildings, up to one third of the enclosed volume is typically occupied by technical systems and structural elements, taking up space that could otherwise be devoted to occupants. Large ceiling space is needed for air-based cooling systems and consumes a lot of room.

The ‘3for2’ concept uses a water-based air-conditioning system that drastically reduces the space needed for transporting air. By using decentralized ventilation systems, this space requirement is further reduced. All in all, this new concept reduces this space consumption by a third.

The office, sited at the new High School block at the Dover Campus, opened in December and will also be installed with Siemens’ Total Room Automation (TRA) controllers for HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) and lighting. Artificial light is switched on or off depending on natural light entering a room and with information from presence detectors and integrated brightness sensors. Through intelligent, energy-saving control of the lighting, TRA will ensure optimised conditions within the office space.

A cooler way to save energy

Always eager to try new innovations, the team at UWC SEA also opted for the installation of Siemens Demand Flow chiller plant optimisation solution. Demand Flow is a patented and proven technology that optimises all energy-consuming components controlled by the system algorithms.

The UWC campus is currently serviced by four TRANE centrifugal chillers, five chilled water pumps, five condenser water pumps and four cooling towers. With Demand Flow, the school is expected to enjoy energy savings between 20 and 50 per cent.

Halliday adds: “We have had exceptional results with Demand Flow around the world with the solution gaining traction in Asia over the past 3 years. Given the region’s hot climate, cooling inevitably consumes a large majority of the energy used to run a facility.”

“Siemens has focused our solution to the chiller plant system and provided our customers with a technology which not only lowers the energy consumption, but also simplifies the system operation, improves the indoor air quality and more importantly, extends equipment life.”

UWC’s Thomas says: “We design, build and operate our own buildings, so we manage the whole life cycle. Our students learn from this and we get everyone on board on our sustainability efforts.”","Tue, 19 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/uwcsea_entrance_cropped_thumb.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['buildings', 'sake', 'space', 'sustainabilitys', 'students', 'campus', 'school', 'energy', 'system', 'uwcsea', 'systems', 'education', 'siemens']",

Some municipalities in the country's Free State province have run out of water while others are unable to meet demand. Farmers are especially struggling as livestock are dying off without regular access to clean water.

In a move to try and deliver water to the most-affected areas, a group of activists launched Operation Hydrate Initiative SA. The goal was to use social media to get people to donate water and for businesses to donate transport for the water to those who need it.

The group announced Friday that they have been able to deliver two million liters of water. Much of the water has come from donations from large corporations including Shoprite, Volkswagen SA and Mango Airlines.

But everyday citizens are also pitching in. Many are filling any container they can find around the house and bringing them to established collection centers.

""Dozens of trucks are loaded with bottled water and are taking to the roads this afternoon and early tomorrow morning,"" said Operation Hydrate's Yaseen Theba in a Facebook statement on January 15.

""Some 800,000 liters is destined for various affected areas in the Free State and 400,000 liters is going to the North West. We have already distributed some 800,000 liters since our launch,"" said Theba.

Along with the outpouring of support from companies and everyday citizens has also come heated criticism of the government's failure to provide sufficient water to its people. Many are also saying that the government failed to have contingency plans in place to deal with the drought.

The production of maize, a staple crop in South Africa has fallen dramatically because of the drought. Economists are warning that there will be food shortages leading to a rise in prices for consumers.

""Drought is an absolute priority for us,"" said Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan at a press briefing this week. Aside from the drought, there are growing concerns that the drought may push the country into recession.

Gordhan added that South Africa's economy will not slip into recession.

""We are growing as an economy, we are not going into a recession. But we are not growing fast enough,"" Gordhan told a media briefing after a cabinet meeting.

Local tobacco manufacturer Imeri is expanding, looking to conquer foreign markets and bring benefits back to the local economy.

Imeri has already started negotiations with Chinese investors to export Georgian cigars to China.

Imeri's director Tamaz Turmanidze told Agenda.ge that Chinese investors were visiting Georgia to negotiate with Imeri company representatives.

Turmanidze explained he earlier visited China, took some Georgian cigars with him and showed them to his Chinese hosts, ""which they liked"".

Now they came here and we are discussing some specific issues related to the export of Georgian cigars to China,” Turmanidze said.

Once the negotiations had completed, the export of Georgian cigars to China will begin.

Meanwhile Imeri was also negotiating with Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Kazakhstan and Belarus regarding the export of Georgian cigars to these nations.

Imeri cigars have already been exported to Turkey, where they are available in Duty Free shops.

Imeri cigars are also sold locally. The product is available in Georgia’s major towns Kutaisi, Batumi, Zugdidi, Poti and capital Tbilisi.

Imeri was financed within the state program ‘Produce in Georgia’.

In total $250,000 USD was invested in the company, of which $40,000 USD was agricultural credit allocated by the state.

Currently Imeri produces more than 30 types of cigars and about 60 cigar accessories.

Imeri has been growing the traditional variety, Georgian oriental tobacco trial batches since 2007 in Adjara, Keda municipality.

The first Georgian cigar samples were made on May 5, 2009 in Indonesia where the oriental tobacco Keda version was defined in Indonesian, Cuban and Dominican Republic tobacco combinations.

In return, the Iranian president travels the world and is courted by all. Not long ago, a pariah of the international community, he has now become an interesting trade partner.

Submissive obedience

The red carpet is rolled out for the Iranian president wherever he goes. Even the pope received President Rouhani, even if it was not about business. The Iranian guest in Rome was shielded from anything disturbing; demonstrators should not jeopardize the lucrative business opportunities. In the Eternal City, the hospitality even went so far that world-class art was covered as a precaution, to spare the pious man from Teheran from the sight of nude sculptures. Have they gone crazy?

This misunderstood hospitality is unnecessary and only elicits protests from the wrong people. Of course, hosts prefer to show guests their best side and ensure a pleasant stay. And that includes not forcing a devout Muslim to eat pork or drink a fine red wine – just as one does not offer a practicing Hindu beef or a vegetarian meat.

But hospitality has limits, and these limits are transgressed if relations are only geared to the making of money. If the host wants to drink his wine because it is important and not prohibited, then a good guest accepts this desire. A cultural nation like Italy should definitely not cover any statues because nudity may offend the religious sentiments of a state guest. In the worst case, the guest must just simply look away or stay away.

The price of partnership

But this is not really about wine, naked statues or the relationship between a guest and host, which is also important in the Islamic world. It is about the cost of economic cooperation. It's about tough deals, but also one's own self-image, especially in secular democracies which fought long and hard for their values - and it's about the separation of state and religion.

Of course, one can do business with undemocratic countries, such as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia or Iran, but not at the expense of one's own identity and one's own values.

Besides the business transactions, addressing contentious issues is also a part of any partnership. This situation shows that Iran has not yet shown itself to be a partner, but merely a market. The country has not opened; it has only opened its doors to lucrative business opportunities. Iran did not discontinue its nuclear program out of conviction, but instead, because the international pressure was too great and the sanctions had brought the country to its knees. The power of the mullahs in the self-proclaimed theocracy remains unbroken.

Change through trade

Compared to Iran's spiritual leader Ali Khamenei, President Rouhani may be the lesser evil, but the West's current ingratiation with Iran is borderline. Despite all the revenue opportunities, it should not be forgotten that nothing at all has improved in Iran in recent years.

As tempting as the lucrative business deals may be, our values of freedom and the rule of law are still more important. The mullah regime and malleable states and companies should not be the only ones to benefit from the changes. The benefits must also be felt by the international community and the Iranian people. The latter, in particular, not only wants more goods and services, but above all, change for the better and an opening of the country to the outside world.

99,99,FL-2016-000009-IDN,Scorching hot weather to persist till March - The Star Online,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/01/29/scorching-hot-weather-to-persist-till-march/,"KUALA LUMPUR: The scorching hot weather prompted by El Nino since early January is expected to persist till March.

Malaysian Meteorological Department director-general Datuk Che Gayah Ismail reminded the public against open burning and to consume plenty of water to prevent hydration.

The El Nino phenomenon is also the reason why there was no occurrence of a major flood in the country as it usually happens following heavy downpours, she told Bernama here Friday.

She said the weather in the month of December is usually more humid but monsoon activities that brought cold surges from China and Siberia have lessened, resulting in reduced rainfall in the country.

""The condition resulted in a drop in rainfall of between 20 and 60 per cent for most areas in the country rendering the weather hot and dry with temperatures rising by 0.5 to 2.0 degree Celsius,"" she said.

Typically during the rainy season, areas in the east coast of the peninsula, west Sarawak and northeast of Sabah would experience heavy downpours between November and January.

According to the department's records, the rainfall distribution in December last year in the interior of Pahang, Negri Sembilan, south and north of Perak, north of Kedah and Perlis was less than 200 millimetres.

Areas in the east coast had also recorded a drop of more than 20 per cent in rainfall. - Bernama","Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['usually', 'scorching', '20', 'hot', 'till', 'east', 'persist', 'weather', 'rainfall', 'heavy', 'north', 'nino', 'el']",
