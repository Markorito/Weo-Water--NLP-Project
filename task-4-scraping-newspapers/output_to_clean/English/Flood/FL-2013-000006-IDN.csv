It has even entered the presidential palace after a dike burst

About 19,000 people relocate to safer areas

More rain and flooding is expected over the next few days

Heavy flooding in the Indonesian capital this week has killed 15 people, driven thousands from their homes and paralyzed the sprawling city -- and officials are warning that more water is on its way.

Caused by unusually strong monsoon rains, the flood waters -- often carrying trash and human waste -- have inundated the city's central business district, closed schools and offices, and entered the presidential palace.

With around 95,000 people affected in different areas of the city, authorities have declared a state of emergency to allow use of national funds and other resources. About 19,000 people have relocated from the worst affected districts to safer areas.

January is typically the wettest month in Jakarta, the political and economic capital of southeast Asia's largest country.

But the low-lying city has already experienced more rainfall since Tuesday than it usually gets in the entire month of January.

Amid about a foot of water, workers scrambled Friday to clean up the mess near where a dike had burst a day earlier, flooding the central business district.

Soldiers heaped sandbags on a railroad line to form a makeshift defense close to the dike.

The situation in the central district appeared to be improving, but some of the worst-hit areas of the city remained under water, with more flooding expected to arrive over the course of the day.

A lot of the water falling in the vicinity of Jakarta, which has a population of around 10 million people, must go through the city's rivers and canals before reaching the Java Sea.

Thousands of people have fled their homes in neighborhoods along the banks of the Ciliwung River, the cause of some of the worst flooding and considered by many to be one of the dirtiest waterways in Indonesia.

In Kampung Melayu, an eastern neighborhood near the Ciliwung, many people remained at home Thursday, sitting on top of roofs or wading inside to try to salvage belongings and secure the premises.

Large amounts of water were expected to flow down the Ciliwung on Friday, generated by rains over the hilly area around the city of Bogor, which lies south of Jakarta.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Board has warned of more heavy rainfall in the next few days, the city government said.

Fresh flooding was likely to bring the risk of more casualties.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly half of the 12 killed in the floods since Tuesday were electrocuted.","Sat, 19 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130118091858-indonesia-floods-story-top.jpg,"['capital', 'floods', 'expected', 'indonesia', 'water', 'worst', 'raging', '15', 'city', 'flee', 'ciliwung', 'kill', 'safer', 'business', 'waters', 'central', 'flooding', 'thousands', 'district']",

Severe floods in Jakarta eased on Friday, a day after unusually heavy monsoon rains swamped parts of the Indonesian capital. (Photo by Supri/Reuters.)

A week of severe flooding in Jakarta is beginning to subside and refugees are starting to return to damaged homes and businesses.

At least 20 people died in the flood and 46,000 became homeless. More rain is forecast this weekend.

At its peak on Jan. 17, the water in some areas reached above six feet. Public transportation and traffic came to a halt forcing businesses to shut down.

“At the time, the water reached some places that previously were never (flooded), such as the presidential palace and the main road of Jakarta in Sudirman-Thamrin,” said Wahyu Dhyatmika, managing editor of the online news portal Tempo.co. “Even the city landmark (the Hotel Indonesia's roundabout) became a large pond of dark brown water.”

Environmental journalist Harry Surjadi painted a grim picture in an email on Friday.

“I can say that Jakarta has collapsed,” he said. “The rain has stopped at night but I can see that a grey cloud is covering Jakarta.”

Maintenance of channels meant to drain water away from the city has been a problem, Dhyatmika said. The city does not have a large enough drainage system for heavy rains and areas upstream have been overdeveloped, Surjadi added.

“The root of the problem is that Jakarta has been built without any comprehensive and integrated plan,” Surjadi explained.

Dhyatmika said the area of the source of Jakarta’s rivers — Puncak, in West Java — has become popular with tourists from the city and is filled with hotels and villas.

“To make rooms for these buildings, they have to cut the forest,” Dhyatmika said. “Eventually, the loss of this important vegetation made the Puncak area incapable of holding rainwater that is coming down heavily these days. All this waters eventually reaches Jakarta and drowns it.”

In addition to unusually heavy rain over a long period of time, “the flood this time not only affected poor people who live near the Ciliwung river, but almost everybody,” Surjadi said.

Politically, the floods are also being seen differently this year. Joko Widodo became the governor of Jakarta just three months ago and promised to help alleviate the capital’s recurring flood problem. Usually, said Surjadi, the governor is criticized heavily for these kinds of disasters.

But, this time, it appears that many people are viewing the urban flooding as a collective problem for society.","Wed, 23 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/open_graph/public/migration/PriMigrationsVivvoFilesImagesMigration/pri.org/files/RTR3CLB4_437154669.jpg?itok=f2u_uZio,"['waters', 'begin', 'jakarta', 'problem', 'returning', 'braces', 'city', 'indonesia', 'surjadi', 'rain', 'water', 'jan', 'heavy', 'flood', 'refugees']",

As it goes in Jakarta, so it goes in Samarinda: heavy rains bring big floods.



A lack of water catchment areas has made flooding a certainty in Samarinda, according to local residents. And many residents of the East Kalimantan provincial capital blame the ubiquitous coal mines around the city.



East Kalimantan is known for its wealth of natural resources.

Singer Ari Lasso acknowledged that, during the massive floods that have inundated the capital, newly appointed Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, widely known as Jokowi, was the one who surely had the worst headache.



“He must have a lot of things on his mind right now. I just hope that he won’t be done in by handling this calamity, hand-in-hand with the people,” he said as quoted by kapanlagi.com.



Ari, former vocalist with well-known rock band Dewa, also extended his condolences to families of those who had lost their lives during the floods.



When asked about his own experience during the floods, he admitted that he had faced some difficulties trying to find the right roads when traveling in the city during the past few days. But, he added that he had to deal with that and continue with his business.

MANILA Tired of the beach or the mountain to chill out every time that you are visiting the Philippines? Then it’s about time you tried going to a mine site.



Yes, closed mine sites in the country are becoming tourist spots, as mining companies are developing these areas into ecotourism parks. In some cases, this happens even before the life of the mine ceases, or in areas affected by a mining accident.



Like in the case of Balog Creek, in Itogon town in the northern Philippine province of Benguet. A tributary of Agno River, the creek has been affected by the accidental discharge of sediment from the tailings pond of Padcal Mine on August 1, following heavy rains brought about by two successive typhoons.



Now, Itogon Mayor Oscar Camantiles has expressed interest in enlisting the creek as part of his town’s ecotourism offering when he was shown pictures of the rehabilitated waterway. In fact, he got so much interested that, according to Padcal officials, the mayor may soon visit the creek and meet up with them to formally discuss the issue.



“The mayor has sent word requesting that the ‘infrastructure installed by Philex Mining in the creek be made permanent,” a statement uploaded on the website of Philex Mining Corp said, quoting Feliciano Diso, Jr, manager at Padcal’s Community Relations Department.



Philex Mining, the country’s biggest gold and copper producer, owns and operates the Padcal Mine. Earlier, it said it would be spending at least one billion pesos (Dh90.32m) for the remediation and rehabilitation of Balog Creek between August 2012 and April 2013, and the rehabilitation of its Tailings Pond No 3 (TP3).



Mr Camantiles has told reporters up north that he foresees the mining-tourism nuptials in Itogon, a first-class municipality with a population of less than 50,000.



“It can be done,” the mayor was quoted by Sun.Star daily newspaper on Sunday as saying.



A mountainous area close to the Philippine summer capital of Baguio City, Itogon boasts cooler climes and stunning views of vegetation that nature lovers and camping and trekking enthusiasts love so much. It also has rugged terrains that can challenge even seasoned mountain climbers.



Already, the mayor has championed the Benguet Corp example, which has mined an area in Itogon for decades and crafted the Balatoc underground mine tour, a first in the country, according to Sun.Star daily newspaper.



“The mine tour is one of the most successful tourism come-ons of the municipality and utilises the abandoned areas of the mining company, in a bid to preserve employment, culture and to familiarise the public to life inside the mines,” Sun.Star added.



At Padcal Mine, Philex Mining has installed eight silt traps along the Maligaboy Creek and is constructing another one at the 2.1-kilometre mark near Balog Creek’s convergence area with Agno River, to contain silt coming from the upstream. Maligaboy is another tributary of the river.



“In addition, Philex Mining has constructed riprap walls in designated areas, and improved access to and along the waterway by constructing footpaths on rugged terrain and building hanging bridges, concrete pathways, and elevated walkways down the creek,” the company said in a recent statement posted on its website.



The riprap walls also serves as temporary storage for the tens of thousands of bags of silt collected by Philex Mining workers from Balog Creek, where the company also constructed a pond and seeded it with 30,000 tilapia fingerlings.



As part of its CSR, or corporate social responsibility, Program, Philex Mining sponsors Itogon’s three-day traverse of Mt. Ugo, which is done every year in March and organised by the Department of Tourism in the CAR, or Cordillera Administrative Region. CAR is home to several indigenous tribes collectively known as Igorot.



The annual event allows participants to trek for three days starting from Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya up to Itogon, Benguet. Nueva Vizcaya is part of the Cagayan Valley Region, in the northern part of the country’s biggest island of Luzon.



Philex Mining, which is facing a fine of at least one billion pesos from government regulators over the accident at TP3, has vowed to clean up and rehabilitate the affected areas in Itogon. It said it was willing to pay the fine provided that the money would be used for the remediation and rehabilitation of Balog Creek and its convergence area with Agno River.



The company, which voluntarily suspended operations at its Padcal Mine starting from the day of the accident on August 1, hopes to resume operations by the middle of this year, as it is now building an open spillway to replace the penstock system of draining clean water from TP3 into Balog Creek through an underground tunnel. Its TP1 and TP2 had long been decommissioned and rehabilitated.

Mr. Safina, a local guide working at Komodo National Park, took a particular relish in describing the way a Komodo dragon’s strong jaws can snap a man’s leg in two. He’d lived on Rinca – a speck of land off Indonesia’s Flores Island, and one of the five places Komodo dragons reside – his whole life, and he was used to the various horror stories that surfaced every now and then after a tourist wandered off the trail or a kid got ambushed while playing in the bush. Standing in front of an assembly line of water buffalo, deer and wild horse skulls – dragon chow – Mr. Safina laughed while gesturing to a row of little wooden crosses stuck in the nearby mud. On each stick, a date and a foreigner’s name was scrawled in white paint. “Those are tourist graves!” Mr. Safina joked. “No really, they’re actually just baby mangrove markers that tourists bought to restore the forest. Now, are you ready to go see the dragons?”

Like so many other tourists, for me, a trip to Indonesia was not complete without a detour to see the world’s largest lizard in its natural habitat. (Read Brendan Borell’s dispatch from his trip to Komodo Island, as featured in our special “Evotourism” issue of Smithsonian magazine.) In recent years, visitors have increasingly flooded this corner of Indonesia, drawn in by the thrill of brushing close to something wild and dangerous. Dragons are not to be taken lightly: male lizards can grow up to 10 feet long, weigh 150 pounds and eat up to 80 percent of their own body weight in one sitting. Though attacks are exceptionally rare, they do occasionally occur, mostly when a park guard lets his focus slip for a moment, or a villager has a particularly unlucky day.

Here are some of the most infamous attacks, as described by Mr. Safina and corroborated by media reports:

A Tragic Playdate

In 2007, a dragon killed an 8-year-old boy on Komodo Island, marking the first fatal attack on a human in 33 years, the Guardian reported. The attack took place in March’s dry season, so rangers speculate that the murderous lizard may have been particularly hungry given that the watering holes – and the prey that gather there – had dried up. The dragon lunged when the boy went behind a bush to use the bathroom, MSNBC writes.

Mr. Safina recalls the boy’s friends – who had been playing together in the scrubland near their village – rushing to get help from their parents. According to the Guardian, the boy’s uncle came running and threw rocks at the lizard until it released his nephew. While the Guardian writes that the boy died from massive bleeding from his torso, Mr. Safina recalls the boy being bitten in half.

In light of the tragedy, park wardens launched an island-wide hunt for the man-eating lizard, though whether or not these efforts produced results remains unclear.

Shipwrecked with Dragons

In 2008, a group of SCUBA divers found themselves swept from waters near their boat by the Flores region’s infamously strong current. After spending 10 hours spinning in the tide, around midnight the group washed up on the beach of what seemed like a deserted island, approximately 25 miles from where their ordeal had begun. Their troubles, however, were far from over. They had found their way to Rinca Island, where an estimate 1,300 dragons live.

The attacks began almost immediately, the Telegraph reports. A relentless lizard repeatedly came at a Swedish woman, who smacked it with her diving weight belt. It chewed at the lead belt while other divers threw rocks at its head, she said, all the while eyeing her bare feet.

For two days and two nights, the traumatized divers contended with dragons and the tropical heat, surviving off of shellfish they scraped from rocks and ate raw. Finally, an Indonesian rescue crew spotted the diver’s orange emergency floats spread out on the rocks. Though in shock, the group rehydrated at the local hospital on Flores Island and celebrated their survival at the town’s Paradise Bar.

Death in the Garden

In 2009, 31-year-old Muhamad Anwar set out to gather sugar apples from an orchard on Komodo Island. A misstep that sent him falling from the tree proved to be his undoing. Two Komodo dragons were waiting below, and sprang on Anwar. His neighbors heard the commotion, and ran to his rescue minutes later. By the time they arrived, however, Anwar had already suffered fatal injuries, and was bleeding from bites to his hands, body, legs and neck, the Guardian reports. Anwar died shortly after the attack, in a clinic on Flores Island.

Other accounts, however, contest some of these details. CNN writes that Anwar – a fisherman – was actually trespassing on the island, and was in an area forbidden for people to enter. This account also reports that Anwar bled to death on the way to the hospital, and was declared dead upon arrival. Even if CNN got this right and Anwar was guilty, however, death by dragon seems an overly steep punishment for eating a bit of forbidden fruit from the garden of Komodo.

Dragon Under the Desk

In 2009, Maen, a fellow guide like Mr. Safina, headed to the staff office as he would any other morning. Like all the other buildings on Rinca Island, Maen’s unit sat on stilts, and hungry dragons would often gather below to wait for the occasional food scrap. On this morning, however, Maen sensed that he was not alone. Just settling in at his desk, he looked down. At his sandled feet lay a dragon, peering back up at him.

As it turned out, one of the cleaning crew had left the office door open the night before and the hungry predator had crept in, likely in search of food. Heart pounding, Maen attempted to slowly withdraw his leg from the dragon’s vicinity. But he moved too quickly, cueing the motion-sensitive carnivore to lunge. The dragon chomped down on Maen’s leg, clenching its jaw shut. Maen kicked at the dragon’s neck, then grabbed its jaws with his hands and wrenched its mouth open, slicing open his arm in the process.

Although Maen shouted for help, most of the rangers were in the cafeteria and could not hear his screams. Only one picked up on the noise, and came to investigate.

“I shouted and he came to help me but he didn’t like to come up because the dragon was still moving around,” Maen explained to travel writer Michael Turtle, of Time Travel Turtle. “Then he saw the blood on the floor and he got everyone from the kitchen. All the people come running here, but other dragons follow along as well.”

The dragons – which can smell blood and the scent of death from nearly 6 miles away – followed the crowd. Some rangers fended off the would-be feeding frenzy, while a couple others darted into Maen’s office to help their colleague fight free from his attacker. Maneuvering their injured friend through the pack of dragons waiting outside, they managed to carry him to the island’s dock, where he was rushed to Flores Island’s hospital. The injuries were too much for the small medical center to contend with, however, and Maen wound up being flown to Bali for six hours of emergency treatment and 55 stitches, MSNBC reports. All in all, it took him six months to recover from his brush with the dragon.

Despite the encounter, Maen went back to work, although he only stays indoors now so he does not have to deal directly with the animals. “The dragon, I can’t remember which one, he’s still alive,” he told Turtle. “But I think now he’ll be bigger. If he had a bigger neck then, I couldn’t have hold it open.”

Horror in Hollywood

Dragon attacks can occur outside of Komodo National Park, too. More than 50 zoos around the world keep the animals as attractions. In 2001, Phil Bronstein, an investigative journalist formerly married to actress Sharon Stone, suffered an unfortunate encounter with a Komodo dragon at the Los Angeles Zoo. Stone had arranged a private visit to the zoo’s dragon pen as a present for her husband, who, according to a Time Magazine interview with Stone, had always wanted to see a Komodo dragon up close. Stone described the incident:

Phil didn’t know where we were going or why we were going there. It was a complete surprise. So we came around the corner and he was like, ‘Oh my god this is so fabulous, I’ve always wanted to see this.’ And the zookeeper said, ‘would you like to go in the cage? It’s very mild mannered. Everybody goes in there. Kids pet him. It’s fine.’

Bronstein accepted the invitation and went into the dragon’s cage with the zoo keeper. The lizard began licking at Bronstein’s white shoes, which the keeper thought must remind the animal of it’s white rat meals. Following the keeper’s advice, Bronstein removed his shoes and socks to avoid tempting the lizard. Then, as he moved into a better position to take a photo with the animal, it lunged.

So there was that hideous moment where the three of us… It’s such a break in reality, it’s so inconceivable that it’s happening, but there’s that moment of stillness where you just stare in disbelief. Then Phil screamed and we heard this crunching sound.

Bronstein managed to pin the lizard’s head down with his other foot, but the animal began jerking back and forth in an attempt to maul and eat its prey. Children gathered around the cage’s glass wall, Stone recalled, taking in the spectacle.

Bronstein managed to wrench the dragon’s jaw’s open and throw it from his foot, then dragged himself out of the cage as the lizard came at him from behind. The top half of Bronstein’s foot was gone, Stone said, and he was covered in scratches from the animal’s lunges at his back. Bronstein survived the incident and did not press charges, though Stone complained that the zoo allegedly continued to allow close-up encounters with dangerous animals following the incident.","Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/PVTnFvkdHo6EG8OH3i-O5ikQ0WQ=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/20130124030149dragon-cropped.jpg,"['island', 'infamous', 'maen', 'came', 'safina', 'lizard', 'dragon', 'past', 'attacks', 'stone', 'komodo', 'anwar', 'dragons']",

A British grandmother was sentenced to death by firing squad yesterday for smuggling cocaine worth £1.6million into the Indonesian resort island of Bali.

Former legal secretary Lindsay Sandiford broke down in tears and cried ‘no, no, no’ after a panel of judges in Bali ordered her execution.



They said she had shamed Bali’s tourism reputation by taking 10.6lb of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island’s international airport.



Sandiford, from Gloucestershire, was arrested in May last year as she entered Indonesia on a flight from Thai capital Bangkok with £1.6million worth of the Class A drug stuffed in her luggage.

Distraught: Lindsay Sandiford of Britain reacts inside a holding cell after hearing her sentence to death, which she is due to appeal

State prosecutors had called for the 56-year-old housewife to be jailed for 15 years but there was a gasp in the Bali courtroom yesterday when she was told she would be killed for her crime.

Sandiford slumped back stunned as the judges announced the shock sentence which, if carried out, will see her led to a jungle clearing on a small island known as 'Indonesia's Alcatraz', where she will be blindfolded, tied to a pole and executed by firing squad .

Mrs Sandiford was heard to cry in anguish from under her beige-coloured sarong, marked with a traditional Balinese pattern, as the sentence was passed.

The 56-year-old also wept and declined to speak to reporters on her way back to prison.

Mrs Sandiford is originally from Redcar on Teesside, married and moved to London, and later lived in Gloucestershire before moving to India several years ago.

She is one of 12 Britons currently facing the death penalty abroad, according to the Foreign Office.

In shock: This is the moment Briton Lindsay Sandiford heard that she would receive the death penalty for drug smuggling

But charity Reprieve, which represents many of them, told MailOnline that they believe this figure only refers to those convicted of drugs offences and there are 40 British citizens on death row around the world.



Lindsay Sandiford is the second British national to be sentenced to death for drug offences in Indonesia in the last six months. Gareth Cashmore, was sentenced to death by firing squad for drugs offences in October.

Mrs Sandiford had hoped she would be spared execution, the usual sentence for trafficking this amount of drugs, because of her age and for her co-operation with authorities on the holiday isle.

'We object to the sentence. We never expected that our client would get the death penalty,' her lawyer Esra Karokaro said.



She had claimed she was coerced into the crime because her children were threatened.

But in its verdict, a judge panel headed by Amser Simanjuntak concluded that Sandiford has damaged the image of Bali as a tourism destination and weakened the government's fight against drugs.

'We found no reason to lighten her sentence,' he said. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm that a British national is facing the death penalty in Indonesia.

'We remain in close contact with that national and continue to provide consular assistance.

'The UK remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.' Behind the scenes the Government is said to being cautious about its protests and fears 'going in all guns blazing' could make her situation even worse. Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire has told MPs the Government 'strongly object to the death penalty' and told the Commons she had at least two further avenues of appeal through the courts and also the chance to apply for presidential clemency.

Mr Swire said 'repeated representations' had been made to the Indonesian authorities and Foreign Secretary William Hague had already raised the case with his counterpart in the country.

Disbelief: Briton Sandiford speaks with her sister Hillary Parsons as they digest what has happened in Bali yesterday Death sentence: The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's international airport Sandiford will appeal within the next 14 days and her hopes of escaping the firing squad now depend on a series of legal challenges and, finally, with a plea for mercy to the president if all her legal channels become exhausted.

There are around 114 prisoners on death row in Indonesia, at least 40 of them foreigners, most of them convicted of drug crimes. Several are Australians.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has granted clemency to four drug offenders on death row since he took office in 2004. Crushed: Lindsay Sandiford leaves the court smoking a cigarette and trying to cover her face as she heads back to prison Happier times: New pictures released yesterday show the grandmother in her forties before her current woes in Bali

Wearing a white blouse and dark slacks - with a locally-made bracelet on her left wrist - Sandiford was ushered to a holding cell where she was seen slumped on a seat, her eyes hidden behind dark glasses.

TIMELINE: LINDSAY SANDIFORD'S JOURNEY TO BALI'S DEATH ROW

Early 2012: Lindsay Sandiford, who had been living in Gloucester, sets up home in India.

May 17 2012: Mrs Sandiford allegedly meets two members of the drug syndicate in Bangkok, Thailand, and collects a suitcase packed with 4.8 kilos of cocaine worth £1.7 million.

May 19: She flies to Denpasar airport, the main airport on Bali, where customs officials X-ray the suitcase and find the drugs. She is arrested.

May 20: She is interrogated by drug squad officers who suggest it will be in her interest to tell all she knows about the syndicate. She agrees.

May 20 - 24: She stays at a hotel arranged by the police, when she reveals everything and agrees to lead officers to the town of Candidasa, on the east of the island, where Paul Beales is arrested.

May 25: Her information leads to the arrest of Julian Ponder and his partner Rachel Dougall, described by locals as 'the King and Queen of Bali' because of their extravagant lifestyle.

May 25 - Sept 27: Mrs Sandiford is held for weeks in a small cell at police headquarters in Denpasar, telling all she knows about the other three arrested Britons.

August: She is moved to Kerobokan prison, where, because she is so important to the police case, she is held in solitary confinement.

Early September: She is believed to have written to the British Embassy and Indonesian government officials claiming she is being badly treated and does not have enough food or water. September 27: Mrs Sandiford makes her first court appearance, accused of drug trafficking. She is tearful and covers her head with a scarf, maintaining that she had agreed to carry the suitcase because her son Elliot, 21, was being threatened by a drug gang.

September to January 14: She appears in court several times, her lawyers pleading for leniency because of her co-operation. The prosecution agree that because she has co-operated with the investigation they want her jailed for 'only' 15 years, rather than receive the mandatory death sentence.

January 14: In a 'last chance' hearing, her lawyer pleads for even less than the 15 years because her son was being threatened and she was coerced into carrying the cocaine.

January 22: She, her lawyer and even the prosecution are stunned by the death sentence, one of the judges said she had brought a bad reputation to Bali's tourism. Her demeanour suggested a woman in great shock - she spun about in the small cell for a moment or two as if uncertain what to do, before prison officers escorted her through a side door with other prisoners. She was then driven to jail - and to an uncertain future. Sandiford, originally from Redcar on Teesside, was one of a 'British gang of four’ who were caught and prosecuted after she tried to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine into the country from Thailand. The usual sentence for the amount of cocaine found in the lining of her suitcase – 4.8kg – is execution . Antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43, from Brighton, his 39-year-old partner Rachel Dougall and 39-year-old Paul Beales, were also arrested for the crime. Sandiford had told her lawyer, Mr Ezra Karo Karo, that she believed she had been made the scapegoat because it was the other three members of the gang who had a bigger role in the operation than herself. She immediately confessed that she had been told to hand over the drugs to Miss Dougall – and in a sting operation they followed her as she went about contacting Miss Dougall, Miss Dougall’s partner Julian Ponder, and Paul Beales.

But the case against Miss Dougall and Mr Beales started to crumble when police failed to find any physical evidence to connect Mrs Sandiford with the other three suspects. Police sources said that all conversations between Miss Dougall and Mrs Sandiford were carried out through mobile phones. But police had failed to retrieve a SIM card during a raid on Miss Dougall’s Bali villa, meaning there was no physical evidence. Insisting that she was just a courier, forced to make the drug run because of threats against her children in Britain, Mrs Sandiford pointed an accusing finger at two of the other members of the ‘gang of four’.

She said that she had met Miss Dougall and Mr Beales in Bangkok before she took the flight to Bali. Mr Beales, she said, had placed the drugs in the lining of her suitcase and the actual owner of the cocaine was Miss Dougall. Both denied the accusation.

Dougall received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court last month. She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be reunited with her daughter, because she had already been in jail for eight months awaiting trial. At the time of her arrest, Dougall insisted she was the victim of a 'fit-up' and Ponder claimed he was 'trapped'. Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a harsh sentence when judges gave him to four years for possession of a small amount of hashish. Showing leniency to Mr Beales at his trial late last year, presiding judge John Tony Hutauruk said: ‘The defendant had admitted his wrongdoings and had promised not to repeat them.’

Mrs Sandiford has also admitted her wrongdoings, but her punishment has been far more severe. The trial of the fourth Briton Ponder is still in the courts and there is speculation among legal circles in Bali that, as one of the alleged key players in the smuggling operation, he will also receive the death sentence. Ponder's lawyer claimed he was told that Sandiford was delivering a present for his child's birthday and, when he met her to receive the gift, police officers arrested him.

A verdict is expected in the trial of Ponder tomorrow. He is accused of receiving the drugs in Bali, which has a busy bar and nightclub scene where party drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy are bought and sold between foreigners. Gang of four: Rachel Dougall, left, was jailed for a year after her charges were lessened while Paul Beales, right, was imprisoned for four years for his role in the plot

On the face of it, bespectacled Mrs Sandiford, a mother of two who once worked as legal secretary, could not have been a more unlikely drugs courier.

After growing up in Cleveland, she moved to London where she married. She is now separated but has two sons, Lewis, 23, and Eliot, 21. Sentencing: Briton Julian Ponder could be sentenced as early as tomorrow and could also face the death penalty For some years Mrs Sandiford rented a £275,000 detached property in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where neighbours have less than fond memories of her. Some have described her as a ‘neighbour from hell’. A man of 63 who lived next door said she was evicted around five years ago for failing to pay rent. A former colleague of Lindsay Sandiford said she should have 'expected the consequences' of flouting Bali's strict laws.

Maria Swift, 47, who worked with Sandiford 10 years ago, said her ex-boss would have been well aware of the risks she was taking. Mum-of-seven Maria, of Cheltenham, worked for Sandiford as a secretary at DTS Legal in the town. 'When you go into these countries it does state that the importation of drugs is punishable by death and she should have seen it, she's not a stupid woman, she would have known,' she said.

'I'm a firm believer that the law is the law and it is there for a reason, this is the ultimate punishment and she should and would have known that could have happened to her.

'I do feel sorry for her though because no one should be sentenced to death, but she got caught and she should have expected the consequences to come with it.'

Neighbours on the quiet street in Cheltenham where Sandiford lived were surprised to learn of her fate.

One local resident said: 'She wasn't a nice person. She caused a lot of trouble when she lived here, her and her sons. She definitely wasn't a normal housewife.

'I don't know why she got herself into that situation, with all those drugs, but she's broken the law and has to pay the penalty, I suppose.' Reaction: The grandmother from Gloucestershire attempts to shield her face from photographers as she cries following her death sentence Painful: Lindsay Sandiford was pictured struggling to comprehend what had happened, especially as prosecutors had called for her to get 15 years not the death penalty

Claims: Lindsay Sandiford listens to her interpreter during her verdict trial at Denpasar district court in Bali Another neighbour, who lived on the street at the same time as Sandiford, said her house was always disorganised, with a rubbish-strewn front garden.

He said: 'There were never any curtains in the window, and then this one time there was a blooming great hole in the front window.

'It struck me as a not very happy house, if you know what I mean. It's what I would call ""disorganised""

'There were always people coming round and I saw the police parked outside a few times.' Passing comment on her crimes and sentencing, the neighbour, who asked not to be named, said she must have known the risks involved in trafficking drugs in South East Asia.

He added: 'At the end of the day, she probably knew what the risks were to what she was doing. We all know what the risks are.

'I don't suppose they'll execute her though - I reckon her sentence will be reduced on appeal.'

Even Mrs Sandiford’s mother, Audrey, refuses to have anything to do with her. She has lived abroad for many years and has remarried. She asked us not to reveal the place where she now resides.

‘I don’t go to England or have anything to do with Lindsay. I got tired of being a piggy bank and realised I was better off away from them,’ said the 86-year-old last June. She says she did not know Lindsay had been arrested and was ‘absolutely horrified. It’s a complete shock’. Expectant: The defendant walks out of the cell at the courtroom with another despondent woman in the background awaiting her fate Witnesses: People in the courtroom heard her cry 'no, no, no' as she was told her sentence and began to spin round uncontrollably Human rights charity Reprieve, which is assisting Sandiford, urged the Government to support her appeal.

Investigator Harriet McCulloch said: 'Lindsay has always maintained that she only agreed to carry the package to Bali after receiving threats against the lives of her family.

'She is clearly not a drug kingpin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water.

'She has co-operated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people.

'Lindsay must file an appeal within the next 14 days and it is vital that the British Government do everything possible to support Lindsay's appeal against the death sentence.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm that a British national is facing the death penalty in Indonesia. 'We remain in close contact with that national and continue to provide consular assistance.

'The UK remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.' Fate: Sandiford faces life in he much-feared Kerobokan jail in Bali, where foreign criminals including ones on death row are incarcerated Squalor: Prisoners are caged here in packed cells, which are filthy and fed gruel unless their family brings in food for them

The judges said there were no mitigating circumstances in Sandiford's case – despite a list of ‘reasons’ her lawyer had submitted last week and the defendant did not appear to care about the consequences of her actions.



‘It’s very rare that judges deliver a sentence so much harsher than what the prosecution has recommended,’ her lawyer said after the verdict.



Originally from Redcar but in recent times living in Gloucestershire, will now spend months – and perhaps years – in Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison as the appeal process against the death sentence stumbles through the Indonesian court system.

The judges had refused to consider the mitigating pleas put forward last week by Mrs Sandiford’s lawyer.

Mr Karo Karo said that there was medical evidence from a psychiatric hospital in England to show that since she was five years old Lindsay had been depressed and suffered a mental disorder in the wake of her parents’ divorce.



‘That condition could cause a middle-aged woman to be easiljy exploited by a drug dealing syndicate,’ Mr Karo had told the court.

Appeal: Lindsay Sandiford covers her face as she arrives for her verdict trial and says she will fight her execution

The lawyer also pointed out that she had acted only as a courier and was not involved any further.



‘Moreover, based on the witnesses that were presented to the previous trial, it was stated that our client did it because she was forced or threatened by that international drugs syndicate,’ Mr Karo said.



He said after that plea last week that he expected the judges to show leniency to Mrs Sandiford – particularly as she had also apologised to Bali and expressed her deep sorrow both verbally and in written form.

Sandiford previously told the court she became involved only because 'the lives of my children were in danger'.

In her witness statement, she said: 'I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement.

'I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.'

During the trial Sandiford's lawyer read out a statement from her son which said: 'I love my mother very much and have a very close relationship with her.

'I know that she would do anything to protect me. I cannot imagine what I would do if she was sentenced to death in relation to these charges.'

Amnesty International UK Campaigns Director Tim Hancock said: 'It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – despite the fact that the prosecution weren’t even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend.



'The death penalty is the ultimate inhuman punishment, and Amnesty never condones its use, but handing out a penalty of death by firing squad for a non-lethal crime, is cruel in the extreme.



'Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases and urges the Indonesian government to scrap this punishment from its books and impose an official moratorium on all executions so that no other individuals face the death penalty there.'



Sandiford's MP said he would seek to raise her sentence with Foreign Secretary William Hague during Foreign Office Questions in the House of Commons this morning.



Martin Horwood, Lib Dem MP for Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, where she previously lived, said the sentence came as a shock to a lot of people, as Indonesian prosecutors had not sought it.



'The days of the death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving,' he told BBC News.



'I imagine all those who know Lindsay will be extremely worried and concerned about this development.



'When the prosecutors asked for something less than the death sentence, for a custodial sentence, then I guess I'm afraid some of us perhaps relaxed a little and this has come as a real shock that the judges have actually delivered a sentence which is obviously much, much harsher than the one that was actually requested by prosecutors.'

Case: This is the villa in Bali used as the home of Rachel Dougall and Julian Ponder, Britons also arrested and accused of drug smuggling £1.6million of cocaine

Hiding: Sandiford, 56, was stopped at Bali Airport last May with 4.8kg of cocaine worth £1.6 million before being paraded in front of the press with the drugs

A university professor and expert on women in the international drug trade who submitted expert evidence during the trial said she was shocked by the 'completely disproportionate' sentence.



Jennifer Fleetwood, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent, said it was very likely that Sandiford had been coerced into acting as a drug mule.



'The prosecution had asked for 15 years, which I considered to be high but not unexpected, so it's very surprising that the judge has imposed a punishment higher than what the prosecution asked for,' she said.



DEATH ROW IN A BALI JAIL: LIFE IN THE NOTORIOUS KEROBOKAN PRISON Kerobokan prison is in the Bali capital, Denpasar, and has been nicknamed 'hell on earth' by many who have been sent there.

It has notoriously poor conditions, with its white-washed walls, topped with barbed wire, all stained with mildew, while inside it is unmercifully claustrophobic.

Crowded cells are filled with all manner of criminals of all nationalities and unless friends and relatives bring food, they must sustain themselves on meals of prison gruel.

And for those on death row, the procedure they follow is depressingly familiar at the prison where at least two of the Bali bombers were executed by firing squad.

On their last day they will be woken early — certainly before dawn — handcuffed to prison officers and led out of the jail for the last time to a van.

It will travel through the deserted streets before cutting down a jungle track and stopping close to a beach or orchard.

From that point on, every chilling step is spelled out in Indonesia’s 1964 death penalty regulations, known as Penetapan Presiden No 2.

The regulations state: ‘Once arriving at the place of their death, the condemned is blindfolded (although they can choose not to be).’

Most prisoners ask to die standing up, their hands tied behind their backs to a pole, but they can also choose to sit or lie down.

A ten or twenty-member squad of the Indonesian Mobile Brigade, who have passed psychological tests to ready them for the task, will be assigned to shoot a prisoner.

But in order to preserve their sanity, only two of them will have live 5.5mm bullets, the rest being blanks.

None of the firing squad knows who has actually fired the fatal shot to the heart, but having only two live bullets means, of course, that instant death is not necessarily guaranteed.

In that case, the law states that: ‘If after the shooting the condemned still shows signs they are not yet dead, the Commander immediately gives the order to the head of the firing squad to let off a tembakan pengakhir (a coup de grace) by pressing the barrel of the gun against the temple of the condemned, right above their ear,’ and firing. Indonesia does not reveal how many prisoners have been executed, but human rights groups have confirmed that in 2009, the country executed 13 people, three of the Bali bombers in 2008, one person in 2007 and three in 2006.

There are at least 120 people on death row for crimes that are almost all murder or drug trafficking.

The number of crimes occurring in the areas that are frequented by tourists is on the rise.

The Thai government has a goal of earning revenue 2 trillion Baht annually from tourism by 2015. However, if the rising rate of criminal activity is not dealt with, this might remain a pipe dream. Even though it is still early to establish whether foreigners are shying away from the destination due to the crime, the government has a lot to do to keep the visitors coming.

After the rape and robbery committed against two Russian nationals in Pattaya on Dec 26th, the public is now demanding that harsher punishments be implemented on offenders. Pol Lt Col Aroon Promphan asserted that although the police are trying their best to help, they are greatly outnumbered by the number of visitors, making it difficult to provide security. Col Aroon added that the number of tourist police in Pattaya is 150 officers and 50 volunteers who are foreigners.

A very large percentage of foreigners that visit Pattaya are Russians. This number has been on the rise since 2009. Back then only about 300,000 Russians visited the area, however, by 2012, the number had risen to 1.2 million.

Due to the fact that the rape case prompted several organizations, most notably the Russian Embassy, to express concern, the government has agreed to improve the state of security in the region.

The measures include an increase in the number of tourist checkpoints; placing of surveillance cameras in areas that are seen as high risk; equipping the tourists with useful information such as a hotline 1155, where they can report any incidences; hotels have been asked to increase the security measures and protect their clients more.

""We are advising our guests to stay off places that are dangerous and to be careful when traveling in cities"" said Peerasak Momin. Momin oversees training at the Hilton Pattaya Hotel. He added that big hotels that have tight security measures like Hilton, Marriott, and Sheraton, have very little to worry about in terms of insecurity.

It was reported that most tourists are aware that the areas that have a high prevalence for crimes include popular destinations such as Pattaya, Koh Samui and Phuket. A small hotel operator in Surat Thani province observed that crime is usually most prevalent in the high tourist season.

The ministry of tourism and sports reported that in 2012, Thailand received 22.3 million foreign tourists, a number that is way above the targeted 21 million. In addition to that, they generated 960 billion Baht compared to the 500 billion Baht that was generated by local tourists.","Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.tourism-review.com/temp/aktualita-detail-facebook_tmb_3548.jpg?v=1502277634,"['pattaya', 'tourist', 'crimes', 'thailands', 'affects', 'crime', 'measures', 'security', 'rate', 'high', 'tourism', 'baht', 'tourists', 'number', 'growing']", 
18,18,FL-2013-000006-IDN,Khalifa Foundation: A helping hand at time of need - Khaleej Times,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/general/khalifa-foundation-a-helping-hand-at-time-of-need,"Motivated by the humanitarian vision and generosity of the President, His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Khalifa bin Zayed Foundation has wrapped the 2012 with a bright record of achievements and a qualitative leap in its humanitarian initiatives towards the underprivileged.

The programmes it launched last year brought comfort, ease and relief to those affected by natural and man-made catastrophes and calamities across the world.

The Foundation carried out a raft of humanitarian programmes in diverse sectors as health and education within the UAE and beyond, therefore earning itself a prominent place in the world map of humanitarian work. Allied with other stakeholder relief agencies, the Foundation has played a vital role to promote the UAE as a key world donor and provider of humanitarian and relief assistance.

Shaikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of the Foundation, said humanitarian assistance provided by the UAE to needy population in different parts of the world is in implementation of Shaikh Khalifa’s humanitarian vision and demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to the spirit of tolerance and openness to other nations in a way that serves mutual interests and consolidates international security and peace.

The Foundation’s humanitarian and relief assistance and programmes reached out to poor and needy segments in more than 70 sisterly and friendly countries. Towards that noble end, the Foundation built strategic partnerships and bridges of cooperation with international peer organisations to coordinate relief operations to those in need.

One of the 2012 milestone in the Foundation’s proven record of success, was its cooperation and partnership agreement with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) to finance GAIN’s efforts to reduce deaths and disabilities associated with nutritional deficiencies in Afghanistan, particularly among women and children.

GAIN will use the grant from the foundation to ensure increased consumption of fortified foods (wheat flour, vegetable oil and ghee, and salt), and fortified complementary foods for children aged between six and 24 months. The goal of the four-year project is to increase the amount of vitamins and minerals in people’s daily diets and to reduce disabilities related to insufficient nutrients by 30 per cent. The project will benefit 15 million people.

Locally, the Foundation undertook important initiatives : subsidised food items to UAE citizens, cash assistance to students, healthcare programme, Ramadan fast-breaking programme (1.7 million hot meals delivered through 109 sites), and Khalifa bin Zayed Village for Social Care in Umm Al Qaiwain.

A total of 130,000 students from more than 700 schools nationwide benefited from the school assistance programme in the last five years. In the 2012-2013 academic year alone, financial assistance were offered to 22,850 students. The Foundation footed bills of treatment for more than 700 patients regardless of their nationality, religion and ethnics, and provide medical supplies and equipment to both government and private health facilities.

In the social sector, the Foundation funded the 940,000 cubic feet village of 40 villas in Umm Al Qaiwain for up to 300 orphans and children of unknown parents.

Internationally, the Foundation sponsored a mass wedding of 224 couples in Bahrain, established the 1,470 square metre Khalifa bin Zayed Hospital in the island of Socarta, Yemen, supported the Khalifa bin Zayed School in Bait Lahia, Gaza Strip, for the third running year, and sponsored mass wedding of 436 Palestinian couples. In Lebanon, financial assistance were offered to the health sector. The Foundation also donated 12 ambulances and 50 medical devices to Tunisia. It also offered medical supplies and equipment to health facilities in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen, Tunisia, Sudan, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The AED 500 million food assistance programme, ordered by President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to Yemen, was among the most vital relief operations the Foundation implemented in the last year. The aid programmes offered food items to 85,000 needy families in Yemen and is still going on.

Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Muslim-minority Rohingya in Mynamar were also supported by the Foundation.

Population affected by floods and earthquakes in Palestine, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Yemen, Philippines, Indonesia, Haiti, Somalia, Libya and Turkey were comforted by generous relief assistance provided by the Foundation.

Other major projects executed by the Foundation included the construction of 20 dams in Somalia, the Khalifa bin Zayed Bridge in Pakistan and the Khalifa bin Zayed Vocational Education Centre in Senegal.","Fri, 18 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.khaleejtimes.com/images/default/default_490x276.jpg,"['yemen', 'need', 'bin', 'relief', 'hand', 'assistance', 'uae', 'zayed', 'humanitarian', 'khalifa', 'foundation', 'al', 'helping']",

Cruel practice of performing monkeys on the streets of Indonesia

Long-tailed macaques are chained and forced to do tricks for £4 a day

A tiny monkey is walking on stilts, clad in a red tracksuit and a ghostly doll mask, as cars and motorcycles drive past on a busy road in Surakarta, Indonesia.

Neneng, a long-tailed macaque, is only nine months old but can already put on a show as he plays a toy-guitar, walk on stilts and does a handstand in a red cowboy hat.

With a yank of the chain around his neck, his master Iyayi changes the act to entice those driving past to throw a coin or two at the performing primate, one of thousands on the streets of Indonesia.

Chained: The monkey holds on to his stilts on the side of the road in Surakarta, Indonesia which is his 'stage'

The practice of training macaques to become street performers has been a part of the country’s culture for decades.

It has been growing in popularity since the 1980s when it changed from being part of ‘monkey circuses’ entertaining children in the poor neighbourhoods, to move to markets and road-sides.

The practice has become an industry in Indonesia, its centre in a district in East Jakarta known as as Kampung Monyet - Monkey Village - where a majority of the residents are ‘monkey masters’.

Here monkey masters train their carefully selected macaque for months to push trolleys, fetch money and roly-poly in the street for pennies.

The monkeys are often clothed and wear masks made out of the face of a dolls head.

Prime performance: Neneng, a nine-month-old macaque, is dancing and holding a guitar whilst wearing an unnerving mask made from a dolls head

Dance monkey: Neneng sits down with his toy-guitar by the side of the road where he performs with his 'monkey master'

Nothing sensational: Performing monkeys on the side of the road or in markets have become a common sight in the country in the the past few decades

Their cruel training methods include ‘the hanging monkey’ which is designed to wean the monkey off walking on all fours.

The monkey master chains the monkey to the ceiling and ties the monkey’s arms around its back, forcing it to stand on two legs.

This goes on for as long as it takes the monkey to find its balance on its hind legs, only allowing a daily food break before it is strung up again.



Neneng’s monkey master Iyayi bought him for 200,000 rupiah (£13) and spent then trained for three months to perform a variety of tricks.

Neneng is expected to make 50,000 rupiah (£3.20) to 70,000 rupiah (£4.50) per day for his master.

Cruel methods: Training a macaque takes months and often involves punishments and beatings to curb the will of the animal

Tight leash: When Iyayi wants his monkey to switch to a new trick, he yanks the chain around his neck

Popular job: Lack of jobs, poverty and poor conditions in the slums have been blamed for the increasing number of 'monkey masters' on the streets of Indonesia

Livelihood: Neneng cost his owner Iyayi £13 and is expected to make him between £3 and £4.50 a day through his roadside performance

The Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN), a charity that feeds rescued performing monkeys, explains that the conditions in the slums is what keeps this practice going.

‘Poverty drives the handlers to exploit the monkeys in the hope of earning small change,’ the charity writes on its website.

Shimla, Jan 19: The Queen of the Hills, as Shimla was fondly called by the British, recorded the highest snowfall on a single day January in the past eight years, a Met official said here Saturday.

Manmohan Singh, director of the meteorological office here, told IANS that the town recorded 38.6 cm snow in the past 24 hours, the highest in the first month of the year since 2005.""The maximum snow in a day in January was recorded was in 2005. It was 33.2 cm Jan 18,"" he said, adding: ""On two consecutive days (Jan 17 and 18 this year) the town got 63.6 cm.""Singh said snow and heavy rain in the region in the past two days was mainly due to induced cyclonic circulation with the western disturbances.As per records of the Met office, there was no snowfall at all in Shimla for two consecutive years in January from 2006.In 2008, there was just 1 cm snow throughout the month, while it was 8.7 cm in 2009, 1.8 cm in 2010 and 8.5 cm in 2011.In 2005, there was 94.3 cm snow in January but it was spread over seven days (Jan 17, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28 and 28). In 2004, it was 96.6 cm snow Jan 23, 26, 30 and 31.On Jan 23, 2004, alone, Shimla saw 30 cm snow.However, in January last year the town saw 95 cm snow, the second highest after 2004 (96.6 cm). ""But last year the highest snow on a single day was just 11 cm (Jan 16),"" Singh added.Old-timers recalled that for almost two decades, Shimla has not recorded the kind of heavy snowfall that used to paralyse life in winter for more than a fortnight in the past.M.R. Kaundal, retired government employee who settled in Shimla in 1945, said till the 1980s, heavy snowfall was a normal feature of the town.""As far as I remember the last time it occurred was during the winter of 1990-91 when the town was cut off from the rest of the country for more than two weeks due to snow. Tourists had to hire porters to leave the town, and trudge miles,"" he said.According to Compendium of Environmental Statistics, Himachal Pradesh - 2012, compiled by the state's department of economics and statistics, the state's minimum average temperature, which was registered at 5.6 degrees Celsius in 1971-72, is now 5.8 degrees.It says the cycles of rain and snow have changed marginally but average rainfall has remained static.The state has 31,757.71 sq km of area under snow cover, and changes in the rain and snowfall cycle are a result of emission of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide, it says.

TO: President Obama

FROM: Elizabeth Ferris

Global warming is occurring at a faster pace than predicted by scientists. Temperatures are rising, icecaps and glaciers are melting, and extreme weather events are becoming both more frequent and more intense. Last fall, the National Snow and Ice Data Center documented a record low of the level of Arctic sea ice – a figure 49 percent lower than the 1979-2000 average. If these trends continue, the results will be far-reaching for life on this planet. But if the warming accelerates dramatically and if polar ice melts even faster, the results could be catastrophic. This could occur if the Greenland ice sheet or the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) collapses, triggering a significant rise in sea levels throughout the world with particularly devastating impacts on populations living in low-lying coastal areas. Although the effects of climate change are likely to be long-term and the worst effects will probably neither be experienced in your presidency nor even in your lifetime, the future is inherently unpredictable. Climate change is already affecting communities around the world. It is likely to produce devastating consequences whether in the near or distant future. Taking bold steps now to address climate change offers an opportunity for you not only to leave a legacy that will impact future generations but also an opportunity to address current problems resulting from the effects of climate change.

Recommendations:

Elizabeth Ferris Former Brookings Expert Research Professor, Institute of Study of International Migration - Georgetown University

• Raise the priority of climate change on your foreign policy agenda, in particular by re-vitalizing negotiations over a post-Kyoto treaty. The Doha round of negotiations, which ended last month, was disappointing. Countries are further away today than they were a year ago on reducing emissions. U.S. leadership can reverse current trends of inadequate global commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.

• Support measures that will enable communities and countries to adapt to the most egregious effects of climate change. On the international level this means supporting and leading the difficult discussions around climate finance and using U.S. aid to support government planning to respond to the effects of climate change, including financial assistance to encourage communities to stay where they are as well as to plan for the relocation of communities whose homes will no longer be habitable.

• Support effective multilateral action to increase both mitigation and adaptation measures. Use your influence with the multilateral development banks to encourage more attention to disaster riskreduction measures in development planning. Work with international agencies and legal experts to devise an international legal regime for dealing with the expected increase in trans-border migration. It is easier to put a system in place before a crisis is at hand.

• Strengthen domestic efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions and enhancing domestic capacity to prepare for, respond, and recover from sudden-onset natural disasters.

Background:

Since the first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990, the projections about the impact of global warming have become direr. From projecting the widespread consequences of a global rise in temperature of 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, current projections are that the rise in temperature will double to 4 degrees Celsius. The seas are rising 60 percent faster than predicted by the IPCC. The Greenland ice sheet is shrinking twice as fast as estimated by the IPCC and is losing mass at about five times the rate it was in the early 1990s. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt completely, global sea rise could reach seven meters. And the consequences of global warming go far beyond sea-level rise. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warns that the conditions that led to the 2011 Texas drought are 20 times more likely to occur now than in the 1960s as a result of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.

Although climate change will have many negative effects in different parts of the world, including prolonged droughts, reduction in arable land, declining agricultural productivity, and increased flooding due to more extreme weather events, the impact of sea level rise perhaps best illustrates the potential dangers. Throughout the world, more people are living in coastal areas as the result of population growth, urbanization and government policies. Presently 10 percent of the world’s population — 600 million people — live in low-elevation coastal zones and the percentage is growing. Sixty-five percent of the world’s megacities (those over 5 million) are located in these coastal areas. A rise in sea level of even a meter would have major implications for coastal populations; if sea levels were to rise by several meters, the consequences would be catastrophic. Most obviously, sea level rise will submerge land, causing countries to lose physical territory. The areas expected to experience the largest land loss by 2030 are the Arctic Ocean coasts of Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Greenland as well as coastal areas of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, southeast Indonesia, and eastern Africa. In the United States, particularly vulnerable areas include the coastal areas of the east and west coasts and the Gulf of Mexico.

Rising sea levels will affect economics, politics, community life and security. For example, the mega-deltas of Asia are the food baskets of the region, and the impact of a sea level rise on food security will be considerable. But perhaps the most significant impact of climate change in general and rising sea levels in particular will be the displacement of people. Migration is a complex process driven by a range of economic, social and political factors but it is becoming clear that environmental factors will increasingly influence migration. In Bangladesh, for example, moving to cities has become a common coping strategy in the face of flooding. One of the IPCC background studies posits that a 40-centimeter rise in sea levels will affect 100 million people. As hundreds of millions of people in Africa and Asia are at risk of flooding by 2060, it is likely that many will move to cities such as Dhaka and Lagos that are located in coastal flood plain areas. In other words, the trend is for people to migrate to areas of greater — not lesser — environmental vulnerability. At the same time, as the UK’s authoritative Foresight study concludes, those who are able to migrate may well be the lucky ones; those who are unable to move may be the most vulnerable.

Large-scale migration has many consequences. If sea level rise renders small island states uninhabitable (which is likely to occur long before the islands are actually submerged by the seas), issues of sovereignty, legal status, and responsibility will present the world with huge challenges. Most climate change-induced migration or displacement will be internal, placing strain on infrastructure and pressure on governments to deliver services. Political instability, conflict and poor governance exacerbate these problems. Climate change is a threat multiplier, often affecting those countries least able to respond appropriately. How will governments cope with the movement of large numbers of people from coasts toward inland areas? There is also a possibility that some, perhaps many, will seek to move to other countries because of the effects of climate change. The international legal system is unprepared to deal with trans-border movements triggered by environmental factors or disasters, since the displaced do not fall under the 1951 Refugee Convention (unless they leave because of political turmoil exacerbated by climate change.)

Projecting possible massive displacement from climate change is complicated by the difficulty of comprehending the interrelationships between the different effects of climate change, for example, changes in fish stocks and coral reefs brought about by the acidification of the world’s oceans; changing patterns of disease; changing habitats for animals and plants; the intersection of deforestation and increasingly arid climates in some parts of the world. Delicate ecological balances are changing in ways that are as yet poorly understood. Similarly, there is much we do not know about the dynamic nature of the effects of climate change. For example, some scientists are reporting that the melting of Arctic ice itself is releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, increasing global warming which will in turn increase the rate of Arctic ice melt.

Most scientists have observed that the climate is becoming warmer and that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. While it is impossible to attribute any single weather event, such as Hurricane Sandy, to climate change, the global trends clearly demonstrate an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. These trends are likely to intensify. The interaction between increasing extreme weather events and other effects of climate change – such as increased erosion, acidification of the seas, desertification, sea-level rise – is also likely to lead to large-scale movement of people.

Conclusion:

There are certainly obstacles and pitfalls to making climate change a centerpiece of your foreign policy. Perhaps the projections of scientists are too pessimistic and the effects of global warming will not be as serious as now thought. Perhaps you will be unable to marshal the necessary political support to enact necessary legislation. Perhaps other governments will fail to rally to your leadership and perhaps the negotiations over climate change mitigation and adaptation will widen, not narrow the North- South divide. It is certainly understandable that you would want to put aside these longer-term challenges and focus on more immediate economic issues. But a climate catastrophe could be lurking around the corner.

Unless urgent action is taken now, the effects of climate change on life on this planet and on life in the United States will increase. Climate change is a domestic, foreign policy, security, development, human rights, and intergenerational justice issue. Preparing better for climate change disasters at home and abroad is a good short-term prophylactic. But making serious and sustained efforts to reduce global warming can solidify America’s present leadership in the world. It can lay the foundation for the country’s sustainable future development. It can address the causes of future humanitarian crises and alleviate future human suffering. It can be a legacy issue for the Obama administration that will impact the world for generations.","Thu, 17 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sandy_newyork001.jpg,"['effects', 'coastal', 'world', 'thaw', 'sea', 'ice', 'big', 'areas', 'climate', 'change', 'global', 'rise']",

29,29,FL-2013-000006-IDN,PHL to seek damage claims for destruction in Tubbataha Reef - GMA News,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/291300/phl-to-seek-damage-claims-for-destruction-in-tubbataha-reef/story/,"(Updated 3:46 p.m.) The Philippine government assured the public Monday that it would be claiming for damages from the US government for whatever destruction its minesweeper USS Guardian has caused in Tubbataha Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

“Yes, I assume it is clearly in the Tubbataha Law, it is incumbent for government to file for such claim,” Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said at a press briefing in Malacañang.

Asked if the US has given assurance that it will pay for the damages, Abaya said “as a responsible nation and state and a strong ally of the Philippines, I assume it goes without saying.” The USS Guardian, which just completed a port call in Subic Bay, ran aground on the reef in Sulu Sea on Thursday on its way to Indonesia. It was supposed to proceed to East Timor for a training exercise, the US Navy said. This is not the first time that a large vessel has run aground in the remote reefs located in the middle of the Sulu Sea, which are frequented by liveaboard dive boats during the summer months from March to May. In 2005, the ship Rainbow Warrior of the environmental group Greenpeace also hit Tubbataha, damaging corals that covered a total area of 32 meters by 3 meters (105 x 10 feet) of the reef. Greenpeace paid a fine of 384,000 pesos (US$6,857) for the damage, according to a report in the group's website. Greenpeace said the government chart they were using had shown them to be 1.5 miles away from the reef when the vessel ran aground at the time.Latest photos of the grounding show that the entire length of the 68-meter vessel is now sitting on the northern edge of the south atoll, which is ringed by corals, and continues to be buffeted by strong waves whipped up by the northeast monsoon.The Tubbataha Reef is considered one of the best dives sites in the world. It consists of two coral atolls that harbor a wide range of marine life including 600 species of fish, 360 species of corals, 11 species of sharks, 13 species of dolphins and whales, 100 species of birds, and six species of sea turtles. In a previous interview with GMA News Online, Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau director Theresa Mundita Lim said the assessment of the damage will depend on the condition and extent of coral cover in the affected area. ""As of now, ang na-peg na value sa losses… [is] P12,000 per square meter ,” she said. ""May baseline information tayo sa Tubbataha so ibig sabihin mas madaling malaman kung ano talaga ‘yung na-damage.”

“I haven't read the law but the law doesn't distinguish whether it is negligence or inadvertent or intentional. What is clear in the law is that we can claim for damages, not really looking into as to the intent or how it happened,” said Abaya. Minimize further damage He said the main focus now of the Philippine and US governments is the removal of the USS Guardian in order to minimize further damage to the Tubbataha Reef. ""Well, just imagine it if a vessel, a 68-meter vessel aground with either a crane lifting it, so you have cables floating and a huge vessel alongside tugboats trying to pull it from the reef with big ropes tied to it. No one should get near those things at all because it could snap, it could break, and environmental investigators in the area could easily be harmed,"" he said. “Once the ship is pulled out then assessing the damage to the reef or whatever damage in species or habitat or breeding area will likewise be done. The DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) should play a key role here, then from there on probably claims would then follow,” he added. President Benigno Aquino III has expressed concern about the incident and instructed officials to coordinate closely with the US Navy, but said the latter should be be allowed to conduct the salvage operations on their own. Abaya said the cause of the grounding will be a separate issue from the damage on the reef, and the government's claims would be given more focus in future discussions.“I haven't read the law but the law doesn't distinguish whether it is negligence or inadvertent or intentional. What is clear in the law is that we can claim for damages, not really looking into as to the intent or how it happened,” said Abaya.“Once the ship is pulled out then assessing the damage to the reef or whatever damage in species or habitat or breeding area will likewise be done. The DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) should play a key role here, then from there on probably claims would then follow,” he added. President Benigno Aquino III has expressed concern about the incident and instructed officials to coordinate closely with the US Navy, but said the latter should be be allowed to conduct the salvage operations on their own.

“He is mindful of the national treasure that we have—the very asset of the Tubbataha Reef—and he wanted to make sure that we would be proactive on this; we minimize damage. The plan should be vetted, the plan should be concurred in, and likewise to keep him informed and the public informed,” he said.

He said the Philippines still has to verify the ship personnel's explanation that the map they used was faulty. ""I'II take it as face value. We weren’t aboard the vessel. Probably they’ve really encountered such problem. But it is best if we verify these stories too and establish our own facts,” he said. Ignored warnings?

Abaya said the investigation will include reports that one reason the ship ran aground was that it ignored the warnings from Tubbataha park personnel.

“That would be of record: when was this notice to mariners made? And, presumably, the US Navy has a very efficient system of disseminating information. Yes, that would be considered,” he said.

Abaya said USS Guardian was currently parallel to the reef and “heavily grounded, meaning it is quite stable there because both its front part—the bow and the rear part, the stern—are basically in contact with the reef. So the probability of moving and damaging further parts of the reef is basically brought to a minimum.”

He said Commodore Joseph Rustom Peña, commander of the Naval Forces West, informed him that the assessment team from the US went on board USS Guardian around noon Monday. The team will try to assess what should be done and lay out salvage plans by Tuesday.

In an interview with reporters, Peña said, “Ang salvage is, once na matapos na yung assessment, they will come up with a plan of action kung papano nila gagawin yun.”

Abaya said Philippine authorities will vet the plans of the US Navy for the salvage operations.

“We will likewise be abreast of every plan and detail that will be conducted and implemented. Foremost in these salvage operations, meaning getting the ship out of the reef, is that the procedure should cause the minimum of damage to reef or no additional further damage to the reef. I think that is clear to our forces and likewise clear to our counterparts in the US Navy,” he said.

Abaya said after an assessment is made, the USS Guardian will be defueled to minimize the risk of oil spillage when the vessel is pulled or lifted. While defueling, oil spill booms will be laid so that if ever there is a leak, the oil will not spill out or cause further damage, he said.

After defueling, repairs shall be conducted in order to allow the ship to refloat. USS Guardian will also be ""dewatered,"" the process of pumping out water to make it float again.

According to the Navy Times website , the stranded navy vessel took water and its “multiple spaces” are flooded.

Abaya said Peña mentioned the possibility of bringing in a heavy-lifting ship which has a 1,000-ton capacity crane to lift the stricken vessel and put it on board another ship if tugging it away cannot be done. —KG/YA/RSJ, GMA News","Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www8.gmanews.tv/webpics/v3/2013/01/ZZZ_012113_1.jpg,"['navy', 'claims', 'phl', 'tubbataha', 'vessel', 'law', 'species', 'destruction', 'guardian', 'seek', 'reef', 'ship', 'uss', 'damage']",

31,31,FL-2013-000006-IDN,"Under Morsi, criminal defamation suits soar in Egypt - IFEX",https://ifex.org/under-morsi-criminal-defamation-suits-soar-in-egypt/,"President Mohamed Morsi’s first 200 days in office alone have witnessed more defamation lawsuits than under all Egyptian rulers combined since 1892, states ANHRI in its latest report, issued to mark the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution.

(IFEX) – 23 January 2013 – When promises of increased media freedoms followed President Hosni Mubarak’s downfall in early 2011, a wave of new satellite channels and newspapers flooded the media scene in Egypt.

It seemed back then that most red lines had dissolved; Egyptians were free to express their political views and criticisms without fear of retribution.

A few months after the revolution, however, it became apparent that the rights of journalists were not to be safeguarded, as criminal defamation made its way into the new constitution.

Under the title “Dignity and the prohibition against insults” Article 31 states: Insulting or showing contempt toward any human being is prohibited.

According to Index on Censorship, the vagueness of this provision allows for a broad interpretation of what could be viewed as defamation and paves the way for its exploitation.

Although President Mohamed Morsi has repeatedly insisted he is committed to the democratic system, other articles in the Islamist-drafted constitution are also viewed as a serious risk to free expression in the country.

“There is a growing trend of targeting independent and critical voices under President Mohamed Morsi’s government, which is especially worrying in light of a lack of protection for the press under the new constitution,” said Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Morsi’s first 200 days in office alone have witnessed more defamation lawsuits than under all Egyptian rulers combined since 1892.

In a report it issued days before the second year anniversary of the Egyptian revolution on 25 January titled “The crime of insulting the president, an authoritarian regime crime”, ANHRI traces lawsuits filed during the reign of Egypt’s five presidents. Its findings convey that at least 24 lawsuits for insulting Morsi have been filed against journalists and activists since his election in June, as opposed to only four such cases under Mubarak, and only one under Anwar Sadat.

Among those recently sued for allegedly defaming Morsi, 12 were journalists or media personalities. The latest victim was Gamal Fahmy, an opposition columnist at the independent newspaper Al-Tahrir, who mentioned that Al Husseiny Abou Deif, a journalist killed outside the presidential palace in Cairo while covering clashes on 4 December 2012, was gunned down for his public criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi himself. According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), a Cairo prosecutor launched an investigation against Fahmy, accusing him of writing articles offensive to the President.

“Targeting opinion makers and journalists directly should be considered intellectual terrorism against those who exercise their right to freedom of expression, which, beyond doubt, includes criticizing the policies and decisions of the president,” said ANHRI in its statement denouncing the criminal investigation launched against Fahmy and others before him.

A similar investigation launched against the popular satirist and TV personality, Bassem Youssef, attracted great media attention, as the former heart surgeon —now turned comedian — enjoys a massive following in Egypt. The prosecutor general’s office accused Youssef of insulting the president for holding up a red furry pillow stamped with Morsi’s image during his popular TV show Al Bernameg. Youssef used the pillow as a prop to mock the way the president delivers his speeches.

Abdel-Halim Qandil, editor of the independent weekly Sawt al-Umma, is also under investigation for writing an article in October 2012 entitled, “Morsi, you are a liar”.

According to ANHRI’s latest report, accusations have been made not only against individuals but against media outlets as well. Al-Masry Al-Youm, Al-Fagr and Al-Tahrir newspapers as well as TV channels Al-Fareen and Al-Qahera Wa Al-Nas have all been accused of insulting the president.","Wed, 23 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://ifex.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/flickr_morsi_painting_france.jpg,"['egypt', 'journalists', 'soar', 'media', 'egyptian', 'morsis', 'lawsuits', 'defamation', 'criminal', 'morsi', 'president', 'suits', 'investigation', 'insulting']",

38,38,FL-2013-000006-IDN,"Editorial: Burt Munro, legend - The Southland Times",http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/opinion/8217178/Editorial-Burt-Munro-legend,"We think of him as a local hero, our do-it-yourself genius who spent decades tinkering with a 1920 Indian motorcycle in an old rundown shed in Invercargill and turned it into a world record-setting speed machine on the Bonneville salt flats.

We're proud of his achievements and of the commemorative annual Burt Munro Challenge that attracts more than 1000 motorbike fans to the city each November, even though local funders have to top up the revenues it generates to meet the $350,000 cost of running it.

But Herbert James ""Burt"" Munro was much more than a local legend, and the recognition accorded his feats by Time magazine - identifying the Invercargill event as one of its top five must do festivals of 2013 - is being applauded by thousands of people around the world on Facebook, YouTube and internet message boards.

PIONEER: Burt Munro and his 'Munro Special' Indian Scout Invercargill, 1938.

Munro is a true international sports legend, his name probably much better known overseas than in New Zealand.

Time, which rates the Munro Challenge as one of five annual festival events not to be missed alongside the Pasola, a religious and sexual renewal celebration in Indonesia, and the Eurovision Song Contest that attracts a television audience of more than 100 million, said that as well as the seven separate racing events of the week-long challenge the live music, food, camping and Invercargill's famous hospitality made it one of the most colourful motorsport festivals ever conceived.

The glowing testimony is sure to be a boon to the Invercargill Motorcycle Club, struggling each year to beg, borrow and connive to get enough money to run the event, and to E Hayes and Sons, that has one of Munro's original racing bikes on permanent public display.

And it should make fundraising to keep the event going easier for the volunteers at the motorcycle club, the people who fronted an Invercargill City Council meeting last year to plead for more money after running at a loss in 2011 when southerly gales battered the region and washed out most of the planned events.

The challenge did better last November, attracting more than 1300 participants and, according to Venture Southland, bringing more than $1.1 million in extra spending into the province. Support is growing and the Time article is certain to pull in more overseas fans.

One wonders, though, what Burt would make of all the fuss. A pensioner when he set his last and still unbeaten speed record at Bonneville at the age of 68, he lived for his motorbikes - he is reputed to have built more than 10 of them from the basic 1920 Indian design in his workshed.

He lived there, too, even though he had a perfectly reasonable house on his section, more comfortable eating and sleeping among boxes and shelves of motorbike parts that he had made himself in his thirst for speed. And he wasn't exactly the ideal neighbour, more an irritating rogue who would test his latest design - no muffler, full revs - at all hours of the day and night.

The only time he appears to have taken any notice of complaints was when long-suffering neighbours insisted he sort out the waist-high wilderness of his section. Burt doused it in petrol and set fire to it - problem solved.

He did have a sense of humour. He became Burt late in life, after a newspaper in the United States, reporting on one of his first trips to Bonneville, inadvertently spelt his name wrong.

Herbert James ""Burt"" Munro - March 25, 1899 - January 6, 1978 - would have loved all the fuss if he was still around. Most of all though, he would have loved the racing, especially if he was in the thick of it.","Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1353730989/162/7994162.jpg,"['indian', 'motorcycle', 'editorial', 'racing', 'local', 'event', 'speed', 'challenge', 'legend', 'invercargill', 'munro', 'burt']",

NIAMEY, Niger, January 16 (UNHCR) - Upriver from Niamey, in Mali, heavy combat is triggering a fresh displacement of civilians. But despite funding shortages, the UN refugee agency is ready to respond to any deepening of the humanitarian crisis, including an outflow to neighbouring Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso

""We have been preparing contingency plans and getting ready on the ground to ensure that we can deal with various possible scenarios,"" said Karl Steinacker, the UNHCR representative in Niger. ""The provision of water, sanitation and hygiene, health, education, protection from sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), and child protection are our main priorities,"" he added.

UNHCR's offices in Bamako, Mali as well as other neighbouring capitals have also prepared contingency plans in the past few months with other UN agencies, NGOs and national authorities to cope with a further possible population displacement of 300,000 internally displaced people (IDP) inside Mali and 407,000 to surrounding countries.

The situation in Mali, which has been embroiled in political upheaval for the past year, escalated last week when the French military intervened to help Malian government troops halt an advance toward the capital, Bamako, by Islamists linked to Al Qaeda.

Since these developments in the military situation, there has been a noticeable increase in the number crossing into neighbouring countries - almost 1,500 have crossed into Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso since last Friday. The figures could multiply if the combat intensifies and persists. UNHCR teams are monitoring the borders.

""Refugees are telling us they fled the ongoing military intervention, the absence of subsistence opportunities and basic services, and the imposition of Sharia law,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said in Geneva on Tuesday.

UN staff reported that 460 refugees had made their way to western Niger's Mangaize camp or the Tillia, Banibangou and Tillabery sites. In Burkina Faso's Sahel region, UNHCR teams at Mentao and Demba camps on Wednesday reported 497 new arrivals from Mali. Most said they had come from the Gao, Timbuktu and Mopti regions, citing the military intervention as one of their main reasons for fleeing.

UNHCR and its partners are providing new arrivals at reception centres with food, water and medical care prior to their transfer to refugee camps. In Burkina Faso, eight new arrivals have been hospitalized with measles. The refugee agency hopes to conduct a border monitoring mission soon to assess the situation there.

In Mauritania, the number of people arriving at the Fassala transit centre had risen to 681 as of yesterday, mostly women and children from Lere in central Mali's Timbuktu area. They told UNHCR they had fled for fear of bombardment of the town, which was attacked at the weekend.

UNHCR personnel in Mauritania took part in a joint assessment mission to the border with Mali at the weekend and reported that people were being allowed to cross. New arrivals are registered at the Fassala centre before being taken to Mbera camp, which is hosting more than 54,000 refugees from previous displacements last year.

Meanwhile, in UNHCR's Niamey office, opened in February last year a month after the crisis in Mali erupted when Mali government soldiers fought with Tuareg rebels, the refugee agency has been working to assure adequate assistance and protection in Niger, despite many challenges, including insecurity, drought and food shortages.

The border areas, which have received most of the refugees from Mali, are under-developed and are difficult to reach. Logistical constraints are compounded by poor infrastructure and the harsh climatic conditions, which include flooding during the rainy season. ""The sustainability of an operation like this is always a challenge for UNHCR. We need to make sure that there are enough resources to meet all the needs,"" stressed Steinacker. This includes funding: UNHCR appealed last year for US$123.7 million for its Mali crisis operations, but has received only about 60 per cent to date.

Steinacker said that UNHCR and the authorities had also been conducting a more comprehensive registration of all refugees in Niger. Once this is completed, some of the estimated 50,000 Malian refugees in Niger will be relocated away from the dangerous border areas. It will also provide better and more reliable data on needs.

Inside Mali, population movements remain very fluid while lack of access to the rebel-controlled north makes it difficult for humanitarian agencies to update displacement figures. As of Tuesday, the Commission on Population Movements reported that almost 230,000 people had been forcibly displaced in Mali since early 2012. There are also an estimated 144,500 Malian refugees in the region, including 54,000 in Mauritania, 50,000 in Niger, 38,800 in Burkina Faso and 1,500 in Algeria. Small groups are also in Guinea and Togo.

Many of the IDPs in Mali have sought shelter in urban areas like Bamako, but life is tough. Like many IDPs, 40-year-old Oulamine is struggling to make ends meet. He fled from the Timbuktu region several weeks ago with his wife and three children and reached the town of Mpoti after travelling for 10 days by canoe on the Niger River. They then rented a car to reach Bamako. He pays the equivalent of US$60 a month to rent a room in the capital and says, ""I will not be able to afford this for long."" He also has to pay for electricity while the family has no access to running water. ""Medicine and food for the family is also expensive,"" he said.

Human rights groups warn of the 'deadly risks' facing migrant workers

Workers lured by wealthy families but face abuse and exploitation

Migrants get little legal protection, with no access to lawyers or embassies

'Justice system is characterised by arbitrary arrests and unfair trials'

Foreign workers are being warned of the 'deadly risks' they face in Saudi Arabia, with more than 45 maids awaiting execution despite growing anger at the country's mistreatment of migrants.

The death row prisoners include a domestic worker convicted of beating her employer to death when he allegedly tried to rape her.

On Wednesday, authorities in the Middle Eastern country ignored international pleas and beheaded maid Rizana Nafeek, 24, who was convicted of killing a baby despite protesting her innocence.

Human rights groups believe Indonesians account for the majority of the maids on death row and that there are Sri Lankans, Filipinos, Indians and Ethiopians also facing execution.

Campaigners say many of Saudi Arabia's 1.5 million migrant workers, around 375,000 of whom are Sri Lankan, are attracted to the country by the prospect of working for wealthy families but face exploitation and abuse.

This can range from months of hard work without pay to physical violence, in a country where legal protections are particularly weak, and access to lawyers, translators and embassies is often blocked.

Human Rights Watch's Nisha Varia told The Observer: 'The Saudi justice system is characterised by arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments. A domestic worker facing abuse or exploitation from her employer might run away and then be accused of theft.



Executed: Sri Lankan maid Rizana Nafeek was beheaded despite international appeals for her release

'Employers may accuse domestic workers, especially those from Indonesia, of witchcraft. Victims of rape and sexual assault are at risk of being accused of adultery and fornication.'

Human rights group say 69 people were executed in Saudi Arabia last year and 79 the year before, including five women, one of whom was beheaded for witchcraft and sorcery.

MISTREATMENT OF MAIDS

Saudi Arabia is notorious for its treatment of domestic staff, the majority of who migrate from poverty-stricken countries. Commentators have remarked that Saudis treat staff as if they were part of the furniture - with stories of beatings, rape and imprisonment all too common. In 2010, shocking photographs emerged of maid Sumiati Binti Salan Mustapa, 23, who suffered severe injuries from being stabbed, burned and beaten.

Her employer was sentenced to just three years in jail but was later acquitted altogether, in a case that outraged human rights groups. Speaking at the time, Wahyu Susilo of the Indonesian advocacy group, Migrant Care, said: 'Again and again we hear about slavery-like conditions, torture, sexual abuse and even death. 'But our government has chosen to ignore it. Why? Because migrant workers generate £4.7billion in foreign exchange every

Amnesty International Saudi Arabia researcher Dina el-Mamoun said there is growing alarm at the number of migrant workers being sentenced to death, with more than 120 foriegn nationals known to be on death row.

She said migrant workers in Saudi Arabia are at great risk if they end up in the criminal justice system and added countries should be advising their residents of the 'very real and deadly' risks.



Ms Mamoun said: 'In many cases they're subjected to whole trials where they can't understand the proceedings, which are conducted solely in Arabic, and without translation. They are often not given access to consular assistance.'

Death row prisoner Tuti Tursilawati binti Warjuki, 27, from Indonesia, faces execution for murdering her employer in 2010 when he allegedly attempted to rape her.

Her supporters say she was abused by the man since arriving in the country a year earlier and was denied legal representation for the first two months of her trial.

Siti Zainab, also from Indonesia, has also been sentenced to death after being convicted in 1999 of stabbing her female employer to death.

She confessed to the murder but the authorities appear to have dismissed concerns over her mental health.

Prisoner Satinah binti Jumadi Ahmad, 40, was arrested in 2007 for killing her female employer. The Indonesian government is prepared to pay some of the £1.6m blood money demanded by the woman's family to save her.

Reports of what happened vary from her fighting back after being attacked to the maid having snapped after suffering months of abuse before being accused of stealing.

The Sri Lankan government has spoken out against the execution of house maid Rizana Nafeek, from, Sri Lanka, after she was beheaded in public by a sword last week.



Miss Nafeek was sentenced to death in 2007 after her Saudi employer accused her of strangling his four-month-old baby two years earlier after a dispute with the child's mother.

Death by beheading has always been a source of tension between Saudi Arabia (capital Riyadh pictured) and the international community

Her family and human rights groups repeatedly appealed to King Abdullah to pardon Miss Nafeek, who protested her innocence and said the baby had choked to death while being bottle fed.

Supporters said the age on the passport she used to enter the country in 2005 was changed so she could get work and that according to her birth certificate she was just 17 when the baby died.

Miss Nafeek said her original confession was made under duress and there translation services were not made available to her. Amnesty said she had no access to lawyers either during her pre-trial interrogation or at her 2007 trial.","Sun, 13 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/01/13/article-2261655-16E9246E000005DC-763_1024x615_large.jpg,"['scores', 'crimes', 'penalty', 'sri', 'killing', 'maids', 'employer', 'sentenced', 'facing', 'murder', 'workers', 'saudi', 'nafeek', 'rights', 'employers', 'arabia', 'death', 'migrant']",

Artist mixes toy figures with fish in surreal underwater scenes

Underwater photographer Jason Isley decided to have a bit of fun

Jules Verne might have written the classic 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, but now one British photographer has created his own hilarious version of what a life beneath the waves might entail.



Underwater photographer, Jason Isley, 42, originally from Essex, decided to have a bit of fun for a change with some of the smaller colourful reef fish in Borneo and Indonesia.

So he got a selection of toy human figures from soldiers to sunbathers and photographed them in a set of hilarious scenes as they interacted with the fish and other sea creatures.

It's behind you! A tiny hermit crab becomes a terrifying monster in another of photographer Jason's fantastic underwater scenarios

Toxic Eggs: A team of miniature workers don protective gear to investigate some weird and wonderful-looking cuttlefish eggs

Jason felt underwater macro (close-up) photography was beginning to become cliched and thought he would create his underwater scenarios to amuse but also give a different perspective of the seabed.

Some of the tiny figures are pictured dressed in protective gear as they investigate all manner of curious crustacean and peculiar-looking anemone.

And a troop of toy soldiers take up arms against a variety of threats including a creepy-looking Bobbit Worm and a blue ring octopus.

Others figures are seen relaxing on sunloungers as a variety of unusual sea creatures lurk nearby.



Jason said: 'Most of the scenes are shot on sand and the figures have either nails or coins glued to their feet. This prevents the current and surge taking them away, not to mention the fish grabbing them a few times.

'I wanted to take them underwater and shoot them with living subjects that would create a really surreal scene.

'I have been working on the project for almost a year but each image usually take an entire dive which could be anything between 50 to 90 minutes depending on the depth.

'The reaction has been great, people that dive instantly recognise the subjects and understand the meaning, other people are amazed when they learn the shots were taken underwater with living subjects.'

In March 2012, his personal wealth was estimated by Forbes to be $18bn (£11bn), placing him 29th on its list of the world's billionaires list.

As of January 2013, the 57-year-old -who is a nephew of Saudi Arabia's king - is listed as the 12th-richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $28.7bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The prince has a wide range of business interests and has stakes in some of the world's top companies such as Citigroup, Apple, Disney, News Corporation and Twitter as well as other technology and media companies.

Prince Al-Waleed is News Corporation's second biggest shareholder after Rupert Murdoch, owning 7 percent.

In December 2011, Al-Waleed made a $300m (£193m) investment in Twitter, securing him a stake estimated at 3.75% after ""months of negotiations, according to the Guardian.

The timing of his investment was questioned because to the key role Twitter played during the Arab Spring as a tool to help activists organise protests.

Some also tweeted fears that Al-Waleed's purchase could negatively influence the micro-blogging site's strategy.

At the time, the prince said: ""Our investment in Twitter reaffirms our ability in identifying suitable opportunities to invest in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact"".

The prince's wife, Princess Ameerah al-Taweel, is a keen Twitter user and has more than 580,000 followers on the site.

In the mid-1990s, Al-Waleed and Michael Jackson launched Kingdom Entertainment, a joint venture to develop movies, book and theme parks based on ""family values"".

However, this project was not as successful as hoped.

(Phys.org)—A new way of studying and visualizing Earth science data from a NASA and U.S. Geological Survey satellite program is resulting in, for the first time, the ability to tease out the small events that can cause big changes in an ecosystem.

Called LandTrendr, this computer program is able to find patterns previously buried within vast amounts of scientific data. Still in development, it's already led to seeing for the first time in satellite imagery an obscured, slow-moving decline and recovery of trees in Pacific Northwest forests.

Comparing satellite data to ground data, scientists uncovered the cause. ""It was, as it turns out, bugs,"" says Robert Kennedy, a remote sensing specialist at Boston University, who consulted with U.S. Forest Service experts to confirm his observations.

The unexpected disturbance pattern showed a long slow decline of tree health over years followed by slow regrowth. It emerged in several areas, particularly near Mount Hood in the 1980s, peaking in 1992 when regrowth began, and near Mount Rainier where the insect outbreak lasted ten years from its onset in 1994 till the insects killed all the trees and moved on in 2004.

Kennedy created the LandTrendr program specifically to work with data from the NASA and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat program. Kennedy's new way of viewing Landsat imagery has already changed how the Forest Service in the Pacific Northwest operates its yearly forest monitoring program that uses ground stations, satellite imagery and statistics to evaluate current conditions.

Kennedy says that LandTrendr works because of the unique nature of Landsat data. The data embedded in images are a scientific record of the Earth's surface that goes back 40 years. Each image, or scene, covers an area 115 miles by 112 miles (185 kilometers by 180 kilometers) and provides data for wavelengths of light reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface, which scientists use to see, for example, forest conditions not apparent in visible light. With the four-decade record, they can compare images between years and see how the land changes with time.

Studying big areas over many years means handling big data sets and figuring out how to get all the data to work together for meaningful comparisons. One challenge in particular is finding images from the same time of year where the view of the ground is not hidden by clouds.

Kennedy's breakthrough was to combine cloud-free pixels from multiple scenes of the same area collected over the growing season in late summer. Then he compares the new images for each year to one another. By breaking a scene down into smaller sized pixels, the cloud-covered portions could be tossed away, but LandTrendr keeps the clean bits to reveal the life history of each pixel.

""We're getting better data use out of what people think of as crummier images,"" says Curtis Woodcock, a remote sensing specialist at Boston University who employs a similar method to Kennedy to build an image of the landscape out of Landsat data pixel by pixel.

What makes all this possible are two things: Computers are finally powerful enough to process vast amounts of data, and Landsat data is now available free of charge.

The Landsat program has been observing Earth's land surfaces consistently since 1972, when the first Landsat satellite, what became known as Landsat 1, went into orbit. Since then, it has compiled the longest continuous satellite record of change across our planet. But a left over pay-for-data policy from the commercialization of the program in the 1980s and 90s meant scientists rarely looked at the year-by-year evolution of a landscape. When the USGS began providing Landsat data for no charge in 2008, looking at twenty-five years or more of data became affordable as long as you had the computing power to handle it.

""Not that long ago the size of an individual Landsat scene would have crippled most desk top computers,"" says Doug Morton, a physical scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md., who uses Landsat to study changes in the Amazon and forests in Indonesia. Now with processing power doubled or more, he says, it's no problem for most desktop machines to handle a big scientific job.

When Kennedy first saw a yearly succession of moderate resolution Landsat satellite images of a 13,000 square mile area near Portland, Ore., it was a revelation. Says Kennedy, it was like looking at a pair of air photos of a forested hillside offset so that with special glasses, the image pops into three dimensional clarity. ""You sort of squint your eyes and it takes a while and all of a sudden you get that moment—boom! Oh, my god, it's a landscape!"" he says. ""I had that same sense [of amazement ] when I first started looking at the time series stuff.""

The ability to scroll backward and forward through time and Kennedy's new technique for creating single visualizations out of millions of bits of data from hundreds of Landsat images has revealed not just the patchwork of fire scars and clear cuts—what he was originally looking for when he partnered with the Forest Service—but also the slow and subtle changes that take place over many years, including pulses of insect outbreaks.

""We did not expect that,"" says Kennedy. In the satellite imagery they had found two kinds of insect signals. The first is a classic mountain pine beetle outbreak. One near the Three Sisters volcanoes in Oregon started in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The beetles attacked lodge pole pines, the same species affected in outbreaks throughout British Columbia and Colorado.

The second, subtler signal found near Mount Hood and Mount Rainier is the western spruce budworm, an insect that moves into an area and eats the needles off the trees. Losing its green growth doesn't necessarily kill the tree, but it does put it under a lot of stress. If budworms return in following years, trees will ultimately succumb to the onslaught and die. Then the budworms, out of food, move on. And the forest gradually recovers.

Kennedy says to confirm the satellite data, they hiked into areas with recent known budworm outbreaks near Mount Rainier. With the decline and regrowth patterns from the new maps in hand, Kennedy says, ""we stand out on the ground in the forest and look at all the dead trees and we realize that we're actually starting to see something that we had never been able to see before from space. It was very exciting.""

The imagery produced by LandTrendr is a remarkable tool for looking at change over time, says Woodcock. But what he really wants to see is a move from the retrospective to the real time. He says, ""The goal in the long run is to be able to provide land managers information on what's happening as it's happening."" It's a process, he says, that's just getting started.

""That ability to read the story of the landscape is something that the Landsat archive allows us to do like none other,"" says Doug Morton of NASA Goddard. NASA and the USGS will continue providing the means to see it with the next satellite in the Landsat series, to be called Landsat 8, scheduled to launch in early 2013.

China.org.cn provides a minute-by-minute coverage of the game.

All time is Beijng time. [GMT+0800]

———————————————————————

[12:16pm:] Li Na 6-2,6-2 Maria Sharapova

Match point for Li Na.

Long serve first up.

Then she goes for a big forehand winner down the line, and just misses. Deuce.

Li Na follows up with a swinging wide ACE!

Second match point.

Fault.

Sharapova nets the backhand return, and Li Na is through to the final of the Australian Open.

Li Na is into her second Australian Open final. She thanks the crowd, who clearly have taken her to heart, saying she always plays well in Melbourne. Discussing her tough preparation in the off-season, she says “I know I have a very tough coach… you don’t need to push me any harder!”

[12:09pm:] Li Na 6-2, 5-2 Maria Sharapova

Sharapova is on the ropes, 0-30 down and at Li Na’s mercy during a rally, bu she pokes a forehand she should have slammed, and the Russian recovers the point and fights back to 40-30.

But the Chinese woman tenaciously chases and chases on game point, and lasts long enough for the mistake to come from Sharapova, who hits a simple forehand wide. Deuce, almost a given on Sharapova’s service in this match.

Once again, Li Na outlasts Sharapova, who hits wide on her backhand, and the end is nigh, with Li Na two breaks up and serving for the match.

[12:04pm:] Li Na 6-2,4-2 Maria Sharapova

No time to waste for Sharapova, down a set and a break, and she gives up any pretence of nuance and goes for it, slamming her groundstrokes with more vigour than ever. It gets a her a break-back point, but she misses an ambitious drive down the line.

A big, wide first serve helps Li Na closer to safety. Then another, down the middle, helps her escape a tough game.

[11:57am:] Li Na 6-2,3-2 Maria Sharapova

A double-fault delivers a second opportunity for Li Na, and she is soon up a set and a break when Sharapova hits a backhand long. Any rally over four shots is death for the Russian in this match.

[11:50am:] Li Na 6-2, 2-2 Maria Sharapova

Li Na resists the challenge from Sharapova for another game, her service standing up to the Rusian’s change of pace on her returns.

[11:45am:] Li Na 6-2, 1-2 Maria Sharapova

Sharapova might be coming to grips with some of Li Na’s strengths. That was her second comfortable service game in a row, after all but one were tests of stamina in the first set.

[11:42am:] Li Na 6-2, 1-1 Maria Sharapova

Sharapova re-doubles her attack on he Li Na service, improving her response to second serves, and creates two break points. But her groundstrokes let her down on the big points, and Li fights back to hold her serve.

[11:35am:] Li Na 6-2, 0-1 Maria Sharapova

Finally, another comfortable game for Sharapova on service, after Li Na muffed an easy put-away on the first point of the second set. The Russian mixed her serve up more, sending it to the backhand a little more after being predictable in the first set.

[11:31am:] Li Na 6-2 Maria Sharapova

A comfortable service game for Li Na, who is not dependent on her first serve – she has won 77% of points on her second serve.

[11:21am:] Li Na 4-2 Sharapova

Sharapova, still a break down, has pushed the Li’s serve to deuce twice, and broken once – there isn’t much in this game. The Russian is being forced well behind the baseline for most of her groundtsrokes. Li Na’s power, accuracy and depth dictating rallies.

[11:06am] Li Na 4-1 Maria Sharapova

Li Na runs Sharapova around off a weak second serve, and belts a double-fisted backhand down the backhand line for a clean winner. Two breaks, and a dominant start, for the Chinese star.

Li Na, 30, the sixth seed, is 13-1 in 2013, and has won seven career titles. She is 4-8 against Sharapova, who beat her at all three of their meetings in 2012.

[11:01am:] Li Na 3-1 Maria Sharapova

Convincing love service game now from Li. Both teams have had a shaky game and a dominating game on service, but Li managed to convert her break point opportunity, and she has been the more impressive of the two players so far. Her groundstrokes are feeding off Sharapova’s slamming style.

Sharapova, 25, the second seed, is 5-0 in 2013, having missed lead-up tournaments because of injury. She has won 27 carer titles, over $25 million, and could be world number one depending on the results of these semi-finals.

[10:53am:] Li Na 2-1 Maria Sharapova

Li Na faces a break point in her opening service game, but fights it off to get to deuce. These two are approaching this match with due gravity, as if expecting a long battle.

[10:43am:] Li Na 2-1 Maria Sharapova

Shaky start from the always intense Sharapova, a double-fault leaving her at 0-30 in the opening game. She fights back to 40-30, but Li Na’s deep return wins her a point and we’re at deuce. Li Na keeps the pressure on, and a mishit gives her a break point. She out-rallies Sharapova to take the opening game.

[10:32am:] The combatants are making the ritualistic march along the corridors snaking beneath centre court, the introductions from the announcer becoming audible as they move past the large pictures of former champions.

Down the steps, into the bright light, and out on to centre court, to loud, startling voiceovers and applause.","Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",http://live.china.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/favicon.ico,"['updates', 'major', 'break', 'game', 'open', 'serve', 'semifinal', 'maria', 'point', 'li', 'events', 'live', 'second', 'vs', 'sharapova', 'service', 'backhand']",
