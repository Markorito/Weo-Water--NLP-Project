0,0,FL-2018-000050-CHN,A brave new world: Xi’s Xiong’an - Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/a-brave-new-world-xis-xiongan/,"President Xi has played a pivotal role in launching the Xiong’an New Area. Just as Shenzhen and Pudong are considered gems of the Deng era, Xi aspires to see his name associated with a new urban miracle, write Cheng Li and Gary Xie. However, the ambitious project will need to address key issues in urban planning, socioeconomic considerations, and ecological vulnerabilities. A successful Xiong’an may profoundly change China’s geo-economic landscape, contributing to a rebalancing of Chinese economic development. This piece originally appeared in China-US Focus .

On April 1, 2017, President Xi Jinping surprised both the Chinese public and China watchers overseas by designating three counties in Hebei Province as the “Xiong’an New Area.” In doing so, Xiong’an—a combination of the Chinese characters for “brave” and “peace”—joined economic powerhouses like Shenzhen and Shanghai’s Pudong on a shortlist of areas the Chinese central government has designated for special development throughout the past forty years.

Located about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, Xiong’an will house some of the institutions and companies currently struggling to find space in the crowded capital. According to a 2017 study by Morgan Stanley, Xiong’an will draw in as much as ¥2.4 trillion ($380 billion) in investment, or thirteen times what China spent on the construction of the Three Gorges Dam.

The development of Xiong’an is critically important as China goes through a transition period. This new area aims to be innovative, helping China shift to high value-added industries and escape the “middle-income trap.” Northern China has long been the equivalent of America’s Rust Belt. Seven of China’s 10 most polluted cities are located nearby in Hebei Province. Xiong’an can offer an alternative path for both northern China and the nation as a whole.

President Xi has played a pivotal role in launching the Xiong’an New Area. Just as Shenzhen and Pudong are considered gems of the Deng era, Xi aspires to see his name associated with a new urban miracle. Good news from Xiong’an might directly enhance Xi’s personal prestige as a “farsighted planner.” Therefore, Xiong’an may serve as a very public gauge of the efficacy of the Xi administration’s policies.

In order to fully understand the significance of Xiong’an, it is important to review the chronology of announcements by the Chinese leadership. The April 2017 announcement referred to Xiong’an as signaling a “strategy for a new millennium” and a “demo area” for a sustainable, modern, and innovative urban model. Two weeks later, Xinhua News Agency declared that Xiong’an would aim to alleviate the disparities in China’s regional development. Xiong’an is also expected to help accelerate the development of the wider Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (jingjinji, 京津冀) area, which is intended to be the northern version of regional powerhouses driving China’s economy, akin to the Pearl River Delta in the south and the Yangtze River Delta in the east.

In June 2017, Xi Jinping chaired a Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) meeting on Beijing’s urban planning. He stated that while Beijing should remain the center of national politics, culture, international exchange, and scientific innovation, all other “non-capital functions” should be moved elsewhere, to other regional locales like Xiong’an. Meanwhile, Xi has promoted a number of experienced officials to the region. Notably, Xu Qin, mayor of Shenzhen from 2010 to 2017, was “parachuted in” (空降) as the new governor of Hebei. Chen Gang, a technocrat who oversaw Beijing’s high-tech industries, became the first head of the Xiong’an New Area.

At a meeting on February 23, 2018, the PSC emphasized the importance of technological innovation for Xiong’an. In line with this plan, China signed a deal with the United Kingdom worth $11.4 billion to build a financial innovation hub at Xiong’an following Prime Minister Theresa May’s visit to China in February 2018. China’s top three technology companies—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent—also announced their decisions to establish branches in Xiong’an.

Although the party leadership’s sudden announcement about Xiong’an surprised the Chinese public, the thinking behind this new urbanization drive is in fact not all that shocking. For years, residents and visitors have complained about severe congestion in Beijing. In looking to the surrounding region to alleviate Beijing’s overcrowding, China’s leaders are following the lead of other heavily populated metropoles around the world, which have reduced the burdens of traffic, pollution, and soaring real-estate prices by forming urban clusters or “city groups.” Based on this concept, Beijing will move many of its functions to Xiong’an, relocating universities, hospitals, companies, banks, and business headquarters.

High-tech enterprises and innovation hubs in Zhongguancun, one of China’s foremost innovation centers, will also move to Xiong’an. In addition, Xiong’an is supposed to feature large green spaces and narrower streets, creating a more resident-friendly urban landscape than Beijing’s grand multi-lane boulevards. This will challenge the Chinese urbanization model over the past few decades, which is based on economic utility at the expense of livability and aesthetics. This showcase of China’s new urbanization model can be used to enhance Chinese influence abroad.

According to official announcements, one key difference between Xiong’an and the other special economic areas like Shenzhen and Pudong is a ban on real estate trading. All housing in Xiong’an will be state-owned and provided to authorized workers and employees at subsidized rates. This is intended to lower living costs and to prevent a wave of housing speculation. Likewise, according to official media, Xiong’an will host only technology innovation firms. Factories with high carbon emissions will be banned or highly restricted. Though construction in the area only started in September 2017, reports indicate that the authorities have already shut down over 5,200 companies for pollution violations.

It is far from clear how the authorities plan to implement and sustain these policies, which perhaps more closely resemble old-fashioned central planning than market-oriented development. Some plans for Xiong’an appear very ambitious. For example, when Baidu tested its self-driving cars in Xiong’an in December 2017, many media outlets even claimed that this new city would be free of traffic lights and traffic jams. Instead, traffic would be regulated by artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.

It is worthwhile to highlight a few key socioeconomic and ecological issues related to the project. The first is regarding Xiong’an’s population size. The Chinese Academy of Engineering estimates that the target population for Xiong’an is 2 to 3 million residents. However, given the publicity around Xiong’an, how will the government satisfy the desires of all the citizens eager to partake in the “Xiong’an Dream?” Providing high-quality social services for potentially millions of newcomers in this “model city” presents a great challenge and an ambitious experiment in urbanization.

The second issue concerns Xiong’an’s location and its vulnerability to extreme weather. Xiong’an is situated in a low-lying marshland. Baiyangdian, the lake that borders Xiong’an, could prove to be a major liability. In 1963, heavy rainfall created the largest flood in modern Chinese history; according to the local Land and Resources Bureau, the disaster killed 340,000 in the Xiong’an region alone. The cost of preventing major floods in this marshland could be astonishingly high. If that were not enough, the 1980s witnessed the opposite extreme, with a drought that almost completely evaporated the lake. In 2015, the Chinese government approved a mega waterworks project connecting Baiyangdian with the Yellow River to address water problems. However, Xiong’an may remain vulnerable to extreme weather.

Finally, the government has exerted strong state influence over the market. However, technological innovation—the city’s target industry—could falter in the face of excessive and rigid regulations. If the government continues to dominate the process of resource allocation, it will distort the market and stifle incentives for innovation. The government also needs to be more transparent in order to attract investors. Erecting an entirely new city is enormously expensive—even for China. Some Chinese critics have compared Xiong’an to the Great Leap Forward, an ambitious and “modernistic” mega-project undertaken in Mao’s China.

Without a doubt, Xiong’an is crucial for Xi’s “new era” ­–– and for his legacy. The success or failure of Xiong’an could affect his new vision for China’s development. A successful Xiong’an may profoundly change China’s geo-economic landscape, contributing to a rebalancing of Chinese economic development. As both a symbol of and a challenge to China’s ongoing economic transformation, Xiong’an deserves careful attention in the years to come.","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rts1ow7i.jpg,"['chinese', '2017', 'china', 'innovation', 'brave', 'xiongan', 'development', 'urban', 'area', 'xis', 'world', 'xi', 'chinas']", 
1,1,FL-2018-000050-CHN,China Is Building a Massive Network of Chemical Rainmakers - Popular Mechanics,https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a19822232/china-is-building-a-massive-network-of-chemical-rainmakers/,"China wants to manufacture 10 billion tons of rainfall on the Tibetan Plateau by building tens of thousands of chemical furnaces. The rainmakers, developed by China's Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, will burn chemical fuel to release silver iodide into the air. The silver iodide will allow water vapor to condense, forming clouds that will draw rain.

Hundreds of burners have already been set up in Tibet, a major water source for the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong and other rivers through China and Asia. A single cloud-seeding chamber could bring enough clouds and rainfall to cover a five-kilometer area, according to the South China Morning Post.

China hopes to bring rainfall and snow to an area of over 1.6 million square kilometers (about three time the size of Spain). The furnaces were originally developed as a part of a Chinese military program to use weather modification for defense.

Some researchers question the safety of the rain system: releasing silver iodide at ground level can potentially cause health issues for workers in the area. And forcing rainfall over a specific area could mean unpredicted consequences for other areas: “If you’re making it rain where it wouldn’t otherwise, you’re taking water out of the air that would have rained elsewhere,"" Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University’s engineering school told Quartz.



Still, researchers working on the rainmakers marvel at their efficiency. “Sometimes snow would start falling almost immediately after we ignited the chamber. It was like standing on the stage of a magic show,"" a Chinese researcher said.

3,3,FL-2018-000050-CHN,OPINION: China Not to Blame for US Opioid Epidemic - The News Lens 關鍵評論網,https://international.thenewslens.com/article/93845,"When something bad happens, we tend to blame others before we look at ourselves. It makes us feel better.

Thus, the United States’ opioid epidemic is not the fault of people taking pain medicine to feel better; the doctors or pill mills that prescribed them; drug companies selling medicines for huge profits; the lobbyists and politicians who helped them do so; or a long-term depressed economy in America’s “heartland.”

Nope, it’s China, which is waging an underhand “Opioid War” against the West.

“The worst drug crisis in American history,” according to U.S. President Donald Trump, is essentially a cunning plot to undermine the country from within. Proof of this, he says, is that China manufactures the “flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl” pouring into the U.S.

That China produces fentanyl, a rapid onset opioid, is not in question. Despite a hardline policy against drugs and no significant domestic, synthetic opioid addiction problem, it has been estimated there are 30,000 companies that produce the drug. For at least a decade now, the synthetic cannabinoid Spice and opioid derivatives have been freely bought from China and sent to the West.

But should we blame the Chinese for Western recreational drug use? As a friend in Beijing says, “If Trump’s appeal stands, it would be legitimate for China to blame the U.S. for fast food production because more Chinese people are getting overweight and obese.”

The Chinese authorities deny they are responsible for this flood of illegal drugs to the West, but even so have agreed to work with the U.S. to stem the tide. They have already banned at least 23 analogues of fentanyl, but as in the case of Spice it is relatively easy for chemists to slightly change the formula and legally circumvent bans.

AP / 達志影像 The synthetic cannabinoid 'Spice' is just one of many legal narcotics exported from China to the United States.

China is a source of illegal opioids, but not the only one. Supply, after all, meets demand and the principal supplier is undeniably U.S. big pharma. Fentanyl was developed by a chemist from Belgium, but it was only after his company was bought by Johnson & Johnson that sales people were sent out to offer doctors deals and make it a prescription favorite.

The best-selling 21st century opioid, OxyContin, is produced by Purdue. The company is owned by the Sacklers, which has become one of the United States' richest families on the back of selling the drug and making false marketing claims about it.

Codeine was first discovered in 1832 but is now a popular addition to fizzy drinks called drank, lean or sizzurp. It’s an opioid that is being abused throughout America and is celebrated by rappers, even as they die from it – like Big Moe in 2007 and Fredo Santana in early 2018. No one knows how Lil Wayne is still standing, though long may he live. Codeine is produced worldwide but it’s American companies that provide it.

None of the above has stopped Trump or ideologues like the author Stephen W Mosher from blaming China. Because this is what they do … a bit like the manager of a losing soccer team, they blame the referee and decisions that went against them, or claim the victorious side played dirty or were lucky.

Which brings us to Mosher’s latest tome, titled ""Bully of Asia: Why China’s Dream is the New Threat to World Order."" The former lieutenant in the U.S. navy earned both fame and notoriety for his study of forced abortions in China. Married to a Taiwanese woman for six years in the early ‘80s, he now lives in the U.S.

Essentially, the book is the latest in a long line of works from Mosher warning that China invented totalitarianism and desires worldwide hegemony. In it he claims China is manufacturing synthetic opioids and deliberately exporting them around the world to undermine democracy, free trade and the rule of law – as embodied by America.

Presumably, Mosher and possibly Trump are aware of the Opium War, and how Britain’s Honorable East India Company, supported by the U.S. and other members of a 19th century “coalition of the willing,” forced opium on the Chinese by putting a gun to their heads. They did so by insisting on the principle of free trade and individual rights.

This effectively bankrupted the nation and contributed to making China the “sick man of Asia.” It directly led to the sacking of the Summer Palace in 1860, an ill-judged act that has been used by the Communist Party as a motivational tool to spur economic progress and military strength. As pointed out in a China Daily article on historian and Opium War book author Julia Lovell, “The Opium War still leaves a lasting mark and casts a shadow on China even today.”

第二次鴉片戰爭聯軍攻佔廣州， Public Domain The British East India Company forced opium onto the Chinese market as a way to recoup a growing trade deficit.

“If you talk to many Chinese about the Opium War, a phrase you will quickly hear is ""luo hou jiu yao ai da"" (落後就要挨打), which literally means that if you are backward you will take a beating,” Lovell is quoted as saying.

What this means is that at some point China took responsibility for its situation and did something about it, making a positive of a negative. Even if it still holds a grudge against Britain and the rest for pillaging its Summer Palace and creating a mass opium addiction, it made this tragedy into a rallying call for growth.

Equating the Opium War with the Opioid War would be convenient because it is easy to read as a reversal of history, as karma, or justice. But I have never heard of such a sentiment in China, even though it would be understandable.

In contrast, the U.S. cannot realistically claim China is forcing poor Midwesterners to buy fentanyl. It may be one source of “cheap and deadly fentanyl” but there are no guns at the heads of Americans forcing them to take it – and there’s plenty of homegrown substitutes available as well. Blaming China or any other country is essentially dumping the problem on someone else, meaning no solution to such a devastating epidemic is likely.

It is surely better to look for a reason for the opioid crisis closer to home, rather than half way round the world. Maybe there isn’t a “pill for every ill.” A system that financially rewards dispensing huge amounts of drugs to cure pain or sickness is clearly not healthy. A population raised on drugs, like Ritalin for “overactive” behavior at school, is not a positive educational model.

Reuters / 達志影像 Deaths from overdose are a grim everyday reality across the United States.

Finally, if Trump wants to revive the long-discredited War on Drugs and execute drug dealers like his pal Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, it would be another step backwards. After all, do executions really make a country great?

If you want to change you have to take responsibility. Maybe, on this occasion, the U.S. could learn from others instead of blaming them.

4,4,FL-2018-000050-CHN,China Announces New Rules For Foreign Car Manufacturers. Is That Good News For Tesla? - CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2018/04/18/china-announces-new-rules-for-foreign-car-manufacturers-is-that-good-news-for-tesla/,"China is the world’s most populous country — 1.39 billion people and counting. That means it has more people who want to buy things than anyone else. Companies from all over the world have been flocking to China to sell stuff there ever since President Richard Nixon pried open the door to doing business there in 1972. What company wouldn’t want to be part of the biggest market in history?

The 50-50 Rule

The Chinese government saw its nascent manufacturing sector being inundated beneath a flood of outside companies, so it required those foreign corporations to partner with a local company. The 50-50 rule, as it came to be called, meant foreign companies would have to share some of their manufacturing expertise with local Chinese companies, rather than just setting up shop in China and dominating Chinese manufacturing.

Most of those foreign companies bit the bullet and played ball according to the Chinese rules. Today, companies like Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Jeep, Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai are working with local partners and finding their sales in China are a significant proportion of their total global sales. They fuss and complain about having to share their knowledge with those partners but they do it because the Chinese new car market is so huge — about 30 million cars a year — it can’t be ignored.

This week, the Chinese government announced that it will eliminate the 50-50 rule for manufacturers who manufacture new energy vehicles — defined as battery electric or plug-in hybrid cars — in China by the end of this year. For companies making commercial vehicles, the rule will expire in 2020 and will disappear completely by 2022.

Is This Good News For Tesla?

That should be wonderful news for Tesla, which has been negotiating with officials in Shanghai for over a year for permission to build a factory in the free trade zone outside that city, right? Several industry analysts have asked that question and come up with different answers. Bloomberg notes that building cars in China is just one piece of a highly complex puzzle. After making them, a company has to sell them. China offers incentives of up to $8,000 on new energy vehicles with longer range batteries. Bloomberg thinks foreign companies may still need a local partner in order for its cars to be eligible for those incentives.

Bloomberg goes on to say that Tesla found out recently how important incentives are to success in foreign markets. Once Hong Kong removed its electric car incentives, sales of Tesla automobiles plunged. China also introduced a new system of credits last year that requires all manufacturers to produce a certain number of electric or plug-in cars. The system is designed to encourage cooperation among manufacturers.

The subtext to all this is the ongoing war of words between Beijing and Washington over trade. China has dangled the possibility of increasing its import tariff on foreign made cars to 50%, a penalty Tesla might be able to avoid if it decides to work with a local partner.

Sticking With The Status Quo

Most of the major car companies say they are satisfied with the local partnerships they have forged and do not see ripping up those relationships to build wholly owned factories of their own. BMW, for instance, tells Reuters, “We believe a more free and flexible business environment will benefit both Chinese and foreign companies in China and the Chinese economy. BMW will continue pursuing mutual benefit and win-win solutions with the local partners.” It adds it intends to expand a joint venture with Chinese company BBA and is exploring a new partnership with Great Wall Motors to build MINI branded vehicles in China.

A Volkswagen spokesperson tells Reuters, “We will carefully analyze whether this opens up new opportunities for Volkswagen and its brands.” Daimler says it is happy with its current business arrangements in China and is watching regulatory developments there with interest. An anonymous source at General Motors claimed the company will not sever its relationship with SAIC Motors and that GM would not be successful in China on its own. In a statement, GM said its growth in China was “a result of working with our trusted joint venture partners. We will continue to work with our partners to provide high-quality products and services to consumers.”

Honda also says its business in China has grown significantly because of its relationship with its local partners. “At the moment we have no plans to change our capital relationship,” a spokesman said. James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief at consultancy IHS Markit, tells Reuters, “Foreign companies may already be in a box (in China). While getting a bigger share could be advantageous in terms of boosting profits, they may actually be already too dependent on their Chinese partners to sever those ties.”

Time To Move On?

Donald Trump, of course, will take all the credit for forcing China to knuckle under to US demands because of his superior deal making skills. But it is unlikely this new course for China happened overnight. Shanjun Li, a professor of economics and policy at Cornell University, tells The Verge that China has gotten what it wanted from the joint venture policy — a stable domestic auto manufacturing base that can thrive without foreign partners. “Chinese domestic automakers have improved dramatically in their technology know-how during the past decades,” he says. “They are in a better position than ever to compete directly with international rivals for the domestic and international markets.”

In a related development, China will also remove joint venture rules in the shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing sectors this year. YiCai Global reports that China’s National Development and Reform Commission now says on its website, “China’s full opening of the manufacturing industry is a clear indication of our opposition to trade and investment protectionism, and shows our strong support to widening and deepening the development of economic globalization.”

Be Careful What You Wish For

While all that is happening on the surface, an article in the New York Times on April 13 warns that the communist party is taking a more active role in many areas of Chinese life, including manufacturing. At the 5-year meeting of the party last year, president Xi Jinping called on party officials to strengthen the party in “government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west.” Since then, several foreign companies that have entered into joint venture agreements with Chinese companies have been pressured to amend their contractual agreements to provide party officials a more active role in managing the businesses.

Shortly after Xi’s speech, the Times reports the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce said it was concerned about “proactive calls on foreign-invested companies to promote the development of theCommunist Party of China within companies.” The European Chamber of Commerce has called such incidents a “great concern” that could represent “a significant change from the legal framework under which joint ventures were negotiated and under which they have been operating successfully for decades.”

“Infiltration by party operatives into the executive circle of foreign-invested enterprises is not extensively apparent at this time but things are certainly going in that direction,” says James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing whose clients include American multinational corporations. He tells the Times that several of his clients in joint ventures had received explicit requests to give their internal party organizations a greater say in the company’s operations. At some companies, the requested language requires a board of directors to consult with the committee before making business decisions.

All that glitters is not gold. For decades, foreign companies have chafed under the joint venture rules in China that require them to share manufacturing expertise and some intellectual property with their Chinese parties. They have been hoping for years for permission to do business in China the way they do in their home countries. That day may be at hand, but as the old expression warns, “Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.”","Wed, 18 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cleantechnica.com/files/2013/07/ct-favicon-50x50.png,"['car', 'chinese', 'tesla', 'announces', 'partners', 'party', 'manufacturing', 'good', 'china', 'local', 'venture', 'companies', 'manufacturers', 'joint', 'foreign', 'rules']", 
5,5,FL-2018-000050-CHN,"Hawaii rescuers airlift residents after floods, landslides on Kauai - CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/weather/hawaii-kauai-flooding/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds of people have been evacuated from flood-stricken areas of the Hawaiian island of Kauai after severe rain struck over the weekend, leaving swaths of land underwater.

Rain and flooding Saturday night caused multiple mudslides, as well as power and water outages.

One low-lying area was issued with an evacuation notice over fears a dam would burst, and the Kuhio Highway in the city of Hanalei was closed.

The Kauai Emergency Management Agency (KEMA) said multiple landslides ""continuously engulfed the roadway from 2 p.m. local time (8 p.m ET) Saturday.""

Hawaii Governor David Ige issued an emergency proclamation for the County of Kauai late Sunday due to the damage from ""the severe, sudden and extraordinary event of heavy rains and flooding.""

""For context, the town of Wainiha, Kauai, recorded a staggering 822 mm of rainfall in just 48 hours,"" CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. ""That amount of rainfall would climatologically take nearly 18 months to fall in London and over 24 months to fall in Los Angeles.""

Rescue efforts

Emergency rescue crews have evacuated 152 people by helicopter, 121 by bus and others by water, Ige's office said Monday.

Gov. Ige and Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho flew with military and county emergency crews over heavily damaged regions in the Hanalei District, including Wainiha and Haena, seeing ""the swollen Hanalei River, flooded neighborhoods and farmlands,"" according to the governor's office.

""Damage is very extensive in this area. The immediate problem is access. Several landslides are blocking roads into the communities.

""Crews are working to restore access to the Hanalei District, but it will take some time. We are establishing landing zones for aircraft. The Hawaii National Guard has deployed two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, two CH-47 Chinooks, eight Zodiacs and more than 45 soldiers and airmen to support rescue efforts, and to get medical aid and necessary supplies to the area,"" Ige said.

Red Cross shelters

The Red Cross told CNN Monday afternoon that 61 people were stranded at a Red Cross shelter inside a Kauai elementary school surrounded by flash flood waters.

Coralie Matayoshi, CEO of the Hawaii Chapter of the American Red Cross, said 40 residents had been at the shelter since Saturday, with another 21 arriving Sunday night. ""They came by boat, they came by jet-ski, they did whatever they could to get there,"" Matayoshi said.

The organization later said the floodwaters had receded enough to allow the residents to be bussed to another of the Red Cross's five shelters set up on the island.

Representative for Hawaii's Second District Tulsi Gabbard posted a message on Facebook saying her heart was with those on Kauai experiencing severe flooding and mudslides. She thanked the US Coast Guard, Hawaii National Guard and first responders for the efforts getting support to those affected.

Water and power

In a statement posted on Facebook, the County of Kauai said emergency agencies were working to get water and supplies into Wainiha and Haena, from where more than 100 people had been airlifted.

""Those who wish to be evacuated are advised that it is unknown at this time when they can return, as landslides continue to block access along Kuhio Highway between Waikoko and Wainiha,"" the statement said.

It said that power had been restored to the Wainiha pump stations and that water services would be slowly restored to customers in the Wainiha and Haena areas.

""However, DOW has issued a 'do not drink' advisory and a conservation notice for Wainiha and Haena customers. Those who are receiving water are also urged to heed the conservation notice,"" the county said.

Coast Guard rescues

The US Coast Guard said in a statement Monday that its helicopters had helped local authorities rescue hikers around Hanalei Bay Sunday after being asked to assist early that morning.

""The north shore of Kauai experienced flash flooding with waters rising between five and eight feet above average due to the severe thunderstorms and heavy rains, trapping many residents inside their homes and on rooftops,"" it said in a statement.

""Crews from the Hawaii Fire Department and Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services have been evacuating residents to higher ground via jet skis but were unable to effect rescues in the towns of Hanalei, Wainiha, and Haena,"" it said.

In one instance, the coast guard said hikers waved down one of its helicopters above Hanakapiai Beach after being stranded for two days and were hoisted to safety.

Honolulu coast guard command was also in contact with 30 hikers stranded on Kalalau Beach. ""The hikers currently have food and supplies and are not in need of an immediate rescue,"" it said.

State parks

Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of State Parks said that in addition to the campers stranded in Kalalau, efforts were being made to contact and check on the safety of others who had camping permits.

In a statement, the department said Napali Coast State Wilderness Park, Haena State Park, Polihale State Park and portions of Wailua River State Park remained closed following the storm.

Damage to the roads leading into the Haena and Napali Coast parks meant they were likely to remain closed indefinitely, it said.

'Notorious' rainfall

Javaheri said the forecast for Kauai was set to improve over the next couple of days.

""However, this is a part of the world is notorious for persistent rainfall over 300 days per year,"" Javaheri said.

""I'd expect showers and blustery weather to continue in this region, although not nearly similar to the amounts seen in recent days.""

Kauai County said in its statement that the rain meant the Kalihiwai Reservoir had been nearing capacity Saturday afternoon and residents in low-lying areas had been told to evacuate.

""Since that time, the dam has been inspected and it has been deemed safe for residents to return. Officials will continue to monitor the reservoir,"" the county said.

It advised residents to stay out of flood waters.

""Heavy rains have caused storm water runoff throughout Kauai, leading to widespread flooding producing large areas of standing water. Coastal waters have also been affected and a brown water advisory remains in effect until further notice.""

Seasonal flooding has on occasion suspended maritime transportation along inland waterways. However, over 1,000 years ago, the engineers of the Mayan Empire devised a method that was implemented at higher elevations that reduced flooding at lower elevations.

Introduction

While Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli (1700 – 1782) is regarded as the father of modern hydraulics, the engineers of the Mayan Empire of Central and South America achieved feats of hydraulic engineering some 1,000 years before he was born. They developed a method of using kinetic energy to cause water to flow uphill through underground channels and into hidden reservoirs located beneath their enclaves. They built the world’s first known suspension bridges, and they developed a method to reduce flooding at low elevations, where Mayan farmers cultivated a variety of food crops.

The Mayan engineers built a succession of rock dams at high elevation, along the streams and tributaries that fed into major rivers that were prone to seasonal flooding. Even today, evidence of the ancient rock dams still exists along tributaries of several South American rivers. At the present day in the modern world, rising water levels have occurred along several navigable waterways internationally including sections of the Lower Mississippi River and sections of the Danube River where maritime traffic was suspended, also along a section of the Upper St Lawrence River.

The Mississippi

A recent scientific analysis of the history of flooding along the Mississippi River concluded that while seasonal flooding occurred prior to the installation of dams and navigation locks along the waterway, flooding became worse following the installation of dams and navigation locks. However, the Mississippi and navigable rivers that connect to it form the basis of an important corridor that carries millions of tons of bulk freight annually. The economic importance of the waterway requires that methods other than the dismantling of dams and navigation locks be investigated as a possible method by which to reduce flooding.

When the Mississippi River overflows its banks, maritime traffic is suspended as areas next to the river become flooded. Hordes of volunteers appear to help fellow citizens cope with the floods. The sheer extent of the waterway system that connects to the Mississippi River involves thousands of stream and hundreds of small rivers that flow into successively larger waterways that in turn connect to the Mississippi. While extremely onerous, it may actually be possible to organize armies of mainly volunteers to build thousands of Mayan-style rock dams along streams and small rivers that eventually flow into the Mississippi.

Environmental Considerations

Any such proposal will inevitably attract the attention of the environmental movement as well as government departments that oversea environmental matters. A large percentage of the environmental movement would likely call for the dismantling of the navigation locks and the dams. There is massive monetary value of damage that flooding causes almost annually along the Mississippi River. If a solution were possible, it could prompt a government department to commission a study to investigate such possible solutions.

If such a commission were supportive of the method developed centuries ago by the engineers of the Mayan Empire, it could invite thousands of interested people who might seek to install small-site and micro-size hydroelectric installations plus a series of kinetic river turbines along streams and small rivers located at high elevation. As a result, the American department of energy would likely become involved due to the possible potential mass decentralized power generation. Recent initiatives aimed at increasing grid-scale, electrical energy storage capacity across North America could justify an increase in mass small-site power generation.

Inflatable Dams

The development of heavy duty, submersible and inflatable plastic bags that can be secured to a lake or river floor and pumped with air allows a variation of this technology to also be pumped with water while secured at strategic locations across a stream or river. A series of such water inflatable “dams” placed at regular intervals could duplicate the objective of the rock dams built centuries ago by the engineers of the Mayan Empire. Unlike rock dams that would be permanent fixtures, water inflated dams could be installed seasonally at some locations along some rivers.

There may be scope to implement the combination of rock dams and inflatable dams along numerous streams and rivers that flow at high elevation before flowing into larger rivers that carry far greater water volumes. From upstream, navigation locks regulate the flow of water from Lake Superior into Lake Huron and a control dam regulates the volume of water that flows from Lake Erie over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario. The may be scope to install water inflatable technology on the channels floors between Lakes Michigan and Huron as well as between Lakes Huron and Erie.

Upper St Lawrence River

During the northern spring of 2017, water levels rose to near record levels on Lake Ontario and along the western section of the St Lawrence River located upstream of Montreal. Water levels rose to levels where authorities debated whether or not to allow ship traffic to continue to sail between Montreal and the Great Lakes. Excluding the Upper Great Lakes, water also flows into Lake Ontario along rivers that originate in three jurisdictions of Pennsylvania, New York State and Ontario. Since spring flooding rarely occurs on Lake Ontario and Upper St Lawrence River, no flood reduction action would occur.

However, if changing weather conditions result in regular springtime flooding along the waterway located upstream of Montreal, the three jurisdictions would need to cooperate in regard to modifying the headwaters of rivers that flow into both Lake Ontario and the Upper St Lawrence River.

European Barge Canals

Changing weather patterns have caused flooding along sections of some European barge canals. While rivers such as the Danube cross national boundaries, many rivers originate and flow to the ocean exclusively through sovereign states and include the Loire, Seine, Marne, Rhone, Weser and Vistula. Given that several of these rivers originate at high elevation in high mountains, there may be scope to adopt the Mayan approach to moderate water volume flow rate so as to reduce flooding at the lower elevations.

Asian Rivers

Most of Asia’s main navigable rivers originate and flow to the ocean within national boundaries of single nations. International cooperation between India and Bangladesh could reduce the annual flooding along the Lower Brahmaputra and Lower Ganges Rivers. While flooding sometimes occurs along the Indus River of Pakistan, the headwaters of that river originate in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Given that some of the headwaters of the Ganges River originate at high elevations in Nepal, there may be scope for international cooperation between India and Nepal to moderate seasonal monsoon water volume flow rate into the Ganges.

Conclusions

Dating back over 1,000 years ago, the engineers of the Mayan Empire devised a means by which to modify the headwaters of rivers at high elevation in mountains to reduce seasonal flooding at lower elevations. They did so to sustain agricultural food production. The Mayan method of flood control may still have application at the present day along navigable inland waterways.

9,9,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Flooding Hot Spots: Why Seas Are Rising Faster on the U.S. East Coast - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/flooding-hot-spots-why-seas-are-rising-faster-on-the-u.s.-east-coast,"Scientists are unraveling the reasons why some parts of the world are experiencing sea level increases far beyond the global average. A prime example is the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, which has been experiencing “sunny day flooding” that had not been expected for decades.

Seen from a pedestrian footbridge overlooking Myrtle Park — a sliver of land that Norfolk, Virginia is allowing to revert to wetlands — the panorama of surrounding homes illustrates the accelerating sea level rise that has beleaguered this neighborhood along the Lafayette River. A grey house, among the first raised in the area, is slightly elevated on cinderblocks, standing 2 feet off the ground. Nearby, owners of a white-sided house with black shutters have lifted their dwelling about 4 feet above ground level. And on the right, a brick house resting on cinderblocks rises incongruously 11 feet above the street. The roads circling Myrtle Park are cracked and disintegrating due to frequent flooding. Tidal grasses like Spartina are springing up. The boulevard a block away, which leads to the world’s largest naval base, floods several times a year and the frequency is increasing. “Things are getting worse,” says William “Skip” Stiles, executive director of Wetlands Watch, a local advocacy group. “We’re now requiring you to go even higher in Norfolk because we get it.”

From 2011 to 2015, sea levels rose up to 5 inches in some locales from North Carolina to Florida.

What Norfolk gets is that while sea level is rising globally at about a tenth of an inch per year, cities along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States — including Norfolk; Baltimore; Charleston, South Carolina; and Miami, among others — have suffered “sunny day” flooding from seas rising far faster than the global average. One study published last year shows that from 2011 to 2015, sea level rose up to 5 inches — an inch per year — in some locales from North Carolina to Florida. Given growing concerns over the flooding, scientists are now working to unravel the mystery of why some parts of the globe are experiencing so-called “sunny day” flooding that had not been expected for decades under conventional sea level rise projections. Along the southeastern coast of the U.S., researchers have zeroed in on three factors that have made this shoreline a regional hot spot of sea level rise. They include a slowing Gulf Stream, shifts in a major North Atlantic weather pattern, and the effects of El Niño climate cycles. “These coastal areas are more vulnerable than they realize to short-term rapid acceleration of sea level rise,” says Andrea Dutton, a University of Florida geologist who studies the history of sea level fluctuations. “If they’re hanging their hat on sea level rise projections looking at the potential over decades, they need to refocus and think about the potential for short-term variability in that rate.” Around the world, sea levels are not rising equally like water in a bathtub. The oceans are more akin to a rubber kiddie pool where the water sloshes around unevenly, often considerably higher on one side than another.

Scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), for example, have found that sea levels in the northern Indian Ocean are rising more rapidly than the global average and threatening densely populated shores, particularly along the coastlines of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, and Sumatra. Scientists say that shifting monsoon patterns have significantly warmed the north Indian Ocean, causing unusually rapid thermal expansion of the region’s seawater and thereby increasing sea levels. In a paper published earlier this year, those NCAR scientists modeled sea level rise for 20 cities worldwide. They found that cities like Boston and New York might experience twice the global mean increase, while San Francisco and Buenos Aires will likely be 15 to 25 percent below the mean. Sunny day flooding — what one researcher calls “high tide on steroids” — has increasingly disrupted coastal cities in the southeastern U.S. coast. In Charleston, tidal flooding increased to 50 days in 2016, up from four days annually 50 years ago, causing millions of dollars in damage and disrupting travel to the city’s hospital district. In Miami, flooding during unusually high tides, what local forecasters call “king tides,” is becoming an increasingly severe problem, with clear-weather flooding accelerating to nearly 20 days a year. But much worse is to come. A report earlier this year from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that “by 2100, high tide flooding will occur every other day (182 days/year) or more often” under an “intermediate low” scenario along the Atlantic coast and the western Gulf of Mexico. Scientists have been steadily increasing their estimates of how much sea level overall will rise this century from melting glaciers and polar ice sheets. The current best estimates are in the range of 3 to 6 feet. The problem of variable sea level rise along the eastern U.S. seaboard gained widespread attention in the summer of 2009, when dozens of communities suffered from unexpected flooding during clear weather. City and state officials reached out to NOAA seeking answers. What, they asked, was going on?

The role of the slowing Gulf Stream has been the focus of much research by scientists.

William Sweet, a NOAA oceanographer, began to investigate. He examined tide gauge data, wind data from buoys, and the speed of the Gulf Stream, which has been tracked since 1982 using an abandoned telephone cable that snakes for 55 miles from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Grand Bahamas Island. He discovered that a prevailing northeasterly wind and a slowing Gulf Stream — coupled with a full moon tide, above-normal summer high tides, and decades of sea level rise — created the conditions for sunny day flooding that summer. “That really was the first time I was able to connect several different atmospheric and oceanic factors that contributed to impacts that really were concerning to folks,” Sweet says. “What I’ve set out to do since then is to explain the flooding folks are seeing and the underlying causes.” The role of the slowing Gulf Stream has been the focus of much research by scientists such as Sweet and Tal Ezer, an oceanographer at Norfolk’s Old Dominion University who has examined the effects of currents and weather patterns on sea levels. Ezer has been studying the Gulf Stream for 30 years. Though he’s never actually been out in the Gulf Stream, he creates computer models simulating the stream using information from tide gauges, the abandoned cable, satellite data recording sea-surface heights, and coastal radar that measures surface currents.

Beginning in 2012, he published a series of papers matching long-term slowing of the Gulf Stream with increased sea level rise. The Gulf Stream — about 60 miles wide, a half-mile deep, and generally flowing 100 to 200 miles off the U.S. East Coast — transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico into the North Atlantic, all the way to Western Europe. A rapidly flowing Gulf Stream in effect whisks water away from the eastern U.S. seaboard. Using satellite altimetry, Ezer has found that the sea-surface elevation across the width of the Gulf Stream has a slope. On the coastal side, sea level can be 3, 4, or 5 feet lower than on the east side. When the current is stronger, the slope is steeper, aided by the Earth’s rotation. But when the Gulf Stream flow slows, that slope decreases, pushing more water up against the land, causing flooding during high tides.

Oceanographers say that the Gulf Stream could well slow even more in coming decades as the melting of Arctic Ocean ice and the Greenland ice sheet dump huge quantities of fresh water into the North Atlantic and disrupt longstanding ocean circulation patterns. Other evidence underscoring the role of the Gulf Stream in sea level rise anomalies along the East Coast has surfaced in recent years. In 2015, Hurricane Joaquin hovered over the Bahamas for days, more than 800 miles from Norfolk, yet tides as much as 3 feet higher than expected flooded the city. A year later, Hurricane Matthew missed the Norfolk area but caused massive flooding, power outages, and more than $35 million of damage throughout the state thanks to relentless rainfall and a high sea level that blocked drainage. In both cases, Ezer says, the storms slowed the Gulf Stream. That’s because strong winds near the surface weaken the Gulf Stream flow, contributing to high sea levels farther north in places like Norfolk.

Scientists hope to help localities prepare for years when sea levels and high tide flooding increase dramatically.

“This is a relatively new phenomenon,” says Ezer. “Sea level rise is changing all the time and the Gulf Stream is changing all the time. But only in the last few years have we found this nice correlation between the measurement of the Gulf Stream offshore and coastal sea level.” Ezer and other researchers have been examining additional factors that create sea level anomalies. Building upon Sweet’s earlier work, Dutton and Arnoldo Valle-Levinson, her University of Florida colleague, noticed unexpected changes in tide gauge data near Cape Canaveral, Florida that prompted them to look at the effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. They discovered rapidly rising sea levels from 2011 to 2015 along the coast from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina south to Miami. In some cases, sea levels rose nearly 5 inches in five years. What was happening? El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean but spreads its effects across North America, changing wind patterns and causing water to build up along the Eastern Seaboard. Meanwhile, changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation, a major weather pattern, alter the jet stream, prevailing winds, and storm tracks, which affects the distribution of water in the North Atlantic and can increase sea levels along the U.S. East Coast. The study by Dutton and her colleagues determined that El Niño controls the timing of increases — and decreases — in waters along the coast. The North Atlantic Oscillation, Dutton says, acts as a seesaw that serves as a steering mechanism, focusing increased sea level rise either north or south of Cape Hatteras. She is now looking at potential hot spots for sea level rise along the Gulf of Mexico.

Dutton says that variability makes sea level rise like global warming. “It pulses up and down as it’s going up,” she says. “It means we’re going to hit 2 feet (in sea level rise) before 2060 during extreme events or periods of high water where we get these hot spots.” With sea levels changing dramatically in such short time spans, Sweet has turned to providing coastal communities with actionable science, creating annual reports that recap flooding from the year before and make projections for the year ahead. NOAA also issues two- to four-day flooding forecasts based on tides and computer models. The goal is to help localities prepare and budget for years when sea levels — and high tide flooding — increase dramatically.","Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/Miami_KingTideFlooding_Getty_web.jpg,"['coast', 'stream', 'hot', 'rise', 'levels', 'east', 'high', 'water', 'gulf', 'flooding', 'sea', 'rising', 'faster', 'seas', 'spots', 'level', 'north']",

Climate change, driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, would drive more extreme shifts between hot and dry summers and wet winters in the most populous U.S. state, they wrote in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Global warming is making California and other regions with similar Mediterranean-style climates, from southern Europe to parts of Australia, drier and warmer in summer, said lead author Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles.

In California in winter “an opposing trend toward a strong Pacific jet stream is projected to locally enhance precipitation during the core months of the ‘rainy season’,” he told Reuters.

“Natural precipitation variability in this region is already large, and projected future whiplash increases would amplify existing swings between dry and wet years,” the authors wrote.

They projected “a 25 percent to 100 percent increase in extreme dry-to-wet precipitation events” this century.

California had its worst drought in recorded history from 2010–2016, followed by severe rains and flooding that culminated with evacuation orders for almost 200,000 residents as a precaution near the Oroville Dam last year.

The study said that major urban centers, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, were “more likely than not” to suffer a freak series of storms by 2060 similar to ones in 1861-62 that led to the “Great Flood”.

The storms swamped the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, flooding an area 300 miles (500 km) long and 20 miles wide. Storms washed away bridges, inundated mines and wrecked farms.

A repeat “would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars”, the study said.

As part of planning, Swain said the state should expand use of floodplains that can be deliberately flooded to soak up rains, such as the Yolo Bypass which protects the city of Sacramento.

The study assumes, however, that global greenhouse gas emissions will keep rising, at odds with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement under which almost 200 nations agreed to cut emissions to net zero between 2050 and 2100.

“Such a future can be partially, but not completely, avoided” if the world takes tougher action, Swain said. He noted that existing government pledges to limit warming fall well short of the Paris goals.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts mainstream findings that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of warming, plans to quit the deal, saying he wants to promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry.","Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180423&t=2&i=1254508106&r=LYNXMPEE3M183&w=800,"['greenhouse', 'gas', 'risks', 'drought', 'projected', 'swain', 'precipitation', 'flood', 'emissions', 'california', 'scientists', 'severe', 'warming', 'study', 'storms', 'whiplash']",

In past, rescue teams were scattered, but now they'll be under a single body

The new Ministry of Emergency Management, which officially began functioning on Monday, will help integrate China's scattered disaster-relief resources to cope with the country's frequent natural disasters and accidents, experts said.

Ceremonies inaugurating the ministry were held in Beijing and attended by Vice-Premier Han Zheng, who is also member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.

China is one of the countries worst hit by natural disasters, and is adapting to the situation by establishing the ministry, said Zhang Xingkai, president of China Academy of Safety Science and Technology.

Of the 50 natural disasters worldwide with more than 100,000 casualties over the past three centuries, 26 happened in China, and 70 percent of the 151 million people killed in these disasters were Chinese.

Workplace accidents from 2011 to 2015 in the country are estimated to have resulted in direct economic losses of 562 billion yuan ($89.4 billion) and indirect losses of 1.1 trillion yuan, according to Zhang.

He said that populations are more densely concentrated in areas with more infrastructure, so improper emergency management can result in great losses.

Shan Chunchang, a specialist in emergency management for the State Council, said that while risk is on the rise from increasing populations and infrastructure in urban areas, emergency management is underdeveloped in rural areas, especially in the China's central and western regions. ""The new ministry will be key in building up an efficient emergency response system to safeguard people's lives and wealth,"" Shan said.

The new ministry will take over the responsibilities of the former State Administration of Work Safety, along with functions from other ministries including firefighting from the Ministry of Public Security, disaster relief from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, geological disaster prevention from the Ministry of Land and Resources, drought and flood control from the Ministry of Water Resources and prairie fire control from the Ministry of Agriculture.

""Previously, various rescue teams were scattered across different government bodies. Not every one of these government bodies, however, will respond to emergencies frequently. Some of the teams may be idle for a long period of time, which will affect their capacity for emergency response,"" Shan said.

As the world enters the era of big data, the establishment of the ministry will also help in integrating and applying emergency-related data, said Wang Yukai, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance.","Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201804/17/5ad52e9fa3105cdce0a30efe.jpeg,"['management', 'natural', 'scattered', 'ministry', 'response', 'china', 'help', 'resources', 'disasters', 'teams', 'improve', 'emergency']",

Alerted by the potential instability that such rumors may cause in a society already on edge over the issue, the Taiwan government quickly issued a statement denying the fake news (Pension.president.gov.tw, July 17, 2017). According to Taiwan’s national security apparatuses, a growing volume of disinformation are the products of “content farms” (內容农场) emerging from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (Liberty Times, July 18, 2017).

The disinformation campaign concerning the pension reform is one example in a long history of the use of propaganda and disinformation as political tools across the Taiwan Strait. While Taiwan may have enjoyed an advantage at the beginning of the information war due to access to more resources and technology (e.g., help from the United States), that advantage is eroding as Beijing, while remaining a close authoritarian government, exploits the openness and transparency of Taiwan’s democratic and economic system to unduly influence Taiwan. Unchecked, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda and disinformation campaigns could have a corrosive effect on Taiwan’s democracy.

CCP Propaganda and Disinformation: 1949-1991

Propaganda and disinformation are used by the PRC as tools for political and psychological warfare (Project 2049, October 14, 2013). During the Chinese Civil War, both the Communist and Nationalist (Kuomintang, or KMT) armies spread false information to sow discord in enemy-controlled areas, spreading rumors about defections, falsifying enemy attack plans, and stirring up unrest in an effort to misdirect enemy planning. After the Nationalist government relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the propaganda and disinformation war continued as the two sides flooded propaganda and disinformation into enemy-controlled territories to affect public opinion and troop morale.

Starting in the 1950s and continuing until the 1990s, the two sides were engaged in an intense ‘Taiwan Strait psychological war’ (台海心战). Following the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, while the two governments were locked in an intense international diplomatic contest, engagements were limited to covert operations, subterfuge, and other efforts to encourage defections by enemy officers through psychological warfare. Ground-zero of the psychological war was between ROC-controlled Kinmen (金門) and PRC-controlled Xiamen (厦門), where the two sides used megaphones and radio stations to spread propaganda and disinformation into enemy territory. They utilized balloons and floating carriers to send leaflets and other objects seeking defectors, promising rewards and small gifts including underwear, toys, and cooking oil, among other messages meant to exert a psychological effect on the targeted population (Phoenix TV, 2013). In an instructive example of how the CCP used propaganda and disinformation, in 1971 the PLA blasted propaganda leaflets over Kinmen touting the military successes of the Khmer Rouge (the CCP’s allies) against the United States. The timing was not coincidental: in the same year Taipei was replaced by Beijing in the United Nations, and Communist triumphs in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia had left the government in Taiwan panic-stricken. The propaganda touting a Communist victory was apparently meant to amplify the fear among the people at the time that the United States was unable to protect Taiwan [1].

Cross-Strait relations began to liberalize in the 1980s and the CCP officially shuttered its overt propaganda program from Xiamen in 1991 (FTV News, October 13, 2013). On the surface, the war without gunfire that had lasted for over 40 years appeared to be over—this could not be farther from the truth. Rather, propaganda and disinformation found new outlets in the mass media and now new media (Heritage Foundation, July 12, 2013).

A New Media Environment in Taiwan

New information and communication technologies has magnified propaganda and disinformation to an unprecedented degree. The viral aspect of social media has made it an effective tool for propaganda and disinformation. Taiwan has one of the highest Internet usage rates in the world, at 82.3 percent in 2017 (Focus Taiwan, December 29, 2017), as well as a smartphone penetration rate of 73.4 percent (Emarketer.com, December 16, 2016)—second in the world only behind Denmark. Taiwan also boasts a robust ICT industry with the sixteenth fastest Internet speeds in the world and fifth fastest in the Asia-Pacific (Taipei Times, June 12, 2017). The two most popular social media platforms in Taiwan are Facebook and LINE. For instance, 75 percent of the population of Taiwan used Line in 2015. PTT, a bulletin-board service system similar to Reddit, is also popular (Oxford University, June 16, 2017).

CCP Propaganda and Disinformation on Social Media

The CCP uses social media in a number of ways to spread propaganda and disinformation in its influence operations against Taiwan, as noted by analyst J. Michael Cole (Taiwan Sentinel, January 19, 2017).

One important way is circulating fake imagery, in the hopes that it will go viral and be picked up on by traditional media outlets in Taiwan. In one instance, an image was posted on social media showing Chinese bombers flying near Taiwan’s Jade Mountain. This photo was likely posted to instill fear in the hearts of the Taiwanese public. Even though Taiwan’s defense ministry denied the veracity of the image, the denial came after the photo had already been widely shared (Taiwan Sentinel, January 19, 2017).

Another time-honored tactic, reinvigorated by the social media era, is deliberately obscuring or misquoting statements made by Taiwanese persons, usually officials or ex-officials—whether in forums held in China or in interviews—in order to tarnish the person’s reputation or mislead the readers into believing that the person supports a particular political position held by the CCP. These tactics, used by both China and Hong Kong-based media, have ensnared retired former generals, high-level defense officials, lawmakers, and even entertainers in a host of political controversies (The National Interest, July 30, 2017).

The CCP also uses proxy organizations to spread fake news. Taiwan is a democracy with a diverse civil society, an openness which can also make it vulnerable. And indeed, observers have noticed a troubling uptick in the infiltration of Taiwan’s civil society by proxy organizations associated with CCP’s United Front Work Department, with possible financial ties to the PRC government (USCC.gov, April 5). These United Front organizations may then be used to propagate disinformation, as was reported in the case of some anti-pension groups, and counter perspectives from other segments of Taiwan’s civil society (Liberty Times, July 18, 2017).

Finally, the CCP has also begun to use computational propaganda, in the form of bots, social media, and content farms, to saturate Taiwan’s information space with pro-Beijing political propaganda. According to J. Michael Cole:

… computational propaganda has allowed Beijing to insert itself into the battleground of domestic Taiwanese politics, so much so that various (dis)information campaigns can no longer be solely attributed to the KMT and other pan-blue forces, which adds to the confusion. In recent cases, Chinese disinformation efforts have overlapped with—and in some cases appear to have co-opted—traditional blocking action by opposition legislators and civic groups opposed to reforms. These recent cases include protests against pension reform, government plans to limit the (environmentally unfriendly) burning of large quantities of incense and ghost money at Buddhist temples, and limits for the Tsai administration’s Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program” (Oxford University, June 16, 2017).

Conclusion

The CCP has a long history of using propaganda and disinformation against Taiwan. In social media it has found a fertile information environment to amplify its time-honed tactics of political and psychological warfare. Flooding Taiwan’s society with propaganda and disinformation can weaken its people’s trust in democratic institutions and lead to political instability.

The challenge is not lost on Taiwanese officials and civil society. For instance, Taiwan government is reportedly taking a long-term approach, attempting to tackle the problem of fake news through public education by including topics such as “media literacy” on the curriculum in schools (TIME, April 7, 2017). To counter the challenge of dubious news sources on LINE, private developers created a bot that will inform users whether or not a suspicious links is providing false information, and provide relevant facts on the issue (Oxford University, June 16, 2017). Taiwan’s national security apparatuses have also reportedly ramped up surveillance programs to monitor the connections and finances of potential proxy groups and individuals with ties to Beijing (Taipei Times, March 13, 2018).

In general, propaganda and disinformation exploits the openness of democratic institutions and can undermine the people’s ability as citizens to think and act effectively and collectively. The CCP’s ultimate goal is the subjugation of Taiwan under the PRC, and propaganda and disinformation are means to weakening morale and people’s resistance towards that political end.

According to CNN affiliate KHNL , a deluge washed out a bridge, cutting the San Diego family's vacation rental off from safety.

""We tried not to let the kids see, but I was terrified,"" Erin Gwilliam, the mother, told KHNL.

But a nearby resident and good Samaritan approached in his boat and helped the family escape.

Their knight in a shining wetsuit? None other than surfing legend Laird Hamilton

The famous big wave surfer has spent days coordinating rescues after severe rain struck last weekend, causing mudslides and power outages on the island of Kauai, where he lives. The resulting floodwaters have forced hundreds of people to evacuate.

""If you have compassion, this is what you do,"" Laird Hamilton said.

In an interview Thursday, Hamilton sheepishly told CNN he's coordinated or conducted more than 75 rescues in floodwaters near his Kauai home, but he's not asking for credit.

""If you have compassion, this is what you do,"" Hamilton said. ""These are opportunities to make a difference, when it really counts.""

Over 400 people have been airlifted from Kauai since Monday, according to County Mayor Bernard P. Carvalho Jr. The island is particularly vulnerable, because the ground has become heavily saturated from the record-breaking rainfall of more than 30 inches.

Rescues weren't limited to people

Hamilton said the boat launch at his home is on the high side of the flood plain, which enabled him to continue the rescues, even as other boat launches across the island remained submerged.

""It allowed me to have access to the water,"" he said. ""I was able to support farmers, help some people off their roofs and get them what they need.""

The surfer has been getting up at 4 a.m. each day, working to help as many people in remote areas as he could before sundown, according to a spokeswoman for Hamilton.

Hamilton also rescued 15 girls from the home of fellow surfer Leila Hurst, and lent his boat launch to members of the National Guard, who used the location as a departure point for their own rescue operations.

The rescues weren't limited to humans: Hamilton and his friends also rescued approximately 80 bison they found in the flood plain, spread out to different spots around town, he said. Some were even standing on the reef.

""We were just going around in boats, tying them and towing them, trying to get them back into pasture,"" Hamilton said.

The threat isn't over

Flooding is not unusual for the area, Hamilton said, but the weekend's rainstorms were unparalleled. ""People don't know the level of intensity of what's happened here,"" Hamilton said. ""There are people who have lost everything.""

""The power, the length and the strength of this: It's unlike anything that I've ever seen.""

The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for all the Hawaiian islands through Friday afternoon.

Kauai's flooded Hanalei Bay area is seen in this image from April 15.

Hamilton said it's the Hawaiian residents' resilience and unity that helps them persevere in difficult times.

""In Hawaii we have a word called 'ohana.' It means family,"" Hamilton said. ""Family and friends banding together. It's a pretty wonderful thing. This would have been much worse had we not all banded together here. That's ohana.""","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180419161916-02-laird-hamilton-rescue-super-tease.jpg,"['rescues', 'hawaiian', 'boat', 'hawaii', 'cnn', 'laird', 'surfer', 'flood', 'family', 'kauai', 'surfing', 'floods', 'legend', 'hamilton', 'island', 'rescuing']",

""We've opened up a new front in the trade war, and while it's quieter than all of the bombast about tariffs that had people freaking out, there are still a ton of companies that can get hurt here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The new front in the trade war? Technology."" The U.S. Commerce Department's Monday ban on selling U.S. products to Chinese smartphone maker ZTE was ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" Cramer said. Early on Thursday, China hit back, citing antitrust concerns in Qualcomm's proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. But in addition to negative merger reviews, telecom tensions, and restrictions on exports, China had one key strategy that Cramer was particularly concerned about.

Not enough winners?

As stocks sank on Thursday, Cramer inspected the market for the various triggers that sparked the decline. ""Thanks to a nasty combination of the yield on the 10-year Treasury approaching 3 percent, a series of disappointments in the consumer products space, some amazingly fast growth in personal and corporate spending, a rally in commodities and a pickup in the trade war with China, we got hit with a flash flood of selling in a number of key groups,"" Cramer said. Of all the woes, Cramer was particularly worried about the breadth of the United States' trade dispute with China. This week, the tit-for-tat battle spread to a group that Cramer saw as integral to the success of the stock market: the semiconductor sector. ""The semis are a leadership group, no doubt about it, so the tone was just plain jarring,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The problem is, in a trade war with China, there simply aren't enough publicly-traded winners.""

The race to $1 trillion

The race to a $1 trillion market cap is underway, and to Cramer, it's looking ""very close."" Leading the pack is iPhone maker Apple, with a market cap of $877 billion. In second place is Google parent Alphabet at $757 billion, followed by Amazon at $754 billion and Microsoft at $740 billion. Tipping his hat to Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who came up with the concept of the race to $1 trillion in a recent research note on Microsoft, Cramer decided to look at all four contenders and speculate on which one might cross the ""finish line"" first.

Nucor CEO talks tariffs after earnings

Cramer also heard from John Ferriola, the chairman and CEO of steel producer Nucor who was a leader in pushing the Trump administration to implement steel and aluminum tariffs. ""It'd be extremely disappointing"" if Trump didn't follow through on the tariffs, Ferriola told Cramer on Thursday. ""We need the president to fulfill his commitment. We must not let the date of May 1 slip any further. Frankly, his credibility and the credibility of America is on the line here."" But even if the administration failed to uphold its commitment, Ferriola wasn't worried about Nucor's business, pointing to the company's year-over-year results on the heels of its first-quarter earnings report. ""Can Nucor do well despite what happens with 232?"" he asked rhetorically. ""The answer is absolutely, yes. All you need to do is to look back at our performance last year, but particularly in the first quarter, when we were operating in an environment in which imports still took 25 percent of the market."" ""We operated at 92 percent capacity utilization,"" the CEO continued. ""We had a very solid quarter. Just about all of our cylinders of our great company are running, full steam.""

United Rentals CEO on tech investment benefits

After touting the benefits of investing in technology, Cramer sat down with United Rentals CEO Mike Kneeland, whose construction equipment rental company is doing just that to stay ahead of the curve. ""We started out with telematics. We had to put telematics on our total fleet,"" Kneeland told Cramer on Thursday, referring to a type of telecommunication technology that provides location information in various applications. ""It does a lot of different things,"" Kneeland said. ""It eliminates any kind of waste trying to locate a piece of equipment. It identifies whether it's low on fuel, whether it needs service. So it helps us, but it also helps our customers, more importantly."" Investing in tech was one of many factors that boosted business at United Rentals, Kneeland said after the company's first-quarter earnings beat. ""If you look at all the leading indicators, all of them, they're either at record-highs or damn close to it,"" he told Cramer. ""Everything I see is going to point to a solid year. And you don't have to listen to me. Listen to my competitors. They're saying the same thing.""

The petitions demonstrate that Chinese producers have used dumping and foreign government subsidies to gain an unfair advantage in the U.S. market. They allege dumping margins that average 455%, revealing that Chinese prices are far below the cost of producing quartz surface products in market economy conditions.



Quartz surface products have grown in popularity as a more desirable alternative to surfaces such as granite or marble due to their strength, durability, and aesthetic appeal. Quartz surface products are used in applications such as countertops, tiles, bar surfaces, shower and tub surrounds, fireplace surrounds, walls, floors, bathroom vanities and on furniture and accessories.



For years, Chinese producers have used steep price undercutting to flood the U.S. market and seize market share from domestic producers. In less than a decade, the value of Chinese imports of quartz products surged from $6 million a year in 2010 to nearly $460 million a year in 2017.



“Cambria is taking this action to ensure the long-term best interests of our industry, American manufacturing, American workers, and American business,” said Marty Davis, President and CEO of Cambria. “Unfair trade practices have gone on for far too long. Fair trade and free trade are inseparable paradigms; you simply cannot have one without the other. We believe strongly in free trade—to protect it, we must demand fair trade. Cambria is pursuing existing trade laws to stop the unfair trading from China that is damaging our industry and to restore a level playing field. These fundamental virtues of fair trade and free trade are critical to the success of American capitalism, to our industry, its workers, and to the communities and the customers we serve. We encourage other American companies to support fair trade, if only to protect the virtues of free trade, and in doing so, our country’s best interests.” Davis concluded, “This is not an effort in protectionism, quite the opposite. Our efforts are to allow for open markets with free and open trade, based squarely on a market economy.”



The petitions allege that Chinese producers benefit from more than 20 subsidy programs provided by the Chinese Government, including grants, loans, tax breaks, and the provision of land, electricity, and raw material inputs at below-market prices.



In addition, the petitions allege that the increase in Chinese imports has injured the domestic industry and threatens further damage if duties to offset China’s unfair trade practices are not imposed. The petitions will be investigated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. If both agencies make affirmative determinations, preliminary relief from Chinese imports could be imposed in September 2018, with final duties imposed in June 2019.

In China and India, men outnumber women by 70 million. Both nations are belatedly trying to come to grips with the policies that created this male-heavy generation

Nothing like this has happened in human history. A combination of cultural preferences, government decree and modern medical technology in the world’s two largest countries has created a gender imbalance on a continental scale. Men outnumber women by 70 million in China and India.

The consequences of having too many men, now coming of age, are far-reaching: Beyond an epidemic of loneliness, the imbalance distorts labor markets, drives up savings rates in China and drives down consumption, artificially inflates certain property values, and parallels increases in violent crime, trafficking or prostitution in a growing number of locations.

Those consequences are not confined to China and India, but reach deep into their Asian neighbors and distort the economies of Europe and the Americas, as well. Barely recognized, the ramifications of too many men are only starting to come into sight.

“In the future, there will be millions of men who can’t marry, and that could pose a very big risk to society,” warns Li Shuzhuo, a leading demographer at Xi’an Jiaotong University.

Out of China’s population of 1.4 billion, there are nearly 34 million more males than females — the equivalent of almost the entire population of California, or Poland, who will never find wives and only rarely have sex. China’s official one-child policy, in effect from 1979 to 2015, was a huge factor in creating this imbalance, as millions of couples were determined that their child should be a son.

India, a country that has a deeply held preference for sons and male heirs, has an excess of 37 million males, according to its most recent census. The number of newborn female babies compared with males has continued to plummet, even as the country grows more developed and prosperous. The imbalance creates a surplus of bachelors and exacerbates human trafficking, both for brides and, possibly, prostitution. Officials attribute this to the advent of sex-selective technology in the last 30 years, which is now banned but still in widespread practice.

In the two countries, 50 million excess males are under age 20.

Girls ages 0-4 Girls and boys ages 0-4 Difference between girls and boys ages 0-4 Number of boys for every 100 girls ages 0-4 Number of men for every 100 women ages 15-29 Number of men ages 15–49 for every 100 women ages 15-29 Source: United Nations World Population Prospects These lines represent the number of girls, from newborns to age four, in China and India since 1970, with projections out to 2100. The darker lines show the number of male babies during that same period. The shaded area is the difference between these boys and girls. The number of young boys in India and China has outpaced the number of young girls by millions for at least 20 years. When looking at just the ratio of boys to girls in each country, it may look as if that gap has narrowed ... ... but its effects on marriage have yet to peak. The biggest gap between men and women of marriageable age, defined here as 15 to 29, will come in the next few decades, as the babies of the past decade grow up. And factoring in the large pool of both unmarried older and younger men vying for the same small pool of young women, the gap becomes more of a chasm.

Both nations are belatedly trying to come to grips with the policies that created this male-heavy generation. And demographers say it will take decades for the ramifications of the bulge to fade away.

In the four sections below are personal tales that show how the imbalance has affected:

Village life and mental health. Among men, loneliness and depression are widespread. Villages are emptying out. Men are learning to cook and perform other chores long relegated to women. Stagnant lives

Housing prices and savings rates. Bachelors are furiously building houses in China to attract wives, and prices are soaring. But otherwise they are not spending, and that in turn fuels China’s huge trade surplus. In India, there is the opposite effect: Because brides are scarce, families are under less pressure to save for expensive dowries. The desperate effort to land a bride

Human trafficking. Trafficking of brides is on the rise. Foreign women are being recruited and lured to China, effectively creating similar imbalances in China’s neighbors. Importing a bride

Public safety. With the increase in men has come a surge in sexual crime in India and concerns about a rise in other crimes in both countries. Harassment of schoolgirls in India has in some towns sparked an effort to push back — but at a cost of restricting them to more protected lives. Taking a stand over harassment

Chapter One Stagnant lives Outnumbered and struggling The growing number of eligible men who cannot find brides has had a profound impact on the age-old rhythms of family life. Adult sons live with their mothers — in some cases, their grandmothers. Indian and Chinese women who showed a marked preference for sons are growing old. They are still burdened with cooking and cleaning for their adult sons, and the stress affects their health. “I’ve cried so much I can’t see any more,” says one. The gender imbalance could prompt a “crisis of masculinity” as traditional roles are upended and males embrace socially regressive stances to prove their manhood, said Prem Chowdhry, a researcher and social scientist in New Delhi. “People devalue their masculinity. If they remain single, they will be declared not men at all. The basic function of a man in rural society is to have a family and look after that family.” “In rural areas, men who didn’t get married are really marginalized; even socializing in the village is difficult,” said Therese Hesketh, a professor of global health at University College London. “These guys are depressed.”

‘Life is boring and lonely’

Li Weibin has never had a girlfriend. Boys outnumbered girls in the isolated mountain village where he grew up, in the factories where he worked as a teenager, and on the construction sites where he now earns a modest wage.

Today, 30 years old, he lives in a bare, stuffy dormitory room with five other men in the southern city of Dongguan, bunk beds lining the walls, cigarette butts carpeting the floor.

“I want to find a girlfriend, but I don’t have the money or the opportunity to meet them,” he said. “Girls have very high standards; they want houses and cars. They don’t want to talk to me.”

Li’s problem is not only that he is poor and struggling to save enough money to buy an apartment of his own; it is that in China there are simply too many men. This is a country where marriage confers social status, and where parental pressure to produce grandchildren is intense. Bachelors like Li are dismissively branded as “bare branches” for failing to expand the family tree.

But as any forester knows, bare branches pose a danger, and not just to themselves.

In Dongguan, where the gender ratio is 118 men to 100 women, Li says he has virtually given up hope of finding a girlfriend. He spends his spare time playing games on his phone, or accompanying his co-workers to karaoke or for a foot massage.

“It is just me,” he said. “Life is boring and lonely.”

Om Pati is the mother of seven sons, including from left, Sandeep, Sanjay and Suresh. (Poras Chaudhary/For The Washington Post)

‘May you be the mother of a hundred sons’

When Om Pati, a farmer’s wife in the Indian village of Bass, in the state of Haryana, was having children, she actually prayed a sweet-eyed girl bundle would arrive. But instead she had a son. Then another, and another — seven in all. Her neighbors in the village were overjoyed for her each time a new baby arrived. They rang steel plates so everyone in the neighborhood would know a boy had been born.

After all, this is a culture where male children are desired above all else — to light the Hindu funeral pyre, inherit property, care for aging parents. As the Sanskrit blessing says, “May you be the mother of a hundred sons.”

Sometimes it felt to Om Pati like she was the mother of 100 sons. She worked from sunrise until night. She consoled herself with the thought that she would one day have daughters-in-law to trade stories and share cooking duties. Grandchildren, too.

But by the time her eldest Sanjay — now 38 and a cook — reached marriageable age, the practice of families in her area sneaking off to larger cities for an illegal sonogram and then an abortion had taken its toll. When she and her husband began seeking matches for arranged marriage, still the norm, there were no suitable brides. The few young women had all married — that is, those who hadn’t left for better opportunities elsewhere.

These days, Om Pati, now 60, spends her days cooking and cleaning for her husband and adult sons, who range from age 22 to 38. They gobble up so many rotis — the flat-round bread loaves that are a household staple, each one shaped in her calloused hands — that she goes through several pounds of flour a day.

“There is no other option,” she said. “It’s not in our hands.”

Suresh Kumar says the suffocation he feels as a single 35-year-old is palpable. (Poras Chaudhary/For The Washington Post)

‘No one knows how sad I feel’

Suresh Kumar once dreamed of getting married, with a procession through the lanes of Bass, a bride adorned in gold and the kind of ceremony that was once a near-universal rite of passage for Indian men.

But after one potential engagement fell apart, no other suitable brides could be found. He even went back to earn his high school degree in hopes of being a more attractive suitor.

Still no one. Now Kumar is in his mid-30s, long past what is considered marriageable age in India, and is beginning to face a hard truth — that a wife and a family won’t happen for him.

“People say, ‘You don’t have a wife and children at home to care for — why are you working so hard?’ ” Kumar said. “I laugh on the outside but the pain that I have in my heart only I know.”

The men themselves are isolated, left out of major family decisions and subject to ridicule, with little in the way of support or mental health services. Worse, in the traditional culture of villages, those who missed out on marriage have no hope of female companionship — dating or having a girlfriend is out of the question.

One recent evening, a family threw a rooftop party to celebrate the birth of a boy. Parties to welcome girl babies are still so rare they are covered by the local newspaper. Before the guests arrived, Kumar huddled in a stairwell nearby, sweating over a cast-iron pot, cracking jokes with friends as he fried sweet pancakes for the guests.

He likes to cook, he says, but the role occasionally unbalances him.

During a harvest festival last year, his mother was delayed in another town. So Kumar was left to prepare the pancakes on his own. As he flipped the cakes in the bubbling oil, he grew teary-eyed, thinking of how there was no wife and kids to eat the treats he was making.

Shaofeng’s problem — one faced by millions of his countrymen — is a product of cultural preferences, government decree and modern medical technology. In China, there are simply too many men. (Lu Liu/for The Washington Post)

With a wife, he says, “there would be somebody to make tea for me, to tell me when to take a bath. We don’t have much value as unmarried men in this society. Everybody thinks, ‘What problem does this man have? What is lacking in his family? What is lacking in him?’ ”

Evenings are the loneliest times, when the village folds into itself, minders return with their cows from the pond, smoke wafts from evening meals, schoolchildren still in their plaid school uniforms play in the uneven lanes. Kumar shuts himself in his room.

“I watch TV, romantic movies sometimes,” Kumar says. “What can I do? It’s up to me then. What I feel inside stays inside.”

It wasn’t supposed to end up this way. When he was in high school he had a brief romance with a classmate, a beautiful 17-year-old, tall and slim, with two braids that reached down her back. Even now he cannot speak of her without singing a few bars of an Urdu love song. “I looked for her on Facebook just yesterday,” he says.

But the tryst was discovered, the parents put a stop to it, and his classmate eventually married someone else. And the family wasn’t able to find any other suitable prospective brides for him.

“We feel it, but this is a problem in every house,” said his mother, Bhima, sitting with her son after the party in the dimly lit courtyard of the modest house where they live.

Sometimes, Kumar says, the suffocation he feels is palpable:

“You know how when there’s no wind and a plant is sitting there and the leaves are not moving? That’s how the man feels: You’re just stationary.”

The desperate effort toland a bride

To catch a wife, build a house

Chapter Two THE DESPERATE EFFORT TO LAND A BRIDE To catch a wife, build a house It takes a house, savings and a good job to win a bride. Many Chinese men are working harder, taking more dangerous or unpleasant jobs, to get ahead. Parents are also trying to give their sons a leg up financially. “It’s kind of an arms race in the dating and marriage market,” said Shang-Jin Wei, a Columbia University economist. The high household savings rate, particularly in China, helps explain its huge trade surplus. A man who makes cheap shoes for export does not spend the wages he earns on consumer goods imports. Instead he saves to build a house and attract a bride. Another unintended result — urban housing prices are rising fast.

Now elderly parents are sacrificing to help their sons appear marriageable — and to support sons who fail to find a bride. Daughters-in-law were once expected to look after their husbands’ parents. In millions of families, that’s no longer possible.

‘If you want to find a wife, you have to build a house’

Today, young people are fleeing the villages in a desperate search for fortune, and marriage. The best way to find a bachelor in rural China these days: look for someone building a house.

Li Defu is typical. Now 21, he left home seven years ago to find work in the provincial capital Guiyang, but he has pooled the family savings to build a 10-room house overlooking the green hills and valleys of his birthplace, Paifeng.

The reason is simple: It is the only chance he has of finding a wife.

“At the moment there aren’t any girls my age around,” he said, on a recent trip home to supervise the construction. “But I am building this new house in preparation, in case I find someone.”

Li was brought up by his grandmother, a tiny, wizened woman who sat beside him as he chatted. His parents still work in far-off factories; the savings they have collected could be crucial.

Around $10,000, Li reckons, will have to be paid to his future bride’s family, just to gain their approval for the engagement. A centuries-old tradition, the “bride price” in China is similar to a dowry elsewhere in the world, but paid from groom’s family to the bride’s parents — rather than the other way around.

A 24-year-old who gave only his family name, Wang, came to Guangdong province to work when he was 14. He has saved enough to build a house back home but struggles to find a wife. (Giulia Marchi/For The Washington Post)

A decade or two back, the typical bride price was just a few hundred dollars. Today, in some parts of China, the average is nearly $30,000, according to a survey by the People’s Daily newspaper.

That translates into huge pressure for young men like Li and their families. Indeed, helping to build Li’s house was another young man who was already feeling that pressure.

“There are very few girls here, and many girls from outside won’t want to marry into this village because it’s poor,” said 25-year-old Zhou Haijiang, as he laid the tiles in one of the house’s many bathrooms. Only a show of prosperity can attract, and hold, a bride.

“In our village, if you want to find a wife, you have to build a house.”

Zhou said he would like to stay in Paifeng all his life, but the pay isn’t good, and he will soon reluctantly join the tide of migrant workers heading for China’s booming megacities, in search of riches — and brides.

Many unmarried Chinese men have made their way to cities like Dongguan in southern China’s Pearl River Delta, a vast urban agglomeration nicknamed the “factory of the world.”

Their work ethic, their determination to succeed, is remarkable.

In a noodle shop close to a series of shoe factories, a 24-year-old who gave only his family name, Wang, was enjoying dinner with some friends. In between mouthfuls, he said he left his home in rural western China a decade ago and now works 11 or 12 hours a day, with just two days off a month.

He has already saved enough to build a house back in his home village, but is still struggling to find a wife.

“If you are picky, it’s hard,” he said. “There are also more boys here, and it is not necessarily easy to meet girls.”

27,27,FL-2018-000050-CHN,China is obsessed with stopping jaywalkers — and is now spraying them with water - Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-does-china-care-about-jaywalkers-2018-4,"One city in China has built bollards that spray jaywalkers with water, and tell pedestrians that ""Crossing is dangerous.""

The system also uses facial recognition technology to capture and shame wayward walkers.

Facial recognition technology is being used more frequently to target jaywalkers because of a high number of road fatalities and traffic jams.

But in an increasingly strict China, police may want to clamp down on overt law breakers.

Jaywalkers may soon lose points on their social credit score.

China is so desperate to stop jaywalkers it's turned to spraying them with water.

In Daye, in the central Hubei province, one pedestrian crossing has had a number of bright yellow bollards installed that spray wayward pedestrians' feet with water mist.

The pilot system works by using a laser sensor that identifies movement off the curb when the pedestrian light is still red. The bollard then emits its water spray, set to 26 degrees Celcius, and announces, ""Please do not cross the street, crossing is dangerous.""

Unsurprisingly, the bollards are also equipped with facial recognition technology and photographs of jaywalkers are displayed on a giant LED screen next to the crossing.

The use of facial-recognition technology is soaring in China where it is being used to increase efficiencies and improve policing. AI is being used to find fugitives, track people's regular hangouts, predict crime before it happens, but, most commonly, to stop jaywalkers.

While many Chinese cities are displaying jaywalkers' photos, names, and identification numbers on giant public screens, and even government websites, some cities are becoming more creative.

Shenzen has begun immediately texting jaywalkers after they commit their traffic infringement, while other cities only allow pedestrians to have their photos removed from public screens after helping a traffic officer for 20 minutes.

But why, of all crimes, does China focus so heavily on stopping jaywalkers?

Crossing roads in China can be very dangerous, and local governments are likely trying to minimize traffic jams and change pedestrians' behaviours for their own safety.

According to the World Health Organisation, China had more than 260,000 road traffic deaths in 2013.

An anecdotal contributor to this number appears to be the country's compensation system. In China, drivers who injure someone customarily pay expenses, but paying up to $50,000 for a funeral or burial is far cheaper than what may be life-long medical bills. So for some drivers its more frugal to ensure a victim is deceased.

There could also be less altruistic reasons for the clamp-down.

When one city built pedestrian gates at a busy intersection it was linked to attempts to strengthen ""public morals."" In a country where the government attempts to — and largely succeeds in — censoring its citizens behaviour in accordance with morality and socialist values, the constant flood of jaywalkers flaunting the law and creating havoc is hardly an ideal scenario.

And while the new water spray system seems like a light-hearted solution to these problems, the consequences could be severe.

If Daye's system is rolled out across the city, Global Times reported that the behaviour of repeat jaywalkers may lower offenders' social credit scores. People with low social credit scores can be blocked from travelling, applying for certain jobs, sending their kids to certain schools, and even throttling internet speeds.","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/5ad9367319ee8626008b4678?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['traffic', 'spray', 'china', 'jaywalkers', 'water', 'obsessed', 'pedestrians', 'social', 'system', 'stopping', 'technology', 'used', 'spraying']", 
28,28,FL-2018-000050-CHN,"China's upstart chip companies aim to topple Samsung, Intel and TSMC - Nikkei Asian Review",https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/China-s-upstart-chip-companies-aim-to-topple-Samsung-Intel-and-TSMC,"SHANGHAI/TAIPEI -- Business is booming at the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Museum.

For most of its nine-year history, the museum has been mostly a place for school children to learn about the uses of computer chips. But it has become a hot ticket for officials from all over China ever since Beijing declared that creating a world-leading semiconductor industry was a top national priority.

On a recent weekday this spring, Lance Long, the museum's director, was hosting a tour for officials from Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital known for being the world's most landlocked city. Before that, Long hosted groups from distant provinces such as Gansu and Yunnan and even Mongolia. All told, some 200 groups came last year for an education in China's next big thing.

""Many of these representatives knew very little about chips, but they all want to capture this once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity being led by high-ranked policymakers,"" Long told the Nikkei Asian Review.

This national enthusiasm reflects China's towering ambitions for its semiconductor industry. China, and its young chipmakers, are clear about their goal: to break the dominance of American, South Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese semiconductor companies. The government wants to create Chinese versions of most of the industry's leaders, then leapfrog them in the race for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence.

In March, Premier Li Keqiang named semiconductors as the top priority of the 10 industries China wants to foster in its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative. But China's ambitions were already clear in 2014 when it launched the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund -- better known as the Big Fund -- in 2014 with 138 billion yuan ($21.9 billion) in seed capital, which it hoped would turbocharge investment from local governments and the private sector. The Big Fund is in its second phase of fundraising for at least 150 billion yuan. Credit Suisse estimates China's total investment to be around $140 billion.

China wants to end its reliance on foreign technology -- its annual imports of $260 billion worth of semiconductor-related products have recently risen above its spending on oil. It also wants to move its manufacturing sector to higher-value products.

But there are also national security concerns. Chips serve as the brains for every electronic device -- from smartphones and PCs to connected cars and data centers -- and therefore have strong implications for intelligence. China wants to defend against the types of national security breaches exposed by Edward Snowden's 2013 leaks, which revealed connections between American technology providers and the U.S. National Security Agency's vast surveillance program.

This position is a mirror-image of the increasingly hard-line U.S. stance toward China. American regulators have cited national security concerns when it has curbed chip and other deals with Chinese groups, and has recently fired the opening shots in a trade war to penalize China for stealing high-tech intellectual property. To Beijing, such moves point to an all-out U.S. effort to slow China's aggressive attempt to become a new semiconductor superpower.

""The U.S. is really feeling the threat,"" said Jerry Peng, an analyst at research unit IEK of Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan.

There is no guarantee of success for China's chip push, however. The country's previous efforts to build a chip industry, including a major drive in the 1990s, were mostly unsuccessful. Its technology is far behind that of global giants such as Samsung Electronics and Intel, making China's goal of producing 75% of the chips it uses domestically by 2025 seem highly ambitious, analysts at Natixis say.

Unlike its previous efforts, when its investments were scattered and ill-placed, China is seeking to bring in expertise from the outside by luring foreign companies to set up advanced production facilities within its territories. This will help create a full supply chain and attract talent. The latest move by the U.S. to bar American companies from selling any components to ZTE, a Chinese telecom equipment provider and smartphone maker, has only strengthened China's determination to replace as many foreign suppliers as possible, according to multiple industry executives.

Analysts also say China has learned from its past mistakes.

""It's totally different from decades ago when China suffered through a frustrating experience to build semiconductors out of nowhere,"" Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein Research said. ""This time, it's a totally different story as the country has all the right ingredients, including a massive market and strong local makers of smartphones, TVs, PCs, and automobiles ... . It could be just a matter of time for them to bear fruit.""

Memory chip push

The first fruits of Beijing's big investment in chips could come as soon as the end of next year, when it will begin shipping its first batch of memory chips. Right now, China has yet to produce such chips in substantial volumes. But industry executives say Chinese memory chips could cause a major disruption in the market once its manufacturers are able to produce them in sufficient quantities, which they expect to happen in three to five years.

When that happens, it could have an impact on two markets: NAND flash memory and DRAM memory chips.

Production of global NAND flash memory-- a $58 billion market annually -- is controlled by only six companies: Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, Western Digital, SK Hynix, Micron Technology and Intel.

DRAMs are dominated by an even smaller group of companies: Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, which together held 95% of the $71 billion global market in 2017, according to Taipei-based research company TrendForce.

Helped by strong demand and tight supplies, Samsung and SK Hynix alone generated some $85 billion in memory chip sales in 2017, higher than the gross domestic product of Luxembourg. The combined semiconductor operating profit from both companies -- about $46 billion -- would be 1.6 times higher than what the two biggest Japanese companies, Toyota Motor and SoftBank Group, earned together in fiscal 2017.

""It's so unhealthy about the recent memory price hike, and it's so unfair that such important components are controlled by very few companies,"" a Chinese chip industry executive told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""The road could be bumpy, but we need to have our domestic memory chips for sure, and we wouldn't care at first whether we could make a profit or whether we cause a price crash in the market.""

A little-known state-backed conglomerate called Tsinghua Unigroup will play a key role in determining whether Chinese chipmakers can successfully challenge the dominance of Samsung, SK Hynix and Toshiba in the memory market.

Tsinghua initially tried to buy its way into the market, but its $23 billion bid to acquire Micron and a separate attempt to become the largest shareholder of Western Digital were blocked by the U.S. government. At the same time, the industry's dominant players were reluctant to license their technology to the aggressive latecomer. But those setbacks did not dampen Tsinghua's enthusiasm.

The group's affiliate, Yangtze Memory Technologies, is spending $24 billion to build the country's first advanced memory chip factories in the city of Wuhan. It has poached thousands of engineers from Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron and Nanya Technology, and on April 11, it began moving equipment into the factory.

Tsinghua Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo announced that the company should begin producing its first batch of 32-layer NAND flash memory chips this year. But Avril Wu, a longtime market watcher at TrendForce, said it is likely that Yangtze Memory will not be ready to ship the more advanced 64-layer chips, currently the industry standard, until the end of 2019 at the earliest.

Apple, the world's biggest consumer of NAND flash memory, recently visited Yangtze Memory to learn about its development status, according to people familiar with the matter. It is not clear whether the iPhone maker received pressure from China to evaluate a potential supply deal, but Apple will undoubtedly want to continue diversifying its memory chip suppliers in order to reduce its reliance on Samsung, multiple industry sources and analysts have said.

Roger Sheng, an analyst at Gartner, said Chinese memory chipmakers still have a long way to go before they make a dent in the market. Still, his company expects that in the NAND flash memory segment, Yangtze Memory could come to replace some low-end providers in three years and compete with first-tier players in five years.

Samsung Electronics CEO Kim Ki-nam and Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra are aware of China's offensive, but both say Chinese chipmakers face high technological barriers to entering the market. ""We recognize that the Chinese government is supporting [these emerging players] actively ... but it's difficult to narrow technological gaps in the short term solely through big investments,"" Samsung's Kim said at the company's annual general meeting in March.

The memory chip market is notoriously volatile, swinging between periods of supply shortages and serious gluts. Despite China's technological hurdles, executives from top memory chipmakers worry that Chinese companies could flood the market with cheap semiconductors, leading to a repeat of the massive oversupply that hit the industry a decade ago.

There may be good reason for such concern -- the planned capacity from China is huge. Yangtze Memory has set out to make 300,000 NAND flash wafers a month in years to come, equivalent to some 20% of current global output. ""Even if only some one-third or even less of [planned production] is realized in three to five years, it could cause a major price drop for memory chips and hurt the profitability of current suppliers,"" said Sean Yang, an analyst at Shanghai-based CINNO.

Chinese chipmakers will have the advantage of a vast end market of local gadget makers eager to use more domestic chips. Chinese brands controlled roughly 50% of the global smartphone market and 36% of the PC and tablet computer market in 2017, according to Gartner. Government agencies would also be first-wave adopters.

Another potential hurdle -- intellectual property, including chip design and production techniques -- is not a worry for Chinese chipmakers, analysts say. ""Intellectual property issues would never be a roadblock for these newcomers,"" said IEK's Peng. ""The most important task is to deliver the results, and even if there is any concerns with IPs, they can always later come back to negotiate with these big guys to settle the case with a certain license fee.""

A dilemma for foreign chipmakers

While IP may not be a worry for the Chinese companies, it is a very real concern for foreign chip giants such as Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and SK Hynix. Like companies in other sectors, high-tech groups are eager to have access to the Chinese market, but wary of handing over valuable technology secrets to state-sponsored competitors.

For China, bringing in as many world-class foreign chip producers as possible is the easiest way to achieve its goal of cultivating a supply chain ecosystem to support its new industry.

""For the longer term, expanding advanced production sites in China could be a trade-off for the existing players because they are potentially helping their competitors,"" said a Taiwanese chip industry executive who asked not to be named. ""It's like these newcomers can go to Harvard or MIT near their home rather than going abroad.""

TSMC, for instance, has spent $3 billion on an advanced 12-inch chip facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing, which began production ahead of schedule in April. The world's No. 1 contract chipmaker relies on Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia and other U.S. clients for 60% of its revenue, but Chinese customers are its fastest growing, making up some 11% of sales in 2017, up from 9% the previous year.

Not far away from TSMC's Nanjing facility, Tsinghua Unigroup is planning to build a $30 billion megasite the size of 2,380 basketball courts to produce memory chips. The Tsinghua project would benefit from any suppliers that TSMC brings to the community.

""It's very difficult for emerging players to secure good support from best-in-class chip equipment and material suppliers, but foreign chipmakers would bring a whole cluster of them even to some distant cities should they have a facility there,"" said Gartner's Sheng. ""And these foreign chipmakers could help us train a huge group of engineers that could later work for local Chinese companies.""

This complicated dynamic will only be exacerbated once homegrown Chinese chipmakers make it to the global stage.

""We will see more and more conflicts of interests later -- between countries and also between local and foreign suppliers later,"" said CINNO's Yang. ""This ongoing trade friction between the U.S. and China is just one example.""

Russia paired with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year in cutting oil output jointly by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), a deal they say has largely rebalanced the market and one that has helped elevate benchmark Brent prices LCOc1 close to four-year highs.

Now, the relatively high prices brought about by that pact, coupled with surging U.S. output, are making it harder to sell Russian, Nigerian and other oil grades in Europe, traders said.

“U.S. oil is on offer everywhere,” said a trader with a Mediterranean refiner, who regularly buys Russian and Caspian Sea crude and has recently started purchasing U.S. oil. “It puts local grades under a lot of pressure.”

U.S. oil output is expected to hit 10.7 million bpd this year, rivaling that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

In April, U.S. supplies to Europe are set to reach an all-time high of roughly 550,000 bpd (around 2.2 million tonnes), according to the Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows monitor.

(GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supply to Europe - reut.rs/2F8xk0k)

In January-April, U.S. supplies jumped four-fold year-on-year to 6.8 million tonnes, or 68 large Aframax tankers, according to the same data.

Trade sources said U.S. flows to Europe would keep rising, with U.S. barrels increasingly finding homes in foreign refineries, often at the expense of oil from OPEC or Russia.

In 2017, Europe took roughly 7 percent of U.S. crude exports, Reuters data showed, but the proportion has already risen to roughly 12 percent this year.

Top destinations include Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, with traders pointing to large imports by BP, Exxon Mobil and Valero.

(GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supplies to Europe in 2017-2018 by destination - reut.rs/2F9lWRO)

Polish refiners PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos and Norway’s Statoil are sampling U.S. grades, while other new buyers are likely, David Wech of Vienna-based JBC Energy consultancy said.

“There are a number of customers who still may test U.S. crude oil,” Wech said.

The gains for U.S. suppliers could come as a welcome development for U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused OPEC on Friday of “artificially” boosting oil prices.

“Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

‘KEY SUPPLY SOURCE’

While the United States lifted its oil export ban in late 2015, the move took time to gain traction among Europe’s traditional refineries, which were slow to diversify away from crude from the North Sea, West Africa and the Caspian.

“European refiners started experimenting with U.S. crude last year,” said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of London-based consultancy Resource Economics. “Now, they know more than enough to process this crude.”

U.S. oil gained in popularity, sources said, in part because of the wide gap between West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, and dated Brent, which is more expensive and sets the price for most of the world’s crude grades.

This gap, known as the Brent/WTI spread, has averaged $4.46 per barrel this year, nearly twice as high as the year-earlier figure, Reuters data showed.

Wech of JBC Energy said the spread would likely persist in the near future.

The most popular U.S. grades in Europe are WTI, Light Louisiana Sweet, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mars.

Prices for alternative local grades have been slashed as a result.

CPC Blend differentials recently hit a six-year low versus dated Brent at minus $2 a barrel. Russia's Urals also came under pressure despite the end of seasonal refinery maintenance. BFO-CPCBFO-URL-EBFO-URL-NWE

WTI was available at 80-90 cent premiums delivered to Italy’s Augusta, well below offers of Azeri BTC at a premium of $1.60 a barrel, according to trading sources.

U.S. oil is even edging out North Sea Forties, which is produced in the backyard of the continent’s refineries.

Cargoes of WTI were offered in Rotterdam at premiums of around 50-60 cents a barrel above dated Brent, cheaper than Forties’ premium of 75 cents to dated.","Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180424&t=2&i=1254766283&r=LYNXMPEE3M0YO&w=800,"['grades', 'crude', 'revenge', 'russia', 'oil', 'hurting', 'sea', 'dated', 'europe', 'floods', 'barrel', 'brent', 'opec', 'high', 'million', 'trumps']",

Andy Home - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aluminium-sanctions-ahome/china-the-highly-problematic-savior-of-the-global-aluminum-market-andy-home-idUSKBN1HP2A3,"LONDON (Reuters) - The shocks from the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Oleg Deripaska and his UC Rusal aluminum empire are still rolling through the market.

After Rio Tinto last week flagged it was declaring force majeure on some raw material contracts, it warned today of potential “adjustments” to its aluminum guidance this year due to the sanctions.

Some of Japan’s major trading houses, meanwhile, have asked Rusal to stop shipping aluminum for fear of secondary sanctions.

Japan imports around 300,000 tonnes of Russian aluminum every year, equivalent to around 16 percent of its total import needs.

Aluminum’s previously well-filled supply chain is starting to crack along multiple fault lines.

As supply fears grow, the market’s attention is turning to China as a potential source of aluminum.

There are almost a million tonnes of the stuff sitting in warehouses registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE). That metal will flow out of China if the price is right.

But China’s role as supplier of last resort is heavily laden with irony given the political push back against its exports of aluminum products.

The world’s largest producer is also suffering from its own supply-chain turbulence.

Graphic on London and Shanghai aluminum relative price performance:

tmsnrt.rs/2JWSBO3

OPENING THE ARBITRAGE WINDOW

In London the price of aluminum has been on a rocket-propelled charge since the U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions on April 6.

At a current $2,527 per tonne London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month aluminum has gained over $500 in the space of under two weeks.

That has opened up a widening gap with Shanghai prices, which have reacted only mutedly to the excitement in London.

However, still higher prices will be needed for Chinese aluminum to leave the country and fill the supply gaps opening up in the rest of the world, according to analysts at CRU.

That’s because exports of primary metal from China are subject to a 15 percent export tax, unlike exports of products which qualify for VAT rebates.

Depending on market dynamics in both London and Shanghai, CRU is looking for prices to approach $3,000 to unlock the 991,780 tonnes of metal sitting in ShFE warehouses.

But this is what will be necessary if Rusal’s own exports out of Russia are blocked.

CRU was already anticipating a supply shortfall of around 1.8 million tonnes outside of China before the sanctions, according to CRU’s head of primary and products research, Eoin Dinsmore.

Throw in the potential loss of 200,000-230,000 tonnes of monthly exports from Russia and there would be “a critical need” for Chinese metal.

Goldman Sachs agrees, arguing that a complete cessation of Rusal exports could lift prices to as high as $3,200. (“Quantifying upside risks from Russian Sanctions”, April 18, 2018).

The bank’s view is that Rusal will be restructured to bypass sanctions and allow both production and exports to continue but it has still lifted its price forecasts to factor in the uncertainty.

METAL NOT PRODUCTS

The irony here is that China is already a huge exporter, not of primary aluminum but rather of aluminum in the form of semi-manufactured products.

Indeed, such has been the flood of products out of the country that up to now the big issue for everyone else has been how to stop China exporting so much not how to stimulate it to export more.

The United States has led the political push back against Chinese product exports, which rose another 4 percent last year to an annual record of 4.24 million tonnes.

President Donald Trump has signed off on a 10-percent import tax on all imports of aluminum with China firmly in the administration’s sights.

Separately, the United States is still slapping anti-dumping duties on specific Chinese products.

Aluminum foil has already been hit with swingeing countervailing duties and the net has just been widened to include aluminum alloy sheet.

This is the dilemma for the rest the world. It now desperately needs Chinese exports of primary metal to rebalance the market but simultaneously still needs lower exports of products.

CHINESE TURBULENCE

China’s own aluminum production sector, meanwhile, is experiencing plenty of its own turbulence.

The closure last year of “illegal” capacity, meaning that operating without all the correct permits, and mandated curtailments at some plants during the winter smog campaign have slowed production growth to just 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018.

It’s true that the winter heating season cuts have disappointed aluminum bulls.

But the environmental pressure on the aluminum smelting sector shows no signs of letting up any time soon.

Adding new uncertainty is a draft proposal from the National Development and Reform Commission targeting aluminum producers drawing their power from captive coal plants and stipulating retroactive power payments to the government.

Hongqiao, the world’s largest aluminum producer and one that is heavily reliant on coal, could be particularly vulnerable.

At this stage the proposal is no more than that and there is likely plenty of wriggle-room for such a big industrial powerhouse and employer.

But the key takeaway here is that Beijing’s scrutiny of its aluminum sector is only getting sharper as it targets both excessive capacity and polluting industries.

At any other time in recent history China’s giant smelter sector could have been relied upon to lift production in response to rocketing prices.

Right now, however, price is only part of a more complex landscape defined by “illegal” capacity closures, winter curtailments and, now, the longer-term viability of coal as a source of the power needed to produce the metal.

THE PRICE OF EXCESS

The global aluminum industry continues to pay the price of Chinese excess.

With over half of the world’s aluminum production concentrated in one country, there is no cushion outside of China to compensate for diminished flows of metal from Rusal.

Moreover, what is clearly available right now in China, namely the million tonnes sitting in Shanghai warehouses, is trapped behind China’s export tax.

What is flowing in ever increasing quantities out of China is in the wrong form for the rest of the world, which now needs more primary aluminum and less product.

This problematic reliance on China has been growing for many years but it’s taken the hit on the largest non-Chinese producer to expose the dysfunctional nature of the global aluminum supply chain.

31,31,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Xinjiang Snow Scientists Dig Deep for Climate Change Clues - Sixth Tone,https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1002106/xinjiang-snow-scientists-dig-deep-for-climate-change-clues,"XINJIANG, Northwest China — The researchers’ SUV broke down on a muddy slope, leaving the team of 11 with only two vehicles. It was a race against time: The snow in the Tianshan Mountains had started melting in mid-February, more than a week earlier than usual. It was now early March, and the scientists from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography (XIEG) were just starting their trip to study the ice crystals before they all turned to water.

Known as the “water tower of Central Asia,” the Tianshan mountain range cuts Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region into north and south. Runoff from the mountains contributes half the water supply for arid Xinjiang — where annual precipitation reaches only a quarter of the country’s average.

But rising temperatures could make the region’s already-harsh climate even less hospitable. Accelerated glacial melting has been documented in Xinjiang, with worrying implications for the local water supply. The Tianshan Mountains have seen greater snowfall, which could increase the intensity and frequency of phenomena like blizzards, avalanches, and flooding.

You will never find the same snowflake that you saw two days ago, as it is always changing. - Li Lanhai, snow researcher

Though the effects of climate change on the region have so far been relatively minor, temperatures in Xinjiang have risen faster than the global average over the past 50 years. And despite the importance of snow from the Tianshan Mountains to local communities — a third of the mountain range’s precious runoff comes from snow — there is a shortage of reliable data due to the region’s remoteness and a lack of funding in the past, according to professor Li Lanhai of the XIEG, who leads the Tianshan research team.

The Tianshan snow survey is part of a national investigation on snow characteristics and distribution that hopes to help China better adapt to climate change, manage water resources, and predict snow-related disasters. The survey began last year and will run until 2020, to the tune of 23.9 million yuan ($3.8 million). Li’s team hope their findings will also contribute much-needed improvements to China’s snow remote-sensing system, which provides snow data and satellite images for use in fields like climate research, water management, and weather prediction.

Li, 54, is a sturdy-looking man who wears a winter coat the color of sand. He has a penchant for drinking Chinese liquor at dinner to keep himself warm in the freezing mountains; just a sip of the pungent spirit turns his square face red and loosens his tongue.

Born into a farming family in eastern China’s Jiangxi province, which rarely sees snow, Li became fascinated with the precipitation upon seeing his first proper snowfall at age 12. The village turned white overnight, and Li remembers observing his first snowflake up close: It was hexagonal, just like in comic books.

After studying agriculture, ecology, and snow hydrology at universities in China and abroad, Li was invited to Xinjiang 10 years ago by a deputy head at the XIEG, and he has remained there ever since.

When the Tianshan snow survey team began their trip during the melting period in March, the snow on the sunny slopes had been receding for weeks in some places, revealing dirt, sand, and the occasional mammoth red characters painted in a bygone era: “Be loyal to Chairman Mao. Long live Chairman Mao.”

Starting from Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, the team circled the middle range of the Tianshan Mountains, traveling over 2,400 kilometers across 18 cities and counties to survey snow in forests, lakes, desert, farmland, and grassland. It was their third field study, following similar trips in the snow accumulation and stability phases in January — when temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius froze instruments and car engines.

With no snow, there is not enough water. - Dailigeer, Xinjiang resident

Most of the researchers are graduate and doctoral students Li supervises at the institute, specializing in fields like snow physics and climate modeling. “Take a close look at these new snowflakes. Each one looks magical to me. Their shape and water content offer so much information,” doctoral researcher Yang Tao tells Sixth Tone.

Yang and fellow 26-year-old researcher Chen Ditao are usually the first to start digging at a sampling site. After using a ruler to measure the depth of the snow cover, Chen inserts needle-like temperature sensors, while Yang collects snow in a matchbox-sized iron container to measure its density. Meanwhile, other researchers measure the snow’s hardness and water content, and take samples to analyze the snow’s makeup, including materials like pollutants.

“Snow is unpredictable,” Li says. “You will never find the same snowflake that you saw two days ago, as it is always changing.”

In Bayanbulak, in the southern part of the mountain range, the team stops for dinner at the only restaurant open in the winter. The eatery is run by 40-year-old ethnic Mongolian Dailigeer and her family, who explain the importance of snow to their livelihoods.

“With no snow, there is not enough water,” Dailigeer tells Sixth Tone while preparing noodles for the survey team. Aside from managing the restaurant, Dailigeer’s family raise around 500 sheep; on winter days without sufficient snow, they are forced to buy water to feed their livestock, which puts a dent in their already-meager income. Snow blanketing the grassland also protects vegetation from severe cold, crop diseases, and insect pests.

But it’s a precarious balance: “Very heavy snow also does no good,” Dailigeer’s husband interjects, explaining that livestock can’t find grass to eat if it’s covered by thick snowdrifts. Snow can also be destructive: Rapid melting this year contributed to a flash flood that damaged villagers’ houses just days before the research team arrived, according to a village official who declined to give his name, as he was not authorized to speak to media.

Local farming and herding families reveal the human impact of the scientists’ survey, as they’re among those hit hardest by Xinjiang’s changing precipitation patterns. The survival of their communities relies on stable snowfall in the Tianshan Mountains: As a local saying goes, “A timely snow promises a good harvest.”

32,32,FL-2018-000050-CHN,China’s Weibo Reverses Gay Content Ban in Surprise Win for LGBT Community - Hollywood Reporter,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/chinas-weibo-reverses-gay-content-ban-surprise-win-lgbt-community-1102931/,"Bowing to a wave of popular backlash, Chinese social media giant Sina Weibo has reversed a briefly instated ban on gay content. The move represents a rare, possibly unprecedented, win for China’s nascent LGBT rights movement.

Weibo, often referred to as “China’s Twitter,” issued new guidelines last Friday saying that it would begin deleting all gay-themed cartoons and videos, along with violent and pornographic material. The company said the initiative was an effort to “create a sunny and harmonious community environment,” in compliance with Beijing’s cyber security laws.

But the decision appears to have been out of touch with the widespread growing social tolerance for LGBT rights in China’s major cities. By late Friday, the hashtags #iamgay and #iamgaynotapervert had gone viral on the service, with users posting photos with their partners, angry comments and rainbow emojis.

In one post that was liked some 60,000 times, a woman in Shanghai wrote: “I am the mother of a gay son. My son and I love our country. No matter where we go we tell others loudly and proudly that we are from China…. But today…I suddenly [find] that in this strong country, Sina Weibo is discriminating against and attacking this sexual minority.”

Weibo initially attempted to tamp down the protests by deleting the posts, but by late Monday it had made the decision to reverse course, saying that gay-themed content would no longer be targeted by the “clean-up” effort.

“We thank all for your discussions and suggestions,” it said in a brief statement posted to its website.

Homosexuality is not illegal in China, and the country’s big cities boast vibrant, semi-open gay scenes. But Beijing’s official stance toward depictions of homosexuality in the media is repressive, if inconsistently enforced. Late last month, the state-backed Beijing International Film Festival abruptly cut the Oscar-winning gay romance Call Me by Your Name from its lineup. Gay-themed content has been barred from television in the country for years, and a controversial set of guidelines introduced last year placed a similar ban in the online streaming space.

Yet exceptions have occasionally been made. The widely discussed “gay moment” in Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast was allowed to run uncensored in Chinese cinemas last year, and state newspaper The People’s Daily even celebrated the decision on Weibo, posting: “Controversial gay moment kept in Disney’s #BeautyAndTheBeast…requires no guidance for minor audience.” Barry Jenkins’ gay-themed Oscar Moonlight was similarly allowed to stream last year on iQiyi, a local Netflix-like platform.

On Saturday, “The Gay Voice,” a popular Weibo page devoted to gay rights issues and gay art, announced to its 230,000-plus followers that it would suspend posting due to an “event of force majeure.” The reference to Weibo’s repressive guidelines from Friday prompted a flood of popular support, with users of all backgrounds taking up and retweeting the #iamgay hashtag throughout the weekend.

“I feel totally surprised and touched,” Hua Zile, the page’s founder told CNN on Monday in response to the rule reversal.

“Seven years ago, not that many people were willing to make their voices heard this way,” he added. “It’s amazing to see this happen now, with everyone — straight or gay, celebrities or ordinary people — using the hashtag and joining in.”","Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-696802186.jpg?w=1024,"['late', 'community', 'posting', 'country', 'reverses', 'guidelines', 'gaythemed', 'win', 'decision', 'weibo', 'ban', 'popular', 'content', 'surprise', 'gay', 'rights', 'lgbt', 'chinas']",

""It was a spectacular hike,"" said Lani Rupp, 24, of Honolulu. ""The first two days was so beautiful and nice. The valley makes you feel like you are in a fantasy world.""

Rupp and her group of over 20 friends met Wednesday for their weekend of backpacking, but by Friday evening their adventure took a turn for the worst.

""The ocean was raging and the rain and lightning was immense,"" Rupp said. ""Most of us got soaked and couldn't sleep because we were cold and tired.""

34,34,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Cancer Breakthrough Leads China's Biotech Boom - OZY,https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/cancer-breakthrough-leads-chinas-biotech-boom/86161/,"Because a new arena for competition between the world’s two big powers is opening up.

A few days before Craig Chase was discharged from the Jiangsu Provincial People’s Hospital in Nanjing, his doctor told him something he never expected to hear: His cancer had been cured.

“His English was not so good, so he used Google Translate. When he said I was cured, I told him it was impossible — there is no cure for multiple myeloma,” he recalls. “But he said, ‘No, you’re definitely cured.’ It was unbelievable.” Unbelievable, perhaps, but also true. When Chase, now 57, returned home to America after his six weeks of treatment in China to undergo further tests, his doctors could find no trace of multiple myeloma. The blood cancer he had suffered for three years — which had threatened to end his life — was gone.

Wealthy Chinese people often travel to the United States for health care, but it is rare to hear of someone going the other way. Indeed, Chase was the first American to be treated at the Jiangsu hospital, where he underwent an experimental procedure known as chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy, or CAR-T.

The data were almost too good to believe. Peter Lebowitz, head of oncology research at Johnson & Johnson’s drug-making division

As biotech has gone from strength to strength over the past four decades, China has been a backwater for the industry, tending to follow the west rather than pursuing its own innovations. But it is now rapidly emerging as a world leader in cell therapies like CAR-T, which try to treat and even cure illness by hacking the body’s biology. There are already more clinical trials in the country than in the U.S., and executives and scientists say it has several strategic advantages that could allow China to challenge U.S. dominance, including an accommodating regulatory regime, low labor costs and expertise in precision manufacturing.

“The Chinese companies I have met are determined to become leaders in this,” says Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Exchange Traded Fund, who recently returned from a trip to the country. “These treatments have the potential to be highly disruptive to medicine, and I think they view it as a unique opportunity as new contenders to spring to the forefront of the biotech industry.”

At a time when President Donald Trump is fretting about Beijing’s plans to dominate the industries of the future, China’s push to become the preeminent destination for cell therapies and other evolving technologies such as gene editing would represent a major shift in modern medicine and an important marker in the growing technological competition between the U.S. and China.

CAR-T “is among the few corners of biotech in which China may have a chance to compete globally in the near to medium term … and even leapfrog global pace in certain targets,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report this year.

Chase’s visit to China was not without its jarring moments. On one occasion in Nanjing, his doctor used an herbal wrap to reduce a large swelling in his ankle. “It smelled like an Italian lunch,” recalls Chase, a paper broker, though he says it seemed to work rather well.

This low-tech anecdote belies the fact that CAR-T is at the cutting edge of biology: It involves extracting a patient’s blood cells, reengineering them in a lab so they can identify and destroy cancer and then re-inserting them into the body.

There are already two CAR-T products for rare types of leukemia on the market in the U.S., made by Novartis, the Swiss pharma company, and Gilead, the west coast biotech group. But the treatment is still in its infancy and many scientists in the field believe the biggest advances are yet to come. The next big target is multiple myeloma, after which companies are expected to turn their attention to solid cancers and even infectious diseases like HIV.

Research into CAR-T in China has exploded in recent years. There are currently 116 clinical trials registered in the country, according to a U.S. government database, compared with 96 in the U.S. and 15 in Europe, giving it a lead that would have been unthinkable when the treatment was first discovered.

“It was zero when we started [human trials] in 2010,” says Carl June, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who helped develop the earliest CAR-Ts. “Then they caught up with us, and now they have surpassed us.”

Although the Trump administration’s recently proposed trade tariffs have targeted raw pharmaceutical ingredients from China, they would have a negligible effect on the country’s ability to pursue and export the cell and gene therapies of the future.

***

Chase first heard about the particular CAR-T that would rid him of cancer after a large clinical trial of the treatment was published last June at the world’s most prestigious oncology meeting. The gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology takes place each year in a conference center by Lake Michigan, where 30,000 researchers and doctors from around the world pore over studies sponsored by the biggest pharma companies in cancer.

But the most eye-catching research at last year’s conference was presented by a Chinese biotech group that virtually no one had heard of: Nanjing Legend.

In a study of 35 Chinese multiple myeloma patients who had all relapsed and were no longer responding to drugs, 33 participants had entered remission within two months of being treated. The response rate of 94 percent was among the highest seen for a CAR-T trial.

Excitement over the trial soon turned to disbelief in some quarters, in part because Legend was such an unfamiliar name, but also because it was based in China. Some delegates at the conference told the Financial Times that data from a company based in a country that fiddles its economic growth figures could not be trusted.

But Chase, who had spent five months on the waiting list for a CAR-T trial in the U.S., investigated Legend, spoke to its executives and decided it was a credible company.

One of his doctors was worried about how a Chinese hospital would handle the toxic and sometimes fatal side effects of CAR-T — the excessive production of immune cells known as the “cytokine storm” — but he reasoned they would do as much as they could to keep him alive. A month later, he caught a flight to Shanghai. “I knew they were setting up to peddle this drug in the U.S., so they’re not going to take an American into their trial program and send him home in a body bag,” he says.

He was not the only one to take note of the data published at Asco. Investors snapped up shares in Legend’s parent company, Hong Kong–listed GenScript, which have appreciated sixfold since the positive study. Legend also piqued the interest of executives at Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest health care company. The big pharma group had been looking for a way to enter the race to develop a CAR-T for multiple myeloma, and was stunned by the trial results.

“The clinical data looked superior to anything else we’d seen,” says Peter Lebowitz, who heads up oncology research at Janssen, J&J’s drug-making division. “The data were almost too good to believe.”

But over the next few months, Lebowitz and his colleagues made several trips to China to carry out due diligence and became confident that Legend’s CAR-T, codenamed LCAR-B38M, was a “spectacular asset.” In December, the pair struck a deal. J&J paid Legend $350 million to enter an agreement whereby the companies will share the costs of developing the CAR-T and split the profits if it is approved by regulators in the U.S. and China.

Lebovitz thinks LCAR-B38M could be superior to a rival CAR-T being developed in a partnership by Bluebird Bio and Celgene, two U.S.-based biotech companies, which is generally seen as the most advanced product in the race to tackle multiple myeloma.

One reason could be that Legend’s CAR-T binds to two spots on the cancer-causing protein, he says. “If you’re going to grab a basketball, then it’s easier to grab with two hands than one.”

Even if Legend’s CAR-T turns out to be better than its U.S. rival, however, it could be something of an outlier. Researchers in both countries say that despite the surge in research, China is still playing scientific catchup. “Legend is the exception,” says June. “The rest are just Xeroxing what we’re doing in the U.S. — there’s not much innovation yet.”

Yang Ling, founder of PersonGen Biomedicine, a Chinese CAR-T group, agrees. “On a technical level, our country is basically following the trend in blood tumors.”

However, some biotech groups are breaking new ground. There are more than 20 CAR-T trials targeting solid tumors in the lungs, liver, pancreas, breasts and ovaries. Treatment of such cancers is a priority for CAR-T companies given the vastly higher numbers of people affected by them.

Innovative Cellular Therapeutics, a Shanghai-based biotech group that counts Japan’s SoftBank among its investors, says it has also made significant progress toward turning CAR-T into an off-the-shelf product rather than a treatment that is made for each individual patient. Moving from the current “autologous” model — which uses the patient’s own cells — to an “allogeneic” approach that uses donor cells is seen as a major step in reducing the cost and complexity of the treatment.

“We were followers at the beginning, but we have the potential to be a leader,” says ICT founder Xiao Yang.

***

The CAR-T boom is fueled by a flood of investment — reaching $10 billion last year — into Chinese biotech companies, often founded by Chinese-born scientists returning from overseas. Such founders say it is easier to obtain funding in China than the U.S.

With an aging population, unhealthy lifestyles and pollution, China has a world-leading incidence of cancer, with 4.3 million cases diagnosed in 2015, twice the 2000 figure. That makes recruiting patients for trials easier and is potentially a huge source of demand.

China also has strategic strengths, such as cheaper overheads and a high-tech manufacturing industry that could help push down the high cost of making a CAR-T for each individual patient. The bespoke nature of the process — which is for the most part done by hand — has resulted in record prices for the treatment, which costs up to $475,000 per person in the U.S.

This worries Chinese patients whose incomes are generally much lower than in the U.S. Zhang Qi, one of Legend’s trial patients in China, says, “Everyone was very anxious after the drug went on sale in the U.S.,” because costs of even RMB 1 million ($158,000) would be “a huge burden for any Chinese person.”

Nanjing Legend’s chief executive, Frank Zhang, who earned a PhD at Duke and worked for seven years for a U.S. pharmaceuticals company, says prices could be lower in China as manufacturing costs for CAR-T can be one-sixth of those in the U.S.

Around 30 Chinese companies involved in CAR-T trials are building a total of more than 10,000 square meters of dedicated manufacturing facilities, often with local government subsidies.

Vasant Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, the first company to launch a CAR-T, says his group could end up turning to Chinese companies to help produce its treatments. “There’s no question there’s very strong expertise in China on automation, roboticization and miniaturization,” he says. “We want to tap into it if the quality is there.”

June says Tmunity, a company he recently founded, could also carry out research in China, noting that many of the country’s biologists trained at universities in the U.S. before returning home — but can conduct experiments at a much lower cost. If China continues to do such a huge amount of research, it will eventually lead to important breakthroughs.

“Part of the discovery process is just doing the human trials and studying the things that come out,” he says. “They’ll make new unexpected observations, and that will lead to new intellectual property. That’s what happens if you do enough experiments.”","Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.ozy.com/ozy-prod/2019/07/h_15039765.jpg?width=1200&height=630,"['cart', 'chinese', 'biotech', 'treatment', 'company', 'cancer', 'trial', 'boom', 'breakthrough', 'china', 'trials', 'research', 'leads', 'companies', 'chinas']",

Although Cape Town was in the midst of a drought and winter rainfall patterns could not be predicted with certainty, flooding was a known hazard in the city and a number of departments were working hard to mitigate the impact of such incidents in the coming months, mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services JP Smith said.

Historically, Cape Town was known for experiencing cut-off low pressure systems during the winter months that resulted in heavy rainfall and flash floods. The risks were increased when such conditions coincided with the spring tide, as was the case in June 2017, resulting in storm damage, including structural collapses, power outages, and uprooted trees in various areas of the metropole, he said.

To mitigate the impact of severe weather episodes, a number of city departments participated in the annual winter readiness preparations under the banner of the flooding and storms task team chaired by the city’s Disaster Risk Management Centre.

This year, the task team had identified various risks relating to the hazard of flooding, including:

- 29 informal settlements, mostly situated along the N2 strip and Khayelitsha, were considered high-risk because of their location. Some of these were situated in wetlands, ponds, and natural water-courses, and would need to be relocated to higher ground;

- Parts of the N1, N2, and R300 highways had also been identified as flood risks. Roadworks to mitigate these risks were under way; and

- Mountain slopes in the Helderberg, South Peninsula, and Table Mountain range that had been stripped of stabilising vegetation by fires were a risk for flooding or mudslides.

""The respective departments are working hard to address the risks, but are also doing general maintenance like cleaning of stormwater and river systems, pruning of trees and shrubs, and public education and awareness drives on how to safeguard homes, particularly in informal settlements, from flooding and related risks,"" Smith said.

""Residents are given practical tips on how to raise floor levels, divert flood waters, and reduce health hazards associated with stagnant water. We also call on private homeowners to assess their risk. For example, if they live close to mountainous areas it is probably wise to consider sandbags in the event of flooding or mudslides; and to ensure that their properties are maintained to reduce weather-related risks,"" he said.

Some tips for private homeowners included clearing gutters of debris such as leaves, ensuring that roofs and chimneys were waterproofed, trimming tree branches that could potentially fall and cause damage or injury, having chimneys and fireplaces cleaned as accumulated debris could pose a fire hazard, and ensuring that personal and building insurance was up to date.

""We have no clear sense yet of how wet it will be this winter. The Disaster Risk Management Centre is still awaiting a long-range weather forecast from the South African Weather Service. Given our desperate need for rain to counter the crippling drought, we are obviously hoping for above average rainfall, but that comes with its own challenges. It is therefore imperative that everyone does their bit to ensure that we are ready for winter,"" Smith said.

Article content It was on May 3 of last year that Christine Smith saw her house floating away, literally lifted off its foundation in Constance Bay by the Ottawa River’s unstoppable floodwaters. For good measure, the foundation crumbled as well. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Constance Bay battles back from the flood, with help from Mennonites Back to video All up and down the shore, homes were inundated by cold, muddy water that brought dirt and, after the flood receded, mould. Many houses were damaged, but the home where the Smiths lived for 16 years was destroyed. “We lost it all. Everything,” Christine said Saturday. Theirs was originally a summer cottage, built in 1957 and turned into a year-round home later, which meant it was low and vulnerable to flooding. A little way east along the river, Kara Shaw-Plourde and her two daughters — aged seven and nine at the time — were also devastated by the loss of their house. Shaw-Plourde had no thought that they would ever be able to move back to the area. “The only thing that ran through my head was bankruptcy,” she said.

Article content One year has changed everything. On Saturday, there were brief but emotional dedication ceremonies for two homes built this winter for the Smith and Shaw-Plourde families — built mostly by volunteers, many of them total strangers from hundreds of kilometres away. “We’re so happy right now. It’s amazing,” Christine Smith said. “A year ago today we didn’t know what we were going today,” Jeff said. Their new home stands much higher on a concrete foundation, with only a crawl space below ground so that if water does get in it will not reach drywall or carpeting, which could cause mould. But the Smiths don’t think another flood would get through the new raised foundation. “It would take a tsunami now to wet this house,” Jeff said.

Article content How this came to pass is a story about a small army of volunteers from Mennonite Disaster Relief who contacted the Constance Bay community a couple of weeks after the flooding and asked whether they could come and help. And on Saturday, with nearly a year’s work behind them, the Mennonites came back to celebrate in the April sunshine at the community centre. Heather Lucente, a volunteer in Constance Bay who took on the role of relief director after the flood, remembers when the Mennonites contacted the community out of the blue last year. “MDS came to us in the springtime, a couple of weeks after the flooding,” Lucente said. Photo by Ashley Fraser / Postmedia They began by offering to do the dirty, physical work of ripping out everything that had been under water.

Article content “They were ripping out old drywall and helping to move contents as well as repairing them. There were about 50 houses in Constance Bay that the Mennonites came and helped to do repairs on,” Lucente said. “So the donations that the community centre raised went to buying materials, and MDS raised their volunteers to do the labour, re-insulating basements and doing drywalling, fixing up pumps, things like that.” They came “from all over Ontario.” But when the cleanup phase was finished, the volunteers were just getting started. “My biggest surprise was when they came back to us in September (after their earlier cleanup work) and said, ‘We would like to help rebuild these two houses,’ ” she recalls. “But they said, ‘The catch is we can only do it this winter.’ ”

Article content That put the project on a schedule through the coldest time of year. “We thought, ‘Oh, my goodness! How can we possibly do this?’ But here we are today and sure enough these houses are rebuilt. … I feel very blessed to have met everyone.” “Some volunteers would leave their homes in Southern Ontario at one in the morning. They would drive up … they worked all through the day. They worked in minus-25 (Celsius) with the wind blowing. It was so cold. They were framing the houses. They worked all day and then they drove home that night.” The Smiths’ new home stands on a high concrete foundation without windows, above the level of last spring’s flood. Its lower level is a bare crawl space, with no drywall or other absorbent materials that could soak up and hold water if it were to flood.

Article content “Now we have a house that is impervious to flood damage. … The basement is able to handle water influx and be dried out,” said Lucente. “They were just like a pack of army ants. It was just work, work, work,” Jeff Smith said. “They’re tougher than I am, that’s for sure.” The area is in the 100-year floodplain, so there isn’t a question of whether owners are allowed rebuild or not. The new homes only have to be flood-resistant. Nick Hamm, who lives in the Niagara area, is part of the Ontario chapter of Mennonite Disaster Service, and he spoke at the two dedication ceremonies Saturday. “As Christians, we feel that we are called to serve our neighbours, whether the neighbour is here in Constance Bay or in our backyard. That is what we do,” he said. “We do this in the U.S. and Canada. We’ve been doing this for almost 70 years.”

He tallied about 200 volunteers during the cleanup and construction phases combined with a total of 600 volunteer days of work. Some local contractors were also prominent in the work, in particular Marco Scapillati Flooring from Nepean. The construction happened in winter because the volunteers are largely contractors and farmers who have more time to offer in winter. Photo by Tony Caldwell / Postmedia Network Kara Shaw-Plourde’s home is basically finished but there is no septic system yet. She hopes she will be able to move into it in June. “It’s a pretty emotional day,” she said. “We started out with tears of sadness, and now it’s tears of joy. We are so excited to move in.”

She also remembers watching the volunteers in the cold. “Some of the Mennonite framers, when they were putting the trusses on, had frostbitten hands,” she said. Photo by Tony Caldwell / Postmedia Network Len Russell of the Constance Bay Community Association summed up the year’s work in an email: “April 21 marks the end of MDS’s West Carleton engagement which started with 21 volunteers assisting residents clean up and grew to 55 in the repair phase and finally 107 men and women for rebuilding; their gift to our community exceeds 5,000 volunteer hours and the cost of food, transportation, and equipment,” he wrote. He said the volunteers and donors “filled the significant gaps between the government, Red Cross, and insurance responses. The volunteer response helped 350 of the 513 West Carleton families affected and accelerated the recovery of 138 families, including 32 helped directly by MDS. Unfortunately, not everyone is back to normal; there are at least a dozen cases where it is not the case, each with its own story.” Jeff Smith, standing in a sandy yard that will one day be his front lawn, said it never occurred to him to move away from Constance Bay. “Nope, never. Even during the flood and that. Constance Bay is my home.” tspears@postmedia.com twitter.com/TomSpears1 Photo by Wayne Cuddington / Postmedia Photo by Errol McGihon / Postmedia Photo by Errol McGihon / Postmedia

Electronic handheld drug detectors have already helped Customs and Border Patrol agents in Texas stop an international shipment of an illegal and potentially dangerous drug.

In March, CBP agents working at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport used a Gemini Thermo Scientific Analyzer to find a 49-lb. shipment of Gamma-Butyrolactone, or GBL, listed on a cargo manifest as “mixed ink,” according to agency officials.

When consumed by humans, GBL is metabolized as Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, which is more commonly known as a “club drug,” or “date rape drug,” the agency said.

Although CBP didn’t say where the shipment came from, its cover name sounded familiar. In January at DFW, the agency’s electronic manifest system and detection dogs stopped a $300,000 shipment of liquid methamphetamine bound from China to Tennessee marked as “printing ink.”

CBP said it recently added the device to the portfolio of detection tools used by its officers. At the end of March CBP officers at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport were also trained to use the detector, which uses elemental isotope analysis, essentially a molecular fingerprint, to identify substances.

The new detectors, the agency said, can sniff out over 14,000 different substances, including industrial chemicals, bomb-making materials and narcotics. The device is also non-intrusive, which allows it to quickly identify shipments of illegal substances without agents having to physically open and inspect packages.

The device can detect thousands of substances, including the highly potent opioid fentanyl and its dangerous cousin carfentanyl. Both substances have become a scourge in the U.S. in the last few years, as increasingly smaller, harder-to-detect containers and even envelopes of the potent drugs flood into the country from suppliers overseas, primarily China.

To fight the rising tide of illegal drugs flowing into the country, lawmakers and federal agencies are looking for more firepower, including lighter handheld, non-intrusive detection technology.

In a congressional subcommittee hearing last week, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said new detection technology will provide more accurate and immediate identification of fentanyl found in shipping containers, while non-intrusive detection gear would allow agents to focus on smaller vehicles where shipments of the drug are increasingly common.","Thu, 19 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://gcn.com/-/media/GIG/GCN/Redesign/Articles/2018/April/drugscanner.png,"['shipment', 'cbp', 'substances', 'nonintrusive', 'detection', 'agents', 'including', 'fields', 'handheld', 'illegal', 'detectors', 'gcn', 'drug']",

They claimed they had done so to “clean the souls of the dead,” according to reports in the Japanese media.

The three women, one named as 53-year-old Liu (柳), the second as 41-year-old designer Lin (林), and the third unnamed, entered the Nijo Castle area at 10 a.m. on April 18 last year, the Apple Daily quoted the Sankei Shimbun as reporting.

They deposited a “tea-colored powder” at a total of 54 locations in the area, which is listed as a major cultural heritage site. Police closed off the area to visitors while they investigated the nature of the powder, which was found not to be toxic, reports said.

By the time they had analyzed surveillance camera footage and identified three women as suspects, they had already left the country.

However, the three women returned to Japan on Wednesday, precisely one year after the incident. They were arrested as soon as they arrived at Tokyo’s Narita Airport, and confessed to having been responsible for last year’s incident, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.

They reportedly told police that their motivation had been religious, and that they had spread the powder to help the souls of the dead reach heaven.","Thu, 19 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/5ad8773ee3216.jpg,"['spreading', 'dead', 'arrests', 'japanese', 'castle', 'incident', 'reports', 'taiwanese', 'area', 'souls', 'women', 'nijo', 'powder', 'japan']",

49,49,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Foreign-labelled goods flood shops - BusinessGhana,https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/general/163299/Foreign-labelled-goods-flood-shops,"Some supermarkets and mothercare shops in Accra and its outskirts are selling food and baby products labelled in Chinese and Spanish, in contravention of the law.

Since some of the items may contain substances that may trigger allergic reactions, it is important for consumers to have full knowledge of their contents in the language they understand before patronising them.

While the products on the shelves of Citydia, a retail chain with 13 supermarkets in Ghana, include pasta, chicken soup, bottled asparagus, bottled Chinese salad, pickled scallion, fruit juice, sauce, chocolate, bottled pepper, stuffed almond and toiletries, those of China Mall on the Spintex Road are mainly non-food kitchen items.

During a visit to the central business district (CBD) of Accra last Monday and yesterday, the Daily Graphic found Amalena Mothercare, for example, stocked with baby cots that have Chinese manuals that might make it difficult to assemble the cots.

In some mothercare shops in the CBD, there were toys, baby wipes and diapers, all with Chinese labels.

The law

The Ghana Standards Authority (food, drugs and other goods) General Labeling Rules, 1992 (LI 1541) requires that the labels of products, including food, shall be printed, impressed, embossed or stamped in the English Language.

Section 8.2 of the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) Guidelines for the labelling of pre-packaged food also states that “if the language on the original label is not acceptable (not in English) to the consumer for whom it is intended, a supplementary label containing the mandatory information in English may be used instead of relabelling”.

It also states: “In the case of either labelling or a supplementary label, the mandatory information provided shall fully and accurately reflect that in the original label.”

Under Ghanaian law (Section 4.1.2 of the FDA Regulations), aligned to European Union laws, any pre-packed food or drink sold in the country which is known to cause hypersensitivity must be declared on the label.

These include cereals (including wheat, rye, barley, oats, or their hybridised strains and products of crustacea (including prawns, crabs and lobsters), egg and egg products, fish and fish products, peanuts (groundnuts), soyabeans, milk and milk products (lactose included), tree nuts and their products (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and macadamia nuts) and sulphite in concentrations of 10mg/kg or more ((preservatives that are used in some foods and drinks).

Products on display

When the Daily Graphic visited the Citydia Supermarket at the Dzorwulu Junction and the Adabraka Police Station, quite a number of the items on display had their labels in Spanish.

The supermarket tried to make up for the language barrier by translating the ingredients of some of the items into English, but the printouts were hardly visible.

For some other products in the supermarket, the only signs of a translation were the labels on the shelves, but not on the products themselves.

However, experts hold the view that the method is insufficient compliance with the law, as labels on shelves are not labels on the items.

Citydia reacts

An official of the Compliance Unit of Citydia, who spoke to the Daily Graphic on condition of anonymity, said the company received instruction from the FDA on Tuesday, April 10, 2018 to withdraw products whose labels were not in English.

He said the company had put in measures to carry out the instruction in the next two weeks by withdrawing the products to its warehouse at Kpone for labelling under the supervision of FDA officials.

“We are complying with the FDA directive. It is just that the shops are many and it is taking time,” the official said.

China Mall

At the China Mall on the Spintex Road, there was no food item labelled in Chinese, but some kitchen wares were labelled in Chinese.

At the Amalena Mothercare in the CBD, the manuals for baby cots and some toys were in Chinese. Some other mothercare shops at Okaishie and the Makola Market were selling baby wipes with Chinese labels.

Allergy triggers

A Canada-based food safety specialist, Ms Gloria Mintah, who has had a similar experience in the past in Ghana, described the experience as frightening.

“What makes this very frightening is that the label of the particular product has a warning entirely in Spanish - ‘Puede contener trazas de gluten, crustaceos y apio’ - which in English means: ‘May contain traces of gluten, crustacean and celery.’

“While the law does not specifically state that warnings with respect to food are required on food labels, one can argue that ‘… handling precautions …’ may include warnings about the safety of the food itself, and should I be wrong, then immediate steps must be taken to amend the law to make this a specific requirement, or the authority should immediately exercise its power to make additional or specific labeling requirements regarding warnings,” she said.

Meaning

""If the manufacturer has found it useful or important to give any warning about the food, the information may as well be meaningful to all the consumers of the food product.

“In this respect, the warning is a matter of life and death for someone who is allergic to gluten and crustaceans, and with respect to celery, it is high in sodium; doctors and nutritionists will not hesitate to advise against excessive intake of salt, especially by those with high blood pressure. Having the warning in only Spanish is entirely useless to a person who might have the need to know what it is that he or she is consuming, not to mention that it violates the laws of Ghana,” she added.

Wrong practice

The Head of Communications at the FDA, Mr James Lartey, said the practice of labelling in a foreign language apart from English was wrong and said the FDA always destroyed such products during its market surveillance.

He said the law forbade the importation of food products with foreign language labels and where such products were allowed into the country, everything on the label must be translated into English and not only shelve labelling.

Mr Lartey stated that the only time imports with foreign labels were considered was when, for instance, a company imported the items to be used internally and not for commercial purposes outside.

“If a consumer goes to any supermarket, he or she should be able to read everything about the product. Assuming a consumer is allergic to groundnut and among a product’s ingredient there is groundnut, if the label is English, he or she can decide whether to buy or not to buy that product. When those things are not labelled in English, it creates a problem. When we go on the market, we destroy things like that,” he added.","Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.businessghana.com/site/img/../../cms/img/news/2018-04-17-1231117.jpg,"['language', 'chinese', 'english', 'flood', 'products', 'shops', 'food', 'fda', 'goods', 'label', 'mothercare', 'law', 'foreignlabelled', 'labels']",

Enlarge this image toggle caption Satellite image ©2018 DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company Satellite image ©2018 DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company

The Environmental Protection Agency has removed a toxic waste site flooded by Hurricane Harvey from a special list of contaminated sites that require the personal attention of the agency's leader, because it says there's been significant progress on a cleanup plan.

The San Jacinto Waste Pits are a heavily contaminated area near Houston that is right next to homes and schools, and that has frightened residents for decades. Monday's decision to take it off the list, and to add other sites, underscores the delicate equilibrium between rigorously protecting public health and expediting the cleanup of toxic waste areas across the country. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt calls this a priority for his agency.

Last year, Pruitt appointed a task force to recommend ways to speed up decisions about toxic waste sites. One of their recommendations was that Pruitt personally push for legally-binding cleanup plans at a handful of locations.

One of those sites was the San Jacinto Waste Pits. It's a pair of pits in the middle of the San Jacinto River that were used as a dumping area for toxic waste from a paper mill in the 1960s. The area full of chemicals called dioxins and furans, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department warns people should not eat fish and crabs from the area because the animals may be contaminated.

It took decades for the site to get any federal attention.

In 2008, the EPA added the San Jacinto Waste Pits to the National Priorities List of Superfund sites, which is meant to funnel money and attention to toxic areas that are a threat to human health. The Superfund program has been plagued with budget shortfalls for years, and nationwide, many communities have complained that cleanup progress is slow, inadequate or both.

For years before Hurricane Harvey, progress on the pits was slow and the two companies responsible for the waste opposed any plan that required them to remove any contaminated rock and dirt.

""For folks who live near the site or see that site every single day, [remediation] can't happen fast enough,"" says Jacqueline Young of Texas Health and Environment Alliance, an advocacy group that leads the local effort to clean up the pits. But, she adds, ""we need to take time to make sure that all the fine details can be worked out. At the end of the day, we have hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of contaminated material in a dynamic river, and that's not something that you can just go in and start digging.""

In 2011, the EPA oversaw the installation of a temporary concrete cap meant to protect the river from contamination while the agency and the two companies came up with a more permanent cleanup plan. That still left the site vulnerable to rainstorms or hurricanes, since Houston lies along the flood-prone Gulf.

When Hurricane Harvey inundated the area last year, the normally-placid San Jacinto became a raging torrent of muddy water that ripped away chunks of the temporary caps. Inspectors found a plume of contamination both up and downstream from the pits.

When the water subsided, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt visited the site, and promised to expedite the clean up. Less than a month later, the EPA announced a $115 million plan to remove the contaminated material, and last week, a judge signed off on an agreement that requires the two companies responsible for the waste to develop specific cleanup plans for both pits.

Today's announcement that the waste pits no longer need Pruitt's personal attention cited ""cleanup activities progress and completion of specific milestones and timelines."" A former copper mine in Nevada was also removed, and three other areas in California, Delaware and Minnesota were added to the list.

For the San Jacinto Waste Pits, the two companies have 29-months to come up with a specific cleanup design. Rock Owens, an environmental lawyer with the office of the Harris County Attorney, notes this means at least two more hurricane seasons will pass before waste material is actually removed.

Both Owens and Young, of the Texas Health and Environment Alliance, credit the relatively fast pace of recent EPA decision-making in part to the Pruitt's personal attention. ""Scott Pruitt has made it clear that Superfund sites are a high priority,"" says Owens.

Now that the EPA chief's attention is shifting to contaminated sites elsewhere in the country, Young says her group will be watching carefully to make sure companies don't fall behind schedule.

""Folks are not particularly excited about the 29-month estimate,"" says Young. She notes that even though many environmental advocates agree with the current pace of cleanup planning at the waste pits, people who live near the site are understandably concerned about the immediate risk of another flood.

""We will do everything we can to make sure the plan moves forward and doesn't take any longer than it needs to,"" she says.","Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/16/20170904_140231_smaller_wide-adc9c6e45860d7f83e7a7a9d0792b23bc6929254.jpg?s=1400,"['list', 'site', 'toxic', 'jacinto', 'waste', 'san', 'epa', 'special', 'flooded', 'takes', 'pits', 'cleanup', 'harvey', 'sites', 'contaminated']",

CAIRO – 21 April 2018: Liverpool and national team star Mohamed Salah-inspired Ramadan lanterns are taking the domestic market by storm, while their prices continue to escalate out of control.



Salah-shaped lanterns were produced in and imported from China, as standard kids’ toys, which meant that they were no longer subject to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s 2015 decision to ban importing lanterns and other Egyptian folklore-inspired products, so they were let through by border control, said the Chamber of Commerce.



The high demand for the lanterns, coupled with the limited stock, has enabled traders to raise their prices from LE 98 to LE 155 over a short period of time, explained the Chamber.



In similar vein, an Egyptian citizen locally manufactured Salah-shaped wooden lanterns. “Given that Mohammed Salah became the talk of the world, I wanted to design and manufacture another locally-produced Salah-shaped lantern that can be even better than the Chinese one,” the local manufacturer told Egypt Today.



Liverpool Egyptian winger, Mohamed Salah, added another award to his collection as his goal against Man City at the UEFA Champions League quarter finals second leg was chosen to be the goal of the week.



The 25-year-old is also shortlisted at the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award and he is expected to be one of the nominees for the Ballon d’Or award.



The holy month of Ramadan is just right around the corner and related festivities’ are getting off the ground, with Ramadan lanterns starting to flood the local markets.

Apart from Uganda, Chinese fish exports continue to flood the region with the biggest export being tilapia.

According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the country spent $22m (Shs81b) on fish imports in 2017. This was a growth from $10m in 2016.

Kenya requires one million tonnes of fish annually but only produces 200,000 tonnes domestically, which leaves a deficit of 800,000 tonnes. Much of the deficit was imported from Uganda, Tanzania and India but China has since taken over.

China exported more than 357,000 tonnes of tilapia worth $11m (Shs40b) into Kenya.

According to Philip Borel, the Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters Association vice chairperson, cheap tilapia from China continues to be a problem to the region and has unfairly heightened competition in one of Uganda’s traditional markets such as Rwanda and DR Congo.”

According to data from the Central Bank, Uganda’s formal fish exports were valued at $131m (Shs480b) while informal exports stood at $36.9m (Shs135b) in 2017. Reports indicate that Tanzania, which controls more than half of Lake Victoria, also imported more fish from China growing by about 23 per cent to $8m (Shs29b).

This is more than double the $3.6m (Shs13bn) fish the country imported in 2014.

Tanzania imported frozen pacific mackerel, Indian mackerel, chub, frozen sardine and tilapia.

Challenge

Apart from China, Kenya is also importing more fish from Tanzania than Uganda. This has been occasioned by a near depletion of Uganda’s fish stocks as the country continues to grapple with bad fishing methods.

Country Morocco

Risks Climate change exacerbating extreme weather events

Area of Engagement Deepening engagements in resilience to climate change

In an effort to mitigate impacts from natural hazards, the government of Morocco has moved forward with an integrated approach to disaster risk management.

$800 MILLION IN ANNUAL LOSSES

In Morocco, impacts from natural hazards average about $800 million every year. Driving the largest share of losses, flooding is a chronic recurrent problem in the country. Between 2000 and 2013, Morocco experienced 13 major flood events that together claimed the lives of 263 people. Drought also regularly affects the country, causing considerable losses in the agriculture sector which accounts for about 15 percent of Morocco’s GDP. Furthermore, Morocco also has the potential for massive seismic events, the most recent of which was a magnitude 6.3 earthquake near Al Hoceima that claimed the lives of 631 people and destroyed 12,000 homes in 2004.

Climate change threatens to increase the frequency and severity of weather-related events in Morocco. Case in point: in 2016, the country suffered its worst drought in 30 years, reducing cereal yields by 70 percent and contributing to an economic slowdown. Development factors, such as rapid urbanization along coastal areas threatened by sea level rise, are increasing exposure to risk, especially among the poorest and most vulnerable in the country. 42 percent of the Moroccan coastline is predicted to be at high risk of flooding and erosion by 2030.","Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1082549-FINAL%20-%20Results%20in%20Resilience%20-%20Integrated%20Disaster%20Risk%20Management%20in%20Morocco%20-%204.24.18.png?itok=p4j6KrD9,"['morocco', 'management', 'integrated', 'country', 'natural', 'million', 'impacts', 'managing', 'losses', 'lives', 'hazards', 'rewarding', 'results', 'events', 'risk', 'disaster']",

Lushan primary school will serve 120 children from 12 local villages in an area with a total population of about 1,800 people, 160km northwest of Nanchang, the provincial capital.

Responding the natural beauty of the area, with its mountains, lakes and rivers, the school’s classrooms, dormitory, and utility buildings are contained in vaulted spaces that open out onto its rural surroundings. The site is located on a small peninsula surrounded on three sides by water.

The school is on an elevated escarpment 5m above the 50-year flood level (render by VA)

Classroom arrangements are flexible and include outdoor teaching areas in the subtropical climate.

To keep construction time to a minimum, ZHA proposes to combine the local skills of in-situ concrete construction with new advancements in hot-wire cut foam formwork that can be prepared on site by an industrial robot to create the barrel and parabolic-shaped molds.

ZHA says this will cut the number of separate building elements needing transport to the remote location, while the modularity of the vaults enables molds to be used multiple times.

“The vaulted classrooms are orientated for the best natural light conditions, as well as to frame views to the surrounding landscape,” said ZHA.

“Cantilevers protect the classrooms from the solar gain of Jiangxi’s subtropical climate and extend the teaching spaces into the landscape to provide a varied and interactive learning environment.

“The barrel and parabolic vaults act as the school’s primary structure and enclosure, with each vault performing as an individual structural element.”

Witness Kentucky’s Ark Encounter with its 170-yard-long watercraft on display. Witness Hollywood explorations of the topic that fold in bizarre non-biblical myths or multiplex-level humor. Such popular interest commends news coverage when something flood-wise erupts.

Something just has.

Journalists will find story potential in reactions to the eyebrow-raising book “The Lost World of the Flood: Mythology, Theology, and the Deluge Debate” (InterVarsity Press). The co-authors are evangelical Old Testament Professors Tremper Longman III of Westmont College and John H. Walton of Wheaton College (Illinois).

They contend that the narrative in Genesis: Chapters 6–9 is not a fable or “myth” but stems from some actual catastrophe during primeval human history. However, they dismantle the literal interpretation.

That's interesting, in terms of academics. Note that Wheaton faculty members affirm that all the Bible’s books “are verbally inspired by God and inerrant in the original writing.” Moody Bible Institute, where Walton previously taught for two decades, believes the biblical texts “were verbally inspired by the Holy Spirit.” Longman’s Westmont proclaims the Bible to be “God-breathed and true, without error in all that it teaches.”

In the book, Longman and Walton say “the Bible is indeed inerrant in all that it intends to teach,” but analysis of intent allows room for their flood revisionism. They theorize about what the ancient scriptural writer meant to communicate and what long-ago readers would have understood, based partly on parallels in other writings from the ancient Mideast. On that basis, they consider the flood narrative “theological history” that freely employs “figurative language” and rhetorical devices, especially hyperbole.

Some Bible defenders think the flood was localized, but described in Genesis as worldwide because that’s how the deluge seemed to those who experienced it. Instead, Longman-Walton say scripture purposely depicted a local flood as though it was global in order to convey the universal “impact and significance” of humanity’s sinfulness and God’s resulting judgment.

Wheaton geology professor Stephen O. Moshier adds a technical chapter arguing that scientific evidence rules out a deluge that literally inundated the entire planet. The book contends that the biblical ark’s enormous size was another exaggeration because it would have greatly exceeded the largest wooden boats humans have ever built, and those were not seaworthy.

Since the authors think an actual flood underlies the account, they cite three candidates.

* Geologists tell us a huge flood filled a desert basin to form the Mediterranean Sea. But Longman-Walton assert this wasn’t the biblical flood because it occurred 5 million years ago so no humans experienced it.

* In 1928-29, archaeologists led by Sir Leonard Wooley worked at the site of Abraham’s hometown of Ur in southern Iraq and unearthed a thick layer of silt containing no artifacts, deposited around 3,500 B.C. Wooley proposed this as evidence of Noah’s flood, but further excavations found no more deposits and the claim faded.

* In their 1998 book “Noah’s Flood,” Columbia University geologists William Ryan and Walter Pitman reported evidence that 5,600 years ago a massive flood burst through the Bosporus strait in present-day Turkey to create the Black Sea. They figure the cataclysmic death and destruction that resulted would have been well remembered across future centuries. Longman-Walton find this tantalizing but stop short of endorsing the theory.

60,60,FL-2018-000050-CHN,SunPower Buys US Rival SolarWorld to Head Off Trump Tariffs - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/sunpower-buys-us-rival-solarworld-head-trump-tariffs,"SunPower Corp. on Wednesday said it would buy U.S. solar panel maker SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing as it seeks to stem the impact of Trump administration tariffs on panel imports.

The White House cheered the deal, saying it was proof that Trump's trade policies were stimulating U.S. investment.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

The news sent SunPower's shares up 12 percent on the Nasdaq to their highest level since before President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels in January.

""The time is right for SunPower to invest in U.S. manufacturing,"" chief executive Tom Werner said in a statement.

SunPower is based in San Jose, California, but most of its manufacturing is in the Philippines and Mexico. The company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by U.S. manufacturers, including SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports.

'This is great news'

The deal is a win for the Trump administration's efforts to revive U.S. solar manufacturing through the tariffs. SunPower will manufacture its cheaper ""P-series"" panels, which more directly compete with Chinese products, at the SolarWorld factory in Hillsboro, Oregon, it said. It will also make SolarWorld's legacy products.

""This is great news for the hundreds of Americans working at SolarWorld's factory in Oregon and is further proof that the president's trade policies are bringing investment back to the United States,"" White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in an emailed statement.

The announcement comes as SunPower is seeking an exemption from tariffs on its higher-priced, more efficient panels manufactured overseas. It has argued to the U.S. trade representative, which will make a decision on exemptions in the coming weeks, that those products should be excluded because there is no U.S. competitor that makes a similar product.

In a note to clients, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said the SolarWorld deal would enable the company to compete against Chinese imports should SunPower's products not receive an exemption. But he added that skeptics ""may question the company's ability to generate profits with U.S. manufacturing.""

Capital injection

The deal will inject much-needed capital into SolarWorld's long-suffering manufacturing plant and give it the support of a major market player. SunPower is one of the largest solar companies in the world and is majority owned by France's deep-pocketed oil giant Total SA.

The U.S. arm of Germany's SolarWorld AG opened the Hillsboro factory in 2008 as it sought to capitalize on surging solar demand in the United States. But its start coincided with a dramatic increase in the production of cheaper solar products in Asia, and SolarWorld struggled to compete.

Twice, in 2012 and 2014, trade cases brought by SolarWorld prompted the U.S. Commerce Department to slap import duties on solar products from China and Taiwan. Yet prices on solar panels continued their free fall, and in 2017, the company joined rival Suniva in asking for new tariffs.

SolarWorld called the outcome ""ideal"" for its hundreds of employees in Hillsboro.

Suniva's future in doubt

During the trade case and after the tariffs were announced, the solar industry's trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, argued that the tariffs would not be enough to keep SolarWorld and Suniva afloat.

Indeed, Suniva's future remains uncertain after a U.S. bankruptcy court judge this week granted a request by its biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company's solar manufacturing equipment through a public

Dozens of Red Deer County roads have been hit by the worst flooding in years.

An estimated 20 to 30 roads have been temporarily blocked off in all areas of the county as overland flooding fed by snowmelt-swollen Medicine and Little Red Deer Rivers.

County crews have been working around the clock responding to flooding reports and ensuring county residents are safe, said Dave Brand, county community and protective services director.

The county remains in close contact with the province’s river forecast centre and the county is getting hourly updates on river levels, Brand said late Tuesday morning.

“We have staff dedicated to both the Medicine River and the Little Red Deer River,” said Brand.

“We’re taking stream gauges and going the old-school manual method.”

Isolated pockets of flooding have been reported from all four corners of the county.

Mayor Jim Wood praised the response of the town’s staff as reports of flooding piled up.

“Last night, they had their emergency centre operating. They had already outlined a place for the community to go should the flooding get worse, the Cottonwood-Gordon Hall.

“So we’re prepared. Fortunately, it didn’t get any worse.”

Wood said in some cases frozen culverts may have blocked drainage channels causing snowmelt to back up. In other places, there’s just so much water culverts can handle the flow.

“This is abnormal,” he said of the flooding. “(Staff) have been working extremely hard. They are trying to get roads open as quick as they can and those roads are changing daily.

“I’m confident as quick as possible everything will be back to normal.”

Flooding has receded at Silver Lagoon subdivision and Red Lodge Estates, which are located several kilometres south of Gleniffer Lake on the Little Red Deer River. Homeowners had been given a voluntary evacuation notice on Monday. It was rescinded on Tuesday afternoon.

A boil water advisory remained in effect in those developments as of Tuesday.

Residents near Hwy 587 and the Little Red Deer River were urged to go to higher ground on Monday afternoon as a huge ice jam caused flooding. The ice jam moved on and Hwy 587 was reopened Tuesday morning.

Residents have been asked to phone the county at 403-350-2150 to report flooding or blocked culverts. Motorists should not drive around or move barricades or attempt to drive through what may appear to be only a few centimetres of water.

Sandbags are available at the Spruce View Fire Hall and the Markerville Community Hall.

Residents can get the latest information on road closures through the county’s interactive map.

Red Deer County is posting updates through its Twitter account @RedDeerCounty and on Facebook.

A 12-year-old female kangaroo suffered a severely injured foot when it was struck by bricks and concrete chunks on February 28 at the Fuzhou Zoo in Fujian province, China Central Television reported.

The kangaroo died days later and an examination by a veterinarian revealed that the cause of death was likely a ruptured kidney and excessive blood loss caused by being struck by the bricks.

A few weeks later, a five-year-old male kangaroo at the same zoo was slightly injured in a similar way, said the report posted on the network's website late on Thursday.

A few weeks later, a five-year-old male kangaroo (pictured) at the same zoo was slightly injured in a similar way, said the report posted on the network's website late on Thursday.

The report included pictures of the first kangaroo's smashed and nearly severed foot, and of the animal receiving treatment via intravenous drip before it died.

Visitors to the zoo were known to try and provoke the Australia marsupials to get them to display their signature hopping mode of locomotion using their powerful hind legs.

Zookeepers reviewed CCTV footage and found a number of tourists throwing stones into the kangaroo enclosure at Fuzhou Zoo in Fujian Province.

Ms Chen, who works in the animal rescue team at the zoo, told the Strait Metropolitan Post, that a few days after the female kangaroo died, workers found tourists throwing bricks into the kangaroo enclosure again.

There are only three kangaroos left in the enclosure.

She told the Strait Metropolitan Post that the enclosure was separated from the tourists by fences.

Carers cleared the pavement and removed the stones near the enclosure after the incident

'We have put up signs to remind the tourists to treat the animals in a civilised way. We have also cleared the stones near the enclosure,' the zookeeper said.

However, she said the tourists picked the stones from somewhere else and threw it at the kangaroos.

The long-term outlook for nickel looks bright but has the market run too far ahead on optimistic expectations? Nickel market experts weighed in with their opinions. One glance at a price chart for nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange over the past 15 months shows the reason for its star status within the base metals complex. A 40%-plus rise since the beginning of 2017 to a momentary peak of $14,150 per tonne for the LME's cash contract at the official close in mid-February 2018 shows the reason for its attractions – even if it had dropped back to $13,355 per tonne at the approach of mid-April.

Excitement about the metal's prospects in rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) has been one key factor in propelling the price of nickel higher. William Adams, Metal Bulletin Research's head of base metals and battery research, recalls that the growing use of nickel, cobalt and lithium in batteries made for EVs was the talk of last year’s LME Week in London.



But the nickel market has a tendency to run ahead of events, he cautioned, reminding that in 2014 – in anticipation of Indonesia’s ore export ban – large stockpiles of nickel ore were built up in advance by purchasers, which depressed prices. The nickel market only really picked up again when China’s economy rose and early signs of global economic growth came through in 2016.



While the EV story remains strong for the metal, the nickel market appears to be running ahead of expected demand now, Adams said, noting that there are also still worryingly high levels of nickel stocks available. Even so, the nickel market could attract very long-term investors who note that - even though it is now elevated from its nadir - the present price of the metal is relatively low versus historical highs.



Jim Lennon, managing director of Red Door Research, also pointed out that while the nickel market has been bullish prices are not particularly high at present.



“If you look at the cost curve, unlike copper and zinc prices - which are well above the nominal costs of their production - nickel prices are lying at the top end of its curve, meaning that some mines are still uneconomical,” he said, also stressing the importance of mining costs.



Lennon noted that reported nickel stock levels are still pretty high at more than 370,000 tonnes, so the price still has some way to go to overcome that overhang as it is drawn down.



Nickel was in oversupply during 2011-15, reaching a low point in price at the end of that period. Since then, demand has outstripped production. The global market showed a deficit of 50,000 tonnes in 2016, which climbed to a range of 100,000-150,000 tonnes in 2017, he said, adding that another deficit is expected this year.







“The market is definitely moving in the right direction [to support the nickel price]. No one thinks there will be a surplus for the next five years,” according to Lennon. “Nickel is now in structural deficit in contrast with the structural surplus of earlier years.” “The market is definitely moving in the right direction [to support the nickel price]. No one thinks there will be a surplus for the next five years,” according to Lennon. “Nickel is now in structural deficit in contrast with the structural surplus of earlier years.”



Tiered market

Adams pointed out that the past dynamics of the nickel market have created a two-tiered market. The first is for high-purity nickel delivered by the conventional route of nickel ore processing and refining. The second has grown from the increasing role of nickel pig iron (NPI) production, particularly in China.



From a low base of just 5,000 tonnes in 2005, NPI production increased to around 400,000-450,000 tonnes before Indonesia banned ore exports in 2014. The export ban was relaxed in 2017.



Nickel ore is shipped from mines in the Philippines and Indonesia to create cheaper nickel units in NPI. Ferro-nickel is another important source of supply.



As of now, the EV-battery market wants tier-one (class-one) material that is sourced from mined nickel sulfide ores. The high-quality nickel metal produced from this is used to make the nickel sulfate needed for batteries, Adams said.



“A potential future supply problem may arise from the fact that nickel prices are still too low to encourage investment in opening new nickel sulfide mines, while it is also currently uneconomic to process ferro-nickel or NPI to deliver nickel sulfate of the quality required for battery manufacture,” he added.



In mid-March, sources in the nickel trade told Metal Bulletin that the major nickel producers are eyeing the 2020s for when the metal really takes off on the back of heightened EV and battery demand.



Traders have also questioned whether there will be enough nickel to support that EV boom. Market participants told Yang that around $13,000 per tonne for nickel on the LME is not enough to attract more investment in nickel mines and production. Physical traders are expecting the market to be extremely tight in three years’ time, when battery demand is expected to really start kicking in due to the lack of supply entering the market. Such tightness could lead to industrial consumers seeking longer-term contracts – similar to moves by BMW looking to secure a 10-year supply of cobalt and lithium.



Nickel market participants are watching cobalt to see where nickel consumption will go, with some saying that there is not enough cobalt to meet demand - meaning that there could indeed be a further shift toward using more nickel in batteries instead.



Nickel for battery production mainly comes from big integrated producers, like Norilsk Nickel and SMM, Lennon said, noting that their nickel metal output is used to make nickel sulfate for batteries.



“Other sources include supply of nickel sulfate from platinum and copper refineries and intermediate nickel-cobalt hydroxides,” he said, adding that primary nickel units in the form of briquettes and powder are coming from big suppliers such as BHP, Vale and Glencore. “In 2017 nickel briquettes were shipped to the LME and in 2018 this is being redirected directly to end-users for nickel sulfate production.”



Lennon also noted that NPI production in China could be an important factor for the nickel market this year. “The relaxation of ore export restrictions from Indonesia could see a flood of ore into China for NPI production there this year,” he said. “Exports of Indonesian ore totaled 4.9 million tonnes last year but that has [the] potential to leap to 20 million tonnes this year. Last year’s 400,000-tonne output of NPI in China could rise to 500,000 tonnes as a consequence. By some estimates that level is China’s maximum capacity for NPI production.”



If China is faced with a potential surplus of nickel ore supply for its needs, it could choose the higher-average-grade ore offered by Indonesia over lower-grade ore supply from the Philippines, he added. NPI production is also growing in Indonesia itself.



“All this could create an oversupply of NPI to contrast with booming battery demand. Somewhere in between, the supply-demand balance will be struck. There could be a short-term correction in nickel prices but a lot of people may want to go long in any price dip so it could prove to be very short-lived,” Lennon said.



Stainless dominates

While the recent buzz about nickel use in batteries has captured the imagination of some nickel-market participants, the reality of today’s demand for the metal is the dominance of stainless steel.



“When stainless steel does well, nickel does well,” Adams said. “Stainless steel users are restocking now in an economic upturn.”



Lennon noted that as of now stainless steel accounts for 70% of nickel demand, while batteries use just 5%. In total, global demand for nickel is growing at a healthy rate of 6-7% a year.



China has also seen booming stainless steel demand over the past two years and that it is still looking pretty good this year, he said.



One impact on China’s stainless market has been the Tsingshan stainless mill in Indonesia, according to Lennon, noting that the plant produces slab as well as hot- and cold-rolled 300-series stainless steel. It produced more than 500,000 tonnes of stainless steel in the first quarter of 2018 and has the capacity to produce 2 million tonnes per year – a significant single-digit percentage increase in a 48-million-tpy market for stainless steel.



“Stainless steel prices in China have fallen this year while chrome and nickel prices have risen, leading to falling profitability and pro duction cuts,” he said. “The new Indonesian mill, which has China as a major export market, has increased competition with 300-series stainless mills inside China. Although demand for stainless steel in China remains robust, the market needs to grow further to absorb the additional supply.”



For the time being, excess stainless steel supplies are finding their way into warehouse storage – something that might create a short-term correction that ripples back up the supply chain if other mills start to cut production, Lennon warned.



Potential surge?

The expected EV-battery demand bodes well in the longer term – even though some analysts believe it could still be another five years before that market really takes off, Adams said.



In the meantime, on the supply side reported stocks of nickel are at 360,000-380,000 tonnes and Indonesia’s relaxation of its ore export rules has reopened the door to exporting to China.



Chinese President Xi Jinping has strengthened his power in the country and is looking to rebalance its economy. Large infrastructure projects that have taken a long while to get started – including those that are part of China’s One Belt One Road initiative – are beginning now. China’s leadership is also encouraging an attitude that new apartments should be for people to live in rather than for the property investment, or speculation, seen in years past, according to Adams. If that gains traction, thousands of completely empty apartments that have already been built could stoke demand for stainless steel-containing consumer goods as owners or tenants move in and outfit their new homes.



At a global level, Europe is booming, the US economy is strong and Brazil is recovering – all macroeconomic developments that bode well for nickel consumption, Adams said.



Andy Cole, Metal Bulletin Research's senior base metal analyst, wonders whether consensus views on future nickel prices have been too tame, pointing out that now that nickel has a reason to rally it could really start running away.



“In doing so it could outpace the tame, flattish forecasts we’ve been used to using in recent years,” he said. “In other words, we could be braver with our nickel price forecasts now.”



Historically, nickel does not tend to do flat price trajectories: price moves are typically steeper and run further, faster. Cole said. “With the market having found a reason to be bullish at last and investors effectively endorsing the start of what could be a new ‘super-cycle’ driven by a major structural shift in demand, we think nickel prices will get back to their old ways of steeper moves.”



Metal Bulletin Research's base case charts a path back to quarterly averages in the $14,000-18,000-per-tonne range from the second half of this year – a range seen for an extended period between late-2011 and early-2015, according to Cole.



“Our high-case scenario sees prices rushing back to that range sooner and heading on to quarterly averages in the $20,000s by the end of next year, targeting the [first-quarter] 2011 highs,” he added.

66,66,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Cotton returns as used clothes - The New Times,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/cotton-returns-used-clothes,"Contrary to suspicion, Rwanda is not trying to undermine US hegemony in Africa by phasing out used clothes.

Contrary to suspicion, Rwanda is not trying to undermine US hegemony in Africa in favour of China by phasing out used clothes. Consequently, President Trump’s Agoa salvo, which will find support in the US Congress, which is deeply suspicious of China, is a ploy to tame African leaders.

The US has suspended the duty free status for Rwandan apparel under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Rwanda, in a brief statement released on April 3, indicated that this followed a decision in March 2016 by EAC member countries to raise tariffs on secondhand clothes imports to promote local manufacturing.

Unlike the WTO, Agoa is a commendable unilateral gesture by the US to sub-Saharan Africa countries, including Rwanda, meant to promote trade and development through exports. Rwanda is a victim of the 21st Century Cold War between China and the United Sates for two reasons.

One, the complainant of this ban is the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association. When Trump communicated his decision to suspend Rwanda for 60 days, Smart issued a celebratory press release on March 29. It read, “The proposed ban sparked international controversy regarding the textile industry’s role in Africa, as no ban or increased duties were slated to occur on imports from China, the region’s largest source of clothing imports”

Secondly, USAID published a report in July 2017, under the title 'Overview of the Used Clothing Market in East Africa: Analysis of Determinants and implications'. One of the data findings is “Chinese exports of ready-made clothes to the EAC reached $1.2 billion in 2016, dwarfing the value of used clothing imports by a factor of four.” It also states: “Chinese imports, particularly the undocumented and untaxed that flood the market, pose a much greater danger to EAC domestic industries.”

The cold war between China and the US is a reality. Recapitulate utterances by former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as reported by VOA on March 7. Outlining the Trump administration's Africa policy, he said the US approach of ""incentivising good governance"" contrasts sharply with China, ""which encourages dependency, using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty.""

VOA also reported Representative Chris Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, saying that China's activities and actions on the continent have ""propped up kleptocrats and autocrats."" Then he added that China has been largely a negative actor in the region for some time, and “is building military relationships and partnering with one-party states, often to the detriment of good governance, the rule of law, and the African people themselves.”

Again, on March 26, 2018, Newsweek quoted the US House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, saying on Fox New’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that China was a “big Problem”; and with his fellow Republican lawmakers, they were running an investigation on many aspects of China including intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and its “military footprint” in Africa.

Statistics on the Agoa website shows that under textiles and apparel, US exports to Rwanda were $330,000 in 2016, which dropped to $132,000 in 2017. This is insignificant taking into account the US is the top exporter of used clothing at $575 million. If Rwanda was a top importer of secondhand clothes like Pakistan $239 million, or Malaysia $148 million, then this suspension would make sense.

The real issue for Rwanda and EAC is what we want in the next 20 years or so. This has been answered through the EAC Vision 2050. The third pillar of this vision is industrialisation “that is built on structural transformation of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, through high level value addition”. The ban of worn clothing is just one of the many policies which must be enacted to achieve this vision, without violation of WTO laws.

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits members to impose quantitative restrictions necessary to the development of a particular industry in the early stages of economic development. Article XIX also permits quantitative restrictions necessary to prevent sudden increases in imports from causing serious injury to domestic producers.

The Vision 2050 targets to increase our GDP per capita from $1,014 in 2014 to $10,000 by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue listening to the US tell us to keep up the good work of producing cotton, then send it to Asia who are good in converting it to apparel for US to wear for a couple of seasons, after which they can sell them to Africans as affordable used clothes.

67,67,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Provisions in FAA bill could strip endangered species protections | TheHill - The Hill,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/384621-provisions-in-faa-bill-could-strip-endangered-species-protections,"Two provisions lodged inside an annual House bill on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) could strip away endangered species protections.

The House is expected to vote on the FAA Reauthorization Act this week, and if taken up as is, the bill would include two policies that would limit how Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections extend to airports and a national Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program.

The first provision is being steered by Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio Peter Anthony DeFazioHouse Democrats introduce bill to close existing gun loopholes and prevent mass shootings Democrats seek answers from Boeing, FAA after production issues with 737 Max, Dreamliner jets Hillicon Valley: Global cybersecurity leaders say they feel unprepared for attack | Senate Commerce Committee advances Biden's FTC nominee Lina Khan | Senate panel approves bill that would invest billions in tech MORE (Ore.). It stipulates that private parties rebuilding property with the help of FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) would no longer have to adhere to species and habitat protections as determined under the ESA.

Specifically, the proposal declares that actions taken under the National Flood Insurance Act and others do not “create a federal nexus,” which mandates ESA protections on properties.

The provision, which has nothing to do with the FAA, is personal to DeFazio. It is the third time the Democrat has introduced the provision into House legislation, first in the in the FEMA Reauthorization Act of 2017 and then in the Department of Homeland Security reauthorization bill that passed the House last summer. The provision has since stalled in the Senate.

The addition is a response to an Oregon legal settlement resulting from a 2009 case where FEMA was sued for failing to ensure that the flood insurance program compiled with the ESA. The settlement mandated the agency comply with what the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) said to better avoid jeopardizing species and habitat. FEMA came to a similar settlement in Florida in 2011.

However, DeFazio and other Oregon lawmakers argue that the regulations are too stringent and impact economic growth. Since much of Oregon is built on floodplains with a number of communities reliant on FEMA’s insurance program to exist, they say the ESA protections, meant to protect salmon, steelhead and orca whale habitat, are a lofty burden on Oregonians.

“It would destroy our land use planning process and promote urban sprawl under the guise of trying to prevent building in floodplains and my state has zoned every acre so it would be an extraordinary mess, to put it mildly,” DeFazio told The Hill.

DeFazio said the policy is narrowly tailored to his state and that ESA protections under FEMA would still remain.

But environmentalists say that’s not true. They argue that the provision could strip protections for a host of species.

“It’s a sneaky way to attempt to exempt FEMA from Endangered Species Act compliance,” said Bruce Stein, chief scientist at the National Wildlife Foundation. “The courts have found that there is a federal nexus — and they have found that FEMA’s actions in providing flood insurance in endangered species habitat has an effect on the survival of species.”

The second provision in the bill would bestow the Secretary of Transportation with the authority to override aspects of the ESA on airport land in the name of security.

The provision directs the Secretary of Transportation to make sure that designations of critical habitat under ESA don’t extend “on or near airport property” if it could impact airplane operations. It also says that the protections should not extend to airport lands that have become attractive to endangered species due to the fact that they are buffer zones.

Scott Elmore, vice president of communications at the Airports Council International, an airport lobby, said wildlife management goes hand in hand with airline safety.

“As you know, the safety and security of the traveling public is an airport’s top priority. Wildlife management is part of that equation. The provision essentially recognizes that wildlife — even endangered wildlife — and aircraft don’t mix,” Elmore said.

“Accordingly, the provisions explicitly recognize the preeminence of safety and preclude the designation of new habitat areas on airport property.”

An aide for Rep. Bill Shuster William (Bill) Franklin ShusterLobbying firm cuts ties to Trent Lott amid national anti-racism protests Ex-Rep. Frelinghuysen joins law and lobby firm Ex-Rep. Duffy to join lobbying firm BGR MORE (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said that the amendment was taking into account events like the 2009 US Airways flight that made an emergency landing on the Hudson River after colliding with a flock of birds.

But environmentalists say that logic is flawed, and that the Department of Transportation alone shouldn’t have the authority to determine whether or not ESA protections apply on airport land.

Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the rule opens the floodgates “if every department and every other federal agency decides that they also need special privileges when it’s only supposed to be a listing based on science.”

“They have managed successfully for years,” said Hartl. “It’s just another way to whittle away the Endangered Species Act.”

Stein says the provision on strike hazards is “overly broad” and could include exempting protections to species like the Karner blue butterfly, the range of which stretches across the Northeast to the Upper Midwest and prefers buffer land near airports because it’s quiet.

“This Karner blue butterfly does not represent a strike hazard for aircraft,” said Stein.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee Sheila Jackson LeeHouse Democrats introduce bill to close existing gun loopholes and prevent mass shootings Hillicon Valley: Democrats urge Facebook to abandon 'Instagram for kids' plan | 'Homework gap' likely to persist after pandemic Legislation to secure critical systems against cyberattacks moves forward in the House MORE (D-Texas), a member on the House committee that oversees Homeland Security, said that she was deeply concerned by the provisions in the bill, namely the section regarding FEMA, and hopes they will be pulled from the final version.

“I’d be very concerned. I am a strong supporter of the Endangered Species Act. I don’t think we need to go sideways and around to be able to undermine the act, and I wonder if FEMA really needs or has asked for that latitude,” Jackson Lee told The Hill.

She said she also takes issue with the legislation being connected to FEMA’s flood insurance program.

“I for one, obviously living in hurricane territory, having just experienced and suffered through Hurricane Harvey, hold a priority to the restoration of people who are the victims of a devastating natural disaster and we need to make sure that they are made whole,” Jackson Lee said.

“But to use FEMA’s authority during times of trouble, to loosen and lessen the requirements to protect endangered species, I’ll be voting 'no' but most importantly will be looking to see if that amendment needs to be in that bill.”","Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/orca.whale_.jpg,"['strip', 'provision', 'fema', 'faa', 'act', 'esa', 'house', 'national', 'protections', 'provisions', 'species', 'endangered', 'bill']",

Moscow last month claimed the lead in the race to develop missiles that can travel at many times the speed of sound. Its defence ministry revealed video footage of its plane-launched Kinzhal missile, which is reportedly capable of accelerating to ten times the speed of sound.

American officials have also expressed concern that China was building missiles that could outrace or outfox its existing defence and interceptor systems.

Now the Pentagon says Lockheed is to receive up to $929 million to design and build a “hypersonic conventional strike weapon”.

69,69,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Hong Kong bridge prepares to open amid fears over structural integrity - Dezeen,https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/17/hong-kong-zhuhai-macau-bridge-nears-opening-date-amid-fears-over-structural-integrity/,"Chinese authorities have announced that the 55-kilometre bridge between Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and Macau is on track to open, despite concerns that parts of the structure have been washed away by the sea.

Hong Kong's Highways Department rebuffed claims that the concrete blocks protecting an artificial island connecting the Hong Kong side of the bridge to the tunnel under Mainland China's waters have been damaged by waves.

Named the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau (HKZM) Bridge, the structure consists of three cable-stayed bridges, three artificial islands and one undersea tunnel spanning 55 kilometres through the Lingdingyang channel. The route connects the three major cities of Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau on the Pearl River Delta.

The 29-kilometre section of the HKZM Bridge will be one of the world's longest bridges. China is also home to the world's highest bridge, the Beipanjiang Bridge.

A post shared by Kai (@vanillakai) on Apr 12, 2018 at 4:45am PDT

Once open, the six-lane bridge will cut the travel time between Hong Kong and Macau from four hours to under one hour.

The HKZM Bridge was completed in November 2017 and is due to open to traffic before 1 July 2018.

Artificial island ""same as it was designed""

Following reports that the artificial island had been damaged, authorities held a press conference to reassure the public that the design was functioning as planned.

""There is nothing that we can observe that has been washed away,"" director of highways Daniel Chung told press during a briefing last week.

""It is the same as it was designed and in fact the same as when it was just completed on year ago.""

Concerns had initially been raised in May 2017 when photographs released by Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Authorities appeared to show many of the concrete blocks fully submerged in the sea.

Speculation about the structural integrity of the bridge reignited earlier this month, when images taken by a local drone enthusiast and posted to Facebook allegedly showed a similar sight.

A post shared by Lois Leung (@loixoxo) on Apr 8, 2018 at 4:47am PDT

The Hong Kong Free Press reported that the submerged sea defences look different from the bridge's design documents and computer visualisations, which suggest the concrete blocks should sit proud of the water.

Chung visited Zhuhai to meet with the HKZM Bridge Bridge Authorities and inspect the project before holding the press conference. He said that there were no plans to alter the design of the island's breakwater, as they were working as intended.

HKZM Bridge delayed due to design and safety concerns

Originally the HKZM Bridge was due to open in October 2016, but the mega infrastructure project has been plagued with delays, design and safety concerns, and reports of worker deaths and injuries.

The current controversy surrounds the mid-channel artificial islands either side of the tunnel, but the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities Island (HKBCF Island) has also experienced issues.

Instead of the environmentally-damaging method of dredging the marine mud to build on reclaimed land, the HKBCF Island was made using a non-dredge method where filled circular steel cells are driven into the sea floor to form a seawall.

In 2015 the Highways Department admitted that the non-traditional method of land reclamation meant that parts of the island had moved up to 7 metres.

Then in 2017 Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) charged 19 employees of Jacobs China – a contractor of the Civil Engineering and Development Department – with falsifying concrete compression test results.

The number of officially reported work deaths on the HKZM Bridge currently stands at 10, with the number of reported injuries varying from 234 to 600.

Last year a member of Hong Kong’s Labour Party dubbed it the ""bridge of blood and tears"", suggesting the number of fatalities and accidents could be even higher on the China side of the project. The Construction Site Workers General Union called it the ""bridge of death"" and asked government to put a stop to what it described as ""mass murder"".

Reported costs for the project have been estimated at $15 billion (£10.6 billion).

71,71,FL-2018-000050-CHN,This Afghan fashion house is on a mission to preserve traditional textiles - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/this-afghan-fashion-house-is-on-a-mission-to-preserve-traditional-textiles/story-PfJKTgeOpFCaUYdn9PRP5O.html,"Cheap, Chinese-made nylon burkas are flooding Afghanistan’s north as consumers turn to affordable, mass-produced fabrics — but in Kabul a small, determined fashion house is fighting to preserve the traditional textiles once integral to Afghan culture.

Launched in 2006, “Zarif” — “precious” in Persian — commissions traditional cotton and silk from artisanal weavers, then employs more than two dozen people — mostly women — to tailor and design the fabrics into handcrafted, embroidered clothing. But with cheaper imports saturating the market, they are struggling to keep local traditional methods afloat, says founder Zolaykha Sherzad.

Only decades ago, the textile industry was on par with Afghanistan’s legendary carpet trade, famed since the days of the old Silk Road. During its heyday textiles were more than just fabrics, with their patterns, colours and embroidery illuminating the origins and tribal history of their makers. “In the past, the fabrics were entirely embroidered, on the walls, the cushions... the wedding dresses,” says Sherzad.

“But now, we are trying hard just to keep them as ornaments on jackets and coats, to maintain the know-how,” she adds, saying the decline in the craft has put large numbers of women out of work who once were able to make a living at home. With Zarif, she hopes to fill the gap while aiming to preserve Afghanistan’s textile traditions and designing contemporary takes on Afghan fashion staples.

Fighting the market

A visit to the bazaar in northern Mazar-i-Sharif shows the challenge she faces. There, bundles of striped and padded coats, or “chapans” — popularised in the West by ex-President Hamid Karzai — pile up in stacks at stalls. “Too bright,” she says, discarding the synthetic fabrics.

For many consumers, however, they have their appeal. The cheaper knock-offs are printed on nylon, rather than silk, closely replicating traditional designs but at a third of the price. “These cost 800 to 1,200 afghanis ($11 to $18), compared to 2,500 ($36) for a traditional chapan,” explains Abdullah, a merchant.

Now only the rich can afford the handmade silk chapans, often buying them as wedding gifts, while middle-class and working people opt for the synthetic designs. Markets across Mazar also burst with the polyester burqas Afghan women are forced by tribal culture to don. But even the fabrics used for this ubiquitous garment come increasingly from abroad.

“China, India, Pakistan, everything comes from outside,” Hashem, a dyer and weaver for Zarif, tells AFP in the courtyard of his mud house on the outskirts of Mazar from where he manages the 10 women who weave for him at home. “In the old days I had 10 families working for me, today I have four,” he says while squeezing a skein of freshly dyed cotton. “Before,” he continues, “80% of the raw material came from the local market, today 80% comes from abroad.”

Working women

In founding Zarif, Sherzad — an architect by training — wanted above all to promote female employment, banned under Taliban rule from 1996-2001 and still the norm in large swathes of the country. According to data provided by the World Bank, 19% of Afghan women were employed in 2017 — which excludes the informal agricultural sector.

Despite the economic crisis that has raged since the withdrawal of more than 100,000 NATO troops in late 2014, Zarif still employs 26 employees in its courtyard workshop, located next to a mosque and its blaring call to prayers. About 60% of the team is female, including the director Nasima along with the production manager Sara. Two embroiderers work full time while an additional 30 are called on at the discretion of the managers.

Since its creation, Zarif has trained more than 85 women — but most of them have given up their jobs after getting married at the request of husbands who are reluctant to accept the presence of other men near their spouses. “The brake on women’s employment continues to be their husbands” says Sherzad.

Adapting to survive

To survive, Zarif relies on connections in Paris, where the company is supported by French fashion brand “Agnes b.”, along with a stable of faithful clientele in New York. And even as she seeks to preserve, she is also forced to adapt, scouring Afghanistan’s antique shops in search of richly crafted garments that can be refashioned into bags or the linings for men’s jackets.

Silk encapsulates the challenge. Homespun silk from the western city of Herat was once used by Afghan producers for turbans. Now it is exported to Iran. “There’s only one artisan left in Afghanistan that knows the craft,” Sherzad says. “It’s necessary to train others, but for what? People no longer have the means and young people no longer wear turbans. We have to invent something else that uses silk.”

Chinese traders in Moscow’s huge wholesale bazaars have become the most active buyers and sellers of cryptocurrency in the Russian capital. The retail turnover there is estimated at almost $10 billion a month. Authorities say that most of it is converted to cryptocurrencies and sent back to China where it‘s exchanged to yuan.

Crypto Flows Considered Easier To Track than Cash

The three largest bazaars in the Russian capital, “Moskva”, “Sadovod”, and “Food City”, make about ₽600 billion rubles each month (~$10 billion). That’s almost a quarter of the retail turnover in the Russian Federation. Practically none of it is deposited in bank accounts, according to Yuri Polupanov, head of the Central Bank’s Financial Monitoring and Currency Control Department. 90% of the businesses there are owned by Chinese merchants and producers, he said during the Thomson Reuters Forum in Moscow, RBC reported.

The retail centers have become pioneers in crypto trade. Russia’s Centrobank believes that Chinese traders convert most of their revenues to cryptocurrency and send it back home, where it is exchanged to yuan. Financial authorities have learned that crypto exchange bureaus are also operating there. Polupanov said that some of them are registered as financial services providers. Inspectors have found discrepancies between their accounting reports and the data gathered remotely by the CBR.

There is no point in denying that cryptocurrency is used in wholesale and retail trade, thinks Elina Sidorenko, head of a working group at the Duma tasked with assessing crypto circulation. “It’s no secret that Chinese merchants are using cryptocurrencies through anonymous wallets. But as soon as they are defined legally in the civil code, these financial flows will be easily controlled. It’s easier to track them than cash,” she said.

Sidorenko believes the situation will improve in a few years. If the central bank has evidence of illegal crypto-fiat exchange, it should give it to the Prosecutor’s Office, she added. Elina Sidorenko noted that illegal activities in these bazaars are not a new phenomenon. Violations of immigration laws and crimes related to laundering of illicit proceeds are flourishing there, she said, admitting: “We should’ve dealt with all that long time ago.”

Relics from The ’90s

The story of improvised retail bazaars and flea markets in Russia dates back to the breakup of the Soviet Union. Many of them were set up in the capital in the ‘90s. They have been targeted by authorities since the early 2000’s. Trade there is often unregulated and untaxed. Government inspectors have found multiple violations of sanitary and fire safety standards, customs and migration regulations.

In the summer of 2009 Moscow authorities closed down the “Cherkizovskiy” bazaar, which was one of the biggest. Russian police found 6,000 containers of contraband worth an estimated $2 billion. The newer trade centers “Sadovod” and “Moskva” are now major wholesale markets for clothes and shoes, while “Food City” is the main food distribution center. The volume of retail trade in the Russian capital has been estimated at more than $72 billion dollars in 2017. The monthly turnover is between $5.5 and $7.8 billion. It reaches $49 billion USD a month on national level.

Cryptos like bitcoin have been gaining popularity in Russia, where 12% of crypto users now claim cryptocurrency is their main source of income. Two draft laws regulating the crypto sector have been introduced in the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament. The bill “On digital financial assets” legalizes activities like initial coin offerings and mining. A second draft aims to amend the civil code in order to legalize the use of “digital money” in payments. It’s still unclear whether the circulation of cryptos will be allowed in the country. Recently, Russian media reported that a new crypto exchange bureau is now buying and selling bitcoin for cash in Moscow.

City Councilman Trevor Ozawa said in a news release today that he requested emergency proclamations to address the needs of homeowners affected by the storm.

Meanwhile, the city is supplying two large roll-off dumpsters in East Honolulu this week to aid with flood cleanup.

The city Department of Environmental Services says the dumpsters will be placed at the Hawaii Kai Park and Ride Facility and the Kawaikui Beach Park at the bottom of Hawaii Loa Ridge for residents to drop off items damaged from the weekend storm. The bins will be emptied each morning through Friday.

The city is not accepting hazardous materials, major appliances, regular trash or non-storm related debris.

In addition, the city is suspending citations for bulky items set out early from Aina Hina to Hawaii Kai. Normal bulky item pickup begins April 23 for Aina Hina and April 25 for Niu Valley to Hawaii Kai. The city will provide additional bulky item pickups for areas with significant storm damage, the department said.

Ozawa said if Caldwell issues an emergency proclamation for Honolulu, Gov. David Ige may be able to issue his own emergency proclamation.

Ozawa, who is in Washington D.C. for business, said he also met with U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz regarding federal assistance available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

This morning, Schatz issued a statement saying that the communities of Oahu and Kauai need as much help as they can get.

“I have reached out to the appropriate federal agencies—including FEMA, SBA, USDA, and DOT—and let them know where we stand,” he said in the statement. “They are ready to answer the call once Governor Ige, Mayor Caldwell, and Mayor Carvalho request assistance. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will work with the other members of the congressional delegation and do everything possible to help these communities get on the road to recovery.”","Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/web1_CalvaryBytheSea.jpg,"['federal', 'bulky', 'proclamation', 'hawaii', 'kai', 'east', 'city', 'help', 'honolulu', 'statement', 'calls', 'storm', 'councilman', 'emergency']", 
74,74,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Sumatra's Magic Mountains – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2018/04/sumatras-magic-mountains/,"Advertisement

“We don’t go up to the mountain tops,” the village headman of Lobu Tayas in Sumatra told me, speaking in his ethnic Batak language through a translator. “Up there, many magic.” He shook his head and repeated it: “Many magic.”

Rising steeply about a half a kilometer behind him was a long, jungle-covered mountain ridge where we had installed a camera trap. In two weeks we procured an image of a tiger laying down and yawning right in front of the camera. The locals hear that tiger roar from time to time, and when it does, he said, people just stay inside their homes, and listen.

The “magic” that he spoke of is a kind of animist superstition. Specifically, he and the rest of the village fear something called the orang bunian, a kind of evil spirit of the forest. I first heard of the orang bunian in George Maxwell’s 1907 book In Malay Forests. He mentioned that in Peninsular Malaysia, local people were fearful of the “Orang Bunyi, the invisible Voice folk.” Maxwell goes on to add: “It is worthy of notice that, though the Malays have been staunch Muhammadans for centuries, their aboriginal fear of the forest is so deeply rooted that it is to the spirits and not to Allah that they apply for protection.”

Much more recently, I found that the situation is much the same across the Strait in Sumatra.

Some who I spoke with think the orang bunian is the local variant of the orang pendek — or tropical yeti — that has reportedly stalked the mountains of Kerinci National Park in Jambi province for centuries. But this doesn’t sound quite right to me; the orang pendek is supposed to be a cryptic, empirical being, not a spirit. Stirring up the confusion, I was told that in Aceh it goes by the name of suke mante, among the Bataks it is called orang bunian, and in Kerinci it’s called orang pendek. Whatever the case, spirit or real creature, it is keeping the locals off the high mountains. This is what I was told in the half-dozen or so villages that we visited en route to the trailhead for our recent wildlife survey expedition.

Animist beliefs have more benefits for wildlife than simply scaring villagers away from the forest. Why didn’t the villagers who we spoke with hunt the tiger that lived near them? Why not snare it, kill it, and be rid of it? I found an answer to this in the literature as well. Ruth Padel writes in her 2011 book Tigers in Red Weather:

Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter

Because real tigers are territorial, most old villages had a village tiger, harimau kampong, which they recognized. Our tiger, they called it. Our harimau nunga, the waiting tiger. It was probably an ancestor spirit, and would give a sign, or advize, when the village had a problem. It was part of the community. The tiger they were generally afraid of was harimau luar, the tiger from outside, the other tiger.

I ran this by Haray Sam Munthe, a local tiger expert, head of the grassroots NGO Sumatran Tiger Rangers, and our team leader. He agreed wholeheartedly that the tiger was not hunted because it was the “waiting tiger.”

“When the village has a problem,” Munthe explained to me. “The tiger will come down from the mountain and roar close by. The people will interpret what the tiger said and act accordingly. He will solve their problem for them.”

So we have friendly local tigers who give advice to villagers in times of distress, and we have malignant yeti-ghosts who strike fear into the hearts of locals and keep them off those mountain tops where the tigers — and other threatened wildlife — reside. That all of this is at odds with the Islamic faith is either ignored or not even considered.

Islam arrived in Aceh at the northern tip of Sumatra anywhere from 1,000 to 800 years ago, most likely from Indian traders but possibly directly from Arabia. It then spread south throughout the island, sometimes by force and bloodshed. Yet it is clear to me that, try as they might, the more radical Islamic adherents from Aceh never completely stamped out the old religion, animism. It lingers, and it is encouraging a kind of traditional environmental conservation ethic by keeping local people away from the last refuges of Endangered and Critically Endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger.

In fact, one of our key survey sites is a high plateau, and word has it that a nearby village was considering establishing a coffee plantation up there because of its relatively flat terrain. However, anxiety about the orang bunian, I was told, has kept villagers away. “They are tall with big red eyes,” a woman explained in the last village before our ascent into the mountain forests. She shook her head and looked askance.

In the previous village I was told they had large black eyes and dragged their knuckles on the ground. Not surprisingly, we camera trapped tigers — as well as other rare species — on the nearby mountains. In fact, while checking the memory cards in our cameras, Haray advised me to help spread among the locals the idea that orang bunian is alive and well in these parts. He suggested that upon our return, while passing back through the villages, we tell the locals that we not only saw their backwards-pointing footprints in the ground but actually saw the creatures themselves, and that they terrified us. “It keeps the people off the mountains,” he implored.

So, for the sake of wildlife conservation, I indulged in some lying, and had some fun with it. In order to keep a straight face, I tried to recall the pairs of large green fireflies wafting toward me at night on the trail, imagining them to be two eyes instead of two insects. After all, maybe that’s what the villagers saw anyway. Did I feel guilty about spreading untruths? Not really. I recall seeing some faces twist into grimaces and winces as I spun my yarns. Monkey torn to shreds with tail dangling from one tree and head resting on the branch of another? It was the work of the orang bunian. Strange footprints leading into the depths of the forest where I heard a soft voice calling my name? Orang bunian trying to get me. If those tall tales help keep humans and their snares and chainsaws away from the final refuges of the Sumatran tiger, then, as far as I’m concerned, there is nothing unethical about it.

And these animistic beliefs are not limited to our study area. Elsewhere in North Sumatra province this year, a tiger resting under a village hut was killed for fear of it being a “shape-shifting tiger,” or the Southeast Asian equivalent of the “werewolf.” In South Sumatra, villagers fighting a coal mine believe that they are the descendants of the Sumatran tiger. Friends of mine who work in ecotourism and conservation in Jambi province tell me that animism is alive and well among the ethnic Minangkabau people. Animism, it seems to me, is thriving — if quietly — in Islamic Sumatra today, and it might just be the most effective form of environmental conservation at work.

Christianity, however, may have had more success in stamping out the last residual animist beliefs in its adherents. The people of Nias Island (an island off the west coast of Sumatra), I was told, are almost all Christians, and virtually every tree on that island has been cut down and every form of wildlife thrown into the cooking pot. In fact, Munthe explained to me that when Nias Island Christians move to mainland Sumatra and build homes near forest areas, a major uptick in poaching and logging usually follows.

Troublingly, as we finished up our survey work and were driving back, we picked up some information about a Malayan tapir that had just been snared and killed by Nias Island emigrants. They knew they had done wrong and they had purportedly cut up the carcass and fled into the forest to cook and eat it. Munthe, a Batak Muslim who says his great-grandfather was “full animist,” was outraged by this and proposed going into the forest to pursue and apprehend the poachers, but as it was late and there were only two of us, I advised against it.

Could it be that Islam — which prohibits the consumption of not only pigs (and wild pigs are one of the Sumatran tiger’s main prey species) but also snakes, turtles, frogs, eagles, and many other species — with a twist of animism, is the perfect combination for wildlife conservation in Sumatra? As the Dutch historian Bernard H. M. Vlekke writes in his 1945 book The Story of the Dutch East Indies: “The forces of nature were venerated by the ancient Indonesians and the places where they worshipped remained unchanged throughout the centuries, even though new religions were introduced. The worship has been constant; only the gods have changed.”

Maria Manzo cleaned houses, baby-sat and spent countless Sundays selling burritos at a swap meet to support her eight children, who emigrated with her from Mexico more than 30 years ago. When a son eventually became a legal resident, Manzo, now 82, was able to apply for a green card, ensuring that she, too, could remain a permanent resident of the United States.

For decades, that was enough.

Manzo had no sense of urgency about taking the next step: applying for U.S. citizenship. She had little extra money to spend on English and civics classes, which she needed to gear up for the test required to become a citizen. Her green card made her feel secure, allowing her to travel, if she wished, to see relatives in Mexico and return without hassles to her home in Garden Grove, California.

But after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, Manzo, like many permanent residents across the U.S., began to feel differently.

Now the great-grandmother is among hundreds of thousands of permanent U.S. residents applying annually for citizenship, clogging an already-burdened system that relies mostly on fees from applicants such as Manzo to keep itself afloat.

In the year after the election, the backlog at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services grew 40 percent, to nearly 735,000 pending applications – with pronounced surges in several states with the highest immigrant populations: California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. As a result, the wait time has grown, too.

The backlog creates “a second wall,” said Emily Gelbaum, chief of staff for the National Partnership for New Americans, in addition to the one Trump has vowed to build at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Immigrant advocates say that aside from ensuring their personal security, citizenship applicants want the right to vote – in many instances against the current administration and its backers. Gelbaum, whose organization is a consortium of nonprofits that advocate for immigrants, told Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting that she is concerned that the slowdown is deliberate, a move to “suppress the vote” of these potential citizens.

Manzo, with her daughter Griselda, recently visited Catholic Charities of Orange County, seeking information about becoming a citizen. Maria Manzo was disappointed to learn that it could take up to a year, possibly longer, before her application would be approved. Still, she’s determined to take this final step toward protecting herself from deportation – and winning the right to vote.

“My mother wants to become a U.S. citizen because her kids are here and she’s worried; everything is changing,” said Griselda Manzo, 45, a dental assistant. “She says she is scared.”

Green cards have to be renewed every 10 years and can be revoked. Official reasons are fraud in the application process; criminal activity, even low-level crimes; or staying out of the United States for more than six months.

Today, those who work closely with immigrants say they hear the same fears over and over: that green cards are not secure, that the government could change the reasons for revoking a green card, that the rules could be unevenly applied in the current political climate.

Scenes of chaos in airports during the Trump administration’s first attempt to impose a travel ban against several Muslim-majority countries in early 2017 unnerved many green card holders. Could their countries be targeted next?

Jenny Rodriguez, who works on naturalization applications for Catholic Charities of Orange County, is helping Maria Manzo complete her paperwork. She said the anxiety and pressure applicants are feeling is palpable.

“One of the many reasons is that they have fears of this new administration,” Rodriguez said. “When we hold information sessions, many of the people say they want to vote and not have the president we have now.”

Marilu Cabrera, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, disputed allegations that the naturalization backlog was intended to suppress minority voters. In an email, she wrote, “There is no truth to this claim,” adding that agency Director L. Francis Cissna has said “our work should be grounded in efficiency, fairness, expediency and lawfulness.”

She said the agency “recognizes the many contributions that have been made by immigrants throughout our history, and we take pride in providing the right immigration benefit to those who are eligible.

“USCIS also has a responsibility to serve the American public, and safeguarding the security and integrity of our nation’s immigration system is a top priority.”

A lengthy process

Not everyone who’s decided to apply for citizenship feels a sense of urgency.

Rosa Ramírez, 40, had been a green card holder for about seven years before she applied in April 2017. Her husband has had a green card as long as she, and although Ramírez says he’ll probably apply at some point, he hasn’t done so yet.

“I simply wanted to take the opportunity and the advantage of being a part of this country,” Ramírez said after her March 15 naturalization ceremony at Oakland, California’s historic art deco Paramount Theatre.

Following the ceremony, Ramírez had her first taste of those advantages. She applied for a U.S. passport and registered to vote at tables set up in the theater lobby.

“I want to make sure to vote for those who don’t have a chance to do so,” she said.

Waiting nearly a year for that right did not bother her. The process, she said, had seemed fair.

However, the Trump administration already has taken several steps that will slow the process further for some applicants and keep others out of the pipeline altogether.

It has tightened requirements for military members who previously had been promised an accelerated route to citizenship, delaying a process for at least 10 months that previously could take as little as 10 weeks. The administration also closed immigration offices on several military bases.

Officials have increased scrutiny of applications for unaccompanied minors to remain in the U.S. and slowed down the process for them to get green cards, which delays their eligibility for citizenship. And the State Department has proposed adding a review of visa applicants’ social media accounts over the past five years, which also may slow the process.

In late March, the administration also announced plans to use the 2020 census questionnaire to find out who in the U.S. is a citizen – and who is not, despite protests from the Census Bureau’s own experts.

Administration officials argue that the question will help enforce the Voting Rights Act – aimed at increasing voter participation, not depressing it. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration, is challenging the plan, as are attorneys general – so far all Democrats – in at least 17 states, including California and New York.

Opponents say the move is directly aimed at intimidating immigrants and could result in an undercount because some people may avoid the census, which counts citizens and noncitizens to determine federal aid to states and localities and the boundaries of congressional districts.

“The Census is supposed to count everyone,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. “This is a blatant and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to undermine that goal.”

A new spike in demand

The recent spike in citizenship applications is out of the ordinary, according to León Rodríguez, who led U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for three years the during the Obama administration.

“Overall, citizenship receipts have gone up during the Trump presidency, which is not normal,” he said. “Usually, you have a big spike during an election year.”

Applications for citizenship increased gradually in recent years. In fiscal year 2014, the immigration agency received nearly 774,000 applications; a year later, nearly 783,000 people had applied.

Then, immigrant communities found themselves under attack. In announcing his campaign for president in June 2015, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and other criminals into the United States. In a statement released before a December rally, he called for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

In the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the number of citizenship applications spiked by nearly a quarter, to about 971,000. The following year, as the presidential campaign heated up, 986,000 applied.

Nonprofit organizations that help immigrants apply for naturalization, such as Catholic Charities, also are seeing more requests for information about citizenship and help with the application process.

“It really jumped up in 2017 and this year,” said Aimee Korolev, an attorney who leads the Immigrants’ and Language Rights Center, part of Indiana Legal Services Inc. in Indianapolis. “I think it is a direct result of the election. In our outreach, we always tell clients that the only way you know you won’t be deported is to be a citizen.”

Gregory Olson, who directs the New American Legal Clinic at the San Joaquin College of Law in California’s Central Valley, said he and his colleagues “are processing more applications than we ever have before.” The number has more than tripled in the past few years, he said, from about 35 applications per quarter in 2013 to 110 per quarter now.

Law students help with the applications, and Olson is hoping to add more paralegal help.

“The work has grown astronomically,” he said.

Since 2013, federal data shows that the time it takes for a naturalization application to wend its way through the approval process has more than doubled, from about four or five months to a year or more, depending on where the applicant lives. In Harlingen, Texas, for instance, the wait time is now as long as 18 months, according to recently released data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In Fort Myers, Florida, the wait is even longer, up to nearly 21 months.

That means that someone who applies now to become a citizen has almost no chance of getting sworn in before the November midterm elections.

The immigration agency recently began publicly acknowledging the surge in applications and in mid-March changed its online listing to more accurately reflect wait times, agency officials said.

Cabrera, the agency spokeswoman, said by email that the agency is reviewing its procedures and looking to new technology to “more efficiently” handle cases.

Tech issues add to problem

The crunch at the immigration agency is not caused simply by a surge in applications. Internal challenges such as long-festering technology issues, which date back to its 2005 move to online applications, and limits on spending caused by its fee-based funding system have hampered the agency for several years, as detailed in several inspector general’s reports and a report by the Government Accountability Office.

The fee-based funding was formally approved by Congress in 2002, when it separated immigration law enforcement functions from the segment of the agency that handles naturalization and green card processing. It is set up in such a way that makes it almost impossible for the agency to catch up.

The agency’s funding is primarily drawn from the $725 citizenship application fee, with less than $150 million annually from direct congressional appropriations, most of which pays for the E-Verify system employers can use to see whether a job applicant has legal status. In 2016, according to a recent report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ budget was 6 percent of the department’s overall budget of $64 billion, which includes money collected from fees.

The reliance on fees began during the Reagan administration to ensure that taxpayers – which includes green card holders and other noncitizens – would not foot the bill for those who want to become citizens.

The system works like this: When there are 50 applicants, the agency collects fees from those 50, which is enough to process the next 50. But when the number of applicants grows exponentially, the agency is paying for its operations with fees collected in the previous year from far fewer applicants, which inevitably contributes to a slowdown.

In the past, Congress has called on the immigration agency to make a big dent in its backlog. The Congressional Research Service noted that from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2010, Congress provided about $574 million to help reduce a growing backlog in processing applications.

But Congress has rarely stepped in to provide such additional funds. Currently, the immigration debate in Congress is elsewhere, focused on enforcement at the Mexican border and the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

The funding bill approved by Congress in March allocated $1.6 billion to boost enforcement on the border with Mexico, including construction of new fencing.

Long-awaited gifts of citizenship

Roberto Gil, 48, a well-known youth soccer coach in the San Francisco Bay Area and the 2015 Community MVP for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, is one of thousands recently trapped in limbo by the slowdown.

“I was freaking out; it was taking forever,” Gil said. He has been in the U.S. since he was 15 and had one traffic violation a few decades ago, Gil said. He worried that might mar his application.

“It took me, like, six or seven months to hear back,” he said. “I got an interview, and then they don’t tell you yes or no.”

A few months later, a letter arrived with the good news: application approved. He was sworn in as a U.S. citizen in February, a year after he had applied – and plans to register to vote soon. It was a big decision for Gil, who said that after Trump’s election in 2016, he had considered moving to Canada.

“It is more welcoming there,” he said.

Martha Garcia, 38, recently visited Catholic Charities’ office in Santa Ana, California, with her parents, who are in their mid-70s. All three plan to apply for citizenship. But given the wait times, Garcia knows she is unlikely to reach one of her goals this year: being able to vote.

“I always wanted to vote, and I can’t,” she said. “That was bothering me.”

Garcia’s five children were born in the U.S. and thus are citizens. “I want to be part of that with my kids,” she said.

She hopes that by becoming a citizen, she will be able to help her partner, who works in construction, eventually become a citizen, too. He pays taxes and into the Social Security system, but like many without documentation, he can’t get a refund or have his Social Security payments credited.

Laura Vazquez who works on immigration issues for UnidosUS (formerly the National Council of La Raza), said immigration advocacy organizations have asked repeatedly for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to try to process naturalization applications more quickly, but they haven’t seen much action from the agency. There currently are no requests for extra funding from Congress or other efforts to increase its staff that works on applications.

“The number of applications has been increasing for quite some time,” Vazquez said. And more applications are likely, she said, because of the 2020 presidential election.

“The issue of 2020 is looming. Unfortunately, this is only going to get worse.”","Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://codcourier.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/20180417_Reveal_Naturalization119-1011x675-900x601.jpg,"['agency', 'citizenship', 'anxiety', 'green', 'times', 'flood', 'citizen', 'process', 'naturalization', 'immigration', 'card', 'wait', 'applications', 'increases', 'applicants']",

The air quality crisis has gained greater recognition as the impact of air pollution has been better quantified. Total air pollution was responsible for 6.1 million deaths in 2016, with ambient (outdoor) air pollution being the largest contributor, accounting for 4.1 million deaths, according to a large-scale study by the Health Effects Institute.

The problem is getting a lot worse as the Earth’s population has rapidly urbanised. Global deaths linked to ambient air pollution are estimated to have increased by 19.5 per cent from 3.3 million in 1990.

It means air pollution has become the 4th highest cause of death among all health risks, exceeded only by high blood pressure, diet, and smoking.

The report used new technology including satellite data in conjunction with greater levels of pollution monitoring, to assess the impact of air pollution across the globe.

Air pollution is a complex mixture of particles and gases which differs from region to region and even within cities, but fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the measure used as the chief indicator of pollution levels.

It report says an estimated seven billion people, 95 per cent of the earth’s population, live in areas where (PM2.5) exceeds the World Health Organisation’s air quality guidelines, and that 60 per cent live in places where fine particulate matter exceeds even the least stringent WHO air quality targets.

The problem is most acute in Asia, with India and China accounting for over half (51 per cent) of all global deaths from ambient air pollution.

The report includes studies to identify the major sources of air pollution in these two countries.

Researchers found in China that coal-burning in industry, for power and for residential heating was the largest contributor to outdoor air pollution, followed by transport, residential biomass (solid fuel) burning, non-coal industry and open burning of agricultural land.

In India, the largest overall source of outdoor air pollution is from residential biomass burning, followed by coal-burning.

The report separately assesses levels and impacts of household air pollution, and points out that over a third of the planet’s population is exposed to pollution in the home where fine particulate matter can exceed air quality guidelines by as much as 20 times.

Despite the grim overall picture, China’s ambient air pollution has begun to see declines in recent years, as the government moves to tackle coal combustion. But in contrast, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India have experienced the steepest increases in air pollution levels since 2010.

86,86,FL-2018-000050-CHN,South Sudan's Refugee Flow Often a Children's Crisis - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/south-sudans-refugee-flow-often-childrens-crisis,"ARUA, UGANDA - The flood of South Sudanese refugees from the country's 5-year civil war has been called a children's crisis.



More than 60 percent of the well over one million refugees who have poured into neighboring Uganda are under the age of 18, government and United Nations officials say. More than two million people have fled South Sudan overall.



Amid the fighting, over 75,000 children have found themselves on their own in Uganda and other neighboring countries, according to the U.N. refugee agency, separated from their families in the chaos or sent by their parents to relative safety.



While many children have reunited with relatives after crossing the border, others are matched by aid workers with foster families in an effort to minimize the disruption in their lives. Without parents, some children are left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, aid workers say.



Some teenagers find themselves the head of their households, taking care of siblings.



One 16-year-old boy now takes care of his younger brother. ""My father was shot in the war,"" he said. ""And then my mother, I don't know where she went."" He doesn't know if she's dead or alive.



The brothers fled to Uganda on the back of a car after seeing their father's body on a street in their village. After arriving in Uganda they were taken to a reception center run by the U.N. refugee agency.



Efforts to support the children have been hurt by a recent scandal in Uganda in which officials were accused of inflating refugee numbers to siphon off aid money. That has shaken international donors.



Aid workers say resources are stretched thin as they try to place the unaccompanied children with foster families with close ethnic ties.



It's crucial to place children with families that speak the same language, said James Kamira, a child protection expert with the World Vision aid agency.



One young mother of two, Beatrice Tumalu, now takes care of eight other children who are not her own.



""I feel pity for them,"" she said, as she grew up under similar circumstances during the years that South Sudan fought for independence from Sudan. That independence was won in 2011, and South Sudan's civil war broke out two years later.



The unaccompanied children have little of that aid workers call psychosocial support to help deal with trauma. In one refugee settlement just six case workers are available for 78,000 children, according to the Danish Refugee Council.



Another 16-year-old said his parents died three years ago in South Sudan. He walked into Uganda last year and later was placed with a foster family from another ethnic group.



""Staying there, it is not very well,"" he said of the cultural and communication issues.



Sitting against a tree, he opened the Bible he carried with him and began to cry as he read one passage: ""I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.""



South Sudan's many unaccompanied children need stability and education or ""we can lose actually that generation,"" warned Basil Droti, who is in charge of child protection at one settlement for the Danish Refugee Council.

The

by fijian competition and consumer commission (fccc)

The recent flooding in the Western and Northern division caused by Tropical Cyclone Josie and Keni has affected members of the public and businesses in a number of areas.

The Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) is mindful of the fact that post natural disasters businesses which are affected often increase the price of basic goods as a means to recover their losses.This could be that the cost of doing business may have increased for the trader.

The FCCC has also noted that some businesses try to recover their losses by selling off the flood affected goods (products) or items to unsuspecting consumers,without clearly disclosing that the good(s) (product(s)) was affected by disaster.Businesses may engage in such actions with a view to maximize their profit while ensuring to recover the loss.

Despite the situation it is imperative for businesses and stakeholders to take heed of the following information:

Price Controlled Items greement

The list of items under price control need to be sold at the respective authorised prices.Natural disasters do not mean that the prices of basic food items, particularly those controlled by FCCC can be hiked.

Any changes to prices of price-controlled items will come by way of signed Authorisation by the Commission, the same will be communicated to respective stakeholders.

If it is identified that businesses engage in selling price-controlled item(s) above the authorised prices, FCCC would take appropriate action against the business to remedy the issue.”

Avoid Profiteering and Price Gouging ootprint

Often it is noted that post natural disasters, the prices for goods or services go up whereby businesses seem to hike sale price to cover loss and/or shortage of supply.

In doing so, people, particularly those less fortunate, struggle to make ends meet.

While FCCC is mindful of such factors, however it would like to clarify that the FCCC’s role is not to stop price increases which occur following supply constraints caused by natural disaster such as cyclones, rather, it is to ensure that businesses do not make misleading claims when they attribute any price increases to such situation in a bid to artificially raise prices.

The conduct of misleading and deceiving consumers is contrary to Section 75 of the FCCC Act 2010.

Where such conduct occurs, the FCCC has the power to issue warning notices, infringement notices, impose penalties of up to $50,000.00 and Prosecute traders accordingly.

Upon prosecuting traders FCCC may make an application to Courts to impose penalties of up to $250,000.00 per contravention.

Limiting Purchase

It is imperative for businesses to refrain from limiting the purchasing power of a consumer.

It has been noted in the past that traders inform consumers that they can only purchase a certain amount of products.

For instance, if a consumer wishes to purchase three (3) bottles of 1litre soya bean oil, they are restricted to purchase only one (1). Such conduct is contrary to Section 87I of the FCCC Act 2010.

Sale of Water-damaged Products

Businesses must be honest towards their customers when selling flood affected products including vehicles.

If the product quality has been affected making it not fit for its intended purpose, then the business should refrain from selling it.

It would be advisable that businesses dispose of such damaged goods (products).

However, if a business decides to sell goods (products) which had been affected or damaged by water, the business must ensure that the good (product) is still fit for its intended purpose and the business must clearly inform the consumers that the good (product) had water damage.

If traders sell items of non-merchantable quality goods (products) deceptively or by misleading, then they may be liable for enforcement action under the FCCC Act 2010.

Further, it is advisable for motor vehicle dealers to not lie or withhold information while selling motor vehicles if the motor vehicles had sustained water damage during floods or disasters.

By withholding this information from a consumer before sale, the business would have deemed to have acted deceptively which is a contravention of FCCC Act 2010.

Charity Scams

O In the past, fake charities and fundraisers have taken advantage of public generosity post natural disasters.

Traders should ensure their business is aloof of such practices and their staff members do not use the business name to source funds from the public.

Simultaneously, businesses should avoid giving charity to scammers.

Those who may come seeking financial assistance for a legitimate charity, check for the following:

I.Charity you are donating to – whether it is legitimate or not;

II.The physical location of the organization;

III.Identification card of the collector; and

Receipt post payment.

FCCC wishes to reiterate that post natural disasters are trying times for both business houses as well as consumers.

However, one shall not engage in unfair trade practices to simply profiteer.

The FCCC will act within its jurisdiction and take enforcement action against those traders if identified that they fail to comply with the FCCC Act 2010.

88,88,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Twitter doesn’t care that someone is building a bot army in Southeast Asia - TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/20/twitter-doesnt-care-that-someone-is-building-a-bot-army-in-southeast-asia/,"Facebook’s lack of attention to how third parties are using its service to reach users ended with CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking questions from congressional committees. With that in mind, you’d think that others in the social media space might be more attentive than usual to potentially malicious actors on their platforms.

Twitter, however, is turning the other way and insisting all is normal in Southeast Asia, despite the emergence of thousands of bot-like accounts that have followed prominent users in the region en masse over the past month.

Scores of reporters and Twitter users with large followers — yours truly included — have noticed swarms of accounts with generic names, no profile photo, no bio and no tweets that have followed them over the past month.

It’s been a month already and the twitter bots just keep showing up. Anyone else seeing the same thing? pic.twitter.com/YEGcGnUYxd — Lulu Yilun Chen (@luluyilun) April 18, 2018

The deluge of Asia @Twitter bot follows continues unabated. Sigh pic.twitter.com/jD5JbOQnT2 — Jerome Taylor (@JeromeTaylor) April 10, 2018

These accounts might be evidence of a new “bot farm” — the creation of large numbers of accounts for sale or usage on-demand, which Twitter has cracked down on — or the groundwork for more nefarious activities, it’s too early to tell.

In what appears to be the first regional Twitter bot campaign, a flood of suspicious new followers has been reported by users across Southeast Asia and beyond, including Thailand, Myanmar Cambodia, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Sri Lanka among other places.

While it is true that the new accounts have done nothing yet, the fact that a large number of newly created accounts have popped up out of nowhere with the aim of following the region’s most influential voices should be enough to concern Twitter. Especially since this is Southeast Asia, a region where Facebook is beset with controversies — from its role inciting ethnic hatred in Myanmar, to allegedly assisting censors in Vietnam, witnessing users jailed for violating lese majeste in Thailand and aiding the election of controversial Philippines leader Duterte.

Then there are governments themselves. Vietnam has pledged to build a cyber army to combat “wrongful views,” while other regimes in Southeast Asia have clamped down on social media users.

Despite that, Twitter isn’t commenting.

The U.S. company issued a no comment to TechCrunch when we asked for further information about this rush of new accounts, and what action Twitter will take.

A source close to the company suggested that the sudden accumulation of new followers is “a pretty standard sign-up, or onboarding, issue” that is down to new accounts selecting to follow the suggested accounts that Twitter proposes during the new account creation process.

Twitter is more than 10 years old, and since this is the first example of this happening in Southeast Asia that explanation already seems inadequate at face value. More generally, the dismissive approach seems particularly naive. Twitter should be looking into the issue more closely, even if for now the apparent bot army isn’t being put to use yet.

Facebook is considered to be the internet by many in Southeast Asia, and the social network is considerably more popular than Twitter in the region, but there remains a cause for concern here.

“If we’ve learned anything from the Facebook scandal, it’s that what can at first seem innocuous can be leveraged to quite insidious and invasive effect down the line,” Francis Wade, who recently published a book on violence in Myanmar, told the Financial Times this week. “That makes Twitter’s casual dismissal of concerns around this all the more unsettling.”","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/twitter-app-icon-ios.jpg?w=574,"['accounts', 'bot', 'techcrunch', 'doesnt', 'asia', 'region', 'army', 'users', 'social', 'care', 'building', 'twitter', 'southeast', 'myanmar', 'large']",

Viridity Energy Solutions – focused on offering battery storage and distributed generation, demand response and demand management solutions – has signed Dynapower to a master supply agreement. Dynapower will supply its inverter and fully-integrated storage systems for utility scale and behind-the-meter projects to projects developed by Viridity.

The first two projects being built in new Jersey will make use of the Dynapower CPS-2200 inverter (image below). The unit is described as being a subcomponent of the IPS-2200 battery energy storage system (BESS) – however, the company only lists the IPS-500 on their website (header image is of IPS-500).

pv magazine sees a constant flood of news talking about utility scale solar power developments and energy storage. Since inverter manufacturers have global brand name significance, it make sense that we’re going to see names like Dynapower start to build a much broader recognition than they’ve already got.

91,91,FL-2018-000050-CHN,Cycle makers urge govt to halt dumping - The Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/cycle-makers-urge-govt-to-halt-dumping/1138992/,"PBS is unique where users are able to hire a bicycle for short-distance travel, thus letting it be shared between several users in a day.

The All India Cycle Manufacturers’ Association (AICMA) on Thursday strongly urged the Centre to halt the dumping of cheap Chinese bicycles used for public bicycle sharing (PBS) schemes in India. It pointed out that there was a disturbing development of unfair competition from cheap Chinese bikes, cluttering urban landscapes on the back of artificial demand propped up by unregulated bicycle sharing apps in India. China’s two largest operators Ofo and Mobike are in competition with eight other local entities for the PBS market with the launch of 100 smart city projects in various phases. PBS is unique where users are able to hire a bicycle for short-distance travel, thus letting it be shared between several users in a day.

“What’s of concern (apart from the real threat of mass unemployment and loss of business) is the fact that the playing field becomes very uneven and unfair when heavily subsidised products flood a market that’s attempting to usher in safety standards and healthy practices,” said Pankaj M Munjal, Hero Cycles chairman, and a senior official of the association.

In a memo, the association has urged the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs to issue tender guidelines to all urban local bodies for the use of Made-in-India bicycles in PBS in line with the ‘Make in India’ circular of DIPP. The department of revenue should impose 60% import duty on PBS units, the memo added. According to Munjal, heavy government subsidies on Chinese production have ensured that China retains comparative advantage in global trade.

Dumping of products could cause accumulated losses to 4,000 small and micro units and potentially put the employment of its million-strong workforce in jeopardy, he added. The government’s ‘Make in India’ policy also necessitates an executive intervention, he said. The estimated demand in public and private PBS units in India would be around two million in the next 3-5 years. This is estimated to displace around 40 million retail ‘Made-in-India’ bikes from the domestic market in 3-5 years (on the assumption that each PBS bike replaces around 20 retail bikes).

PBS is already in place in Mysuru, Bhopal, Coimbatore and Pune and is in the pipeline in many cities.

At 16.5 million bicycles produced last fiscal alone, India is the second-largest bicycle manufacturer in the world with 4,000 micro and large units in operation, reporting an annual turnover of `6,000 crore. It provides employment to 1 million workers across the value chain with 11 crore bicycle users on record.

PBS was slowly evolving globally until 2014, when Chinese entrepreneurs popularised a dockless version, in which an individual needs to only download a smartphone app, make an online payment, locate and unlock a bike with an RFID chip and after finishing travel, leave the bike where the ride ends after locking it again. Conceivably, this format brought much convenience to the user but left him/her no incentive to leave the bicycle in an appropriate parking space.

By June, 2017, China had notched up more than 200 million riders. But it became clear very soon that this ‘Park Anywhere’ policy, unregulated operation and the backing of venture capital from leading tech/internet companies were leading to Chinese bicycle manufacturing feeding the PBS market exclusively and creating unsustainable excess capacity in the industry.

Eventually, this trend turned into a big public nuisance. Heaps of used PBS bikes became a common sight in China. The Chinese government has decided to regulate this untenable operation and PBS growth rate in China is expected to fall from a whopping 735% in 2017 to a meagre 32% by 2019. All but the two largest PBS operators in China went bankrupt. The huge unused inventory and excess capacity and continued huge funding led operators such as Ofo and Mobike to explore opportunities in other countries, including India, the association pointed out.","Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/bike.jpg,"['chinese', 'units', 'makers', 'halt', 'users', 'china', 'urban', 'india', 'pbs', 'govt', 'bicycle', 'market', 'urge', 'cycle', 'million', 'dumping']",

From San Francisco to Washington, D.C., e-scooters and dockless bikes have become the latest transportation trend to grip urban spaces — and local governments are struggling to keep up.

The concept is simple: Riders download an app, find and unlock a scooter or bike, and leave it when they're done. Many cost as little as $1, and fans of the services tout them as faster, easier, and greener ways to get where they're going.

But some residents are angry about what they call bad behavior: riders weaving in and out of traffic without helmets; speeding down sidewalks and blocking the way for pedestrians and those with disabilities; and discarding bikes and scooters in inconvenient places. It's even inspired a hashtag: #ScootersBehavingBadly.

Cities have clashed with the rental companies on ways to approach regulation. San Francisco and Santa Monica both have issued cease-and-desist orders to a handful of firms until they can come up with solutions. In Austin, Texas, the company LimeBike deployed 200 scooters before it finished negotiating an agreement with the city.

Patrick Sisson, a reporter with the website Curbed, says local governments largely have been unprepared to regulate the new transportation technologies, and are having to play catch-up on creating new rules.

""It sort of follows the same blueprint we saw with Uber and Lyft, where tech companies are looking to provide transportation mobility solutions,"" Sisson says. ""But they're asking for forgiveness after the fact instead of permission before the fact.""

Interview Highlights

On #ScootersBehavingBadly in California

It's what some have called ""Scooter-geddon."" In San Francisco especially, people have been complaining quite a bit about these scooters — that they're blocking the right of way. San Francisco has issued a lot of declarations and passed laws that are looking for permitting of the scooters. They're actually even asking scooter riders to take photos of where they park their scooters to make sure the not blocking the right of way. In Santa Monica, the company Bird settled for $300,000 with the city after being fined for safety violations and blocking the right of way....

This is also spreading to cities like Washington, D.C., and Austin where people are having the same complaints.

On how e-scooters and dockless bikes provide solutions to other transportation issues

The tech companies — they're on to something. I mean, there's a great desire for people to have car-free, last-mile transportation solutions [instead of walking from the train or bus]. I remember speaking to someone in Santa Monica city government that says, ""You know, we really like the idea of having these around — it's just there's existing transportation infrastructure, there's safety issues. We just gotta make sure it's properly regulated.""

On cities' solutions to issues created by new forms of transportation

Seattle's been trialing a dockless bike parking space that maybe is showing what could be done in scooters and other situations. You're also seeing in San Francisco that Lyft is trialing a dropoff and pickup system, where they would designate certain parts of a neighborhood for dropping off and picking up riders. There's a lot going on, and I think we're still sort of an early days in terms of how this regulation is going to work.

BBC News Published 16 April 2018

image copyright PA

Commonwealth leaders are meeting in London. Here are seven things about this club of nations that you might not know.

1) It's home to almost one-third of the world's population

About 2.4 billion people - out of 7.4 billion globally - live in the Commonwealth's 53 countries. And most of them are under the age of 30.

The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. But 31 Commonwealth members have a population of 1.5 million people or fewer.

2) Some members were never part of the British Empire

image copyright Reuters image caption Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK

Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively, and neither has a British colonial past or constitutional link.

The club has lost members in the past. Robert Mugabe took Zimbabwe out in 2003 after its membership was suspended amid reports of election rigging.

Pakistan was suspended after a military coup in 1999 and was re-admitted four-and-a-half years later. And South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994.

The last country to leave was the Maldives in 2016.

3) The Queen is head of state in only 16 of the countries

Most of the Commonwealth states are republics and six - Lesotho, Swaziland, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Samoa and Tonga - have their own monarch.

image copyright Reuters image caption Tonga has its own King - Tupou VI (centre)

4) It's rather big

The Commonwealth makes up a quarter of the world's land mass.

The giant of the group is Canada, the world's second largest country. India and Australia are huge too. But many of the states are small - like the Pacific island nations of Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, and Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda in the Caribbean.

5) It changed its name

image copyright Getty Images image caption The Commonwealth heads of government also met in London in 1969

The modern Commonwealth was formed in 1949, after ""British"" was dropped from the name and allegiance to the Crown was removed from its statute. Only two people have been head of the organisation - King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. But it's not a hereditary role, although the Prince of Wales is widely expected to take it up when he becomes king.

The founding Commonwealth members were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, who formed a ""free association"" of independent countries.

The Commonwealth had no constitution until it adopted its Charter in 2012, which committed members to 16 values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security.

The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club and for having little influence. The Gambia announced its withdrawal in 2013 describing it as a ""neo-colonial institution"".

Supporters say the benefits which membership brings include developmental support and co-operation on international goals.

Secretary-general Lady Scotland, said: ""Our member countries have committed to nurture and protect democracy, development and respect for diversity.""

6) The UK still has the biggest Commonwealth economy… just

India could claim number one spot soon - possibly as early as this year.

The combined GDP of the 53 countries is $10tn (£7tn). That's nearly as big as China's ($11tn, £7.7tn) but some way behind that of the United States, on $19tn (£13.4tn).

UK exports to Commonwealth countries in 2016 were roughly the same as those to Germany, accounting for about 8.9% of all UK exports. Imports from the Commonwealth represented about 7.8% of the UK's total - equivalent to the value of those from China.

7) There's more than one commonwealth

image copyright EPA image caption The Commonwealth of Independent States met recently in Minsk, Belarus

Don't forget the International Organisation of La Francophonie - a group of French-speaking countries. And there's the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was set up in 1991 by former members of the Soviet Union.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Civil Protection Structure Meeting today, the IACM head stated that pipelines ought to be relocated to create room for the construction of the collection stations at seven drainage points spanning across Rua da Praia do Manduco and Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro (also known as San Ma Lo), in the Inner Harbour area.

Reiterating previous announcements, Tavares further indicated that the construction of the stations – aimed at relieving the flooding of public roads – would be completed by 2021.

Meanwhile, he said that the rainwater pumping stations will be located in Ponte 25 and 26, north of casino Ponte 16.

Photos themed ""the train traveling through a sea of flowers"" have gone viral on the Chinese internet. The photos feature S2 line trains traveling through a sea of peach and almond blossoms with Changping district's Juyongguan Pass section of the Great Wall in the background. Many professional and amateur photographers and other visitors flock to the area every spring. However, in contrast to the well-known trains and the sea of flowers, the staff who maintain the sprawling beauty of the ""floral sea"" are less known to the public. They are villagers from Juyongguan village in Changping, the capital's railway police, joint defense staff and employees from Beijing Shisanling Forestry.More than 1,100 villagers live in Juyongguan village, and more than 200 of them are ""flower guardians"" who help with the day-to-day upkeep of the magnificent scenic spot. The floral sea is monitored by a surveillance system 24 hours a day, and the villagers work 12 hours a day to ensure the safety of both visitors and the breathtaking flora, according to a report of qianlong.com in April.Starting from the flower season in 2016, Hou and several other villagers have manned a sentry post at the entrance to the floral sea. Visitors register to enter the park and deposit any dangerous belongings they may be carrying at the post, the qianlong.com report said.""Vehicles are not allowed to enter because the road is narrow, and there is no parking lot in the flower sea,"" said Hou in the report.He added that the Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway is under construction and that as there would be cement trucks coming and going, letting in private cars could cause traffic jams and impede the efficiency of the construction project and ultimately affect the schedule of the high-speed railway construction.Every year from the middle of March to late April, Hou and several other villagers work in the area from 6 am to 6 pm. ""Every household in the village is busy at home in spring. But even so, we put our own things aside to give the floral sea work the priority,"" he explained.On April 1, the flower park saw its tourists boom with the daily registration number hitting about 1,500. The villagers on duty were busy introducing how to prevent fires, how to be safe on the mountainside and how best to maneuver the pathways to visitors.One of the villagers said that it doesn't matter that their workload is heavy. The problem, the villager said, is that some visitors do not understand their work and how their actions can affect the plants, which makes things difficult for the workers. ""We told some visitors that there is a parking lot near the Juyongguan Pass and that they can park their cars there and walk to the scenic spot, but they are reluctant to do so, and some of them were even rude to us,"" said the villager.Nine surveillance cameras were installed in the area before the flower season begins this year. They are scattered across the park, at the various entrances and in areas that see a lot of foot traffic from visitors who want to capture the beautiful surroundings in photos or videos.The area is monitored 24 hours a day. Cheng Chunhong and other villagers rotate the day and night shifts. If they find visitors smoking on the mountainside or walking across the railway tracks, they will inform the staff members working at the scenic spot so that they can get them to stop and avoid incidents.""Everything we do is for the safety of the visitors and the scenic area,"" said Zhang Yu, who has been working for the railway for about five years. Every spring, he and nine other capital railway police and joint defense staff would patrol along a 3-kilometer-long section of the railway track in the area to ensure the safety and efficiency of the railway line.When the tourist number is high, the joint defense team meets more than 1,000 visitors every day, and at the same time, they must remain vigilant and keep an eye out for all kinds of bad behavior from tourists. Zhang said that some tourists even ""play peek-a-boo with them.""""We sometimes find them squeezing through the protective fence along the railway track and try hard to persuade them not to. They would then agree and desist, but later when we patrol the area again, we would find them doing it again,"" said Zhang.""The bad behavior of some visitors once caused an oncoming train to hit the brakes so as not to hit them. Such things have not happened over the past two years, but train drivers still ring an alarm if they see anyone near the railway track. Nothing is considered too small when it comes to incidents that occur on railway tracks; any small incidents that happen on the railway tracks will become a tragedy,"" he said.

Due to insufficient people in the joint defense team, 15 patrolmen from the town of Nankou in Changping district are posted along the railway track that runs through the floral sea.""It is dangerous here. Please leave quickly."" One would hear Yang Guanglin's voice before seeing him. He often has to shout at people to ask them to leave the protective fence along the railway track alone.As a member of the patrol team, Yang watches over a section of the protective barrier that is vulnerable and often catches visitors trying to squeeze through. The other day, an 82-year-old man squeezed through the fence, wanting to have a look at the view. Yang immediately persuaded him to leave. A train came soon after the old man left.""Old people usually move slowly. If I did not stop him in time, I cannot imagine the consequence,"" he said.

Xia Jianfeng is from Henan Province and has been working at Beijing Shisanling Forestry department for less than two months. Xia, whose face has been deeply tanned by the sun, said that his job is to prevent fires in the area.""I walk up and down the mountain every day from 6:30 am to 5 pm, and I stop visitors who are smoking the minute I see them.""Since the only place that one can have dinner near the scenic area is nongjiale, a farmer's house that has been converted into a bed-and-breakfast, which is not cheap for Xia, he brings hot water and instant noodles along with him for lunch every day.Xia goes up and down the mountain many times during the day and said he does not know how long he actually walks every day. He especially watches over the places where visitors and photographers flood to take photos and videos and makes sure that each highly-populated area has a staff member on duty.""There are eight people in our group. We walk along the mountain road and will keep an eye on places where a large number of tourists often build up.""As people's quality of life improve, traveling around to sightsee has become a trend. But safety should be the precondition for traveling, which is why the staff members are stationed at the floral sea.Zhang said what touches him the most is that many photographers who visit the floral sea help them to keep the order. ""We all know that only if we maintain a safe environment will the tourists be able to appreciate the blossoms as well as the 'the train bound for the spring,'"" said Zhang.For the ""flower guardians"" in the floral sea, their wish is that every visitor can respect the rules, not litter, not carry any flammable material and cooperate with them to be a member of the ""flower guardians.""

Nepal’s Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli has returned to Kathmandu after a three-day visit to India that lasted from April 6-8. It was his first foreign visit after being elected as the Prime Minister of Nepal for the second time. This visit was being carefully watched by all, as Prime Minister Oli is known to hold pro-China political views. India is increasingly worried over China’s growing influence in its neighbourhood.

The countries did not reach any agreement, but the Oli visit produced some joint statements, particularly one to extend the rail link from Raxaul in India to Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, which India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi floridly described as connecting Mount Everest with the sea; and another one to work for new connectivity between India and Nepal through inland waterways.

India’s willingness to build a railway connection is particularly significant as China has already started working to extend its railway network to Nepal. However, as the joint statement does not mention any particular river or any specific water route for inland waterways, it is doubtful if India is really serious about the second proposal.

The inland waterways plan, if it gets implemented, will not be free from controversies considering the troubled history of water relations between the two countries. Two water projects, which have made bilateral relations tense in recent months are the Budha Gandaki project – which Oli wants Chinese companies to build but India is opposed to it – and complications over delayed implementation of the proposed Pancheshwar Dam on the Mahakali River along the India Nepal border.

The joint statements have avoided these two contentious issues. As it looks now, the future of the Budha Gandaki project is quite uncertain due to the ongoing China-India ‘Cold War’.

After reaching Kathmandu, Prime Minister Oli addressed a press conference at the airport. He did not mention Budha Gandaki, but made it clear that he has taken up the matter regarding delayed implementation of Pancheshwar Dam project with India and has asked for an early start of its work.

It is however not as easy for the Indian government to start the Pancheshwar Dam construction as Oli has hoped. Protests in Nepal against ‘Indian’ projects have recently delayed the construction of several planned Indian dams, including the Karnali Project (Chisapani Dam) and the Kosi high-dam project.

The most controversial and complicated one is India’s planned water storage projects on the Mahakali River, particularly the Pancheshwar Dam. It is thus important to understand the complex and conflictual history of this project and the futility of the riparian countries hoping of an early completion of it.

Dam trouble

The origin of the Pancheshwar Dam trouble goes back to when India’s colonial rulers had signed the Sarada Treaty with Nepal in 1920. India constructed the Sarada barrage on Mahakali River after exchanging 4,000 acres of territory with Nepal. But Nepal became unhappy with its share of 400 cusecs of water allocated by the treaty. Moreover, the construction of the Sarada Barrage also brought difficulty for the implementation of Nepal’s own Mahakali Irrigation Project.

Downstream of the Sarada Barrage, the Mahakali once again flows into Nepal, and then into India where it joins the Ghagra River.

In 1983, India unilaterally started the construction of a 120-megawatt dam, called Tanakpur power project, in its own territory, which was completed in 1989. To increase the size of the pondage to ensure uninterrupted operation of the hydropower plant, India wanted the bund to be extended to the contiguous high ground in Nepal. In exchange of 2.9 hectares of land from Nepal, India agreed to provide to Nepal 150 cusecs of water and 10 megawatts of electricity from the Tanakpur project at no cost. In December 1991, the decision was formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries, which is commonly referred to as the Tanakpur Agreement.

This Tanakpur Agreement became extremely controversial in Nepal, as it was framed in nationalist terms, by raising concern for Nepal’s territorial sovereignty. The opposition accused the government of ignoring Nepal’s interests to appease India. When India’s then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited Nepal in 1992, the Indian side made some concessions. The Pancheshwar project on the river and other possible interventions were separated from the understanding reached on Tanakpur, allowing both countries the possibility to negotiate for any other development in the Mahakali basin. India agreed to provide an additional 10 megawatts of electricity to Nepal, making a total of 20 megawatts.

These Indian concessions were not enough to satisfy the public opposition against the project in Nepal. After a change of government in India, on February 12, 1996, the Prime Ministers of India and Nepal signed the Mahakali Treaty. The Treaty included three separate water development projects in its scope. In addition to endorsing the Tanakpur MoU of 1991, the Treaty took under its annex the regime established by the 1920 Sarada Treaty. It also included the planned construction of the Pancheshwar Hydropower Project on a stretch of the Mahakali between the two countries.

This proposed 315-metre-high rock-fill dam, if built, is going to be the second highest in the world after the Rogun Dam in Ukraine. The reservoir of this dam is expected to store 12 billion cubic metre of water of the Mahakali River to supply 885 cumecs discharge below the power house, of which there will be 3,240 megawatts hydropower capacity on each side of the river. In Nepal, the reservoir is expected to flood 54 square kilometres of land and in India, it will inundate 80 square kilometres.

The 1996 Treaty is based on the principle that, as a boundary river, the Mahakali will be developed in an integrated way to maximise the total net benefit from development. The Treaty has also the provisions for the establishment of the Mahakali River Commission with its relatively broad mandate.

Dam tussle

In spite of having some of these progressive provisions, the construction of the Pancheshwar Dam has not started yet as it continues to be a politically volatile issue. Nepal had prepared a detailed project report in 1995, but India took till 2003 to prepare its report. At the time of signing the treaty, it was estimated that the installed hydropower capacity of the project would be 6,480 megawatts, but the latest estimate suggests it will be only of 4,800 MW. Moreover, the water demand in the two countries is much higher than the proposed project’s augmentation plan. The countries also disagree over the sharing of the capital cost and even had to revise the original plan about the location of re-regulating the Rupaligad Dam downstream of the Pancheshwar Dam site. Not only that, while India proposes phasing the power component in two stages for an assured supply of water to its Girjapur barrage downstream, Nepal prefers to maximise the power benefit.

When Modi visited Nepal in August 2014, a new MoU was signed between the two countries regarding the amendment of Terms of Reference of the Pancheshwar Project. Immediately after that, in September 2014, the governing body of the Pancheshwar Development Authority met for the first time. Though Modi had assured Nepal to start construction of the project within one year, almost four years have passed but the project is yet to start, in spite of India’s increased interest in it in recent years. This dam is the key to the planned Sharda-Yamuna River link project to address Delhi’s growing water demand. The Modi government has given top priority to implement the country’s decades-old controversial plan of river linking.

However, the construction of this mega-dam is not going to be as easy as Indian authorities are pretending. The dam project is expected to displace 19,700 people in the state of Uttarakhand and 11,466 people in Nepal. In June 2017, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had decided to approve the project without doing the usual joint environmental impact assessment with Nepal.

After strong opposition from affected people and environmental groups, a public hearing process of expected dam affected people started in August 2017. Due to the region’s rich anti-dam protest movement experiences, those against the Pancheshwar Dam have already come out to protest, as should have been expected.

Dam danger

Besides the displacement of a large population, the dam project is also being opposed due to its location in a highly ecologically sensitive and earthquake prone zone. The Pancheshwar Dam project and it being part of the three controversial projects under one agreement has all the ingredients to be highly controversial before and after its construction.

The governments of India and Nepal seem to have failed to learn from their experiences that building large dams is not an easy proposition for them anymore. These dams are highly expensive and environmentally destructive. Moreover, both India and Nepal have strong history of anti-dam protests.

Democratization in Nepal has given further strength to not only the country’s anti-dam activism but also to its anti-India political groups. It is high time India tries to make a new start in re-conceptualising its bilateral river water cooperation with Nepal. India should move beyond its old idea of big-dam centric water management of the shared rivers and try to actively explore cooperation over alternative smaller hydropower possibilities in Nepal. By forcing Nepal to make sacrifices for its mega dam projects, India has already ruined its relations with Nepal. Oli’s visit had offered an opportunity for India to start discussing a new start and think of alternative ideas, but unfortunately that has not been grabbed.

It will be good for the both the countries to find new ways as soon as possible to move out of the conflict trap and start to build cooperation over their shared water resources.

99,99,FL-2018-000050-CHN,‘Rampage’ Rounds $217M Overseas; ‘A Quiet Place’ Cranks WW Volume To $207M – International Box Office - Deadline,https://deadline.com/2018/04/rampage-ready-player-one-quiet-place-peter-rabbit-china-weekend-international-box-office-1202373911/,"TUESDAY AM UPDATE, writethru: New Line/Warner Bros’ Rampage continued to dominate overseas play over the weekend, adding a better-than-estimated $58M in 61 markets to push the international box office to $217.6M through Sunday. The global tally on the Dwayne Johnson-starrer is $283.3M, also through Sunday. In China, Rampage crossed the $100M threshold and held No. 1 as it did in many key markets, easing only slightly in some of the smaller hubs. It still has France, Germany and Japan up its sleeve in May.

Rampage‘s week-on-week drop was 50% during a frame that saw summer weather largely blanket Western Europe, meaning moviehouses will have seen less traffic across the region. Overall, there were no major new wide releases as the world awaits Avengers: Infinity War which starts offshore rollout on Wednesday. Instead, this was a frame of holdovers and expansions with some notable milestones achieved.

As we reported Saturday, Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One crossed the $200M mark in the Middle Kingdom, and the $500M mark worldwide. With a full $23M in the current offshore frame, the cumes are $395.8M international and $521.9M global. The Warner Bros/Amblin/Village Roadshow movie notably began its box office quest in Japan where it grossed $4.4M on 745 screens to best Kong: Skull Island’s opening by 20%.

Meanwhile, Paramount’s A Quiet Place, refuses to be silenced. The John Krasinski-helmed scarer knocked out another $15M to increase the overseas volume to $74.8M off a 37% third-session drop and pacing above most comps. The global cume is $207.16M.

Sony Animation Elsewhere, Sony’s Peter Rabbit is springing towards $200M internationally, having now overtaken the overseas lifetimes of both Paddington movies and still with Korea and Japan to hop on board. Worldwide, the Beatrix Potter bunny has $310M in the basket.

This week will see the mightily anticipated arrival of Disney/Marvel’s Infinity War beginning Wednesday in Australia, France, Korea and more before expanding through Friday everywhere except Russia and China. In the latter, there are no major Hollywood titles bowing until May 11 when the Avengers assemble which will give the holdovers a bit of space. An upcoming local movie to keep an eye on in the Middle Kingdom is romance film Us And Them which is tracking well ahead of next weekend’s May 1 holiday. We’ll be back early this week with a preview of the global outlook for the next session.

Breakdowns on this weekend’s films, and actuals where available, have been updated below.

RAMPAGE

WB With an additional $58M in 61 markets on 33,140 screens, New Line/Warner Bros’ Rampage crossed the $200M mark at the international box office this weekend. The overseas cume is $217.6M through Sunday with $283.3M global. About 48% of the session came from China where the Dwayne Johnson-starrer picked up $26.9M and held No. 1. The total there is $106.4M through Sunday The studio gets 25% of the take in the Middle Kingdom where there is still some swing room for Rampage. There are no major Hollywood titles on deck until May 11 when Avengers: Infinity War arrives. In the meantime, however, there will be a flood of local pics including romance film Us And Them which is tracking well ahead of the May 1 holiday.

Overall, Rampage (est production cost $120M) held onto its No. 1s in several markets also including Korea, the UK, Mexico and the UAE. In the UK, the drop was significant, although summer weather is likely part culprit there.

In Latin America, the film was No. 1 for a 33% regional drop. Some smaller individual markets had tight holds: Philippines (-38%), Argentina (-26%), Chile (-18%), New Zealand (-13%) and Israel (-7%).

The Top 5 markets outside China are Korea ($10.2M), Mexico ($9.8M), the UK ($9.2M), Malaysia ($6.2M) and Indonesia ($5.3M).

Rampage still has France (May 2), Germany (May 10) and Japan (May 18) to come.

READY PLAYER ONE

Warner Bros. Crossing $500M worldwide this weekend and $200M in China, Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi pop culture ode took in $23M during the frame on 14,750 screens in 67 markets.

The final market for RP1, Japan, opened this session and delivered $4.4M on 745 screens. The results are 20% above Kong: Skull Island, 28% better than Pacific Rim: Uprising, 39% bigger than Jumanji and more than triple the first Hunger Games.

RP1 fell to No. 3 this weekend in China as local picture 21 Karat took the silver. Although the studio recoups just 25%, the Middle Kingdom run has been spectacular with a total now of $207.4M and a spot on the charts as the No. 10 biggest Hollywood grosser in the market. It is also by far the biggest U.S. movie of the year there.

A QUIET PLACE

Paramount Pictures From Paramount and Platinum Dunes, the John Krasinski-helmed silent horror pic had another scary good hold overseas in the third session. It dipped just 37% from last weekend, which itself had dropped by just 25%. Speaking volumes in 57 markets, it added $15M for an offshore cume of $74.8M and a worldwide tally of $207.16M including its stellar domestic run. It still has France, Japan and China to come.

For all markets in release, the Krasinski/Emily Blunt-starrer is now 87% above Don’t Breathe, 61% above Get Out, 58% over Lights Out, 5% above The Conjuring and 9% below Split. (The latter last year finaled at $140M overseas.)

Stuffing his basket with another $6.4M, the blue-jacketed rascal has now grossed $195.7M overseas and $310M worldwide. Korea and Japan are still on deck in May.

The Will Gluck-directed story of Beatrix Potter’s classic character has become the biggest non-Bond Sony movie ever in the UK after recently holding No. 1 for four weeks. Sony opened the movie there well ahead of Easter in order to tee it up for the holidays which clearly paid off. The UK gross is a leading $54.5M, followed by China with $26.2M, Australia at $17.2M, Germany’s $11.4M and Russia’s $9.5M.

ISLE OF DOGS

Fox Searchlight Wes Anderson’s Isle Of Dogs barked up in China this weekend, where the stop-motion animated pic played on 13,000 screens and grossed $4.1M. The Fox Searchlight film grew from Friday to Saturday and was about even on Sunday, taking the No. 4 position behind Rampage, Ready Player One and a local opener. Chinese audiences have given it a terrific 8.5 score on Douban. In total this session, Anderson’s Berlin Silver Bear winner added $5.5M in 14 markets to lift the overseas cume to $15.14M. The UK leads early international play with $7.7M.

TRUTH OR DARE

The sophomore session was worth $4.1M for a $7.9M rolling cume overseas and $38.3M worldwide on the $5M-budget pic. From director Jeff Wadlow, the movie saw a strong start in Mexico with $1.33M at 682 locations to track above Blumhouse’s Happy Death Day. The UAE is also tracking above that film as well as The Visit, opening to $229K on 45 screens. The UK was the top holdover despite the summer-like weather with a 58% drop and $556K at 432 dates. The cume there is $2.4M. There are several majors on deck throughout May and June.

BLOCKERS

Universal Universal’s comedy added another $2.5M in 27 offshore hubs for a $19.4M international cume and $67.5M global. The Netherlands was a new play with $273K at 69 dates and No. 3.

Taiwan was the next best opener with a good $270K start at No. 3 on 77 screens; that tops Game Night, Bad Moms and Sisters. Germany, again despite the sky-high mercury, was a strong hold (-52%) at No. 3 with a cume to date of $1.78M. Austria dipped 45% for a total $524K after two frames.
