0,0,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Dozens killed in China floods as rivers overflow - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/7/5/dozens-killed-in-china-floods-as-rivers-overflow,"More than 50 people killed as heavy rain has caused the Yangtse River and many of its tributaries to overflow.

At least 56 people have been killed and 22 are missing as heavy rains pummeled southern China, flooding towns, cutting off power and destroying houses, officials said on Tuesday.

Water levels in more than 60 different rivers have risen above warning levels, forcing more than 1.2 million people to evacuate.

Authorities said more than 38,000 homes have collapsed and nearly 880,000 hectares of crops have been damaged.

The Chinese government said it has disbursed $103m in emergency aid so far to help southern and central provinces deal with the flooding.

The annual floods have been even greater than normal and the past week has been particularly wet.

Changsa, the capital city of the province of Hunan, recorded nearly half a metre of rain in a week. This amount is well above the average and is nearer what could be expected on average throughout June, July, August and September put together.

Across Hunan, the flooding has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, damaged crops and destroyed houses, causing a total direct economic loss of $1.22bn, the provincial civil affairs office said.

The river Laodao, a tributary to the mighty Yangtse, exceeded its previous depth and set a new record. At nearly 40 metres, it required a 5km sandbank levee in a failed attempt to save Changsa from flooding.

Rising water levels left Orange Isle, a popular tourist destination in Changsha, almost completely submerged, with only roofs and trees peaking out above the floodwater.

The Yangtse itself, Asia’s longest river and with a capacity to match, has burst its banks in Hunan.

According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, continuous, heavy rain that started in mid-June has caused the water of 10 major tributaries of the Yangtze, as well as 89 middle and small-sized ones, to rise to record levels.

Over the past two days, the seasonal monsoon rainband, the meiyu-baiu front, has eased off in Hunan but reinvigorated in the southwestern province of Guangxi.

The water levels in the rivers of northern Guangxi are now a major concern, most having exceeded the warning line.

The forecast for the next couple of days sees much reduced rainfall in the currently flooded areas, although another 100mm is still possible in Anhui.

More worryingly, the area likely to receive heavy rain next is in Sichuan province, in the area of a recent fatal mountainside collapse.","Wed, 05 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/b0d6e764bc5b4abc99317d4c77616ae3_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['yangtse', 'river', 'rain', 'province', 'nearly', 'heavy', 'hunan', 'week', 'killed', 'dozens', 'floods', 'overflow', 'china', 'water', 'levels', 'rivers']", 
1,1,FL-2017-000075-CHN,"The World’s Most Catastrophic Floods, in Photos - History",https://www.history.com/news/worlds-most-catastrophic-floods-in-photos,"Floods were considered a blessing by certain civilizations—the Egyptians relied on the Nile’s yearly overflow for fertile soil—but they also stand as some of history’s most devastating natural disasters. Whether due to heavy rains, storm surges or busted dams, deluges have often claimed thousands of lives and left whole cities in ruin. In some cases, they even permanently changed the planet’s geography.

1. The Johnstown Flood was so massive it equaled the flow of the Mississippi River.

The disaster began shortly after 3 p.m on May 31, 1889, when a dam on Pennsylvania’s Lake Conemaugh washed away following several days of drenching rain. The collapse unleashed some 16 million tons of water, which quickly turned into a 40-foot-high, half-mile-wide surge of mud and debris. An hour later, the wave struck Johnstown like a giant fist, crushing some 1,600 buildings and sweeping away everything in its path. When the waters finally receded, over 2,200 people were dead and many more were injured or homeless. The flood was later blamed on the poorly maintained dam, which was owned by a hunting and fishing club, but no one was ever held financially liable for the disaster.

2. The Central China Flood may have killed as many as 3.7 million people.

In the summer of 1931, heavy snowmelt, torrential rains and seven different cyclonic storms combined to produce the most devastating flood in Chinese history. In the month of July alone, central China was swamped by as much precipitation as it typically received in a year-and-a-half. By August, the Yangtze, Yellow and Huai Rivers had all burst through their badly managed dikes and flooded an area larger than the size of England. Thousands died from drowning during the initial phase of the flood, but even more followed due to widespread famine and outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery.

3. One flood was known as the “Great Drowning of Men.”

The Grote Mandrenke was the result of a vicious North Sea tempest that swept across parts of Europe in January 1362. The effects of the storm were first felt in England, where one chronicler wrote that “a strong gale blew from the north so violently for a day and night that it flattened trees, mills, houses and a great many church towers.” The damage was even worse in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, which experienced a catastrophic storm surge that overran nearly every dike and levee in its path. Anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 people drowned, and it was said that 60 different parishes in Denmark were “swallowed by the salt sea.” Elsewhere in the Low Countries, erosion from the flood permanently transformed the coastline and led to the disappearance of whole islands. Along with other storms during the Middle Ages, the Grote Mandrenke also played a role in forming a shallow North Sea bay in the Netherlands known as the Zuiderzee.

4. Few floods in recorded history compare to the one that rocked the Indus River Valley in 1841.

The trouble began in January of that year, when an earthquake triggered a massive landslide on the slopes Nanga Parbat, a Himalayan peak located in what is now Pakistan. So much bedrock tumbled off the mountain that it blocked the flow of the rushing Indus River and created a lake 500 feet deep and several dozen miles long. When the natural dam finally burst that June, the lake emptied at a rate of 540,000 cubic meters per second, unleashing a gargantuan flood wave almost 100 feet high. The casualties from the disaster were not recorded, but it was known to have wreaked havoc on several hundred miles of the Indus Valley. Whole villages were wiped off the map, and an entire 500-man Sikh army was reportedly consumed near the city of Attock.

5. The United States’ most iconic river was the source of its most destructive freshwater flood.

In the spring of 1927, following months of unrelenting rain, the lower Mississippi River swelled to its breaking point and overran its levee system. The resulting flood swamped some 16 million acres across seven states from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans. The damage was at its worst in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, where the river inundated so much land it temporarily created a shallow sea over 75 miles wide and forced thousands to be evacuated by boat. By the time the waters finally receded later that summer, at least 250 people were dead and another 1 million had been driven from their homes—roughly one percent of the entire American population at the time.

6. This 1966 flood struck a devastating blow to Italy’s cultural treasures.

The deluge began on November 4, when a period of steady rain caused the Arno River to overflow, sending 18 billion gallons of mud and sludge pouring through the streets of Florence. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed, but the water also reached several art galleries and libraries containing priceless Renaissance-era relics. Some 1.5 million books were left submerged in the Biblioteca Nazionale. Elsewhere in the city, the torrent destroyed or damaged 1,500 frescoes, sculptures and paintings. In the wake of the disaster, a band of international volunteers known as the “Mud Angels” descended on Florence to pick through the debris and salvage waterlogged canvases and manuscripts. The teams rescued countless artworks, but in many cases, the restoration process has taken decades. Work on one famous painting, Giorgio Vasari’s 1546 “Last Supper,” was only completed in 2016.

7. Not all of history’s great floods can be blamed on Mother Nature.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War in June 1938, Chinese Nationalist troops intentionally destroyed several dikes on the Yellow River in an attempt to thwart invading Japanese forces. The Chinese hoped the scorched earth tactic would block Japanese access to a railway and slow their westward progress. What happened instead was an environmental disaster. Once the muddy river was set loose, it tumbled off course and flooded a 21,000-square-mile swath of Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces in the center of the country. An estimated 4 million people were displaced from their homes, and 800,000 died from drowning, disease and famine after the deluge continued unchecked. “Residents who have not died in the floods perish from hardship,” read a 1940 Chinese government report. “Those who have fortunately stayed alive are already urgently gasping for breath and groaning in agony.” The disaster dragged on for the rest of the war—the Chinese government initially tried to blame the busted dikes on a Japanese bombing—and it wasn’t until 1947 that engineers and laborers succeeded in returning the Yellow River to its original course.

8. Historians are still not entirely sure what caused one of Britain’s worst natural disasters.

The deluge began on the morning of January 30, 1607, when a great surge of seawater overran some 200 square miles of southwest England and Wales, completely drowning at least 20 villages. One witness wrote of seeing “huge and mighty hills of water, tumbling one over another” and advancing with “great swiftness” over the landscape. Such descriptions have led some researchers to theorize that the floods were the result of a massive tsunami brought on by an earthquake, but others maintain that a squall-induced storm surge and spring tide are the more likely culprits. Whatever its cause, the flooding proved devastating for the low-lying regions surrounding the Bristol Channel, where some 2,000 people were killed. In Somerset, the floodwaters surged 15 miles inland and briefly turned the famed hill at Glastonbury Tor into an island.","Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTU3ODc4NjAwMDI4MDA2MTEx/image-placeholder-title.jpg,"['great', 'million', 'mississippi', 'flood', 'worlds', 'floods', 'imagesthe', 'photos', 'devastating', 'river', 'disaster', 'miles', 'catastrophic']",

BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China is battling floods along the Yangtze River in the south while northern regions, including Beijing, endure a heat wave.

The first flood this year of the Yangtze River, the country's longest, is forming as water levels are rapidly rising in major tributaries in the middle and lower reaches, said the Yangtze River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters Saturday.

The headquarters ordered the Three Gorges Reservoir of the Yangtze to reduce the flow of discharging to 18,000 cubic meters per second from 2 p.m. Saturday to relieve the flood pressure downstream.

Other upstream reservoirs also joined the flood control efforts.

Floods have already hit the Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang and Zishui rivers in central China's Hunan, the worst-hit province. The rain continues in Changsha, the provincial capital and other cities such as Xiangtan and Huaihua.

The level of the Xiangjiang River in Changsha stood at 38.6 meters at 4 p.m. Saturday, well above the warning level of 36 meters and only 57 cm lower than its highest record level, according to the Hunan Provincial Hydrological Bureau.

The level of the Zishui River in Taojiang County was only 38 cm lower than its record level in history, said the bureau.

At around 1 a.m. Saturday, a 20-meter stretch of the Taxi river, a small branch of the Zishui River, burst due to flood, according to a local official.

The Hunan flood control and drought relief headquarters raised the flood response from Grade III to Grade II on Saturday. The province has mobilized soldiers, officials and villagers, allocated funds and sent relief supplies to affected areas.

As of Saturday, the rain had caused an evacuation of 310,000 in Hunan.

""The water level is rising and my house is in danger of being submerged. I was relieved when I saw a rescue boat coming,"" said Zhou Changsong, who was evacuated Saturday afternoon from Chenxi County, where eight towns were flooded by the Yuanjiang River. Around 100,000 people have been evacuated.

Downpours also hit Hubei, Guizhou and Jiangxi provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

In Jiangxi, which neighbors Hunan, seven people died and two were missing due to flood in the past ten days, showed statistics with the provincial flood control headquarters.

About 440,000 were evacuated in Jiangxi. On Saturday morning, a landslide buried two residential buildings in a village in Xiushui County, but caused no casualties as all 39 residents had been displaced on Thursday.

More than 70 passenger trains passing Jiangxi Province were suspended from Saturday to Monday due to floods, said the Nanchang Railway Bureau in Jiangxi.

The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters launched a Grade III emergency response plan Saturday and dispatched eight work teams to flood-stricken areas to guide relief work.

The National Meteorological Center (NMC) forecast Saturday afternoon rainstorms will hit Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui from Saturday night to Sunday.

In north China, a heat wave affected Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, with temperatures reaching 35 to 37 degrees Celsius at 2 p.m. Saturday, said the center.

In Beijing, many residents chose to stay indoors over the weekend due to the hot weather.

The NMC forecast the heat wave will continue in the north until Tuesday. Some areas will see temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius in Inner Mongolia, Hebei and Shaanxi on Sunday.","Sat, 01 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['endures', 'jiangxi', 'heat', 'focus', 'yangtze', 'xinhua', 'relief', 'zishui', 'flood', 'floods', 'china', 'river', 'battles', 'hunan', 'control', 'level', 'wave', 'headquarters', 'northern', 'southern']",

5,5,FL-2017-000075-CHN,"In drastic move, China's top hydropower plants slash capacity - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-weather-power-idUSKBN19P0D6,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Three Gorges and Gezhouba, two of China’s top hydropower plants, have closed capacity by as much as two-thirds, state media said on Tuesday, as torrential rains across the south triggered drastic steps to ease pressure on the Yangtze River.

Days of heavy rainfall have pushed water levels in more than 60 rivers in southern China above warning levels. Floods have damaged crops, forced hundreds of thousands from their homes and killed at least 33, while the north has wilted in a heat wave and drought-like conditions.

The Three Gorges dam is the world’s biggest power station by far, with an installed generation capacity of 22,500 megawatts (MW), equivalent to about 20 coal-fired stations.

The two power stations in Hubei province have stopped 26 generators, due to flood pressure in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Asia’s longest river, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Three Gorges Corp [CYTGP.UL], the world’s largest hydroelectric power producer.

Hydropower is China’s second largest electricity source after coal. The shutdowns have cut capacity by 13.52 gigawatts (GW) to just 7.5 GW. The Three Gorges plant has reduced capacity to 6 GW from 18.12 GW, while Gezhouba, some 38 kms (23 miles) away, has halved capacity to 1.5 GW from 2.9 GW.

Phone calls to Three Gorges were unanswered.

Hydropower schemes can shut during times of high rainfall to prevent flooding downstream or to protect their turbines.

Such measures are frequent during the rainy season in China’s south, but Li Rong, power analyst with consultancy SIA Energy, said the size of the current shutdown was unprecedented.

He estimated it at 200 GW hours of daily electricity output, about 40 percent of demand in Shanghai, China’s most populated city, during the summer peak season.

While the heavy rainfall has led to short-term power shutdowns, it is also helping to replenish reservoir levels in the country’s south, which had been falling in recent months, hurting output of hydro power.

Most of the nation’s hydro power plants are located in the southern provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou.

Any prolonged closure of the generators will renew concerns about higher demand for coal to fuel the nation’s thousands of thermal power plants as a weeks-long heatwave scorches the north.

Traders said that it would take at least a dozen large fossil fuel or nuclear power stations to make up for the hydro restrictions.

In recent weeks, Beijing has urged coal mines to ramp up output to ensure electricity supplies during peak hours as a prolonged bout of hot weather across the north has boosted demand for air conditioning.

On Tuesday, coal for export from Australia’s Newcastle terminal hit their highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand.

Unprecedented torrential rain has caused rivers to burst their banks, sweeping away roads and houses, and destroying schools.

Three people had been killed, three were in ""cardiopulmonary arrest"" and eight were injured, NHK reported, while about 300 were stranded, mostly in their homes, cut off by floods or landslides.

Thousands of soldiers and others were scrambling yesterday to reach people cut off by torrents of swirling water or threatened by landslides, the government said.

""We are in an extremely serious situation,"" Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso said, warning of the danger of collapsing hillsides and adding that ""many people are still missing"".

More than 50cm of rain deluged parts of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands, over 12 hours on Wednesday, the meteorological agency said.

Downpours will likely continue through today, the agency said as the region grapples with the aftermath of a typhoon that raked the country this week.

The authorities lifted ""special"" heavy rain warnings for the hardest-hit prefectures of Fukuoka and Oita, although other warnings, such as for rain, landslides and flooding, remained in place.

Japan is deploying 7,800 police officers, rescue personnel and troops in affected areas of Kyushu, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, telling reporters that ""there are about 20 people who are unaccounted for"".

They included a child reportedly carried off by a fast-flowing river and a couple who had not been seen since their house was swept away.

Television footage showed rolling waves from swollen rivers hitting residential areas, tearing up roads and inundating farmland.

Asakura was among the hardest hit with footage showing floodwaters surging through the streets.

Mr Ryoichi Nishioka, who grows flowers in the city, said he tried to save them from damage amid fast-rising waters the night before.

""I tried to protect them by covering them up but couldn't make it,"" he told AFP. ""Then the swirling water flooded this area and swept away the greenhouses.""

Mr Nishioka, 67, also described helping a man who clung to an electric pole as muddy waters rampaged through the area on Wednesday night. ""We had a blackout, so I used a flashlight... and shone some light for him,"" he said. ""I was calling out to encourage him for three hours from 9pm to midnight. The man was ultimately rescued,"" he added.

An elderly man in the hard-hit Haki district of Asakura told NHK how furniture bobbed in the floodwaters that inundated his home. ""I dodged them and escaped in a gush of water,"" he said.

A railroad bridge has been destroyed by the raging Kagetsu river, disrupting train services, a railway spokesman said. Several other train lines were also forced to delay or stop operations due to heavy rain, while local officials called off primary and middle-school classes.

Heavy rain forces closure of train tunnel

CHANGSHA • More than 100 trains have been suspended after heavy rain flooded a tunnel on a key railway line through central China, according to railway authorities.

Water flowed into Liuyanghe Tunnel along the high-speed railway between Beijing and Guangzhou early yesterday, Xinhua reported.

The tunnel has been closed and maintenance crews are using equipment to pump out the water, Guangzhou Railway (Group) Corporation said.

Trains that pass through Hunan and Hubei provinces were affected. As of 10am yesterday, 104 train services had been suspended.

Torrential rain has lashed parts of central and southern China this week, with floods damaging crops, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes and killing dozens. Provinces that have been affected include Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan and Guizhou, Reuters reported.

Hunan, in particular, has been the hardest hit by the flooding after the annual rainy season arrived in the second half of June.

In Hunan, heavy rain since June 22 has killed 27 people, with eight still missing.

The floods have swamped houses, uprooted trees, damaged cars and submerged roads.

Over 300,000 people have been evacuated across Hunan, which has lost 295,000ha of crops and seen more than 6,000 homes destroyed.

900,000 affected in three districts

DHAKA • Devastating flooding in parts of Bangladesh has affected some 900,000 people and displaced thousands of families, the country's Disaster Management and Relief Ministry Secretary Shah Kamal told Xinhua.

According to the senior government official, the authorities have already rushed disaster response teams to carry out rescue work, distribute relief materials and supervise centres where nearly 2,000 families have taken shelter.

""Some 900,000 people are affected due to floods in three districts,"" Mr Kamal said on Wednesday. He said the affected districts were Sylhet and Moulvibazar in north-eastern Bangladesh and Cox's Bazar in the south-east.

The plight of millions of people in Bangladesh, criss-crossed by more than 230 rivers, mounts every year as the low-lying country experiences seasonal floods almost annually.

The floods triggered by heavy seasonal rains and an onrush of water from hills across the Indian borders have caused widespread damage to homes, crops, roads and highways across vast areas of the country.

The authorities have evacuated residents of hundreds of villages to higher ground in the districts that are prone to torrential rains between June and September.

Although many people have been affected, officials said on Wednesday that there were no disaster-related deaths from injuries or illness so far.

GUWAHATI (India) • The death toll from worsening monsoon floods in India's Assam state has hit 18 with hundreds of thousands in makeshift camps and no let-up in the deluge, officials said yesterday.

""Monsoons are still ongoing. There are fresh developments every hour,"" Mr Rajib Prakash Barua, a senior Assam State Disaster Management Authority official, told AFP as he confirmed the latest death on Wednesday.

The monsoons started in the north-eastern state in April, said Mr Barua, speaking from the state's main city, Guwahati. ""One person died yesterday, taking the overall death toll in the last week to five. Most people died either because of flooding or electrocution.""

Officials say about 395,000 people have so far been affected in 863 villages across Assam's 15 districts.

Many people have moved to makeshift camps set up by the authorities on higher ground.

Jorhat and Sonitpur, around 300km and 190km from Guwahati, are among the worst-affected districts in the state. More storms are predicted tomorrow and in the coming days.

11,11,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Flood Warnings for Beijing as Worst Storm in 6 Years to Arrive Thursday (June 22) - The Beijinger,https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2017/06/21/worst-storm-six-years-arrive-thursday,"Municipal authorities are warning residents to be wary of flooding as a severe convection thunderstorm is expected to strike Beijing on Thursday.

A severe thunderstorm forecast for Thursday will last all day long. Rainfall accumulation is forecast to hit up to 80 millimeters in the city with as much as 50 millimeters expected to fall in one hour alone during peak precipitation. Besides lightning, the storm will bring sporadic strong winds and hail.

Described as being long in duration and wide in area, the ""worst storm in six years"" is expected to break local weather records.

The rain warning for the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei areas will begin this evening with scattered showers and finally subside by Saturday when heavy rains will taper off, continuing in scattered light showers right up until Sunday.

The local weather department is warning residents to be on alert for flash floods, landslides, mudslides, and small river floods. Along the same lines, people are specifically warned to stay away from the city's mountainous areas, which have already experienced flood conditions this past week.

Severe weather has struck Beijing before with fatal results. Seventy-seven people died in flash floods when heavy rains hit the city on July 21, 2012.

READ: One Year Later: Safety Tips for Flash Floods

We urge everyone to stay safe, and follow these handy tips:

Avoid large puddles or other flooded areas. This seems like common sense, but too many people have attempted to cross areas of water on foot, bicycle, or car, only to discover the water was deeper than expected.

Do not hesitate to leave a vehicle if in doubt.

If water levels prevent the opening of a vehicle door, open the window and try to escape through it. If water levels are above the windows, the glass may need to be broken using the headrest to allow the car to flood – equalizing the water pressure inside and outside will likely assist escape.

Thursday's thunderstorm is caused by a low pressure area colliding with a humid jet stream, causing rising air to release moisture and form storm clouds. Due to its updrafts and downdrafts, convection thunderstorms pose a danger to air traffic, signifying that delays will be likely at Beijing Capital International Airport.

On the bright side of things, the storm will bring cooler temperatures to heat-stricken Beijing where nighttime lows will reach 19 degrees Celsius.

Ecological changes in one of China’s largest freshwater lakes that were caused by the Three Gorges Dam project have led to a significant decrease the rate of schistosomiasis infections in the area around the lake, researchers said.

According to a study published today in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, the decrease in cases of schistosomiasis coincides with dwindling populations of snails in Dongting Lake, a 1,600-square-mile body of water in Hunan province that lies on the Yangtze River downstream from the huge hydroelectric dam.

The lake is home to 48% of the snails in China, including the Oncomelania hupensis snails that host Schistosoma japonicum parasites, according to the researchers. The snails live in the lake’s vast marshlands, but their populations have plummeted since Three Gorges Dam — the world’s largest power plant — began impounding water and discharging sediment in 2003, the researchers said.

In turn, between 2003 and 2015, the area saw a reduction in schistosomiasis of 86.98%, according to the researchers.

They said the decrease might be due in part to schistosomiasis control efforts undertaken by the Chinese government — including extensive use of molluscicides, routine praziquantel treatment and health education programs — but that ecological changes disturb the distribution of snails and also affect the prevalence of schistosomiasis.

“Large-scale hydro-projects not only affect the natural environment, but may also alter regional climate, and further lead to changes in the epidemic distribution of some infectious and endemic diseases,” they wrote. “Previous cases have shown that emergence or re-emergence of schistosomiasis [was] often caused by newly built hydro-projects in endemic areas, such as Aswan Dam in Egypt, Tigay Dam in Ethiopia, Gezira-Managil Dam in Sudan, Manantali Dam in Mali and Danling Dam in China. Hence, the potential influence of [Three Gorges Dam] on the transmission of schistosomiasis in downstream Yangtze River basin aroused heated discussion worldwide.”

Impact second only to malaria

According to the CDC, more than 200 million people are infected worldwide every year by the parasites that cause schistosomiasis — an impact that the agency says is second only to malaria in terms of parasitic diseases.

Schistosoma parasites live in snails and can penetrate the skin of people in contaminated freshwater where the infected snails live, according to the agency. The parasites mature into adult worms and mate in human blood vessels, with females producing eggs that may travel to the bladder or intestine, where they pass into the urine or stool.

PAGE BREAK

Infected humans can contaminate fresh water with their urine or stool, leaving behind eggs that hatch parasites which can then infect snails, the CDC says. Symptoms of infection may take days to develop and are produced by the eggs, not the worms. Early on, they may include a rash or itchy skin; after 1 to 2 months, symptoms may include fever, chills, cough and muscle aches.

According to the CDC, children who are infected can develop anemia, malnutrition and learning difficulties. Years of infection may cause damage to the liver, intestine, lungs and bladder. In rare cases, eggs in the brain or spinal cord can cause seizures, paralysis or spinal cord inflammation.

Study results

For their study, the researchers monitored 12 marshland sites in the Dongting Lake area where snails are distributed. They used hydrological information to analyze the impact of Three Gorges Dam on the Dongting Lake area and collected data related to volumes of runoff and sediments, water level and topsoil moisture level of the lake.

They also collected data on the number of living snails and infected snails each April and May, and used an annual report by the Hunan Institute of Schistosomiasis Control to retrieve data on human infections in patients between ages 6 and 65 years in 41 counties in Hunan province.

According to their results, after construction of the dam in 2003, the volume of annual runoff that drained into Dongting Lake from the Yangtze River declined by 20.85%. The researchers also observed large decreases in the annual sediment volume discharged into the lake and the mean lake sedimentation rate.

As a result, between 2003 and 2015, the mean density of living snails decreased by 94.35% and human rates of schistosomiasis infection in one of the most significant endemic regions in China decreased from 3.38% to 0.44%, the researchers said.

Among their interpretations, they said the dam has affected the variation between the highest and lowest water levels of the river and lake, making the microenvironment of the snails unsuitable and having an effect on human infections.

“Given that the impact of [Three Gorges Dam] on snail distribution and schistosomiasis prevalence in Dongting Lake area is much more complex, prolonged and in-depth studies are needed to address these issues for the effective control of snails in Dongting Lake area and eventually achieving the elimination of schistosomiasis,” the researchers concluded. – by Gerard Gallagher

15,15,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Massive landslide buries more than 120 people in southwest China - CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-landslide-xinmo-sichuan-province-people-feared-dead/,"BEIJING -- More than 120 were buried by a landslide that caused huge rocks and a mass of earth to come crashing into homes in a mountain village in southwestern China early Saturday, officials said.

The Xinhua News Agency reports 15 people have been found dead as workers retrieved the bodies from the debris on Saturday. The news agency says no new signs of life have been found. About 1,000 workers with life-detection instruments are searching for survivors.

The landslide, which came from a mountain, engulfed a cluster of 62 homes and a hotel in the village of Xinmo in Mao County at about 6 a.m., the Sichuan provincial government said. Officials said 1.6 kilometers, about 1 mile, of road were buried in the disaster.

""It's the biggest landslide to hit this area since the Wenchuan earthquake,"" Wang Yongbo, an official leading one of the rescue efforts, told state broadcaster China Central Television. Wang was referring to China's deadliest earthquake this century, a magnitude 7.9 temblor that struck Sichuan province in May 2008, killing nearly 90,000 people.

The provincial government said more than 120 people were buried by the landslide. Rescuers pulled out three people, two of whom had survived, the official Sichuan Daily newspaper said on its microblog. The paper also said a family of three, including a month-old baby, managed to escape just as the landslide started to hit their house.

Qiao Dashuai told CCTV that the baby saved the family because he was woken up by the child's crying and was going to change the baby's diaper when he heard a noise that alerted him to the landslide.

""We heard a strange noise at the back of our house, and it was rather loud,"" Qiao said. ""Wind was coming into the room so I wanted to close the door. When we came out, water flow swept us away instantly."" He said they struggled against the flood of water until they met medical workers who took them to a hospital. Qiao said his parents and other relatives had not been found.

Mao County, or Maoxian, sits on the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau and is home to about 110,000 people, according to the government's website. Most residents are of the Qiang ethnic minority. The village is known locally for tourism, and Chinese reports said it was unclear if tourists were among those buried by the landslide.

The landslide blocked a 2-kilometer, about 1.2-mile, section of a river. The provincial government said on its website that an estimated 8 million cubic meters, nearly 282 million cubic feet, of earth and rock -- equivalent to more than 3,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools -- had slid down the mountain.

Experts told CCTV that the landslide was likely triggered by rain. A meteorologist interviewed by CCTV said there was light rain in the area that would continue for a few days.

The Sichuan Daily said rescuers made contact with a villager buried under the rubble who answered her cellphone when they called and burst into tears. The woman was in the bedroom of her home when the landslide hit the village, and rescuers were trying to reach her, the report said.

CCTV showed footage of rescuers in bright orange uniforms using earth movers and excavators but also relying on ropes to pull at huge rocks and shovels to dig up the dirt.

But make no mistake: the bad weather is coming.

A 2pm local weather report called for thundershowers tonight in Beijing's north and west regions accompanied by category 2-3 winds with gusts up to category 6. Cumulative rainfall is forecast at 40-50 millimeters, while local rainfall is expected to be between 100-140 millimeters.

Yesterday's yellow alert for rain is still in effect in Beijing, though the yellow alert for hail was called off last night.

After a day of waiting, severe weather has already impacted parts of Beijing. A downpour and strong wind have descended upon Haidian District, while hail has fallen on Fengtai District. This winds were so strong at a Beijing suburban hotel that a video shows a glass door being ripped off its hinges.

The storm has led to the cancellation of 366 flights at Beijing International Airport by 2pm as well as the closure of 89 tourist sites.

As a precaution, 7,000 Beijing residents have already been evacuated from high-risk areas while Category III emergency flood response measures have already been deployed.

Judging by the severe weather in neighboring cities, Beijing is in for a rough time when the storm fully arrives this evening.

Heavy rains have hit the south and center of Hebei, the south of Shanxi, the north of Hebei, and the west and north of Shandong, each receiving precipitation between 50 and 91 millimeters as well as category 8-9 winds and hail.

The severe weather has caused flooding in the Yellow River and Huai River regions, affecting 45,000 people.

The rain has flooded streets in Shijiazhuang, Hebei while hail fall and uprooted trees have been reported in Shanxi (shown above) and Baoding, Hebei (shown below) where cars were seen stranded in a flooded underpass.

Just recently, Tianjin issued a blue alert for flooding.

Last week (June 25-26), Hong Kong hosted the Third China-Israel Investment Summit, attracting more than 120 Israeli innovation start-ups and 300 investors from Hong Kong and the mainland.

“China and Israel are a great match of strategic partners, to provide ultimate and long-term benefits under the great economy of China and top technological innovations in R&D companies,” Zvi Heifetz, Israel’s ambassador to China, told the gathering.

It was the latest episode in a remarkable love affair that has made China the biggest foreign investor in Israel, surpassing the United States. In 2016, this investment reached a record US$16.5 billion, most of it to buy internet, cyber-security and medical device start-ups.

On June 15, Technion Institute of Technology, the MIT of Israel that is based in Haifa, announced a US$200-million venture capital fund to invest in science and technology companies. It will be jointly managed by Technion Research & Development Foundation and Hong Kong-based UG Capital Management, with offices in Israel and Hong Kong.

The pioneer of this Chinese investment is Li Ka-shing. In 1999, Hutchison Telecom won Israel’s third mobile network operating license, together with two Israeli firms. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa set up a water treatment company in Israel, specializing in desalination, water treatment, wastewater treatment and other water technologies.

Over the last five years, Horizon Ventures, Li’s venture capital arm, has put money into many of Israel’s most innovative companies, a total of more than 24 investments.

One of the most successful was Waze, a GPS-based map software company founded in 2006 by three Israelis. Its traffic and navigation app works on smartphones and tablets and provides real-time information and travel times and route details submitted by users.

In October 2011, Horizon Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers invested US$30 million in Waze. In June 2013, Google paid US$1.3 billion to acquire it; with an 11 per cent stake, Horizon Ventures earned an estimated US$143 million, a spectacular return in less than two years.

That year Li donated most of his profits, US$130 million, to Technion, the largest gift it had ever received. In exchange, the institution is setting up the Technion Guangdong Institute of Technology, a joint venture with Shantou University in Li’s native place, founded in 1981 with a HK$6 billion donation from the Hong Kong billionaire.

Li wants to give Chinese students the opportunity to learn cutting-edge technology in the sectors that will drive the economy of the future.

It will open its doors this autumn, with 2,960 students for the first 10 years, in chemical engineering, biotechnology and food engineering and materials engineering.

In his address at the ground-breaking ceremony in December 2012, Professor Peretz Lavie, Technion's president, said: “The outcomes of this historic project will affect the whole of humanity.”

During his visit to the campus on June 26 for the annual graduation ceremony, Li and his son Richard toured the site of the new Technion institution to see how the building work is progressing.

Seeing Li’s success, mainland firms followed his example, including Lenovo, Fosun, Xiaomi, Baidu and Alibaba. Huawei and Haier have also established R&D centers there.

At the last China-Israel summit in Tel Aviv in September 2016, Chinese IT firm Neusoft and Infinity Group, a Sino-Israeli private equity fund, set up a US$250 million investment fund and platform for Israeli med-tech companies operating in China.

Amir Gal-Or, founder of the Infinity Fund, said: “Neusoft is considered China’s biggest IT corporation, with a 50 percent share of the health market in China specializing in developing software for the industrial sector.”

At the summit last week, speakers emphasized the important role for Hong Kong in Sino-Israeli relations. “China is moving from low-value material-intensive manufacturing to high-tech research and development,” said Wong Pik Kuen, CEO of HSBC’s China business. “China’s capital and Israel’s technological research ability can complement each other. Hong Kong can play the role of intermediary.

“Last year China’s investment in Israel was 10 times more than in 2015. The PRD [Pearl River Delta] is increasingly like Silicon Valley. A large portion of Shenzhen’s listed firms are in high-tech and their R&D spending is 4 percent of GDP, twice the national average.

“On the southern tip of the PRD, Hong Kong can serve as an intermediary between the mainland and Israel. With the opening of the high-speed train to Guangzhou and the bridge of Zhuhai, the traveling time with the mainland will be reduced. Hong Kong is an international finance center and the second largest private placement capital center in Asia,” she said.

The thunderstorm hit Beijing at around 6am this morning, causing flooding on some city streets. Residents are seen wading through above ankle-high water, but no major incidents have been reported.

According to the local weather authority, the Greater Beijing Area received an average of 65 millimeters of precipitation between noon on June 21 and 8am this morning, a two-day total that already exceeds the city's total precipitation for a six-month period.

But it's not over yet. A yellow alert for rain and a blue alert for lightning are still in effect for Beijing.

The current weather forecast says we will receive light to medium showers accompanied by lightning this afternoon along with a chance of hail. This evening will bring precipitation of 5-20 millimeters with some areas receiving thundershowers with heavier rain along with isolated cases of high winds and hail.

But even with more to come, experts are already forecasting that this year's precipitation will not surpass the storm of 2012 in which 77 Beijing residents died. With the storm failing to meet expectations after a protracted delay, some Chinese netizens have taken their anger out on the country's weather forecasters for their mistake.

The National Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration (NMCCMA) addressed the inaccuracy by comparing itself to an international peer.

""The NMCCMA has a forecast accuracy of 86.31 percent to predict whether it is going to rain or not, but the forecast accuracy for a rainstorm in the next few hours is only 21.8 percent. Though that number may sound ridiculously low, even in the USA, a country with advanced technologies, the number is only 27 percent,"" wrote the government agency on its Weibo account.

The NMCCMA called on the public to keep faith in authorities, reported the People's Daily.

Part of the public disappointment has to do with the prevalence of rumor-mongering on social media networks in advance of the storm. Although the NMCCMA attempted to debunk the rumors themselves, the Beijing Cyberspace Administration of China said it will crack down on the propagation of unauthorized weather forecasts.

Under Chinese law, neither private organizations nor individuals are allowed to issue meteorological forecasts.

22,22,FL-2017-000075-CHN,"Steam review bombing is working, and Chinese players are a powerful new voice - PC Gamer",https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-review-bombing-is-working-and-chinese-players-are-a-powerful-new-voice/,"In early April, just a month and a half after it released on consoles and two weeks after it launched on Steam, action-RPG Nier: Automata passed a million sales. Despite a few performance issues on PC, Nier launched to acclaim and racked up thousands of positive reviews. It was the surprise hit of the year until PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and a wonderful success for quirky director Yoko Taro (whose previous few games combined likely sold less than Automata did in a month). And then, on April 28, this happened:

Nier: Automata's Steam reviews over time, via SteamSpy.

1,113 negative reviews slammed Nier's Steam page in a single day, essentially doubling the total number of negative reviews overnight. That's not enough to sink a game like Nier, but it is enough to drop its ‘recent reviews’ from positive to ‘mixed’ in early May. What happened? Why the sudden rush of negativity? On April 27, Square Enix released Nier: Automata in Asia—without Chinese language support. And hours after release, they doubled the price in China. It turns out that's a really, really good way to piss off thousands of players.

Review bombing isn't a new on Steam; we first saw the power of a flood of negative reviews back in 2015, when Valve briefly tried to roll out paid mods for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. But the reaction to Nier: Automata is indicative of changes in the power structure of the Steam community.

By users, China is now Steam's third largest country, with around 17 million, behind only the United States and Russia. But by bandwidth consumed, China is actually in second place, swallowing up nearly 10 percent of Steam's total traffic (the US accounts for 19.7 percent, Russia only 5.8 percent). It's a huge audience, and it's growing quickly. This presents PC developers a huge opportunity to sell games to millions of players they couldn't reach just a few years ago. But that opportunity comes with new risks, too.

Tried-and-true review bombing

Even without tapping into a whole new audience in China, developers in 2017 have to keep in mind the possibility that their game could be review bombed for any number of reasons. Maybe a political or social issue will draw an angry mob; maybe gamers will voice complaints about a glaring performance issue or a price they consider unfair.

We've seen two high profile cases of this in just the last month. Take a look at the recent reviews for Grand Theft Auto 5 and Crusader Kings 2.

Grand Theft Auto 5's Steam reviews over time, via SteamSpy.

Crusader Kings 2 Steam reviews over time, via SteamSpy.

If you've been following the news, you'll recall GTA5 publisher Take-Two decided to shut down popular mod tool OpenIV, racking up about 35,000 negative reviews in a few days. Crusader Kings 2 accrued just a few hundred negative reviews over Paradox's decision to raise the prices of its games in some regions. In both cases, Rockstar and Paradox backpedaled after an overwhelmingly negative response.

Did those negative reviews actually affect sales of either game? Hard to say for sure, but probably not—both have already sold loads of copies. ""On the per-game basis, it seems that review bombing doesn't hurt short-term sales much,"" writes Sergey Galyonkin, creator of SteamSpy. ""Payday 2 sold more in the month after the [2015 microtransaction] controversy than in the month before, but they had a pretty big discount :) And Ark sold twice as more in the month after the review bombing [over its expansion] than in the month before despite having a smaller discount during that period and no F2P event. Of course, this kind of reaction is usually because of the diminished players' trust in the game, but it's something that is hard to measure.""

This kind of reaction is usually because of the diminished players' trust in the game, but it's something that is hard to measure. SteamSpy's Sergey Galyonkin

As Galyonkin says, damage to community goodwill is likely the bigger concern. And directly commenting on the actions of an angry fanbase is a touchy subject; unsurprisingly, the developers and publishers I reached out to for comment who have experienced Steam review bombing either declined to talk or did not respond.

For many gamers, leaving a negative Steam review is the only actionable way to make their voices heard. It's more direct, and likely more effective, than tweeting or posting on a message board. The system may be abusable, but in some cases it's working as intended: players are simply commenting on a game and giving prospective buyers valuable information. And Valve has taken steps to limit some potential issues with the system by removing reviews tied to free copies from a game's overall score.

Another change to Steam has also had a large positive impact: refunds. ""Refunds are so great,"" says Lars Doucet, the developer of tower defense game Defender's Quest. ""Now that they have refunds, if someone hates my game, they're going to ask for a refund, and usually the grumpiness that they would have directed at a review gets shouted into the refund system instead. Now I don't have an angry player, and the angry player gets their money back and isn't angry any more and probably doesn't feel like they have to post a nasty review (some will still do it, but not most). I have a separate channel for reading messages from people who wanted refunds, which is now where most of the really nasty comments go. That's fine. They can stay there. This system doesn't solve everything but it was a major plus for both developers and players in my eyes.""

Defender's Quest continues to sell well on Steam after five years.

Doucet frequently blogs about Steam on a variety of topics, offering up some great data analysis and savvy commentary on Steam's Discovery system, reviews, the Controller, and more. Though Defender's Quest has a 97 percent positive rating on Steam, I thought Doucet would have some insight into review bombing, generally. He pointed out one issue he's written about before, with suggested improvements to how Valve sorts games based on user ratings. If Valve did improve its sorting, that could, potentially, change the visibility of some games on Steam with fewer reviews but higher positive percentages. And that could, in turn, make review bombing a more powerful tool.

If you're a small developer and you catch that storm you're fielding that red hot fire with your own face, and these mobs can get really nasty. Lars Doucet

I also asked if he thought review bombing was a result of the review system working as intended, or if there's a better way for players to make their voices heard.

""Obviously as a developer the idea of being flooded with a torrent of hate over something players didn't like makes me super scared, especially when it's not something 'merely' personal like your twitter feed, it's my store page which has a direct connection to my livelihood,"" he says. ""However, it's hard for me to feel too sorry for a big AAA company that does something obviously tone deaf and anti-consumer and pays a public price for it. At the same time, if you're a small developer and you catch that storm you're fielding that red hot fire with your own face, and these mobs can get really nasty. The one limiting factor here is, unlike in a Twitter mob, the only person who has a right to leave a review is someone who's paid for your game [on Steam].""

Doucet said that there's a trade-off with that new requirement, since developers who work to build an audience outside of Steam, through a Kickstarter, for example, lose out on the value of those positive reviews. ""On balance, I will make the trade—I prefer being slightly less vulnerable to random hate mobs who just happen to have bundle keys for my game over boosting my user reviews with crowdfunding keys. Others feel differently, of course. I think if they smoothed out the hard thresholds using the Wilson score method [mentioned in his article on reviews], this tension wouldn't be as sharp.""

Doucet has also written about the huge opportunities for indie developers in the Chinese market, which brings us back to the original topic. On top of these concerns, which have been building on Steam over the past few years, developers now have to consider the dangers of releasing a game in China without localization.

Football Manager 2017 had its Steam reviews hammered by Chinese players.

China is now too big to ignore

In October 2016, Chinese players filed hundreds of negative reviews against Football Manager 2017 protesting the lack of a Chinese localization. Some of the anger stemmed from comments made by the studio's director five years earlier, saying more sales in China would justify a localization. More anger came from the developer's decision to make community translations part of the game's Steam Workshop (it officially supported 16 languages at launch).

Publisher Sega stepped in after the outcry and announced a Chinese translation, which was released in April. On SteamSpy's review chart, you can see the jump in positive reviews and a decrease in negative reviews as some players reversed their earlier thumb down.

Football Manager 2017's negative Steam reviews following a Chinese outcry.

Still, many of the negative reviews remained; Football Manager 2017 still has a 44 percent positive overall rating on Steam. And the negative reviews didn't just affect FM2017; on the same days it was review bombed, so was Football Manager 2016.

Several Square Enix games suffered collateral damage after Nier: Automata's pricing debacle. Chinese players also review bombed Rise of the Tomb Raider on April 28, giving it negative reviews to punish Square Enix for Automata's price change in Chinese currency. It was the only significant spike in negative reviews after Rise of the Tomb Raider's first week of release.

Some fans gave Square Enix's other games negative reviews after Nier's price change in China.

Even more recently, Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook launched the Crimson Court expansion and saw a smaller wave of criticism from a Chinese playerbase tired of waiting for a localization that had been talked about as far back as 2015 and still not materialized. (Darkest Dungeon has had a community-driven Chinese localization in progress for months, but it's not yet finished).

As always, it's hard to draw any real correlation between these negative reviews and a tangible impact on sales. It's a lesson all developers will soon have to take note of: If Chinese players are promised a localization, they expect it, and Steam reviews are how they’ll let you know.

With localization, Steam's rise in China could also be a new lifeline for smaller developers.

But with localization, Steam's rise in China could also be a new lifeline for smaller developers struggling to make a profit amid the dozens of games hitting Steam each day. Getting the pricing right for the region and properly localizing a game can be a huge windfall. As Doucet wrote about releasing games in China earlier this year:

""I have never had a localization pay for itself this quickly, not to mention this unambiguously… Of all the revenue Defender's Quest has earned from China on Steam in its entire lifetime, 45% of it was earned last week. That's right, we basically doubled our lifetime sales from China almost immediately!""

Of course, it's not quite that simple—there's no guarantee every game will be a smash hit in China, and there's not even a guarantee that Steam will even remain available in China. Games are routinely banned in China, but so far Steam has escaped government regulation, possibly due to Dota 2's popularity. Megacorporation Tencent is re-launching a Steam competitor in China in July, which could massively upset the PC market there. The only real constant here is how fast things are changing.

But as long as Steam exists in China, expect the Chinese audience's influence to grow. 17 million players and counting are hard to ignore.

Much of the Netherlands is below sea level, with water always nearby. (Photo: Skitter Photo, StockSnap.io CC)

Much of the Netherlands is below sea level, and it has had to deal with a major flood every generation for a thousand years or more. Now, the Dutch are leading the way in water management engineering in a warming world of increased rainfall and sea level rise. Chris Zevenbergen, Professor of Flood Resilience of Urban Systems in Delft, Holland, talks with host Steve Curwood about how the Dutch are adapting to the reality of floods, storm surges and torrential rains and the lessons other vulnerable nations can learn.

Transcript

CURWOOD: As the planet continues to get warmer with more energetic rain cycles, floods and sea level rise, water management and urban resilience are related and growing concerns. Over the centuries, the Dutch have become famous for their system of dikes and serious approach to flooding, as only 50 percent of the Netherlands is more than a few feet above sea level. But even the Dutch were caught short by some crippling floods in the 1990s, and they quickly implemented vast flood prevention projects. And now they are training engineers around the world in how to adapt to the global warming risks of floods, torrential rains and storm surges.

Chris Zevenbergen is a Professor of Flood Resilience of Urban Systems at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education in the Netherlands. He joined us on the line from Nanjing in China, where he is consulting.

ZEVENBERGEN: We have three types of threats. We have the storms from the sea and the storm surges, then we have the flood waves coming via our rivers, and then we have the floods caused by heavy rainfall.

CURWOOD: So, what do you do now to prepare for flooding? What's the approach?

ZEVENBERGEN: We, at the moment, we are in a transition. We had a strong belief that we could predict and control nature, and we're moving now into a period where we acknowledge that we cannot control nature. We have to deal with uncertainties in terms of climate change and socioeconomic development.





CURWOOD: Now, I understand that you have a lot of parks and public spaces which you are now using as emergency reservoirs for flood water. Please talk about how you use that for flood management and flood resiliency in responding to, well, failures.

ZEVENBERGEN: Those examples you just mentioned, they are meant to deal with storm water, cloudbursts, and we see that a lot of cities in our country, they suffer from severe rainfall, and they have real problems with too much water during those heavy, heavy cloudbursts.

CURWOOD: What is the new thinking there in the Netherlands as to how to deal with massive flooding from rivers there?

ZEVENBERGEN: Now the new thinking as we started 10 years ago with the concept of room for the rivers, and room for the river is a paradigm shift. The old paradigm is confining rivers and building and strengthening the dikes along the rivers, but we decided to explore a new approach where we give more space to the water, where we allowed the river to expand when large volumes of water are entering our country. So, the room for the river concept is a turning point in our approach. It's not fighting against water. It is living with water.

CURWOOD: Well, what the storm surges from the ocean there? I mean, much of Netherlands is right there looking out at the sea?

ZEVENBERGEN: Yes, now, for the storm surges we have our flood defense systems, but that was in the old times our solution. Now, we are acknowledging that those systems may fail and that we should be prepared for failure, and one of the new actions we are currently taking is to prepare the Dutch population on these type of events, and so we are now much more aware about the risks than, say, 10 years ago.

CURWOOD: What do you do then to prepare for failure?

ZEVENBERGEN: Yeah, that is, we call it multi-level protection and the first level is our flood protection systems, the primary dike systems. The second level is, for instance, spatial planning. A large part of our country are low laying polders and exactly in those polders we have our big cities. So, we are now really considering to really dampen that development process in those low-laying areas. But also early warning, that we are really prepared when there is a real flood, that we know what to do. So, we call it protection, prevention, and preparedness.





CURWOOD: So, what is the flood protection standard there in Netherlands? What do you aspire to?

ZEVENBERGEN: Our flood protection is now one in 10,000 years. That means that the probability of failure is one in 10,000 years, and that's the most stringent system on this planet.

CURWOOD: Well, Chris, if I heard that number, I'd say, “What's there to worry about, then? The Netherlands must be fine.”

ZEVENBERGEN: Yes, although the probability of failure are low, the consequences are huge. Two-thirds of our economy is in those low-lying areas.

CURWOOD: Talk to me about the money here. In particular, what potential is there for the private sector to engage in this in a way that, well they can make money?

ZEVENBERGEN: The World Bank has estimated that investing in one dollar in flood protection will save $7 to $10 in flood damage. Now, what we see all around world is that on one hand is there is a lot of money available, on another hand there is demand for investments in flood protection. But for some reason there is an investment gap. So, the money cannot find the projects, and the projects cannot find the money, and the reason is that the capacity on the side of the water agencies and ministries is lacking to produce fundable investment proposals, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, we see that the financing sector lacks the knowledge regarding the water systems and flood protection systems. A few weeks ago there was a big conference of the OECD talking about specifically how to engage the finance sector and the water sector.





CURWOOD: What do you see as the greatest challenge that cities face in managing water systems in the face of climate change? What keeps you up at night?

ZEVENBERGEN: [LAUGHS] I see two types of challenges. Currently, I'm in China, and there are about, say, 600 really big cities, 10 million plus. All those cities, they have serious flood problems, and the flood damages there are really affecting the economy of China, but what I see is a big challenge in China. It is not the new built-up areas. Those cities will continue to expand. They will be constructed in a, what we call, “a water-sensitive way.” But what about the existing urban fabric, the existing cities? How to transform those cities in flood resiliency? I think that is a major challenge we are facing, and that will take in my view at least one generation to get it done, and another challenge I see in the small and medium-sized cities in Africa and Asia, those cities are rapidly growing but don't have the capacity to do that in a sustainable way and take into account the threats from the rivers and storm surges and rainfall.

CURWOOD: So, our studio is in Boston, Massachusetts, about 300 kilometers north of New York City. We both have harbors. What's your advice to cities like New York City and Boston about managing water systems in the face of climate change?

ZEVENBERGEN: Yeah, my advice would be, don't wait until the next flood disaster is coming to really have a serious look at your current situation and protection system. The Netherlands, we are not responding to flood disaster, but we are anticipating a flood disaster. That means that we have time to really see what is the best strategy for our country, and that is a process where we are involving all the different stakeholders, and it's a very time-consuming process, but I think we are there now. We are about to implement our new strategy, but it took 10 years to accomplish that.

CURWOOD: Chris Zevenbergen is Professor of Flood Resilience of Urban Systems at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education in the Netherlands. Thank you so much for taking the time with us today, professor.

ZEVENBERGEN: OK, thank you very much.

24,24,FL-2017-000075-CHN,City Plan Aims for Flood-free Growth in Argentina's Santa Fe - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/americas/city-plan-aims-flood-free-growth-argentinas-santa-fe,"Bolstering flood defenses and moving families away from risky areas are high on the agenda for Argentina's Santa Fe as the river port city looks to grow its economy and improve its infrastructure under a new urban plan.

The inland city of around 400,000 in Argentina's Pampas region also aims to cut violent crime, boost social inclusion and kick-start projects including a new airport, as it tries to create jobs and become better connected, said Santa Fe's chief resilience officer, Andrea Valsagna.

Like many Latin American cities, as Santa Fe has expanded, new residents have settled in low-lying areas, she noted.

""The challenge is to organize the growth of the city in a way that reduces the risk of floods,"" said Valsagna by telephone from Santa Fe in northeast Argentina.

The new resilience strategy will help position the city to ""deal with the problems climate change is generating in the region,"" she said, adding that heavy rains and flooding are likely to increase.

Santa Fe, Argentina

Santa Fe lies near the junction of two major waterways — the Parana and Salado rivers — and suffered serious floods in 2003 and 2007, which forced mass evacuations.

The city now has early warning systems in place, and relies on costly infrastructure made up of 40 miles (64 km) of defenses and pumps that help minimize flood risk from the rivers.

The new strategy — released under the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, a global network of cities working to tackle modern-day shocks and stresses — said Santa Fe had taken steps to reduce its vulnerability, but work was needed to bolster flood defenses, drainage systems and other critical infrastructure.

Santa Fe is one of Argentina's oldest cities, with over 70 percent of its territory made up of rivers, lakes and marshes.

An effort to relocate nearly 4,000 people living in 1,500 homes situated in flood-prone areas and curb informal settlement must consider how to integrate communities, and provide education and job opportunities, said Valsagna.

""The problem of families in low-lying or informal settlements is multi-dimensional, and you can't just think about the housing problem,"" she said of the city which suffers from a shortage of accommodation.

""It's very difficult to generate alternatives for many of these families — they have a history in these places ... they have their links with work, schools, health,"" she said.

Crime and waste

Major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed new airport for the regional capital and relocation of its river port, would broaden opportunities for economic growth and jobs, besides improving transport links, said Valsagna.

FILE - Only the tops of houses emerge from the water in the city of Santa Fe, Argentina, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Buenos Aires, May 1, 2003.

Santa Fe is expected to funnel 10 percent of its municipal budget into ways of making the city more resilient. City authorities are also talking to regional development banks, the private sector and the national government about funding the port and the airport, she said.

Reducing crime is another big challenge for Santa Fe, where homicides reached 22 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014. Young men from poor, underserved neighborhoods are most at risk, while police corruption and a weak justice system compound the issue.

Valsagna said a new observatory would analyze crime in the city, which is seeking ways to bring more jobs and services to inhabitants of its poorest areas.

Other goals are to improve drainage and waste services in the city where more than 600 families, including children, make a living out of informal rubbish collection and are exposed to health risks and poor sanitation, said the report.

Santa Fe wants to halve their number within the next five years by offering alternative sources of income.

Santa Fe Mayor Jose Manuel Corral noted in the report that cities around the world are facing complex challenges.

""We believe that a resilience approach will allow us to tackle this complexity, putting the focus on the capacity of communities to face crises, prepare themselves for acute impacts but also to deal with and overcome chronic stresses,"" he wrote.","Wed, 05 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/321A2C91-1130-4128-8BB6-5D4AB1896BE3.jpg,"['cities', 'miles', 'floodfree', 'growth', 'resilience', 'port', 'santa', 'fe', 'city', 'plan', 'argentinas', 'aims', 'jobs', 'risk', 'families']",

26,26,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Bangkok struggles to protect slum dwellers as floods worsen - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-floods-bangkok-idUSKBN19A0KL,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In Phrom Samrit, a squatter settlement along a major canal in Bangkok, most of the 300 households live cheek by jowl and have become used to floods after living next to water all their lives. But now their resilience is being chipped away, says Adirak Sangnut, the slum’s elected leader.

“Before, it started flooding after raining for three days. But now, it floods after just three hours of rain,” the 47-year-old said. “After a while, if nothing is done, it’ll be less than an hour before it starts flooding.”

As Thailand’s rainy season gets underway, residents in and around Bangkok say they are experiencing more intense and frequent seasonal floods since 2011, when the capital was hit by its worst flooding in half a century.

That flood disaster - caused by factors including an unusually heavy monsoon, building on flood plains and changes in water management - affected millions of people and caused $45.7 billion in losses.

Experts do not expect floods of that magnitude again any time soon but say the city’s low-lying location, continued urbanization and extreme weather linked to climate change are raising Bangkok’s vulnerability to floods.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is planning 28 flood protection projects worth nearly 26 billion baht ($765.6 million).

They include dredging and expanding canals, and constructing flood barriers and water retention areas to drain and divert floodwater to Thailand’s main conduit, the Chao Phraya River.

The budget for four projects to build embankments along canals has already been approved, and an extra 2 billion baht from the military government is being used to carve out giant underground tunnels, said Vallop Suwandee, chairman of an advisory group to the Bangkok governor.

The city also issued a resilience strategy earlier this year that includes improved weather forecasts and drainage systems.

Yet not everyone approves of the BMA’s plans. Adirak says nearly half of his neighbours, who live near Don Muang airport, disagree with the canal works, fearing they will lose their homes.

Experts have criticized the plans for focusing too much on hard infrastructure solutions which they say are costly and will never be adequate.

Barriers such as flood walls could trap rainwater, worsening flash floods, and create a two-tier system where some areas are protected at the expense of others, usually the urban poor and those in neighboring provinces, they add.

But Vallop said climate change makes it imperative for Bangkok to prepare.

“It’s necessary for Bangkok and Thailand to invest in infrastructure. If we do not do it now, the damage may cost a lot more in the future,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The city government has warned investors and home-owners whose properties are on major floodways - spillover channels for floodwater - but they have built there anyway, he added.

Deputy government spokesman Lieutenant-General Werachon Sukhondhapatipak said Bangkok lacks effective infrastructure to handle large-scale flooding.

Problems include inadequate town planning, construction blocking waterways and littering of drainage systems, he said by email. “Effective flood management requires genuine cooperation from all sides,” he added.

UNEVEN EXPOSURE

In the aftermath of the 2011 floods, the government unveiled a much-criticized $11-billion flood prevention plan, which was scrapped after the military coup of May 2014.

Despite Thailand’s frequent cycle of floods and droughts, its approach to water management has always been piecemeal, said Nipon Poapongsakorn of the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).

Whenever a disaster hits, committees are set up, but they soon disappear, leaving no institutional memory. The absence of a single water agency and a national water law are other major challenges, he added.

In Siriwan Klai-iam’s neighborhood of Bang Bua Thong market in Nonthaburi, a province to the north of Bangkok, flooding has become more common since 2011. Then water reached chest height, and her home and workplace were submerged for nearly three months.

“It’s happening every monsoon,” said the 39-year-old, pointing at the road outside that was flooded again in early June. “The government helps sometimes... but mostly after the floods.”

Danny Marks, a researcher on urban climate resilience in Southeast Asia at the University of Toronto, said neighborhoods like Siriwan’s could be adversely affected by the BMA’s plans.

The main government response has been to construct more and higher flood walls and other infrastructure rather than significantly improve water management, data collection and land-use planning, said Marks, whose doctoral thesis examined the authorities’ handling of the 2011 floods.

Flood walls create uneven exposure to future flooding, he added, with urban economic areas protected while marginalized groups such as farmers, fishermen and rural communities are exposed to losses and damage.

The TDRI’s Nipon said Bangkok needs to become a “sponge city” - a concept promoted by China where infrastructure, including pavements and green roofs, is designed to absorb water.

RISING RISKS

When Bangkok became Thailand’s capital in 1782, it was a backwater village crisscrossed by canals known as the “Venice of the East”. But many were filled in to make way for cars, while squatter settlements have encroached on others.

With that, Bangkok lost much of its drainage capacity.

“It’s easier to fill canals instead of appropriating land, but now we are paying a very high price,” said Apichart Anukularmphai, president of the Thailand Water Resources Association.

Many also blame slum residents for throwing trash into the canals and blocking the waterways, calling for them to be evicted.

There are hundreds of such communities in Bangkok and they cannot all be dismantled, said Thipparat Noppaladarom, advisor to the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI), a government agency that upgrades slums.

CODI is currently working with residents along a major canal that is being expanded. They will be relocated to higher ground but still live in the same area - a “win-win” situation, said Thipparat.

The complexity of acquiring land for infrastructure projects is a familiar challenge to Thongchai Roachanakanan, an urban planning expert at the Department of Town and Country Planning and Public Works.

He designed a floodway after 2011, but almost all the governors he met rejected the plan because much of the land was owned by the rich and powerful.

Meanwhile, Bangkok is becoming more vulnerable each year, he added.

Thongchai is particularly concerned about flood walls to the east of the ancient capital Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok. Built after 2011, these walls - some as high as 6 meters (19.7 ft) - could cause problems should a major storm hit central Thailand, he said.

If that happens, the water could flow south fast, threatening Bangkok’s two international airports, he warned.

Tea farmers in Sri Lanka are struggling to make ends meet after their land was destroyed by heavy floods and mudslides last month.

The floods, described by authorities as the worst to hit the country in more than a decade, killed more than 200 people and displaced more than 600,000 people from their homes.

For many of the 400,000 small farmers who grow more than 70 percent of the country’s tea, the floods covered their tea bushes by up to five metres with mud and sludge, leading to the rotting of some roots.

K Seelawathi, a farmer in the town of Akuressa in Matara district, hopes this will be the last flood she sees in her lifetime.

“I used to harvest 400 kilograms at a time, earning a good amount,” she told Al Jazeera.

“I built my house and educated my children. But with almost no income now, things are very difficult.”

Prabhat Bezbaruah, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, says almost 300 tonnes of tea and green leaf were destroyed by the floods, while damage to factories is still being assessed.

He says the cost of the floods needs to be measured in humanitarian, and not financial, terms.

Losses that small farmers have incurred in terms of their lives and property are substantial, Bezbaruah says.

Sri Lanka’s tea industry, which earns $1.3bn a year, has also seen a decrease in supply after the floods.

Gunasoma Wanigasekara, the owner of a tea factory, says that while things are improving, it will take time for conditions to return to normal.

“There’s been a five to 10 percent drop [in tea supply],” he told Al Jazeera. “The farmers can’t attend to their work in the fields, so they can’t give 100 percent output to the tea land.”

Mudslides have become common during the monsoon season in Sri Lanka as land has been heavily deforested to grow export crops such as tea and rubber.

Last year, monsoon rains caused flooding and landslides that killed more than 100 people.","Sun, 25 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/db2c7f09eb6c40229821f6001db71970_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C561,"['supply', 'farmers', 'things', 'small', 'struggle', 'told', 'monsoon', 'lanka', 'floods', 'devastating', 'tea', 'sri']", 
28,28,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Attacks on currency have real economic consequences - Marketplace.org,https://www.marketplace.org/2017/06/29/attacks-currency-have-real-economic-consequences/,"President Trump has made a lot of hay about currency manipulators, particularly China, during and even after the presidential campaign.

The reality is that very few countries are currently manipulating their currencies. But not so long ago, they were, and they caused a lot of damage.

Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, first started to notice this in 2004.

“I was looking at the reported foreign exchange reserves of different Asian countries, particularly China,” he recalled.

These kinds of reserves are, in moderation, pretty normal. They’re just a country’s stockpile of other countries’ money. The U.S. central bank has lots of euros, the Europeans have lots of yen. You might still have pesos from your trip to Mexico.

“China started the decade of the 2000s with about 250 billion [U.S. dollars’ worth of] reserves, and it was sort of steadily heading up,” Setser said. Five hundred billion, 700 billion. “And then it went above a trillion.”

In the first decade of the 2000s, China wasn’t just hanging on to a few dollars — it was starting to hoard them, trillions of them. It would eventually peak at $4 trillion. Where were these dollars coming from? What was China up to?

“It did worry me at the time,” Setser said. “We’d never seen that kind of reserve accumulation in an economy.”

Part of it was the fact that the U.S. was starting to buy a lot of Chinese goods, so dollars were flowing there. But something else was happening.

“China was very consistently going into the market and buying U.S. dollars,” he said.

China was buying up dollars to artificially bid up the price of the dollar and make its own currency cheaper. It’s just like someone at an auction house bidding up the price of a painting. The dollar became more expensive, the yuan became cheaper, and that made Chinese exports more competitive. Now, before you go hating on China, just know that this wasn’t entirely evil.

“It’s wrong to say China sort of malevolently decided to do this in 2003 just to hurt the rest of the world,” said Joe Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of “Currency Conflict and Trade Policy.”

He said China was just trying to hold its currency stable, which it had done for many years and which many developing countries do. But as China developed and entered the world of global trade on an unprecedented scale, its currency manipulation started to have real consequences for the U.S.

“It did accelerate this flood of Chinese exports into different industries that caused a lot of job loss,” Gagnon said. He estimates that the U.S. lost more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of currency manipulation — excluding other factors, like automation and Chinese competitiveness.

He also said China invested a lot of its bought-up dollars in the U.S., indirectly fueling the housing bubble, “so it kind of made the housing bubble bigger and made the crash bigger.”

China was not alone in pushing its currency down. Japan and Korea did this as well, though not on the same scale.

Collectively, currency manipulation was notably bad for the U.S. during and after the recession, essentially kicking the U.S. economy when it was down.

“If there had not been currency manipulation during those years, we would have had a faster recovery and gained another million jobs for several years,” Gagnon said.

But the U.S. didn’t do much about it. The consequences of currency manipulation were slow to become clear, even for many economists. And politically, the U.S. didn’t and doesn’t have very strong tools at its disposal.

In 2015, Congress passed legislation requiring the Treasury to monitor currency manipulation. But penalties are limited, said the CFR’s Setser.

The law says “the U.S. government wouldn’t buy products directly from the country that is believed to be acting inappropriately in the foreign exchange market, the U.S. would not enter into new free trade agreements or it would be a factor in that decision. The U.S. wouldn’t offer insurance for U.S. companies making investments in the country that is acting inappropriately,” Setser said. “But what it doesn’t do is explicitly authorize a counter intervention.”

Counter intervention is exactly what is needed, Gagnon said.

“If countries are distorting currency values by buying lots of dollars, we’re going to buy an equal amount of your currency back,” he said.

In other words, if someone messes with U.S. currency, the U.S. messes with theirs. It’s something the U.S. has been reluctant to do for fear of starting currency wars, and historically, policymakers have been reluctant to “stoop” to a behavior they try to discourage in other countries. It would also require an act of Congress. But Gagnon said the U.S. needs something with teeth to deal with currency manipulation.

“It’s a war in which people were firing at us and we never fired back.”

About four years ago, many countries, including China, stopped manipulating their currencies. The war that Gagnon talks about has died down, for now. But he has a warning: Don’t be defenseless the next time it starts up.","Thu, 29 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GettyImages-483962184_0.jpg?w=1200,"['chinese', 'trade', 'real', 'gagnon', 'consequences', 'countries', 'dollars', 'attacks', 'lot', 'currency', 'china', 'manipulation', 'economic', 'setser']",

GUANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province has supplied Hong Kong more than 14 billion cubic meters of freshwater over the past 20 years, said the provincial water resources department.

A continuous, sufficient supply of quality water to Hong Kong was possible after Guangdong spent heavily on the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Project, said the department.

The project began operation in 1965 to solve the water shortage of Hong Kong and has been expanded several times, raising its annual supply capacity from 68 million cubic meters to 2.4 billion cubic meters.

Since 1998, the province has spent more than 5 billion yuan (738 million U.S. dollars) upgrading the project.

The 562-km Dongjiang River originates in east China's Jiangxi Province, and flows to the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong.

Guangdong has created a 2,800-sq-km protection area for the river and has closed nearly 1,400 polluting factories in six cities since 2011 to ensure water quality.","Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['spent', 'supply', 'river', 'freshwater', 'sufficient', 'cubic', 'province', 'kong', 'enjoys', 'water', 'hong', 'billion', 'guangdong', 'xinhua']",

You own a home or business in a high-risk area, sometimes known as a Special Flood Hazard Area.

You have a mortgage from a federally-regulated or insured lender.

Policies purchased in connection with making, increasing, extending or renewing a home loan.

Changes to area flood maps that could waive the waiting period.

While some people are required to have flood insurance, there are those outside the flood plains who might have questions about how to cover their homes and everything inside.You must purchase flood insurance if the following applies to you:Just one inch of water can cost more than $20,000 in repairs and replacements, and flooding is the most common natural disaster in the U.S., according to FEMA. Even if your home is not in a flood plain, you can still find yourself underwater after a heavy storm.If you have physical damage to a building or your possessions directly caused by a flood, these are generally covered by flood insurance, according to FEMA. But, you have to be able to show the damage is a direct result of flooding.If your patio furniture is carried away in the floods, tough luck. According to the National Flood Insurance Project, property outside an insured home or building is not included. So, for example, if your patio rots or has mold damage, insurance won't cover the cost to rebuild the deck.Some people have been lulled into a false sense of security because they have homeowner's insurance. Unfortunately, renters insurance and homeowners insurance doesn't usually cover flood damage, which could mean you'll have to shell out your own money for costly repairs and to replace the things you own.If you think you might just rely on Uncle Sam in case of a flood emergency, think again. FEMA said these monies won't always pay for flood damage, and you'll end up owing interest in the end that could up the cost of repairs.For these approaching storms, you're out of time. In general, flood insurance policies do not take effect until 30 days after purchase. FEMA said there are exceptions however, including:Ask your insurance provider whether you may qualify for immediate coverage.Some homeowners can purchase flood insurance for as low as $137 per year, but it depends on where you live.","Sun, 29 Mar 2020 09:43:06 GMT",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2123452_062017-ktrk-flood-insurance-stock-img.jpg?w=1600,"['insurance', 'facts', 'purchase', 'according', 'homeowners', 'cost', 'damage', 'covering', 'belongings', 'fema', 'flood', 'cover', 'youll', '101']",

Just after 1:30 p.m., firefighters in Gwinnett County, northwest of Atlanta, were dispatched to a parking lot and two businesses located at the bottom of a hill after they became flooded with water, according to Gwinnett County Fire & Emergency Services.

Parts of the parking lot were filled with waist and chest-deep waters, officials said. First responders were able to walk about half of the people out through water that was just ankle deep.

The remaining people were moved to higher ground using a raft from the Swiftwater Rescue Team, according to officials. Between 24 and 27 were rescued, but no injuries were reported.

Gwinnett County officials encouraged residents to stay alert to weather conditions and be prepared to evacuate due to flooding.

A flash flood warning is in effect in Georgia until 10 p.m. Tuesday. Up to three inches of rain has already fallen in some parts of the state, and additional pockets of heavy rain will continue to move through the area tonight.

In nearby DeKalb County, firefighters rescued a family of four from their home, which was becoming surrounded by water.

No one was injured in the ordeal, and DeKalb County Fire Rescue broadcast the swift water rescue on Periscope.

The heavy rain in DeKalb County was enhanced by tropical moisture coming from Tropical Storm Cindy, which was coming off the Gulf of Mexico.

Citing project documents, the Inquirer report stated that the project would focus on 56 potentially critical drainage areas with an approximate land area of 11,100 hectares or over 17 percent of the total area of Metro Manila. This will include an area covered by new pumping stations of about 2,900 hectares, with a total population of about 970,000 people or about 210,000 households.”

The reason behind this proposal is more than obvious: the Philippines is “highly vulnerable to natural disasters with exceptionally high exposure to cyclones and floods.”

“The country, on average, is struck by 20 cyclones every year causing widespread flooding across the country including Metro Manila,” it added.

Poorly planned

A 2015 study by the government’s Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (NOAH) said that “humans have altered the landscape in the metropolis which has grown rapidly but with poorly planned urbanization.”

It broke down the factors that cause Metro Manila flooding, including encroachment of concrete surfaces, densification of buildings and residential areas, silting of riverbeds and canals, obstruction of waterways by informal settlers, clogging of floodways by garbage and reclamation of coastal land.

Many parts of the metro were also subsiding because water that occupies the ground below is extracted by humans faster than it is replenished by nature, Project Noah executive director Alfredo Mahar Lagmay was quoted as saying.

And when heavy rains hit Metro Manila, which sits on a flood plain for three rivers—the Marikina, Napindan and Pasig rivers—it sinks even further, such as in 2012 when nonstop rains hit the metropolis.

Devastating typhoons

Among the devastating typhoons that had hit Metro Manila include Typhoon Ondoy (international name: Ketsana )in 2009, which killed 464 people, flooded 239 barangays in the metro, with Marikina City affected the most, government data showed. Flood waters ran from knee to rooftop deep.

About 37 roads were not passable to light vehicles due to flooding at the height of the typhoon. Cost of damage to infrastructure alone stood at P4.3 billion, including school buildings and health facilities.

In 2015, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) identified 23 flood-prone areas which included major thoroughfares such as the streets of España, Buendia, Osmeña Highway, Quezon Avenue, C-5 and Edsa.

Flood control projects

This is perhaps why flood mitigating projects will always be high on the agenda of every administration.

The Duterte administration’s ambitious infrastructure projects under its “build, build, build” strategy include flood control measures for Metro Manila. Among these projects are the P7.5-billion Pasig-Marikina river channel improvement project phase three, and the P359-million Mandaluyong drainage project along Maysilo Circle.

Under the Aquino administration, 96 flood-mitigating projects under the P5-billion high-impact flood control program were completed in 2015 for three regions, including Metro Manila.

Resident Coordinator. A total of 212 deaths had been confirmed and 79 people remained missing as of early June.

The main cause for severe flooding was two rivers overflowing, particularly in the southern Galle and Kalutara. CNN reported that Ratnapura—63 miles southeast of the capital Colombo—experienced up to 453 millimeters (17.8 inches) of rain over just three days. Ratnapura was the district with the highest death count of any area, with 79 deaths. There, shops and houses remained submerged in 3 to 9 meters (10 to 30 feet) of water.

As average rainfall begins to decrease, it’s replaced by concern about landslides, mainly in Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle, Kegalle, Matara, Nuwara Eliya, and Hambanota districts. About 22,000 people remain temporarily displaced in 202 safe locations, while 2,500 houses have been destroyed and 15,890 are partially damaged, according to U.N. Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka.

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reported that the Government has released a grant of 166 million Sri Lankan rupees (nearly US$1,084,000) for the flood response. A total of 22 agencies are currently providing health, protection, education, food security, WASH, emergency shelter, Non-Food Items (NFIs), and early recovery activities in nine districts. U.N. Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has set an Emergency Response Plan for US$22.7 million, which outlines the support between U.N. agencies and NGOs.

Meanwhile, some are pointing to a lack of prevention measures prior to these events. In a speech in Galle, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said “people who oppose prevention plans are the ones who cry hoarse when the floods occur” The Wire reports.

International response has been prompt, as neighboring countries like India, Australia, Russia, China, and Bangladesh have provided assistance with the emergency and recovery operations. Rains have also hit Thailand, producing heavy rainfall and widespread flooding.

Extreme weather caused these monsoon rains to be the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003. This comes just two months after nearly 900,000 people were affected by the country’s worst drought in 40 years, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), and were undergoing serious food insecurity and malnutrition.

Although the North Korean authorities have announced that restoration is now complete, there are evidently still many rice and paddy fields left in ruin.

Daily NK recently obtained images of rice and paddy fields located in Onsong County, North Hamgyong Province. The images show farmlands (which were arable until only a year ago) left in ruins.

During the floods last year, large tracts of paddy fields were destroyed as significant volumes of sand and gravel were dumped on them. The residents have not been able to farm most of the land, as restoration efforts have been inadequate.

“One third of the paddy fields in the Tumen River region are still damaged. The farmers may starve this year because they can’t even plant seeds,” a source in North Hamgyong Province told Daily NK.

Residents could normally have grown food on their small private plots in the mountains, but even these areas are in a poor state due to the chronic lack of fertilizer.

Instead of addressing the situation, the North Korean authorities have instead been threatening the residents, stating their intentions to reclaim all private plots in order to reforest the area.

“Residents are worried that food shortages will not be resolved soon, and they have suffered through the period of spring poverty. People who were hit by the great floods are now vulnerable” said an additional source in North Hamgyong Province.

Regardless of the situation, the regime has not made efforts to address the mounting issues. At the time of the floods, it was primarily focused on pushing ahead with a fifth nuclear test which was conducted at great cost.

Additionally, the regime first chose to restore historic sites idolizing the Kim family, rather than the homes of the residents. A series of public housing projects undertaken thereafter have been widely rejected by residents for safety reasons.","Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.dailynk.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DNKF00014587_List.jpg,"['north', 'residents', 'situation', 'province', 'recovering', 'damage', 'rice', 'flood', 'floods', 'source', 'paddy', 'fields', 'hamgyong', 'photos']",

A scene from King Yu [Photo provided to China Daily]

In his latest work, King Yu, Wang tells the story of Emperor Yu, who tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and rearranging the channels, and launching the Xia Dynasty (c. 21st century-16th century BC), China's first dynasty.

The dance premiered in September at the annual Art Festival of Anhui Province, and later toured national wide at over 60 cities. It will make its debut at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing on June 21.

""Like many people of my generation, I grows up with the story of Emperor Yu, who, also known as Da Yu, is a legendary hero,"" says Wang in Beijing.

Born in Zigong, Sichuan province, the 42-year-old Wang graduated from the Beijing Dance Academy with a bachelor's degree in Chinese folk dance and a master's degree in choreography in 2000. He is an award-winning dancer-choreographer whose works have included Red Sorghum, staged in 2013, which was based on the novel Red Sorghum Clan by Nobel laureate Mo Yan.

""When I realized that young Chinese people are more fascinated by the Western superheroes than our own heroes, I felt sad. I want to make the story of Emperor Yu real and alive onstage again,"" says Wang.

About two years ago, the director started to develop the dance drama, along with Feng Shuangbai, president of the China Dancers Association, who wrote the script, and co-director Li Zhi.

Feng says the dance drama centers on the story from a Chinese tale, Da Yu Zhi Shui, or Great Yu Controls the Waters.

It opens with Da Yu's father, who failed to control the flooding and was punished by King Yao. Then Da Yu continued his father's mission and vowed to control the flood.

""We want to tell a convincing story about a real man, instead of a man from the book or legend,"" says the director Wang.

In their research, Wang found out that the location where Da Yu built the dams along the riverbank was Yuhui village, Bengbu city in Anhui province, according to evidence found by the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Science, about a decade ago.

So Wang invited over 30 dancers of Anhui province's Huagu Opera Song & Dance Theater to join in the dance drama. They brought local music and dance elements, such as Huangmei Opera, to the work.

Chinese dancers Jiang Wei, Luo Wenbo and Song Yulong respectively play the role of Da Yu, the wife and their son, Qi.

""The wife never meets her husband after he left for the great mission. She takes all the responsibilities in the family, like raising their son alone and farming the lands,"" says dancer Luo, who performs as Da Yu’s wife, Nyu Jiao. ""Unlike my last performance as a strong and brave woman leading an entire group to fight against the enemies, this wife is soft by look but tough and independent inside.""

ATLANTA, GA — Flash flood watches were turning to flash flood warnings Tuesday afternoon, as heavy, steady rains poured down throughout metro Atlanta.

The rains were coming down, in part, in areas already soaked from showers and thunderstorms from the past few days, leading the National Weather Service and other officials to issue a series of warnings. At 3:37 p.m., the weather service issued a significant weather advisory for north Fulton and southern Cobb counties. A line of strong thunderstorms was reported along a line extending from Powder Springs to West End.

The storms were nearly stationary, giving rains plenty of chance to soak into already soggy ground. The heavy rains could cause temporary street flooding, particularly in poor drainage areas, the NWS said.

Officials in Gwinnett and Fulton counties took to social media to report flooding roads. In Atlanta, the North Buckhead Civic Association sent out an email reporting that Lakemoore Drive, near Mill Creek, and Mountain Way, near Little Nancy Creek, had flooded between 3-4 p.m.

""Please protect yourselves and do not drive through flood water. Select alternate routes,"" the email read. Elsewhere, DeKalb County officials were warning motorists in the Decatur area to use caution, reporting that several roadways there were experiencing flooding as well.

About 1,500 mattresses had already been given out but Walter still didn’t have a place to sleep, and needed one. Ms. McCormick said she’d be calling on his behalf to work it out.

Alongside the mattresses, people donated clothing and money flowed in as well. A team of chaplains are still doing regular house calls to check on families’ spiritual and emotional needs. There was a program to give people new refrigerators and other appliances.

Ms. McCormick and the other volunteers made clear that there was also a fair amount of frustration. One insurer seemed to have included a clause in its contracts that allowed it to avoid paying certain claims. Some residential property owners seemed to have received more government help than others, which led to some grumbling.

59,59,FL-2017-000075-CHN,How China could use trade to force North Korea to play nice with the West - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/how-china-could-use-trade-to-force-north-korea-to-play-nice-with-the-west-80609,"North Korea got the world’s attention – and President Donald Trump’s – when it said on July 4 that it had successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. The weapon, potentially equipped with a nuclear warhead, could reach Alaska.

President Trump’s initial reaction included blaming China for letting things get this far. He tweeted that Chinese trade with North Korea “rose 40% in the first quarter,” implying that China is reluctant to punish North Korea for continuing to pursue nuclear weapons.

Is he right to call out China’s trade relationship with North Korea, which formally goes by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea?

While the poor quality of the data on trade between these countries should lead one to be skeptical of any sweeping claims, Trump’s overall sentiment is probably correct. China has increased its trade with North Korea in recent decades and has likely done very little on that front to try to forestall this trading partner’s nuclear ambitions.

Yet a quick look at the data, however murky, shows just how much leverage China has, if it wishes to use it.

North Korea’s primary patron

In general, exports from one country to another can be mostly explained by the distance between them and the sizes of their markets, a pattern that holds for China and North Korea.

Geographically, they share a large border, which makes China a natural partner for trade. North Korea also abuts South Korea, which doesn’t trade with its rival, and shares a tiny border crossing with Russia, with whom it trades a little (more on that later).

China’s large market, proximity and willingness to trade with North Korea has led to a situation in which the latter has become highly dependent on trade with its primary patron. About half of North Korean exports and imports go directly to and from China and much of the rest of its trade is handled indirectly by Chinese middlemen.

North Korea’s dependence on its northern neighbor has grown hand-in-hand with the nascent superpower’s increasing economic dominance of East Asia, which began 15 years ago when China joined the World Trade Organization. Since then, both Chinese gross domestic product as well as its annual trade with North Korea have increased nearly tenfold, to around US$11 trillion and $6 billion, respectively.

And today, China is responsible for more than 80 percent of both North Korea’s imports and exports.

North Korea imports pretty much everything from China, from rubber tires (1.8 percent of the total) to refined petroleum (4 percent) and apples and pears (1.3 percent), with no single category dominating. Meanwhile, coal makes up about 40 percent of its exports to China, followed by “non-knit men’s coats” (7.2 percent).

Time to use that leverage?

However, recent events have led to some uncertainty about the extent to which China is willing to use this economic leverage to rein in North Korea’s military ambitions. It appears that China is willing to use these close economic ties to serve its own diplomatic purposes but it’s unclear whether that includes using this economic leverage to rein in North Korea’s military ambitions.

On the one hand, China claims that coal imports from North Korea have recently been stopped as part of an effort to punish the regime for recent missile tests and the suspected assassination of Kim Jong-nam. If true, this would be an important signal of China’s willingness to support U.S. concerns about the missile program as it would represent a loss of about a third ($930 million) of North Korea’s import revenue.

However, there is evidence that coal shipments in fact never ceased. And in any case, China may have dramatically increased its imports of iron ore from North Korea to offset the lost coal revenues.

This is consistent with the idea that China carefully considers the resources and revenue that are available to the North Korean regime at any moment, and uses trade as a lever to control them. In this way, China walks a fine line between providing too many resources, and thus allowing the regime to prosper, and not enough resources, such that North Korea is in danger of collapsing. Ultimately, trade may be used as a lever to do some light scolding, but China’s overwhelming concern is preventing North Korea’s collapse.

Further evidence that China has tight control over the North Korean economy comes from a recent report from C4ADS. The research group found close, and often common, ownership ties between most of the major Chinese companies who do business with North Korea. This suggests that trade with North Korea is highly centralized and thus easily controlled.

Russia: North Korea’s other ‘friend’

Of course, China’s not the only country North Korea trades with, but the others pale in comparison. Other top export destinations, after China, include India ($97.8 million), Pakistan ($43.1 million) and Burkina Faso ($32.8 million). In terms of imports, India ($108 million), Russia ($78.3 million and Thailand ($73.8 million) also sell North Korea stuff.

Russia in particular may be beginning to complicate things for U.S. efforts to isolate the regime. While still little, Russian trade with North Korea increased 73 percent over the first two months of 2017 compared with the same period of the previous year. This may be part of a coordinated effort with China to obstruct attempts by the U.S. to pressure North Korea on its military ambitions.

But whereas China is legitimately worried that an economic crisis in North Korea could lead to a flood of refugees or all-out war, Russia likely sees engagement with North Korea in much simpler terms, namely as an additional way to gain geopolitical advantage relative to the U.S.","Thu, 06 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/177214/original/file-20170706-26461-n7vj28.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=6%2C51%2C1484%2C720&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['north', 'west', 'trade', 'million', 'regime', 'play', 'recent', 'force', 'china', 'nice', 'imports', 'koreas', 'korea', 'economic']", 
60,60,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Why the World's Rivers Are Losing Sediment and Why It Matters - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-the-worlds-rivers-are-losing-sediment-and-why-it-matters,"Vast amounts of river-borne sediment are trapped behind the world’s large dams, depriving areas downstream of material that is badly needed to build up the marshes and wetlands that act as a buffer against rising seas.

In September 2011, after 20 years of planning, workers began dismantling the Elwha and Glines dams on the Elwha River in northwestern Washington state. At the time, it was the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, and it took nearly three years for both barriers to be dismantled and for the river to once again flow freely.

Over the course of their nearly century-long lives, the two dams collected more than 24 million cubic yards of sediment behind them, enough to fill the Seattle Seahawks football stadium eight times. And since their removal, the Elwha has taken back the trapped sediment and distributed it downstream, causing the riverine ecosystem to be rebuilt and transformed. Massive quantities of silt, sand, and gravel have been carried to the coast, resurrecting a wetlands ecosystem long deprived of sediment.

“We’ve seen a big expansion of coast landforms,” says Jonathan Warrick, a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who studies the after-effects of the dam removal. “The beach is 500 feet offshore from where it used to be and there is this brand new wetland complex that has developed behind the beach.” Scientists are now beginning to fully appreciate the life-giving effects of sediment, which some researchers, as well as people who live along waterways, once viewed as a malevolent force that choked the life out of rivers, streams, and wetlands. Now, as global warming steadily melts glaciers and polar ice sheets, quickening the pace of sea level rise, scientists say that a severe shortage of river-borne sediment — most of it trapped behind dams — will increasingly be felt along the world’s coasts. “Ten or twenty years ago most wetlands scientists in most places viewed sediment as a negative,” says Richard Ambrose, a marine ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Too much sediment would come in and bury the marsh. Now people realize sediment is a resource, and we need it to keep up with sea level rise.”

Dam removal is becoming increasingly common, especially in Europe, where hundreds of dams have been removed in recent years.

Billions of cubic yards of natural river-borne sediment are trapped behind the world’s 57,000 large dams and countless small ones. This is material that otherwise would have been swept by river currents downstream and to the coast, where it would help build up marshes and other wetlands to act as a buffer against rising seas. Now, experts are searching for ways that this trapped sediment can be liberated and made available again to the rivers and estuaries to mitigate the loss of wetlands. “Sediment allows coastal habitat to grow, adapt, and maintain itself while sea levels change,” says Robin Grossinger, a senior scientist with the San Francisco Estuary Institute, which is working with agencies and conservation groups to increase the extent of wetlands in the San Francisco Bay from 50,000 acres to 100,000. “It’s almost like it’s the food — the nutrients, minerals, and vitamins — these systems need to grow and adapt, and we are starving them of that.” Scientists have for decades understood the impacts of engineering and flood-control projects on the United States’ largest river, the Mississippi. Before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began radically altering the Mississippi’s natural rhythm of seasonal flooding, the river was so rich in transported sediment it used to create its massive delta that it was called a “land-making machine.” But an elaborate network of levees, floodgates, and drainage canals have created a situation in which much of the Mississippi’s sediments are no longer allowed to flow over Louisiana’s coastal marshes and wetlands. Deprived of the river’s land-making capabilities, southern Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land and 20 percent of its wetlands since the 1930s. Officials are now planning to build sediment diversion projects that mimic the natural flood cycle so that sediment and freshwater can rebuild and sustain Louisiana’s coastal wetlands.

A similar appreciation of the role that dams play in robbing rivers and wetlands of much-needed sediment flows is now moving to the forefront of ecological studies and river engineering. The need to restore sediment flows to coastal environments has become more urgent in recent decades as development, agriculture, aquaculture and other human activity has destroyed or badly damaged about two-thirds of the world’s wetlands. Some 90 percent of the wetlands in San Francisco Bay are gone, and 75 percent of the wetlands in southern California have disappeared. Some restoration projects are now underway, but sediment — and an economically efficient way to deliver it — is urgently needed. Wetlands — including marshes, sea grass beds, estuaries, and mangroves — are remarkably rich and productive ecosystems, providing nesting habitat and nurseries for fish, birds, and other wildlife. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a third of the threatened and endangered species in the United States live solely in wetlands and half of them spend part of their life in a wetland environment. And wetland soils also have some of the highest amounts of stored soil carbon of any ecosystem. Studies also show that the sediment that has gathered behind the world’s dams is a significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than CO2 that seeps from organic material into the atmosphere. Researchers around the world are now searching for solutions to transport more dam-captured sediment downstream in rivers. Dam removal is becoming increasingly common. Across much of Europe — especially Spain, the U.K., and Sweden — hundreds of small dams and some large ones have been removed in recent years. There are, however, ways to restore the flow of sediments that do not involve dam removal. Sometimes sediment is simply dug up and moved or channeled around the dam in pipes or sluices. Bank stabilization structures can be removed in the river sections where sediment is needed so that more sediment can enter the river and flow downstream. “It’s a tricky issue,” says Warrick. “There’s probably a unique best answer for each river, based on what type of river, how much sediment, when the sediment moves, the natural cycles, and what the dam does. Every dam works differently. Some are used for flood control, some for power generation, some for water distribution. There’s not one answer for all this.”

Rather than consider sediment a waste product, one planner says, people should think about “how this precious resource can be utilized.”

Numerous other efforts are underway to help make needed sediment available for wetlands. The salt marsh wetlands of Jamaica Bay were replenished with sediment from the dredging of New York-New Jersey Harbor, for example.

Part of the answer, says Brett Milligan, an assistant professor of landscape architecture at the University of California, Davis, is changing the way we think about sediment. To that end he and colleagues formed the Dredge Research Collaborative and created DredgeFest, a series of conferences around the country attended by scientists, government officials, conservationists and the public to raise awareness about the essential role of sediment in ecosystems. “It’s something people don’t see or think about,” he says. “DredgeFest is a way to raise awareness and look for solutions.” Rather than consider sediment a waste product, Milligan would like people to think more about a “sediment-shed” — akin to a watershed — “and how this precious resource can be utilized,” he says. Ambrose is working on a five-year project that is restoring the wetlands near Seal Beach Harbor in southern California with an experimental technique called “thin-layer sediment placing.” During the first year, contractors sprayed a slurry of sediment with a firehose across 8.5 acres of marsh at risk of inundation. Over the next four years, researchers will see how well the vegetation comes back thanks to the sediment. “With some marshes you’ll be able to give them this boost and their natural processes will help them enough to allow them to keep up for a long, long time,” says Ambrose.

ADDIS ABABA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopia-Djibouti cross border potable water project will be finalized and commence operation in about three months, according to Demelash Mulu, project manager.

The water project funded by the Export-Import Bank of China is under construction by the Chinese company CGCOC.

The project, which is expected to provide safe drinking water for more than 700,000 Djibouti nationals, was tested three weeks ago and proved successful, Ethiopian local media FBC quoted Demelash Mulu, manager of the project, as saying on Tuesday.

The Ethiopia-Djibouti water project, dubbed as one of the largest water projects in Africa, was launched in 2015 in a bid to solve the drinking water problem in Djibouti as well as to deepen ties between the two neighboring countries.

The project, which includes the construction of water wells, reservoirs, and installation of 102km water distribution pipeline, will supply groundwater from Ethiopia's Hadagalla town to Djibouti's key towns of Ali-Sabieh, Dikhil, Arta and the capital.

Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh, speaking during the project launching ceremony in 2015, has hailed the existing partnership between his country and China as a major driving force realizing the project.

With an annual average of 200 mm of rain water per year in most parts of its national territory, Djibouti has always been classified as a country in a chronic water stress situation.

The Djiboutian government hopes that the project, which is expected to benefit the country with 100,000 cubic meters of water daily for the next 20 years, to end the perennial water problem in the horn of African country.","Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['funded', 'chinese', 'ethiopiadjibouti', 'ethiodjibouti', 'djibouti', 'problem', 'project', 'expected', 'drinking', 'mulu', 'water', 'country', 'soon', 'xinhua', 'inaugurated']",

Tens of thousands showed up Saturday in the northern German city, police said.

Waving flags, wielding banners and holding posters, they displayed their support for a slew of issues, including migrant rights, Kurdish independence, LGBT rights and environmental initiatives.

Julian G., who lives in a Hamburg suburb, told CNN he was demonstrating for the rights of Turkish people who've lost their freedoms under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.

""I want to stand with my friends in Turkey who are trapped in an authoritarian system and can't demonstrate freely,"" he said.

Chinese human rights groups based in European countries called for the release of Chinese political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.

""We are free human beings and are going to fight, not only for all human rights in China but for the basic rights of all and humans across the world,"" said activist Tienchi Martin-Liao, president of the Independent Chinese PEN Center.

Communal feel

Saturday's turnout includes two separate demonstrations that were to converge at one large meeting place. An estimated 22,000 people marched in one of those.

A festive and communal feel pervaded the crowds, with people holding climate change signs and feminism posters and grooving to music. Many came with family.

Carolin Wolter, 25, who showed up with her daughter Levke, 5, said she's most concerned about how the G20 leaders address climate change.

""It's the first main important issue to speak about, especially for my daughter, whose future lies in the decision of these leaders,"" Wolter said. ""And that worries me.""

The calm atmosphere was in sharp contrast with the restive and angry mood in Thursday's and Friday's protests, where street violence flared.

Since the demonstrations began this week, at least 213 officers have been injured, 114 people have been arrested and 89 have been taken into custody, police said Saturday.

Tight security

Security in the city of 1.8 million has been bolstered with 1,000 police officers from around Germany after Hamburg police asked for more help as tension grew Friday.

Protesters set bonfires in the streets, looted shops and stacked up blocks of pavement to use as projectiles. At first, police stayed back, while demonstrators threw rocks and bottles and then retreated.

But shortly before midnight, police moved forward. They fired tear gas and water cannons and set off flash-bang grenades.

Protesters hurled bottles of looted champagne into the fires, causing popping noises that sounded like fireworks. At one store, residents tried to stop people from stealing from the shop windows.

The Group of 20, which includes 19 countries and the European Union, accounts for about 80% of the global gross domestic product. Around two-thirds of the world's population live in a G20 country.

Chinese companies have plans for additional factories with the capacity to pump out more than 120 gigawatt-hours a year by 2021, according to a report published this week by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s enough to supply batteries for around 1.5 million Tesla Model S vehicles or 13.7 million Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrids per year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

By comparison, when completed in 2018, Tesla Inc.’s massive Gigafactory will crank out up to 35 gigawatt-hours of battery cells annually.

Lithium-ion batteries have long been used in smartphones, laptops, and other personal electronics, but demand is forecast to explode in the next five years as electric vehicles proliferate and power companies install giant storage systems to smooth the ebb and flow of wind and solar.

Telsa produced nearly 84,000 vehicles in 2016 and has said it plans to make 500,000 in 2018.

While Tesla may be building the biggest and splashiest factory, the Chinese government has launched a sweeping effort to increase the country’s dominant market share.

Roughly 55 percent of global lithium-ion battery production is already based in China, compared with 10 percent in the U.S. By 2021, China’s share is forecast to grow to 65 percent, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

“This is about industrial policy. The Chinese government sees lithium-ion batteries as a hugely important industry in the 2020s and beyond,” Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Colin McKerracher said.

In all, global battery-making capacity is forecast to more than double by 2021 to 273 gigawatt-hours, up from about 103 gigawatt-hours today. That’s a huge opportunity -- and China doesn’t want to miss it.

“The Gigafactory announced three years ago sparked a global battery arms race,” said Simon Moores, a managing director at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “China is making a big push.”

But don’t count Tesla out. The company could announce locations for up to four new battery factories by the end of 2017. (It’s exploring at least one site in Shanghai.) And there are few, if any, individual Chinese battery companies that can match the scale of Tesla’s production toe to toe.

Yet while China lacks a dominant battery behemoth, it makes up for it with a constellation of smaller players, including Amperex Technology Ltd., Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co. and dozens of others.

Earlier this year, the Chinese government announced plans to consolidate battery manufacturers to help the industry mature. The initiative goes hand in hand with China’s plans to flood highways with five million electric vehicles by 2020.

China’s ambition to become the global leader in clean cars stems in part from pressure to clear pollution from smog-choked streets in Baoding, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and other cities. There’s a second reason: creating a domestic market for Chinese battery manufacturers, said Logan Goldie-Scot, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst.

“The Chinese government wants to encourage the creation of a domestic market to create a large enough base and gain a foothold,” Goldie-Scot said. “From there, they can expand and sell globally.”","Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/styles/800x600/s3/OEM05_170639987_AR_-1_JQTQMXSBJYWH.jpg,"['chinese', 'overtake', 'gigawatthours', 'chinas', 'vehicles', 'bloomberg', 'production', 'plans', 'battery', 'global', 'tesla', 'china', 'energy', 'lithiumion']",

BUENOS AIRES, Jun 27 2017 (IPS) - Two new nuclear power plants, to cost 14 billion dollars, will give a new impetus to Argentina’s relation with atomic energy, which began over 60 years ago. President Mauricio Macri made the announcement from China, the country that is to finance 85 per cent of the works.

But besides the fact that social movements quickly started to organise against the plants, the project appears to face a major hurdle.

The Chinese government has set a condition: it threatens to pull out of the plans for the nuclear plants and from the rest of its investments in Argentina if the contract signed for the construction of two gigantic hydroelectric power plants in Argentina’s southernmost wilderness region, Patagonia, does not move forward. The plans are currently on hold, pending a Supreme Court decision.

“China has an almost endless capacity for investment and is interested in Argentina as in the rest of Latin America, a region that it wants to secure as a provider of inputs. Of course China has a strong bargaining position and Argentina’s aim should be a balance of power.“ -- Dante Sica





Together with Brazil and Mexico, Argentina is one of the three Latin American countries that have developed nuclear energy.

The National Commission for Atomic Energy was founded in 1950 by then president Juan Domingo Perón (1946-1955 and 1973-1974) and the country inaugurated its first nuclear plant, Atucha I, in 1974. The development of nuclear energy was halted after the 1976-1983 military dictatorship, by then-president Raúl Alfonsín (1983-1989), but it was resumed during the administration of Néstor Kirchner (2003-2007).

According to the announcement Macri made during his visit to Beijing in May, construction of Atucha III, with a capacity of 745 MW, is to begin in January 2018, 100 km from the capital, in the town of Lima, within the province of Buenos Aires.

Atucha I and II, two of Argentina’s three nuclear power plants, are located in that area, while the third, known as Embalse, is in the central province of Córdoba.

Construction of a fifth nuclear plant, with a capacity of 1,150 MW, would begin in 2020 in an as-yet unannounced spot in the province of Río Negro, north of Patagonia.

Currently, nuclear energy represents four per cent of Argentina’s electric power, while thermal plants fired by natural gas and oil account for 64 per cent and hydroelectric power plants represent 30 per cent, according to the Energy Ministry. Other renewable sources only amount to two per cent, although the government is seeking to expand them.

Besides diversifying the energy mix, the projected nuclear and hydroelectric plants are part of an ambitious strategy that Argentina set in motion several years ago: to strengthen economic ties with China, which would buy more food from Argentina and boost investment here.

During his May 14-17 visit to China, Macri was enthusiastic about the role that the Asian giant could play in this South American country.

“China is an absolutely strategic partner. This will be the beginning of a wonderful era between our countries. There must be few countries in the world that complement each other than Argentina and China,” said Macri in Beijing, speaking to businesspeople from both countries.

“Argentina produces food for 400 million people and we are aiming at doubling this figure in five to eight years,“ said Macri, who added that he expects from China investments in “roads, bridges, energy, ports, airports.“

Ties between Argentina and China began to grow more than 10 years ago and expanded sharply in 2014, when then president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-2015) received her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires, where they signed several agreements.

These ranged from the construction of dams in Patagonia to investments in the upgrading of the Belgrano railway, which transports goods from the north of the country to the western river port of Rosario, where they are shipped to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas.

On Jun. 22, 18 new locomotives from China arrived in Buenos Aires for the Belgrano railroad.

However, relations between China and Argentina are not free of risks for this country, experts warn.

“China has an almost endless capacity for investment and is interested in Argentina as in the rest of Latin America, a region that it wants to secure as a provider of inputs. Of course China has a strong bargaining position and Argentina’s aim should be a balance of power,“ economist Dante Sica, who was secretary of trade and industry in 2002-2003, told IPS.

“They are buyers of food, but they also want to sell their products and they generate tension in Argentina´s industrial structure. In fact, our country for several years now has had a trade deficit with China,“ he added.

Roberto Adaro, an expert on international relations at the Centre for Studies in State Policies and Society, told IPS that “Argentina can benefit from its relations with China if it is clear with regard to its interests. It must insist on complementarity and not let China flood our local market with their products.“

Adaro praised the decision to invest in nuclear energy since it is “important to diversify the energy mix“ and because the construction of nuclear plants “also generates investments and jobs in other sectors of the economy.“

However, there is a thorn in the side of relations between China and Argentina regarding the nuclear issue: the project of the hydroelectric plants. These two giant plants with a projected capacity of 1,290 MW are to be built at a cost of nearly five billion dollar, on the Santa Cruz River, which emerges in the spectacular Glaciers National Park in the southern region of Patagonia, and flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

In December, when the works seemed about to get underway, the Supreme Court suspended construction of the dams, in response to a lawsuit filed by two environmental organisations.

The three Chinese state banks financing the two projects then said they would invoke a cross-default clause included in the contract for the dams, which said they would cancel the rest of their investments if the dams were not built.

To build the two plants, three Chinese and one Argentine companies formed a consortium, but after winning the tender in 2013, construction has not yet begun.

Under pressure from China, the government released the results of a new environmental impact study on Jun. 15 and now plans to convene a public hearing to discuss it, so that Argentina’s highest court will authorise the beginning of the works.

Added to opposition to the dams by environmentalists is their rejection of the nuclear plants. In the last few weeks, activists from Río Negro have held meetings in different parts of the province, demanding a referendum to allow the public to vote on the plant to be installed there.

They have even generated an unusual conflict with the neighbouring province of Chubut, where the regional parliament unanimously approved a statement against the nuclear plants. The governor of Río Negro, Alberto Weretilnek, asked the people of Chubut to “stop meddling.“

“Argentina must start a serious debate about what these plants mean, at a time when the world is abandoning this kind of energy. We need to know, among other things, how the uranium that is needed as fuel is going to be obtained,“ the director of the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation, Andrés Nápòli, told IPS.

Argentina now imports the uranium used in the country’s nuclear plants, but environmentalists are worried that local production, which was abandoned more than 20 years ago, will restart.","Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2017/06/1.jpg,"['drives', 'nuclear', 'plants', 'construction', 'province', 'power', 'macri', 'attached', 'argentinas', 'expansion', 'china', 'energy', 'strings', 'argentina']",

BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Sharing their experiences of being bullied, several children shed tears.

""He broke my pencil without any reason, punched me, and gave me a bloody nose after I asked him to pay for my pencil,"" a fourth-grader, recalls in front of his classmates, his body trembling.

The little boy takes off glasses, briefly wipes his tears and bursts out crying. His teacher walks over and hugs him without saying a word.

The class at Sanjiang Ethnic Experimental School in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is called social and emotional learning (SEL). It is a cooperation project between the Ministry of Education and UNICEF.

SEL is about helping students develop skills such as self-recognition and confidence, understanding and managing emotions, and maintaining positive relationships with others. ""Say 'no' to bullying"" is one of the topics.

During the course, Zhou Lihong, the teacher, tells a story of an imaginative but introverted girl's long-term bullying and asks students for ways they would help the girl.

Some suggest making friends with her, some advise her to turn to teachers or parents for help, someone suggests ""an eye for an eye.""

""Bullying is constant and intentional, initiated by the stronger against the vulnerable. We should learn to protect ourselves, and meanwhile, never bully others,"" Zhou tells the children.

Educationalist Guo Xiaoping of UNICEF says since launch of the SEL project in 2013, the number of participating schools has increased to over 500.

These schools are mainly in less-developed middle and western parts of the country, such as Guangxi's Sanjiang County, Panxian County in Yunnan Province and Zhongxian County in Chongqing Municipality, said Guo.

""With the support from local education authorities and experts, some schools that are not included into the pilot have also joined in,"" she said.

Wu Xinyun, head of the primary section of Sanjiang Ethnic Experimental School, says students receive a SEL every two weeks, using textbooks provided by the project.

""We have found there is less physical conflict among the kids,"" she said. Each class has around 60 students, much more than the advised national maximum of 45.

""Physical contact is very frequent in the classroom, and often led to fights in the past. SEL helps students understand each other, so brawls are much more infrequent,"" she said.

Many countries, such as the United States and Australia, have SEL in their standard curriculums, and it is helpful for students' academic progress, according to Guo.

She says a study of U.S. primary and high schools and kindergartens in 2011 found SEL participants did 11-percentage points better than control groups.

Wei Jiaqi, 12, has drawn a picture of a classmate holding an umbrella for her in rain. She names the drawing, ""Thanks for caring about me.""

""I was upset as my mom had scolded me that day. It was my classmate who kept me company,"" she says. ""I changed my girl pal into a boy, because drawing a boy is easier,"" she says with a smile, adding they like the SEL courses very much.

Li Fuzhuo, head of teacher education at Guangxi normal university, said SEL is meant to create an atmosphere in which students feel, experience, think and acquire the related skills. Competent teachers are vital.

To address this issue, the Ministry of Education and UNICEF often organize training and demonstration courses for school heads and teachers.

The project also encourages parents to participate. The team is compiling articles about SEL to be released via the UNICEF WeChat account.

In this way, parents, especially migrant workers who have left their children behind, will be able to join in the SEL project.

Huang Guizhen, an official with the Ministry of Education, believes SEL not only improves teaching competence, but enables vulnerable groups, like left-behind children, to feel more care and love from school and the family.

""We want to expand the project to more schools, so that more children benefit from it,"" she said.","Sat, 01 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['chinese', 'benefits', 'children', 'education', 'unicef', 'social', 'project', 'county', 'school', 'china', 'sel', 'students', 'emotional', 'schools', 'xinhua', 'sanjiang', 'learning']",

The programme includes catastrophic insurance solutions to protect against natural and man-made disasters such as fire and explosion.

Vice Mayor of Dalian, Hong Dengjin commented; “Innovative risk management solutions developed in partnership like this one, between the city of Dalian and Swiss Re, will allow us to put effective risk financing instruments in place in order to speed up recovery.

“This will benefit individuals, enterprise and the broader economy in our region. Overall it will strengthen our city’s fiscal and physical resilience.”

Jayne Plunkett, Regional President of Asia, Swiss Re, added; “We’re delighted at this important partnership with the City of Dalian, offering our deep risk management expertise and innovative insurance solutions as an effective tool to build concrete disaster resilience plans.

“More and more cities around the world recognise the win-win of understanding their risks and preparing for disaster in advance, rather than responding after the fact. It helps people, business and the economy.

“We hope more provinces in China and around the world will consider the advantages and follow suit.”

China has a strategic plan to develop urbanisation, but many of the highly developed zones are situated in areas highly exposed to natural disasters. Extreme weather events can threaten China’s booming economic development, which are seeing greater concentration of assets, people, and technology.

Chinese authorities and regulators are collaborating with re/insurers to pioneer new models of insurance tools to increase urban and rural resilience.

Swiss Re has previously launched two pilot schemes for resilience building in which local governments in rural and urban provinces are insured against natural disaster, instead of individuals and enterprises.

In October last year, Swiss Re sealed an agreement with the Chinese province of Guangdong to be the sole reinsurer for a parametric disaster insurance pilot providing $350m of protection against tropical cyclone and excess rainfall for seven prefectures in the region.

In addition to using re/insurance to build urban and rural disaster resilience, China has been pioneering harnessing re/insurance solutions to protect its clean energy revolution against deviations in weather patterns and energy turnout – and while these re/insurance and government led partnerships are in pilot project stages – they signal potential for reinsurance demand in China to rapidly increase in coming years.","Thu, 06 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Flag_of_the_Peoples_Republic_of_China-300x200.png,"['insurance', 'world', 'solutions', 'resilience', 'signs', 'swiss', 'reinsurance', 'rural', 'dalian', 'city', 'china', 'mou', 'disaster', 'urban']",

Bitcoin’s distributed ledger of transactions, known as a blockchain, makes it possible for it to operate without any central authority.

China is not the only country interested in overhauling its currency. This year India eliminated some banknotes in an effort to reduce tax evasion and illegal income. And while some other central banks, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, are studying digital fiat currencies, China’s test appears to be the first of its kind anywhere in the world.

One of the main concerns voiced by other central banks looking at digital fiat currencies is that they could undermine the commercial banking system by making it possible for anyone to have an account with the central bank.

China’s digital currency is designed to avoid this problem. In a paper published in Tsinghua Financial Review, an academic journal, and posted online recently, Yao Qian, deputy director of the Technology Department of the People’s Bank of China, wrote that a digital currency could be integrated into the existing banking system, with commercial banks operating digital wallets for the central bank’s currency.

And while other countries have proposed following Bitcoin’s architecture and many of the largest banks in the world are experimenting with it, the currency developed by the People’s Bank of China is also different in design.

Yao writes that the currency would only use a distributed ledger in a limited way. A blockchain might not be used to process transactions, as this could prove an insurmountable bottleneck for a currency with such a huge transaction volume as the renminbi. But such a distributed ledger might be used to periodically check who owns what. “The ownership of digital currency can be verified directly by the issuing bank, so as to realize peer-to-peer cash transaction[s],” Yao writes.

Officials from the People’s Bank of China declined to provide any official comment on the development of the digital currency or plans for its use.

There may be good reason to proceed slowly. For all the excitement over digital currencies, Bitcoin is experiencing technical problems as it grows more popular, and the community of developers behind the currency is beset by infighting over its future direction. Bitcoin’s value has also oscillated wildly in recent years (as of writing, the value of a bitcoin is $2,662, more than double its value in March). A number of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, and blockchain technology is being explored as a way to track all sorts of different things.

Still, a less decentralized currency under the control of the central bank has significant appeal. “In a place like China, they may see an opportunity to catch up with other countries; to adopt new technology; and maybe even overtake people,” says Simon Johnson, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management who studies monetary innovation and who previously served as the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.

Johnson notes that China is already at the vanguard of experimentation in mobile payments and digital money, which has driven economic growth. “There’s a lot of innovation in the private sector with things like Alipay,” he says. “And China is also the biggest user of Bitcoin, as far as we can determine.”

Johnson adds that China may be the right place for an official digital currency to take off. “There’s this confluence of being at the front of the technology, getting some advantages for their payments system, and developing some jobs,” he says.","Fri, 23 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mit-yuan-dollar-7.jpg?resize=1200,600","['cautiously', 'central', 'testing', 'chinas', 'bank', 'currencies', 'bitcoin', 'technology', 'currency', 'china', 'begun', 'banks', 'digital', 'distributed']", 
75,75,FL-2017-000075-CHN,"Swiss Re, Ping An Offer China’s 1st Mobile-Enabled Parametric Insurance Cover - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2017/07/07/456910.htm,"Swiss Re has partnered with Ping An Property & Casualty Insurance Co. of China Ltd. to launch China’s first mobile-enabled typhoon property parametric insurance solution.

This solution is designed to provide an affordable, easy-to-use insurance product for both individuals and enterprises located in areas that are prone to typhoons, and covers the economic losses caused by typhoons, said Swiss Re in a statement.

In addition to the technological support and reinsurance service from Swiss Re, the solution uses the company’s catastrophe models and data on natural disasters to generate quotes for Ping An’s customers.

Swiss Re said the solution gives customers the ability to purchase insurance, make inquiries and complete the claims settlement process from a mobile device. It also provides real-time tracking of a typhoon’s path and wind speed, provided by China’s national meteorological center.

The trigger for the payout amount is also based on this information, Swiss Re said.

The insurance covers eight coastal provincial regions in Southeast China: Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Shandong and Hainan.

When a typhoon occurs, a user can access an inquiry page, check if the claim terms have been triggered and submit a remote self-service claim. The system will then automatically calculate the claim amount and settles the claim within three days. This product offers a maximum payout of RMB 20,000 (or Chinese Yuan Renminbi) ($2,940) per address for individuals and RMB 500,000 ($7,350) per address for enterprises.

“Typhoons are the most often and costliest natural catastrophes which occur in China,” commented John Chen, president of Swiss Re China.

“They can cause severe life and property loss in economically developed and densely populated regions,” he said. “The successful launch of this product can serve as an important example for other regions affected by similar natural disasters.”

Using its catastrophe modeling and big data capabilities, Swiss Re said it takes into consideration the insured’s risk exposure, builds an on-line pricing engine based on cloud technology and produces a quote for users of the solution based on the real-time atmospheric circulation information.

“China is a vast country that experiences diverse natural disasters, but has a low level of insurance coverage, which leaves a significant protection gap,” said Mike Mitchell, head of Property and Specialty Reinsurance, Swiss Re.

“Products such as this help accelerate economic recovery after natural disasters, and allow people to return quickly to normal life,” added Mitchell.

76,76,FL-2017-000075-CHN,China bans more synthetic opioids blamed for US drug deaths - STAT,https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/19/synthetic-opioids-fentanyl-china/,"Deng Ming, deputy director of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, announced that four synthetic opioids would be added to China's list of controlled substances as of July 1.

BEIJING — China said Monday it would ban a designer drug called U-47700 and three others, following U.S. pressure to do more to control synthetic opioids blamed for fast-rising overdose deaths in the United States.

In China, U-47700 has until now been a legal alternative to fentanyl and potent derivatives like carfentanil. Its usage has been growing among U.S. opioid addicts.

Last year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed U-47700 in the category of the most dangerous drugs it regulates, saying it was associated with dozens of fatalities, mostly in New York and North Carolina. Some of the pills taken from Prince’s estate after the musician’s overdose death last year contained U-47700.

The DEA has long said that China is the top source country for synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its precursors, assertions Beijing has said lack firm evidence. Still, the two countries have deepened cooperation as the U.S. opioid epidemic intensifies.

Deng Ming, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission, said that U-47700 and three other synthetic drugs — MT-45, PMMA, and 4,4′-DMAR — would be added to China’s list of controlled substances as of July 1.

Yu Haibin, a division director at the Ministry of Public Security’s Narcotics Control Bureau, said China was making “big efforts” to deal with drugs known as new psychoactive substances. These substances are made by modifying the chemical structures of controlled substances in order to get around the law, and China has now restricted 138 of them.

However, as soon as one substance is banned, chemists create slightly different and technically legal alternatives and then market them online.

“My feeling is that it’s just like a race and I will never catch up with the criminals,” Yu told a news conference. “Actually, we just want to make a breakthrough in dealing with this.”

To counter the cat-and-mouse game, Yu said authorities had set up a system whereby information on new types of drugs gleaned during police investigations, customs clearances and medical treatment would be transferred to the national drug lab. An expert committee would then assess this information and send alert notices to relevant agencies in order to help speed up the control of new substances, he said.

Yu said suspects use the internet to communicate with customers and use the anonymized digital currency bitcoin to transfer money, and that authorities were working with internet companies to try to stop such trade and the advertising of drugs on websites.

To combat drugs being sent by post or express delivery service, authorities were carrying out real-name registration requirements and X-rays of parcels being delivered to “high-risk areas,” he said.

Addressing the news conference, Justin Schoeman, Beijing-based country attache for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said: “I can tell you that when China controls a substance, (new psychoactive substances) or fentanyl-classed substance, it has a huge impact on seizures and availability in the U.S., so thank you very much.

“The controlling of substances in China certainly saves lives in the U.S.,” he added.

He added that China’s banning of additional substances means the U.S. and China can now carry out joint investigations on those chemicals, including the tracking of packages from the source through to the recipients in the U.S.

U-47700 is a synthetic opioid, a fast-proliferating class of drugs that have caused thousands of deaths in the United States. In 2015 alone, there were 9,580 deaths due to synthetic opioids other than methadone, accounting for almost a fifth of all drug overdose deaths.

Severe flooding on Ward's Island has led to a plunge in business at the Rectory Café. It will close for good in October.

After one of the rainiest springs on record, Toronto is grappling with prolonged flooding. Here’s what the TRCA is doing to keep the damage at bay.

The Rectory Café on Toronto’s Ward Island overlooks a large, marshy pond—a new addition this year to the tourist site. The wetland is the result of a particularly rainy spring that saw double the rainfall compared to the same period last year, and by May 31 water levels in Lake Ontario reached the highest they’ve been on record. About 40 per cent of Ward’s Island has receded into the encroaching lake. During the calm after one of the season’s many rainfalls, the flooded island, with its Toronto skyline backdrop, makes for an eerily beautiful image. But the impact on the environment, and the people who rely on it, can be devastating.

Zorah Freeman-McIntyre, the chef and co-owner of the Island Cafe told CBC last month about the drop in business. “Islanders have been supporting us a lot, which is great, and city workers have been coming by…but the bulk of our traffic is tourists, and people can’t come across,” he said. The Rectory Café will close in October, and has seen a drop in business.

Indeed, damages from flooding create a significant financial burden on small businesses, homeowners, and the economy in general. The 2013 summer storm in Alberta cost $1.7 billion in insured damages, making it the priciest natural disaster in Canadian history. Property damage from Toronto’s rainstorm that same year cost $850 million, and another Toronto storm in August 2005, cost $671 million. Damages from the record rainfall this April and May have yet to be tallied.

The waterlogged state of the Toronto Islands and waterfront this spring is due to lake-related flooding—the result of prolonged periods of rain, often in spring on top of a snow melt. High lake levels, and the flooding that comes with it, can persist for months.

The other type of flooding common in the GTA is riverine flooding. When all is running smoothly, Toronto’s extensive ravine network acts as a natural drainage system to protect against these floods. When heavy rain falls in a short period of time, the ground becomes saturated with water which can’t be absorbed into the earth fast enough. The runoff that results funnels into the ravines’ many capillaries, which carry the water down to Lake Ontario.

But urbanization has left swaths of impermeable concrete in place of rain-absorbing green space. The result is huge amounts of runoff that stress our urban rivers. When that system becomes overwhelmed by rain—which it frequently does—surrounding properties and low-lying areas near rivers and streams pay the price. “Urbanization has to occur in a way that allows the ravines to fulfill their natural function,” says Rehana Rajabali, an engineer with Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) who specializes in flood-risk management. But historically, that hasn’t always happened.

It doesn’t help that most of the city’s sewers aren’t equipped to deal with the onslaught of extreme weather brought on by climate change. Developments built before the 1980s (and before the region had effective stormwater management programs) have sewer systems designed for two– or five-year storms—weather events that have a 50 per cent and 20 per cent chance of happening, respectively, each year.

“The problem is that we’re getting a lot more intense storms than we were when these systems were built,” says Glenn MacMillan, senior manager of water and energy with TRCA. “The science is showing we’re getting 10 per cent more rain per year—not a huge amount more, but it’s how we’re getting the rain that matters.” Rather than getting small, 5–10 millimetre rainfall events, it’s more common now to see droughts and then pummelling rain in a short period of time.

“During big storms, there’s nowhere for the water to go,” MacMillan adds. “You’re going to have surcharging from the sewers, and then the water will pond and go wherever it can find a way out. A lot of it goes into the storm sewer system which can flood people’s basements.”

Unfortunately, it took a disaster to wake the region up to the importance of our river systems, and to our vulnerability to flooding. In 1954, after nearly a century of urban development near rivers and strain on the ravines, the calamitous Hurricane Hazel rocked the city. Homes near the Humber River, Holland Marsh, and Etobicoke Creek were swept off their foundations and into the rivers and flooded streets, dozens of bridges were washed out by the rising water, and 81 people died. “With so many lives lost, and homes destroyed, Hurricane Hazel was truly the watershed moment for our region,” says Rajabali. “It was a reminder of the power of Mother Nature, and reminded us of the importance of city building in a way that was mindful of natural hazards.”

Although conservation authorities existed prior to Hurricane Hazel, their mandate was expanded after the storm to include responsibilities such as flood risk management. In response to the tragedy, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was formed with the amalgamation of four of the smaller watershed-based conservation authorities. Over the years, the organization has gained jurisdiction over 40,000 acres of land, including most of Toronto’s river valley areas, in order to mitigate flooding and undertake myriad other conservation initiatives. “Many of the practices that we implement have benefits beyond flood protection,” says Rajabali. “They can also serve to improve water quality, reduce urban heat-island effect, and preserve access to green space for future generations”

Since the TRCA’s inception, the region’s municipalities have restricted building on floodplains. All new developments, meanwhile, no matter where they’re located, are required to account for stormwater on their lands. “When you have a development, you’re creating new impervious areas which alter the water balance,” says Sameer Dhalla, associate director of engineering services at TRCA focusing on restoration and infrastructure. “You have less water infiltrating [the earth], less water evaporating, and more water that runs off the landscape. This increase in runoff can cause flooding, erosion, and can create water pollution problems.” Adding green roofs, permeable pavement, and infiltration trenches to properties can help avoid these problems.

Still, there are 43 sites in and around Toronto deemed “flood vulnerable area clusters,” most of which are located in historic urban areas that predate floodplain-management plans and stormwater-management practices. “For these existing flood vulnerable areas, we need to look at larger remediation solutions,” says Dhalla.

Those solutions involve ambitious, long-term projects aimed at protecting entire neighbourhoods from riverine flooding and avoiding another Hurricane Hazel–like calamity. The Corktown Common is one example of large-scale flood remediation. There, a 8.5 metre-high landform, cloaked with grassy hills and saplings, protects the West Don Lands in case of flooding from the Don River. The landform is one phase of a larger effort—the Don Mouth Naturalization and Port Lands Flood Protection project—to keep widespread flooding at the mouth of the Don River at bay. Another piece of the massive project is modifying the mouth of the Don River. The stretch was artificially straightened in 1886 to make space for boats to pass through and to divert sewage and waste water into Ashbridge’s Bay Marsh. But the plan, dubbed “Don Improvement,” made flooding worse. Now, Waterfront Toronto, in partnership with the TRCA, plans to restore the mouth of the Don to its more natural state, complete with recreation space, habitat creation for species, and, most critically, flood control measures.

Indeed, building a number of benefits into one project is a core principle of the TRCA’s “Living City” mandate. Corktown Common, for instance, shows how well-designed green space can offer recreation space and conservation as well as rigorous flood protection to vulnerable parts of the city. It’s something earlier flood control measures failed to strive for. Dam building, for example, proved useful for stymying torrents, but dams can harm species populations and habitats.

“Moving into the future we’re looking for new solutions to provide flood remediation on a larger scale that not only offers flood protection, but multiple benefits: that it provides habitats, it provides city building with amenities like parks, and, of course, it provides protection to people and properties from flooding,” Dhalla says. “All these things work part and parcel with each other.”

The island is no longer an island, but the city on it is not yet a city. A calming yet strange silence envelops the enormous government-built conference center. As I walk past another large building, the spacious civic center, a flock of birds swirls just in front of me before rushing to safer heights. The birds are the only beings I encountered on the footpath. Some doors in the shopping alley already have names on them but the windows reveal their emptiness. It is Monday, there is no holiday, and it is still before the end of the working day; yet I noticed only a few people.

Is it a ghost town? No, for ghosts are the emanations of the deceased and this city is just waiting to be born. There is no sense of decay, but of hope. The “Lianyun New City” – which is in fact the new business district of a city called Lianyungang – is waiting by the sea, hoping to be engulfed by the flood of development.

Lianyungang was recently mentioned by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as one of the nodal points of the Belt and Road Initiative (previously known as One Belt, One Road, hence OBOR/BRI). The expression was timely as it appeared in Xi’s speech during the Belt and Road Initiative Forum held in Beijing in May 2017.

Even before the OBOR initiative was first announced in 2013, Lianyungang was being mentioned as the starting point of OBOR’s earlier and smaller avatar, the Eurasian Land Bridge. Lianyungang could indeed be a symbol of the Belt and Road rhetoric as it is conveniently located at a cross-section of land and sea routes. The railway line is a part of a network that not only reaches western China but stretches on through Kazakhstan to Europe. At the same time the coastal city is located not far away from the bustling South Korean port of Busan. Thanks to an agreement signed in 2013 by the city’s authorities in the presence of the leaders of China and Kazakhstan, companies from Kazakhstan are now using Lianyungang’s port facilities.

While Lianyungang used to be recommended as a laid-back town of a kind in which one could spend their elderly years (if you don’t mind the nuclear reactors), the city has recently seen an uptick of economic activities. The port was recently expanded and the already described new business district is being built northeast of the city and northwest of the port, on a small island which is actually so close and well-bridged that it forms an easy addition to the coast. The cost of land for investment is very competitive in comparison to other cities. Led by its mayor, Lianyungang embarked on a regional-level diplomacy mission that is common for many of China’s provinces and cities. Apart from the already mentioned deal with Kazakhstan, Lianyungang’s international cooperation now includes, among others, an agreement signed with the Belarusian city Zhlobin. Lianyungang seems now ready to both reclaim the land from the sea and lay a claim to a sea of opportunities inland.

Yet, obstacles and doubts remain. Lianyungang is not even the capital of its province, Jiangsu. It is a prefecture-level city and there are bigger and economically more important cities even in the province, not to speak of a broader region. Lianyungang is also obviously not the only Chinese city which is both a port and a trading center connected by rail to Central Asia. While trade can expand, at least one of its sources – the Eurasian railway connection – is, after all, limited in its capacity and the establishment of new railway connections seems hardly a viable option. Yet, among other and more concrete advantages that Lianyungang has it now gained a new one – the OBOR/BRI logo on its team’s T-shirts.

The OBOR/BRI project is visibly offering a wider advertising platform for some of China’s lesser known regions and cities. It is not that without this initiative economic opportunities and regional-level diplomacy would not be possible. It is not that without this project investment would not come and new infrastructure would not be established. It is just that cities like Lianyungang can get the hold of the OBOR/BRI promotional balloon to claim that their efforts are a part of a wider, national strategy. Both Chinese and foreign institutions have understood that using the OBOR/BRI symbolism may provide additional popularity to a project or an event. Lianyungang understands that very well too. The city’s marketing materials use the “One Belt, One Road”/”Belt and Road Initiative” catchphrase. Just few weeks after Xi’s mention of Lianyungang in Beijing, a conference on the One Belt, One Road was held in the city (which is how I ended up in Lianyungang).

As I was walking back from my short tour of the under-construction business district the sun was getting ready to sink behind row of tall and empty office buildings. A bus went by, manned by a woman driver but otherwise empty (the previous bus had some 3 or 4 passengers in it). One may think here of Wade Shepard’s book, The Ghost Cities of China. Yet, Lianyun New City is different. Shepard’s “ghost cities” told the story of residential areas waiting for a flood of people moving from rural to urban areas. Lianyun New City, in turn, is a new business district waiting for more investors. But the two do have something in common: very meticulous Chinese pre-planning.

Some would say that it is too risky to plan and build so much before an expected process actually starts. Others, however, would point out that the only preparation is a good one. Building an empty district before the economic activities will start is an obvious risk of overshooting one’s capabilities. But, as many examples around the world show, reacting when the process has already started can bring about haphazard systems and inefficient improvisation. After all, Lianyun New City is a city waiting to be born – and when you wait for the birth, you prepare the house beforehand (despite the risks of pregnancy) rather than wait until after the delivery.","Thu, 06 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat.com-20170703_183012.jpg,"['district', 'hub', 'road', 'initiative', 'waiting', 'born', 'chinas', 'port', 'city', 'lianyungang', 'cities', 'belt', 'oborbri']",

GUANGZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Police officer Li Jianzhao was once hated by villagers who cooked crystal methamphetamine in Boshe, a coastal village in Lufeng County, Guangdong Province.

The village of 14,000 was a center of production and trade of drugs, with over a third of meth consumed in China originating in Boshe and neighboring villages. One in five families were directly involved in drug production.

Li started work in Boshe the day after the raid on Dec. 29, 2013, when more than 3,000 armed police with helicopters and speedboats stormed the village, arrested 183 people and seized three tonnes of the drug.

Li leads 30 officers who continue to sniff out narcotics and maintain security.

Before the 2013 operation, Boshe was off limits to police. ""When I started work here, the village was totally stinking, with sewage running everywhere, the ground covered by garbage and the air stinking of chemicals,"" he said.

Pointing toward a ditch, which still smells bad, Li said, ""three years ago, it was 100 times worse than it is now.""

Li's job was not easy. ""Making and selling meth was a way of life here. The villagers hated us for cleaning out the drugs,"" he said.

When Li made home visits, he could not get doors open. Patrols were attacked and vehicles were vandalized.

""I understand how they felt. We caught many people who shared common surnames. People said there was no way out of making drugs,"" said Li.

In the past three years, Li and his colleagues have helped the villagers find other ways to make a living.

""The village is beginning to change. There are not so many cold stares now. I even get invited to have tea in their houses,"" he said.

Lufeng was a poor county of about 1.8 million people. Narcotics production became popular in 2009. To clean up the area and wean them off drugs, the government has built shrimp, geese and pig farms, said Cai Longqiu, CPC secretary in Boshe. ""Many young people work in cities like Guangzhou and the villagers have taken up new jobs,"" he said.

The wholesale price of a kilogram of meth was 8,000 yuan three years ago, but the price was up to 40,000 yuan per kilo last year, said Lin Yizhi, public security chief of Lufeng.

""We have squeezed the room for narcotics, and will continue to combat production and trade,"" said Lin.

Anti-drug billboards are put up on the way from downtown Lufeng to Boshe. Wanted notices are also posted for suspects who are still on the run.

""It is easy to get tough on drugs, but it is difficult to completely stop the trade if we do not help people to find jobs, and if we do not help them abandon ideas of making quick money and breaking the law,"" said Li.

Lin Shaoang, CPC secretary of Jiazi township, suggested building an industrial park and improving port facilities to help people make money.

""When an area is so heavily influenced by drugs, we cannot count on a few campaigns to clean it all away. Economic development and awareness campaigns are the ultimate solutions,"" said Li.","Sun, 25 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['boshe', 'narcotics', 'chinas', 'work', 'li', 'production', 'villagers', 'village', 'meth', 'cleaning', 'drugs', 'way', 'trade', 'feature', 'xinhua']",

Some people prefer to spend rainy days in the comfort of their home, but your options are not just limited to being cooped up all day. In this roundup, we show that Beijing is just as exciting in the rain as it is on a sunny day. Whether you prefer to stay home, embrace the damp, or find a balance in between, a little water never hurt anyone, no much your new shoes might disagree.

Get cultured

Beijing is blessed with an abundance of museums and art spaces that are just waiting to be explored. Museums like the National Museum of China, the National Art Museum of China or the Capital Museum have extensive collections and are also free. Also make sure to visit the many galleries situated in Beijing’s 798 Art District. Renowned galleries such as the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA) and Pace Gallery are both located there. With Beijing’s best galleries clustered in one location, it's highly likely that you'll run out of time before you run out of things to see.

Shopping

The mall is a safe haven when it’s pouring cats and dogs outside. Beijing’s largest malls such as Wangfucing’s APM, Chaoyang Park’s Solana, or Sanlitun’s Taikooli have all the stores a shopaholic could ever hope to find. Retail giants such as Zara, H&M, Bershka, and Under Armour, to name a few, have branches in all the malls mentioned above. If you’re looking for more high-end shops, venture to Guomao’s China World Shopping Mall (there's a skating rink here, too) or Sanlitun’s Taikooli North. Beijing’s best malls also have plenty of dining options; just because it's raining doesn't mean you have to order in.

Cinema

Sometimes there’s nothing better than disappearing into the cinema for an hour or two. As China continues to expand imports from Hollywood, the movie scene in Beijing is better than it’s ever been. A surge in the number of moviegoers means better cinema amenities and quality. Catch the latest local or Hollywood movies at Beijing’s top cinemas such as Megabox or UME. For a unique movie-going experience, visit Cinker Pictures in Sanlitun, where you can grab movie-inspired cocktails and dinner while enjoying art house or foreign films on their silver screen. Another option is Pop-Up Beijing’s weekly movie screenings of old Hollywood movies.

Restaurants

Rainy days tend to be a little chillier, and we all know what chilly weather means: comfort food. Lucky for us Beijingers who can’t be bothered to whip up a meal ourselves, there is tons of comfort food scattered around the city. If you’ve got a hankering for Chinese food, we suggest hotpot. Places such as Xiaoyun Lu’s Celadon Hotpot or one of Xiangcao Xiangcao Yunnan Hotpot’s branches serve satisfying hotpot that’s guaranteed to leave you scrambling for a nap after the meal.

If you want Western comfort food, we suggest visiting the newly opened F Bistronome at China World Mall. The restaurant serves heartwarming French cuisine and its breathtaking venue will let you watch the rain come down on parts of Beijing’s CBD area, including the CCTV tower and the Third Ring Road. Another option is to enjoy a pan of paella with a side of Spanish wine at Saffron in the Lama Temple area. Saffron has an indoor rooftop area with large windows, so you can enjoy your meal with a full view of the rain, without getting wet.

Cafés

If you’ve got some work assignments that need to be done, but need to get a reason to get yourself up and out of bed, consider spending the day in one of Beijing’s many quaint cafes. Changing locations can be refreshing and may help motivate you to finish whatever is next on your to do list.

There are a lot of charming yet lesser-known cafes across the city that even the most experienced Beijinger probably hasn’t heard of. For instance, Jiaodaokou’s Metal Hands serves quality hand-drip coffee with their comforting wooden interiors. If you want something to snack on while working, pick a café with a dessert selection. TiensTiens in Gongti Beilu has a fantastic assortment of cakes and pastries, as well as beverages. The spot is also very charming with lots of natural light. Other cafes worth checking out include Théatre Tea in China World Financial Centre or Wudaokou’s The Bridge.

Exercise

Refuse to let rainy days get in the way of your fitness routine? Fear not, we’ve got your back. Instead of taking an off day, why not try these exercise classes that will definitely turn a lazy day into a productive one. F45 Studio in Shangdu Soho offers 45-minute classes focusing on intense HIIT, circuit and functional trainings. At RMB 99 per class, you are definitely getting your money’s worth. Alternatively, women can consider going to female-only gym Ms. Uptown for yoga, pilates, and dance classes. Don't worry guys, there are lots of options for you to choose from too: If you’re looking to burn some cardio, try taking a cycling class at Space Cycle or GuCycle. Both gyms have a DJ on deck to pump you up during workouts.

Spa Day

Shield yourself from the rain and pamper yourself instead. Whether you need a spa, facial or just a massage, these places are just some of Beijing’s most relaxing places. The Opposite House’s Kocoon offers sleek designs with natural lights and greenery, as well as a complete list of treatments, waxing, and meditation workshops. The Westin’s Heavenly Spa is also a favorite for its service and professionalism. If you want a more out-of-the-box experience, consider going to Xindong Lu’s Premedion for their beer spa. You can sip on a glass of beer whilst bathing in beer.

Another cool alternative to the usual beauty treatment is Awa Health’s sensory deprivation tanks. Salt floating therapy is believed to relieve joint pain, cure certain illnesses such as insomnia, and also help get you into a meditative state.

Don't mind getting soaked? Embrace the rain.

If getting wet is not a problem for you, why not embrace the rain? One of the things you can do is turn a rainy day into a photography day. Take snapshots of the city’s moody skyline imbued in rolling clouds or visit Beijing’s artifacts and capture a unique perspective of the city drenched in rain.

Not a big fan of photography? Why not channel your inner child and play in the rain instead? You can visit famous parks such as Taiyangong Park, Iris River Park, Chaoyang Park, or Fragrant Hills Park. These parks are guaranteed to be emptier on rainy days, so you get to reenact Gene Kelly’s Singin’ in the Rain scene shamelessly.

Andrew Snelling was awarded a PhD by the University of Sydney in 1982 and is the director of research at Answers in Genesis, a Christian science group that believes in the literal interpretation of the Bible.

On Friday, News Corp reported that Snelling’s Grand Canyon research project had been approved after he agreed to drop a lawsuit against the national park’s administrators.

Snelling had sued the US Department of the Interior in May alleging religious discrimination after his proposal to remove 50 to 60 “fist-sized” rock samples had initially been rejected for lacking scientific merit.



His lawyers argued the park violated a recent Donald Trump executive order expanding religious freedom, while Snelling told the Australian that the administrators “turned me down because­ they didn’t like the question I was asking”.

However, Dr Gilles Brocard, a postdoctoral research fellow in geology at the University of Sydney, said the scientific evidence was incompatible with Snelling’s hypothesis.

“We know what the impact of extremely large floods on Earth are,” he said. “We know they happen sometimes, we have glaciers that have big ice dams that have a very distinct signature on the landscape. It produces extremely special features that you’re able to identify.

“These are just normal rocks, they are mundane. They do not show traces of catastrophe.”

Brocard said nuclear dating had found rocks in the Grand Canyon that were 2bn years old, and that the age of the Earth was between 4.45bn or 4.47bn years old.

“All the methods are concurrent, there are no contradictions. The only contradictions have been in the age of the canyon itself. Twenty years ago, people had the view that it formed around 20 million years ago, but more recently they think it may have formed in the past 5 million.



“But this is a debate that is completely distinct from [Snelling’s] debate, which is to say it formed in the past 20,000 years.”

As an organisation, Answers in Genesis believes the Bible’s story of creation is historical and not a myth, and have constructed a replica Noah’s Ark in Williamstown, Kentucky.

Brocard said he could not comment on the full value of Snelling’s study until he released more details, but that the possibility of a great flood had been discussed before.

“Until the 19th century there was a debate on whether the great flood occurred. I did my PhD in the Alps, and in the 19th century they discovered all these big erratic boulders. Geologists asked if they were the result of a great flood, but they soon realised they were the result of glaciers.”

“From what I understand [Snelling] is trying to show that these rocks didn’t form slowly over geographical times, but that they formed very quickly. I suppose he wants to show that the rocks formed over the past 10,000 years, with some kind of deluge.”



Snelling told the Australian that he would make the results of his study public, and that “even if I don’t find the evidence I think I will find, it wouldn’t assault my core beliefs”.

“The Australian Aborigines have stories about a great flood. You find similar stories in China. It’s all circumstantial but … I believe the Bible is a record given to us by God and what I read in the Bible really ­occurred.”

Snelling and Answers in Genesis have been approached for comment.

88,88,FL-2017-000075-CHN,South Korea's Moon Jae-in Is Meeting with Donald Trump. Here Are 5 Things to Know - TIME,https://time.com/4839458/moon-jae-in-south-korea-donald-trump/,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in is making his first visit to the U.S. as president this week, and is due to sit down with President Donald Trump on Friday. While the visit won’t be as palpably awkward as Angela Merkel’s, things will be tense — and not just because of Trump. Moon brings plenty of his own baggage to the proceedings. Here’s what you need to know:

1. Moon is a break from the past…

Moon assumed office a little over a month ago, and represents the progressive wing of South Korean politics. His election victory was a repudiation of conservative President Park Geun-hye, who ended her tenure with a four percent approval rating and was impeached over allegations she abused her authority and allowed a close friend to extort money from Korea’s business conglomerates, the chaebols. South Korean business and political elites run in the same circles, and patronage is baked into the political system. Each of the last four presidents—or their close relatives—have been engulfed in corruption scandals. People want that to change, and much of Moon’s appeal flows from the perception that he is a “clean” politician. That’s partially reflected in his popularity, currently hovering around 80 percent.

Moon also brings change to his country’s foreign policy. South Korea has been governed by a string of pro-U.S. presidents, most of whom have shared Washington’s hardline attitude toward Pyongyang. Moon seeks to change tack, even as the rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang heats up.

2. …who wants to bring North Korea in from the cold

How? By sticking to the basics of South Korea’s “sunshine policy”, Seoul’s on-again, off-again plan since the 1980s to thaw relations with North Korea via constructive engagement. This is no progressive, elitist policy proposal, either; nearly 77 percent of South Koreans believe Seoul should restore dialogue with Pyongyang to help “resolve” North Korea’s nuclear program. Moon has gone further, floating the prospect of economic cooperation with Pyongyang as a way of raising living standards for North Koreans and defraying the costs of potential reunification down the road. In a 2013 paper, RAND estimated that reunification between north and south could cost about $2 trillion—$500 billion for military operations, another $500 billion for damages, and $1 trillion for building the North’s economy. Just think: Germany’s reunification in 1990 cost West Germany approximately $1.9 trillion—and East Germany was lightyears ahead of where North Korea is right now.

3. But his country is caught between China and the U.S.

The world’s two great geopolitical powers are at odds with how to deal with North Korea. The U.S. is unsurprisingly concerned that an openly hostile regime is developing the capacity to strike the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon. Short of that, the U.S. has multiple defense treaties that require it to come to its allies’ defense.

Beijing, meanwhile, is more worried about a North Korean regime implosion. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s trade and most of its food and energy supplies. But a collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime would flood China with distressed North Korean refugees. The International Rescue Committee believes between 30,000 to 60,000 North Korean refugees already live in China; if North Korea goes under (population 25 million), China would face millions more.

Moon knows that all these points give the U.S. and China a compelling interest in his approach to the North. Not to mention it’s in a tough neighborhood; 11 of the 15 largest militaries in the world are in or adjacent to Asia. China, India, Pakistan, Russia, and North Korea all have nuclear weapons.

4. Then there’s the trouble with THAAD

Adding pressure to Moon’s relationship with Trump is the current row over installation in South Korea of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and long-range missiles. The THAAD deal was originally negotiated by the Park administration, and two of the six missile launch platforms that normally comprise each THAAD battery have already been installed. The other four are being delayed until an environmental study is done, however, and Moon has been ambiguous on the program’s future. The THAAD deployment provides the U.S. additional force projection and security for its 28,500 troops stationed in the country. At the moment, 55 percent of South Koreans say they support the THAAD installations.

China opposes THAAD, because it fears that Washington will use it to reduce China’s military leverage by working with South Korea and Japan to build out what might become a broader and more comprehensive missile defense system. It’s also worried that the radar system employed by THAAD could theoretically be used to track Chinese missile launches (though the U.S. stresses that THAAD is not designed or even necessarily capable of serving that purpose), which is a serious security concern for Beijing.

China has responded by imposing economic restrictions on South Korean firms that have forced some to shutter operations in China; Hyundai for example is expecting a 65 percent drop in its China sales for the month of May. China is also restricting tourism to South Korea; more than half of all tourists to South Korea are from China. If China maintains the travel ban, as much as 20 percent of South Korea’s GDP growth could be knocked off according to Credit Suisse.

5. All of which adds up to a tricky balancing act for Moon

South Korea is in a uniquely difficult position. It can’t afford to keep China, its largest trading partner, at arm’s length. The value of its exports to China are more than double those headed to the US. For a country where exports account for 46 percent of GDP, that’s not something you take lightly. China has threatened more economic repercussions if THAAD installations continue.

Neither can it risk relations with the U.S. More than anyone else, South Korea is existentially threatened by Pyongyang; North Korea has conventional artillery trained on Seoul with enough firepower to seriously damage the city (just 35 miles away) in mere hours. While THAAD doesn’t help guard against this type of shelling, Moon knows the presence of the U.S. military in his country is a major deterrent that goes beyond the number of troops stationed there or artillery deployed.

Each ally tries to thread the needle with Trump as best it can. It’s just much harder for South Korea than for anyone else.

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's next generation bullet train, ""Fuxing,"" ran for the first time on the Beijing-Shanghai line on Monday.

CR400AF departed Beijing South Station at 11:05 a.m. for Shanghai, while, at exactly the same time, CR400BF left Shanghai Hongqiao Station bound for Beijing.

Beijing-Shanghai line is China's busiest route, used by more than half a million passengers each day.

The new bullet trains -- electric multiple units (EMU) -- can hit 400 kilometers an hour and maintain a constant speed of 350 kilometers an hour.

The train includes a monitoring system that automatically slows the train in case of emergency or abnormal conditions. Telemetry allows a control center to monitor the train in real time.

""Fuxing"" (rejuvenation) in a substantial upgrade on ""Hexiehao"" (harmony). ""Fuxing"" is more spacious and energy-efficient, with a longer life expectancy and better reliability.

""The train was entirely designed and manufactured in China. We hold the complete intellectual property rights,"" said Lu Dongfu, general manager of China Railway Corp., operator of the new train.

China began working on EMU trains in 2012 and in 2015, the first EMU hit 385 km per hour. In July 2016, two EMU trains travelling at 420 km per hour passed each other in opposite directions on parallel tracks.

""High-speed train technology has become wholly indigenous,"" said He Huawu, chief engineer of China Railway Corp.

China has the world's longest high-speed rail network, 22,000 kilometers at the end of last year, about 60 percent of the world's total. Chinese bullet trains have been bought by Indonesia, Russia, Iran and India.

He Huawu said ""Fuxing"" will be China's prime high-speed exports in the future. The model can be adapted to various geological and operational situations, including extreme climate, a core competitive strength in the global market.

A high-speed link between Indonesian capital Jakarta and nearby Bandung was the first full-package overseas deal for China's high-speed trains, using Chinese technical standards, surveys, design, construction, equipment and personnel training.

Chinese companies are now actively seeking deals in Malaysia and Singapore, Mongolia, the United Kingdom, the United States and across Africa.

China will soon test driverless trains on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou line and carry out more further experiments on maglev trains, He added.

YINCHUAN/URUMQI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Muslims in China are joining communities across the world to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

Festivities started Sunday in the provinces of Qinghai and Gansu. Other regions with a large Muslim presence celebrated it on Monday.

In Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, home to two million Muslims, employees were given a three-day holiday on top of the weekend.

People packed early morning prayers.

""Eid al-Fitr is the most important festival for Muslims,"" said Qian Shangli, 76, who has lived in Ningxia for nearly half a century.

A devout Muslim, Qian said he has severe knee pain, but he did not let that stop him from attending mosque.

""I can't kneel to pray but the important thing is I am here,"" he said. ""Peace and harmony are the key messages of Eid.""

In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where more than half of its 23-million population are Muslim, Monday was also a public holiday.

In the city of Aksu in western Xinjiang, hundreds of Muslims gather at Reyset Jama Mosque early in the morning.

The mosque has only been open since late May. It features a large prayer hall, about the size of two tennis courts, and a 100-space parking lot.

""The prayer area has tripled. It is clean and has blankets, heaters and lamps,"" said Abliz Barat, 70, who was comparing it with the mosque he usually went to.

Large crowds were at mosques in Qinghai Province to mark Eid al-Fitr a day earlier.

On Sunday alone, about 110,000 people visited Dongguan Mosque in the provincial capital of Xining, said Ma Yun, director of the mosque management committee.

""We prayed for a peaceful world, a thriving nation, and family well-being,"" he said.

Visiting relatives and friends is another big tradition.

Highway toll fees in some regions are waived for private vehicles during the holiday. Like during Spring Festival, many urban residents return to their rural homes to be with their relatives.

Ma Heimai flew all the way from Malaysia to visit Hualong Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai, his hometown. He opened a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur to sell his hometown's specialty -- lamian, a traditional hand-pulled beef noodles.

In Xinjiang, Abliz Barat told Xinhua that he would take a five-day break for Eid to visit relatives or welcome them to his home.

""I have prepared cash gifts for my grandchildren, and will slaughter a goat for a feast,"" he said.

Lamb farmer Turgun Abduwahit was happy with the recent bout of brisk business. He said he had sold more than 100 goats, which would be slaughtered and sit pride of place on a family's banqueting table.

He often invites Han Chinese to his house to enjoy the family celebration.

Yang Heping, who brought gifts to Abduwahit family this year, said he usually celebrated festivals like Eid al-Fitr with his Muslim friends, and invites them round for Lunar New Year.","Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['mosque', 'chinese', 'eid', 'celebrate', 'xinjiang', 'qinghai', 'muslim', 'focus', 'millions', 'family', 'autonomous', 'muslims', 'china', 'alfitr', 'xinhua']",

96,96,FL-2017-000075-CHN,Sikkim standoff: Strategic importance of Siliguri corridor and why India should be wary of China - Firstpost,http://www.firstpost.com/india/sikkim-standoff-strategic-importance-of-siliguri-corridor-and-why-india-should-be-wary-of-china-3785967.html,"As the Indian and Chinese armies face-off over the construction of a road on Bhutanese land, this piece examines the strategic importance of the disputed territory.

As a country, India is shaped rather oddly. It has a giant peninsula to the south, has a dog-head shaped state to the west and large, disputed borders in the north. And then there is the east. Or more particularly, the North East.

While the rest of India can be seen as one big landmass, the North East is trickier. The presence of Bangladesh means that the North East is connected with the mainland by a particularly thin piece of land called the Siliguri corridor. This narrow strip — which slims down to 17 kilometres at its narrowest — is also known by a more appropriate name: Chicken's Neck.

The corridor is extremely important for India because it runs its rail and road networks towards the North East through it. This allows it to sustain the armed forces posted in the North East which will form an important piece of the puzzle should a conflict arise between India and China in the region. If, however, China is able to block off the corridor (and break the Chicken's Neck, so to speak), this will isolate the North East and will cut off the supplies and reinforcements reaching that area. There is no sea route as the North East is completely land-locked. Limited provisions can reach the region if India uses only aeroplanes.

It is in this context that the stand-off at Doka La becomes important. Doka La is a pass in the middle of the Doklam plateau, which is very close to the tri-junction border of India, Bhutan and China. In June 2017, India accused China of constructing a road in the disputed territory on the Doklam plateau. This road would link the Chinese territory of Yadong to Doklam and would allow China to transport troops and munitions practically at India's doorstep with great ease.

To be clear, the dispute on the territory is not between India and China but between Bhutan and China as it falls within Bhutan's borders. Indeed, China has already brushed aside the Royal Bhutan Army which had sought to prevent the construction. However, because of the disputed territory's proximity to the Siliguri corridor, India has become involved in the dispute.

Post India's opposition, China asked India to remove two bunkers which were set up at Lalten in the plateau. These bunkers were later destroyed by China on 6 June after which China claimed ownership over the region.

The geo-political importance of China's presence in the disputed territory

China wants to get as close to the Siliguri corridor as it can because then it gets the option of cutting off the North East from the rest of India. This means the armed forces stationed in the North East will stop getting provisions and reinforcements requiring a complete rethink of India's military strategy. It also allows for conflict to rise in the North East as it gets away from India's direct administration. This gives China two-fold benefit as India's north-eastern troops fall in disarray and India's gets another headache of maintaining order in the North East.

China's presence in the area also gives it possible access to important Indian infrastructure. A hydro-electric project is located at Jaldhaka river at Jhalong, close to the border. The project is also a bridge for crossing over to Bhutan.

China's water power

China itself has been busy building infrastructure close to the border including dams which establish its rights over the waters of the biggest river in the region, the Brahmaputra. In 2015, it started a large hydropower project in the form of the Zangmu dam on the river.

China's damming of the river can turn water into a weapon should conflict arise as it can either turn off the water supply or flood the lower riparian States, the first one of which is India.

Further, Chinese actions affect not only India but also Bangladesh which is the lower riparian State in the picture. Any arrangement with regards the Brahmputra must then be a trans-national one, a fact which India can use to its advantage if it can get Bangladesh in its corner.

China's dams will also adversely affect the livelihoods of people who are depending on the Brahmputra for small-scale fishing and subsistence agriculture. There is also the problem of the ecosystem being affected which will have an impact on fishing in the entire South East Asia where fish is a major source of food.

The need to protect Bhutan

Even apart from the strategic importance, Bhutan is one of India's closest allies and India virtually serves as a security guarantor to the hill kingdom through the 2007 Friendship Treaty. So when China infringes on Bhutanese territory like it did in the present case, it also tests India's resolve to stand by its ally. If India does not step in, it shows Bhutan that it cannot rely on it's long-term friend and might tempt it to establish better relations with China. It would also weaken India's reputation in the eyes of its other allies which will see it as a fair-weather friend who will not step up in times of need.

India's advantage

All is not dire for India, as explained by SK Gurung in The Economic Times explains. China is proceeding through a very narrow strip of land as it stretches its military presence towards India, it leaves itself very vulnerable to artillery shelling and air attacks from either Sikkim or Bhutan. Thus if it blocks the Siliguri corridor, India could attack the Chinese troops concentrated in that area and force open the corridor again.

Gurung quotes an armed forces officer as saying, “On both sides of Yadong and Doklam is India and Bhutan. If Indian aerial and artillery assaults are carried effectively on the Chinese supply lines easily identified in Chumbi valley stretched in a linear North-South direction, it would reduce PLA’s capabilities to fight.”

China has many reasons not to get into a military conflict

China's global ambitions mean that it needs to maintain a certain image. It can then hardly get into conflicts with its neighbours as it needs to be seen as a responsible power to the world. It has increasingly sought to dominate economically and not necessarily through military might. Further the India-China trade cooperation means that any military conflict will lead to massive loss of revenue to them.

Still, the fact that China is ready to face-off with India over border issues on a regular basis is a cause for concern for India. It requires the dedication of constant resources at the border flash points and stops it from concentrating on developing infrastructure which would provide for more long-term security. India needs to arrive at a long-term solution to the China problem so that it can move on to devoting more of its budget and resources to resolving internal issues like education, and law and order.

A massive increase in hydropower from a series of planned Amazon dams could harm the world’s most important rainforest all the way from the slopes of the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean.

Altogether, 428 dams are being built or are under consideration along the network of rivers that drain – and nourish – 6 million square kilometres of forest spanning nine countries. Of these, around 140 are already finished or under construction.

The Amazon is home to four of the world’s 10 largest rivers. Of the 34 largest tropical rivers, 20 are in the Amazon region, and these rivers are the source of one fifth of the planet’s fresh water.

That same flow delivers the nutrient-rich sediments to habitats downstream to support the teeming life of the region, including the canopy that shelters its shrubs, plants, insects, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds.

“ People say: ‘Oh another dam, another river.’ It’s not. It’s the Amazon. We have to put the risks on the table and change the way people are looking at the problem. Edgardo Latrubesse, geographer, University of Texas at Austin

Widespread benefits

Those rivers exchange sediments and nourish a mosaic of wetlands, said Edgardo Latrubesse, a geographer at the University of Texas at Austin, who led a collaboration from 10 universities to assess the potential environmental damage, and report in the journal Nature.

“People say: ‘Oh another dam, another river.’ It’s not. It’s the Amazon,” Professor Latrubesse said. “We have to put the risks on the table and change the way people are looking at the problem. We are massively destroying our natural resources, and time urges us to find some rational alternatives for preservation and sustainable development.”

Dams conserve water, deliver irrigation in the dry season, reduce the threat of flooding and of course provide energy for hydropower. On the other hand, they impose an environmental cost: sediments vital downstream are trapped upriver and the floods they might prevent are an integral part of the forest’s long-term stability.

So dams come at a price not normally measured in economic cost-benefit analyses, but they can change a river system and damage an economy all the same.

The researchers first devised what they called a Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index, assessing the vulnerability to land use change, erosion, run-off pollution, trapped sediment and other changes to river systems, to test the real value of the 140 dams already happening and the ones still under consideration.

Many of the dams are in areas that yield heavy loads of sediment: the Andean Cordillera, for instance, provides more than 90 per cent of the silt to the entire river system. The Marañon and Ucayali rivers are or will be home to 104 and 47 dams respectively.

Up to 80 per cent of the area upstream of the lowest-planned dam will be vulnerable: dams will change river dynamics, to alter the pattern of creation of oxbow lakes and floodplain sediment storage, putting thousands of species at risk.

The Madeira River drains waters rich in sediments from Bolivia and Peru and has the most diverse fish population. Two huge dams have already led to a 20% fall in sediment concentration in the Madeira, and 25 dams are planned further upstream.

Indivisible

“The Amazon is the most important river basin on the planet. It’s a microcosm of our issues of today involving environment, energy and health of the planet,” said Victor Baker, a hydrologist at the University of Arizona, and one of the authors.

“The river and its individual pieces cannot be separated out. That an individual dam assessment can be separated from the rest of the system isn’t scientifically valid.”

And collectively, the authors close their study with a warning: “Citizens of the Amazon Basin countries will ultimately have to decide whether hydropower generation is worth the price of causing profound damage to the most diverse and productive river system in the world.

“If those decisions are made within the context of a comprehensive understanding of the fluvial system as a whole, the many benefits the rivers provide to humans and the environment could be retained.”

The ongoing standoff at the Sikkim sector of the India-China border between troops of the two countries has brought the “Sino-British Treaty, 1890” into focus.

Here’s what the treaty is all about and why China is raking it up now.

Officially called the Convention Between Great Britain and China Relating to Sikkim and Tibet, the treaty was signed in Calcutta on March 17, 1890. The Convention, according to Beijing, settles the border between the two regions. But India maintains that the borders in Doklam, the area in question, are yet to be settled.

Article I of the Convention talks about the boundary of Sikkim and Tibet in physical detail. “The boundary of Sikkim and Tibet shall be the crest of the mountain range separating the waters flowing into the Sikkim Teesta and its affluents from the waters flowing into the Tibetan Mochu and northwards into other rivers of Tibet. The line commences at Mount Gipmochi, on the Bhutan frontier, and follows the above-mentioned water-parting to the point where it meets Nepal territory,” the Article states.

The standoff

The current round of tensions was triggered by the China's bid to construct a road in the Doklam area, which falls in the tri-junction of India, China and Bhutan. New Delhi says that a road there will threaten its national security.

Analysts say that if built, the road will provide China further access to the Chumbi Valley, adding to the vulnerability of the “Chicken’s Neck”, a narrow corridor that links the Northeast with the rest of India.

What is India’s stand?

India has expressed deep concern at the Chinese actions at the Doko La (Doklam) tri-junction. “…Conveyed to the Chinese Government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India,” said a government statement on June 30, 2017 in its first reaction since the tensions at the tri-junction were made public a week earlier. The war of words also saw Chinese anger towards Bhutan.

What is Beijing’s stand?

China stresses that the Sikkim section of the China-India boundary was defined by the 1890 treaty. China has accused India of “betrayal” of the treaty, a colonial era understanding of the boundary alignment relating to Tibet and Sikkim. Beijing, on July 3, 2017, cited letters between Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai that “had explicitly recognised many times that the (1890) Convention has defined the boundary between Xi Zang (Tibet) of China and Sikkim”.

According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in his letters to Zhou on March 22, 1959 and again on September 26, 1959, Nehru acknowledged that the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet “was defined by the 1890 Convention and demarcated by the two sides on the ground in 1895” and that “there’s no dispute over the boundary between Sikkim and Xi Zang, China”.

“Current actions by the Indian side undoubtedly run counter to the Indian government's longstanding position,” the spokesperson said.

What did Nehru say in the letter?

Nehru’s September 26, 1959 letter to Zhou, cited by China, was a point-by-point refutation of the claims made by the latter on September 8, 1959. Contrary to the claim that the letter was an overwhelming endorsement of the 1890 treaty on the Sikkim-Tibet border, Nehru takes objection to Zhou’s statement that the boundaries of Sikkim and Bhutan did not fall within the scope of the discussion. Nehru explicitly states in the letter that the 1890 treaty defined only the northern part of the Sikkim-Tibet border and not the tri-junction area that brings Bhutan into play. India’s first Prime Minister goes on to state that “rectification of errors in Chinese maps regarding the boundary of Bhutan with Tibet is therefore a matter which has to be discussed along with the boundary of India with the Tibet region of China in the same sector.”

Then only Nehru makes the statement that China now latches on to, out of context. He says: “This Convention of 1890 also defined the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet; and the boundary was later, in 1895, demarcated. There is thus no dispute regarding the boundary of Sikkim with the Tibet region”.

Nehru concludes his letter with regret and shock while invoking the 1954 Panchsheel Agreement. “India was one of the first countries to extend recognition to the People's Republic of China and for the last ten years we have consistently sought to maintain and strengthen our friendship with your country. When our two countries signed the 1954 Agreement in regard to the Tibet region I hoped that the main problems which history had bequeathed to us in the relations between India and China had been peacefully and finally settled,” he states.

Why is China angry with Bhutan?

In the current standoff, Bhutan has rebuffed China by refuting the latter’s contention that it (China) was constructing a road at the India-China-Bhutan tri-junction in an “indisputable” part of Chinese territory. Thimphu had said it had conveyed to the Chinese government that this was not the case.

According to an explanation published in The Hindu on ‘Why Bhutan is special to India’, “Under the 2007 India-Bhutan Friendship Treaty, the two sides have agreed to ‘cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither Government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other.’

“Under a previous treaty, India was to ‘guide’ Bhutan on foreign and defence policies. The language of the 2007 treaty is meant to respect the sensitivities of Bhutan regarding its sovereignty. But the reality is that the Indian military is virtually responsible for protecting Bhutan from the kind of external threat that the Chinese military poses.”","Tue, 04 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article19210138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sikkimjpg,"['sinobritish', 'border', 'issue', 'india', 'final', 'chinese', '1890', 'word', 'tibet', 'boundary', 'trijunction', 'nehru', 'bhutan', 'sikkim', 'really', 'china', 'accept', 'treaty']",

Bike-sharing start-up Ofo faces competition in China from 30 other players

The two firms - and several much smaller players - also face tighter regulation in Chinese cities after residents complained about the accumulation of millions of rentable two-wheelers on the city streets.

Chinese state media reported late Wednesday that from October 1, firms will be forced to hire at least one maintenance worker for every 200 bicycles.

Market flooded

The Xinhua news agency said more than 30 operators had deployed more than 10 million branded bikes over the past year alone, and that many of them were badly maintained or parked haphazardly.

Ofo's new financial round follows a similar new $600 million investment to Mobike last month, its largest to date.

The Beijing-headquartered firm says it currently ""has connected over 6.5 million bikes to riders in 150 cities across five countries, generating more than 25 million transactions daily.""

In April, Ofo said the firm was valued at upwards of $2 billion.
