1,1,FL-2015-000068-BGD,From Drought to Flood-The Sudden Exchange of One Hazard for Another in Texas - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/corelogic/2015/06/11/371525.htm,"This post is part of a series sponsored by CoreLogic.

Amongst Texans, nearly every conversation about weather over the last several years has focused on the ongoing drought that has resulted in water supply shortages and mandatory restrictions of water use, severe wildfire conditions, as well as a considerable reduction in recreational lake activities and what were once “waterfront properties”.

But suddenly, the problem is not a lack of water, but too much water. Record amounts of precipitation have fallen in parts of eastern and central Texas, with forecasts indicating there is more on the way.1 The result? Severe and devastating flooding that has ravaged both urban and rural homes as well as businesses, automobiles, and infrastructure.

Flooding is one of the main causes of property damage in Texas. Approximately 12% of the state’s land area is susceptible to flooding, which makes it the top state for total flood prone area.2 Weather patterns that produce severe precipitation events combined with terrain that is conducive to overland flow of water has resulted in central Texas being one of the most flash-flood prone areas in the United States.3

Unfortunately, one of the most common refrains heard during and after a severe flooding event is that some homeowners were not insured for flood damage.5

CoreLogic analyzed nearly 3,500 flood events in Texas that occurred between 1950 and 2012 and determined that 88.7% possessed a flash-flood component. Although these flood events were distributed throughout the state, it is clear that flash-flooding does not occur randomly, and in fact occurs more frequently in the central part of the state; in areas commonly referred to as Flash Flood Alley (Map 1).

One common method of evaluating flood-induced property damage is by reviewing the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid losses. In fact, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):

The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid losses for flooding in Texas from January, 1978 through March of 2015 totaling nearly $5.6 billion, which places Texas third on the list of states with NFIP payouts. 4

Geographically, the region in Texas with the worst flood losses is located along the coast, centered on Galveston and Harris counties (Map 2).

Galveston and Harris combine to claim 68.6% of the total NFIP losses in Texas over the course of the last 37 years, based on both coastal and inland flooding.4

Inland flooding contributed significantly to the state total, with Travis, Comal, and Guadalupe counties having high flood losses.

Texas has approximately 8 million structures located in a floodplain and nearly 3 million of those structures are not insured for flood damage.6

In 2015, the state of Texas set a new record for the amount of rainfall in the month of May—7.54 inches—with some areas receiving 10 or more inches over the span of just a couple days.1 Due to the intense precipitation and resulting flooding, more than 4,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by the raging water.7 Early estimates indicate that flood damage to insured automobiles may exceed a quarter of a billion dollars in Texas.8 When the rains cease and the waters recede, the total number of properties impacted by this flooding may be even greater. It has never been more important to be aware of the flood risk on your property and to be prepared for future flood events.

Our Bogra correspondent reports that some 20,000 residents of at least 15 villages of Shariakandi upazila have been marooned after an under-construction eight-kilometre embankment collapsed in Haorakhali village yesterday afternoon giving way to the Jamuna.

Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) sources say water has been flowing well above the danger mark, seeping into neighbouring upazilas and threatening another 20,000 villagers.

The Tk 20-crore embankment project, from Dhalirkandi of Shariakandi union and Daripara of Kamalpur union, was initiated after a flood control dam collapsed flooding six upazilas last year.

The agriculture office is yet to estimate damage to crops while the upazila nirbahi officer hopes the situation would be normalised since the embankment's repairs were ongoing.

Our Lalmonirhat correspondent reports that some 50,000 people of 80 villages in five upazilas have been affected with most moving to higher grounds for the rise in the waters of the Teesta and Dharla rivers both upstream and downstream.

Water was flowing close to the danger level at the Teesta barrage point of Hatibandha upazila and at the Kulaghat point of sadar upazila, say BWDB sources.

People have been resorting to dry food while apprehending a shortage of fodder.

Our Nilphamari correspondent reports that at least 5,000 people of 14 villages in Dimla and Jaldhaka upazilas have become marooned since the Teesta started swelling with the water passing close to the danger mark at Dalia point near the Teesta barrage.

Most houses have gone under two to three feet of water while people are suffering from a lack of dry food and drinking water.

The heavy rains are also threatening parts of an embankment at Bhaban Chur and Gopal Jhar points in Jaldhaka upazila.

The affected villages are Uttor Kharibari, Kisamoter Char, Baish Pukur, Vendabari, Tapur Char, Kisamat Chhatnai, Chhatunama, Bhabon Chur, Sati Ghat, Jharsingheswar, Gopal Jhar, Holdibari, Chhotokhata and Banpara.

India opened the Gojaldoba barrage while waters in other major rivers like Charal Kata, Deonai, Buri Teesta, Buri Khora, Jamuneswari, Nautara and Panga have also swelled, inundating maize and vegetable fields on an estimated 200 hectares of land.

The upazila nirbahi officer said they were monitoring the situation.","Sat, 13 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/haorakhali_village_1.jpg?itok=do-5xVWb,"['flood', 'waters', 'flash', 'teesta', 'rivers', 'rain', 'water', 'north', 'villages', 'embankment', 'upazila', 'upazilas', 'triggers', 'point', 'reports']",

Skymet Weather Team

Along with Northeast India, Monsoon arrived in some parts of Bangladesh. Conditions are favourable for Monsoon to cover the rest of the country shortly. Heavy rain has lashed parts of Bangladesh, particularly northern half of the country. The satellite imagery also support heavy cloud mass sitting right over Bangladesh. Conditions look conducive for the next couple of days. Rain may become even heavier.

A cyclonic circulation is over Bihar and West Bengal region and is persisting for some time now. This system is responsible for pushing highly humid winds from the Bay of Bengal to Bangladesh. Most parts of the country have been receiving rain of varying intensity due to this reason. Even the capital city has received good amounts of rain in the last 24 hours.

In the last 24 hours from 8:30 am on Wednesday, Sylhet received 222.1 mm of rain, Rangpur (94.6 mm), Mymemsingh (67 mm), Saidpur (58.2 mm), Tangail (45 mm), Rangamati (37 mm), Bogra (39 mm), Feni (35 mm), and Dhaka (13 mm).

Heavy rain in Fatullah has already played spoilsport on the first and the second day of the one-off test match between India and Bangladesh. The chances of play are bleak in the coming days. Bangladesh will continue to receive heavy to very heavy rain for the next 24 hours. If the situation persists for a couple of days, it may lead to water-logging and a flood like situation.

Pope Francis’ much-anticipated encyclical on climate change and the environment was officially released Thursday, with high expectations that it could be a watershed moment in bolstering support for taking international action to solve what he calls in his message, “one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.”

Credit: Catholic Church of England

The text of document, released in several languages, does not appear to differ substantially from the non-final Italian version leaked on Monday. In it, Francis lays out the myriad environmental problems, including global warming, faced by the world today, as well as the moral and religious arguments for combating them.

Francis' aim is to use his, and the Catholic Church’s, authority to try and spread an acceptance of these issues and spur efforts to solve them.

While “the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics,” he wrote, “ . . . I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.”

Here are the four main points that the Pope makes in the 180-page message, including quotes from the text, as well as what the next steps in international efforts might be.

1. We all have a moral (and, for Catholics, a religious) obligation to take care of the Earth and the poorest.

“The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life.

“I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.”

2. Humans are driving the bulk of observed global warming, as well as numerous other environmental problems that pollute the air and water. We must own up to that fact and work to fix the problems we have caused.

“A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it.”

3. The way primarily Western, developed society currently lives is wasteful and unsustainable. Its consequences are disproportionately felt by the poor, developing nations who don’t get the benefits of that way of life.

“We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty.

“Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and their means of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resources which can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and their access to social services and protection is very limited.”

4. If we don’t act now to solve climate change and other environmental ills, we leave a compounding crisis to future generations. The action that we take must come soon and must be real, substantial and a true global effort.

“There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy.”

“A global consensus is essential for confronting the deeper problems, which cannot be resolved by unilateral actions on the part of individual countries.

“But the international community has still not reached adequate agreements about the responsibility for paying the costs of this energy transition.

“The global economic crises have made painfully obvious the detrimental effects of disregarding our common destiny, which cannot exclude those who come after us.”

The Pope’s comments are already being widely discussed and dissected, and are likely to receive further attention during several future events that will be carefully watched. These include upcoming speeches to be made by the Pope to the U.S. Congress and the United Nations, as well as the crucial international climate talks to be held in Paris in December. The primary goal of those talks is to reach a binding international agreement to limit warming below the 2°C (3.6°F) of warming that some scientists say is necessary to prevent the worst outcomes of climate change. (Since the beginning of the 20th century, the world has already warmed by 1.6°F.)

Many climate scientists, commentators and those involved in such negotiations are hopeful that the moral weight of the Pope’s message will provide a push to those efforts.

“I think it is difficult to underestimate the moral authority that the Pope brings to acting on climate with this encyclical,” Michael Mann, a Penn State climate scientist, said in an email. “I suspect we will look back at this moment as a turning point, and we will view Pope Francis as one of the great heroes in modern history.”

Picture: Glyn Thomas: The Abandoned Village of Geamana, Romania, 2014.

The picture was taken by Glyn Thomas, one of 111 finalists in the Atkins CIWEM Environmental Photographer of the Year Exhibition.

The aim of the annual awards is to demonstrate “the dynamic link between environmental and social issues in a way that makes us think differently about the world around us”.

In the case above, up to 400 families were forced to leave Geamana in 1978 as their homes were sacrificed so the entire basin could be flooded with toxic waste from a huge copper mine. That’s the church steeple you can see in the picture, buried by tailings from the mine.

The colourful swirls that surround the steeple when the groundwater rises are a favourite snap for tourists, even though it’s pure pollution.

But with debate firing up about another cyanide-based mine opening nearby, Glyn Thomas’s shot is a stunning reminder of the long-term environmental price we pay for looting the Earth’s resources.

Here’s a selection of more of the thought-provoking images. From June 22, the shortlisted works of outstanding photographic art will go on show at the Royal Geographical Society in London for 18 days. The winners will be announced on June 25.

The cyclone was expected to make landfall later on Friday. Heavy rainfall is expected to hit Muscat, Dhaklyah, South Batinah, Wusta and Dhofar.

No causalities have been reported so far, an official at the Public Authority for Civil Defence and Ambulance (PACDA), told Gulf News.

Many wadis in Sharqiyah flooded, causing traffic jams. The Royal Oman Police (ROP), closed some roads in the area.

“We don’t want road users to venture out and cross them”, an ROP official said.

More than 40 people were rescued due to flooding in Sur, Ras Al Had, Masirah, Ashkarah, Wadi Bani Khalid and Jalan. PACDA hasn’t yet reported any people missing.

Four Emiratis were among those rescued. Three were rescued when their vehicle was swept away by Wadi Bani Khalid on Thursday. Another ten-year-old Emirati boy was rescued while he was swimming in flood water near Wadi Bani Khalid on Friday morning. The official said they are all in a stable condition.

The Ministry of Social Development said that it provides shelters for those families in South and North Sharqiyah affected due to the cyclone.

Many areas in Sur and Masirah flooded, forcing people to move to allocated shelters provided by the Ministry of Social Development. Ministry officials told Gulf News that it provides all food and medical aid for nationals and residents using the shelters.

Some families refused to leave their flooded houses.

Many losses in properties have been reported in those areas but the financial toll hasn’t yet been announced by the Omani authorities.

Power outages have been reported in some areas of South Sharqiyah provinces, lasting for more than seven hours so far due to the storm.

Some electricity poles were knocked down due to the strong winds, while other poles caught fire, a PACDA official said.

Masirah Island received more than 250mm of rainfall. Ras Al Had recorded 55mm, while Sur has recorded 48mm so far, according to the Directorate General of Meteorology.

Omanis have launched a hashtag in Arabic “Salute to the soldiers of Oman”, lauding the efforts of all Royal Armed Forces, PACDA and the Royal Oman Police, for their stupendous efforts in the rescue operations.

23 schools have been allocated as shelters in South and North Sharqiaha governorate, due to the weather conditions.

The Public Authority for Consumer Protection (PACP) issued a statement warning all suppliers and shop owners that it will not tolerate price increases due to the cyclone.

It added that it will intensify its inspections to make sure the price of food is not increased.

Just a third of the 360-square kilometre Wasa service area is covered by storm-water drainage system. The Dhaka master plan area, however, is 1,528 sq km, officials said.

Wasa has a storm-water drainage system master plan for the capital, but its implementation will depend on the availability of funds, they added.

Canals, rivers and water retention areas collect, carry and retain rainwater and are connected with each other as a drainage network. But in recent decades, the city canals have either been grabbed or turned into box culverts for road construction, said Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, an urban planner who worked as a technical expert on Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for Dhaka.

The government had ignored repeated warnings of experts not to allow water retention areas and flood flow zones to be used for housing estates in the DAP, he said.

Open space and water bodies help evaporate a third of the rainwater, percolate another third while leaving the rest to run down to retention areas, Ansar said. But in the absence of those, water gets stuck on the city roads and takes hours to recede even after a light rain.

City dwellers are left to suffer for hours and sometimes days from almost stagnant water filled with filth. Traffic becomes a nightmare with vehicles breaking down in the water.

According to the Flood Action Plan and DAP, the city should have conserved 5,523 acres of water retention area (which is only 1.57 percent of the 1,528sqkm of Dhaka's master plan), 20,093 acres of canals and rivers (5.7 percent) and 74,598 acres (21 percent) flood flow zones.

“Since DAP gazette notification in mid-2010, nearly all of the conservable wetlands have been filled up with silent government approbation,” Ansar said.

He said designated water retention areas on the eastern fringe (like east of Santarkul near the Balu river) have been filled up by private housing developers, in Uttara third phase housing scheme by Rajuk and private developers, and in Mohammadpur by private developers.

In the name of development that was ill-planned and insensitive to the environment, the ponds, ditches, playgrounds, parks, water retention areas, flood flow zones and dozens of canals, which used to work as natural storm-water drainage system connecting the four Dhaka rivers, have been ruined.

Ishrat Islam, professor and head of the urban and regional planning department at Buet, echoed Ansar's view and said rainwater stagnation was increasing due to indiscriminate urbanisation.

She said the artificial storm-water drainage system was not only meagre, it remained clogged with solid wastes reducing its functionality and aggravating the waterlogging situation.

According to Taqsem A Khan, managing director of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), filling up of floodplains, wetlands and most of the 65 canals in Dhaka was the main reason for waterlogging.

Wasa maintains 320km of large-diameter concrete storm-water drains, 10kms of box culverts over canals and 65km of canals for the city's storm-water drainage management. This covers only a third of its area, said Taqsem.

KS Ching, superintendent engineer of Wasa drainage department, said they managed 26 city canals for storm-water drainage but most of those remained clogged with solid wastes of households and commercial establishments.

The areas, where there is no formal storm-water drainage system, have to depend on natural systems like canals and wetlands. Severe stagnation would be inevitable if those canals and low-lying wetlands are filled up, he said.

Wasa in 2012 installed large diameter storm-water drainage lines only in some parts of Gulshan, Dhanmondi, Mirpur Darussalam Road and Uttara.

Wasa superintendent engineer Akhtaruzzaman, who was the project director of the Tk 47-crore scheme for Gulshan, said it was a piecemeal measure and had not ensured complete storm-water drainage.

At present, a rainfall above 40mm in Dhaka would take at least three hours to recede, as the available system is capable of draining water of only 20mm of rainfall without causing too much public suffering, he said.

The city corporation authorities have to ensure that before monsoon their roadside drains are clear, including the water catch pit of storm-water drains, Akhtaruzzaman added.

Sirajul Islam, chief town planner of Dhaka South City Corporation, said the north and the south city corporations maintained over 2,000km feeder drains (open and small diameter pipes) to drain water from homes and rainwater and take them to canals and wide diameter (Wasa) storm sewer system.

Since population density is very high and the drainage capacity poor, rainwater takes hours to recede, he said.","Sat, 20 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/wasa_drainage_infograph.jpg?itok=Cq1cn_Gm,"['areas', 'canals', 'dhaka', 'stormwater', 'twothirds', 'lacks', 'water', 'retention', 'drainage', 'wasa', 'rainwater', 'city', 'system', 'area']",

This year is the 50th anniversary of Singapore’s independence. In the hoopla of this anniversary celebrations, one major item that has taken a back seat is how Singapore managed to improve its water management from that of a below average developing Asian city in 1965, to one of the best in the world, if not the best, within a short span of about two decades. With about 300 leaders of major utilities from all over the world set to meet in Singapore, it is appropriate to look back on what Singapore has achieved, and also look forward to the challenges it is likely to face during the next 25 years.

Singapore does not have a long history of urban water management. In 1857, a philanthropist, Tan Kim Seng, donated S$13,000 ($9673) for the construction of its initial waterworks and a piped water system. The first reservoir was constructed in 1868 and was later expanded in 1891. The expansion was overseen by the city’s municipal engineers, James MacRitchie, and it still bears his name. MacRitchie also proposed that night-soil be collected and disposed of in the sea. Fortunately, tidal conditions meant that proposal was never adopted.

The history of urban water management in Singapore was largely uneventful until 1965 when Singapore became independent and the architect of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, took a special interest in water. Lee decided that water was a strategic, even existential issue for Singapore and thus must receive high priority. This decision was based on two events.

In 1942, the British blew a 70-ft gap in the causeway to slow the Japanese advance. The explosion ruptured the pipe with water from Johor that was under it. Singapore had then only two reservoirs and two weeks supply of water. The Japanese crossed Johore Straits in collapsible boats to take over the city. The vulnerability of Singapore in terms of water made a profound impression on Lee.

The second event occurred in 1965. The then British High Commissioner, Anthony Head, told Lee that the Malaysian Prime Minister had told him: “if Singapore’s foreign policy was prejudicial to Malaysia’s interests they could always bring pressure to bear on them by threatening to turn off the water in Johor.”

These two events shaped Lee’s lifelong view of the strategic importance of water. He immediately asked for an estimate of how much rain fell in Singapore and how much of it could be made potable. He established a unit in his office that assessed all government policies through the lens of water. As he noted “Every policy had to bend to the knees of our water survival.

There is no question that because of Lee’s personal and continuing interest in water, Singapore’s urban water management became the envy of the world. National leaders everywhere tend to become interested in water only when there is a drought, flood, or other natural hazard. The moment the hazard disappears, water vanishes from the political agenda. Lee is a rare leader who was consistently interested in water throughout his entire political career.

Singapore’s improvements were remarkable. Consider floods. In December 1969, floods resulted in five deaths and caused damages of $4.3 million (in 1969 prices). Nearly 6,900 ha, or 12.8 percent of the land, was flood-prone. In the decades since, Singapore has not had a single fatality due to floods, with the exception of a boy who inadvertently stepped into a flooded drain in 2011. Flood-prone areas have been reduced to 34 hectares today. The average flood currently lasts less than 30 minutes.

The last night-soil removal service was phased out only in January 24, 1987. Singapore now has an outstanding system of wastewater collection, treatment, recycling and reuse to produce ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water (NEWater), which has become one of its four sources of water.

Another example is the cleanup of Singapore River and Kallang River Basin. In 1977, as part of his redevelopment initiatives, Lee set a target of 10 years to clean up the polluted river and basin. True to Singapore style, once the political decision was made, the cleanup was completed within the schedule: Among the steps taken, more than 46,000 squatters living in the area and discharging liquid and solid wastes were resettled, while 610 pig farms and 500 ducks farms were phased out. The emptied areas were transformed into housing estates, new towns and industrial parks with tap water and sanitation facilities.

An analysis of the benefits of the cleanup, including a phenomenal increase in commercial activity and land values along the banks, in addition to significant health, social, and environmental benefits, confirm the wisdom and foresight of Singapore’s political leadership. This extraordinary performance was made possible by consistently strong political support form the highest levels of the government and long-term visionary planning.

What is remarkable is the forward-looking approach and timely execution by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore’s water agency. PUB has been consistently underpinned by responsible and proactive political and administrative leadership, and a relentless pursuit of economic growth, contributing to steady improvements in the living standards of society and a perpetual quest for sustainable development. The net result has been a true success story of self-resilience, creation of consistent growth opportunities, and good governance. This is in spite of a scarcity of natural resources, including water.

Challenges

There is no question that PUB has had a remarkable past and present. Its overall performance certainly has been significantly better than any water utility we know of anywhere in the world. The question that arises then, is what about the future?

The future, of course, is not easy to predict. There will be many issues over which the city-state will have no control. Among these are extent of climate change, the availability and prices of energy, advances in science, management and technology, and Singapore’s competitiveness compared to other countries.

For PUB, many of the national decisions will be out of its purview. Among these additional uncertainties will be the future of population growth, the type of economic growth and the nature of industries that the country may emphasize (including their water use and wastewater discharge requirements), and the perceptions, aspirations, and expectations of Singaporeans. These will be decided by the country as a whole. PUB naturally could offer inputs but in the final analysis may have to react to the decisions made.

And Singapore has a number of water-related issues that will require attention.

First, at 150 liters, per capita water consumption in a country that now imports nearly half of its water from Johor is simply too high. The current targets of reducing it to 147 liters by 2020 and to 140 liters by 2030 are too modest. Per capita water consumption in many European cities like Berlin, Barcelona, Hamburg or Munich is lower than Singapore’s 2030 targets. In fact, Hamburg, in 2008, had per capita consumption of 105 liters.

A significant part of the reduction in these European cities has been through water pricing. Singapore’s water pricing has remained unchanged since 2000. In much of the Western world, water prices have been rising at a rate that outstrips inflation. Considering inflation alone, Singapore water prices in 2014 were 25.48 percent lower in real terms compared with 2000.

Yet the median monthly household income for employed households has increased from $4,398 in 2000 to $8,292 in 2014. Assuming a household uses 20 cubic meters of water, their total water cost has fallen from 0.69 percent of income in 2000 to 0.36 percent at present. In contrast, electricity and gas prices in real terms have increased by 3.64 percent and 2.94 percent, respectively. In our view, if water prices were indexed to inflation, per capita water consumption could well have been quite a bit lower than it is at present.

In addition, having kept water prices constant since 2000, it will be socially and politically difficult to increase water prices in the future.

The second challenge relates to energy. The water sector now uses a prodigious amount of energy to pump, treat, recycle, desalinate and produce NEWater. The increase in water self-sufficiency has been made possible by an increased use of energy. Even though energy prices are now lower than they were last year, this may not continue over the long term. Since Singapore lacks both water and energy sources, a public debate on the desirability of improving water security at the cost of increasing energy insecurity is required.

Third, the environmental costs of brine disposal from the increasing number of desalination plants need to be carefully analyzed. While discharges from a few plants are unlikely to be a problem, the rising number of plants could create the kind of headache that the Gulf experiences.

PUB has been an impressively competent organization. It has very successfully dealt with historical water problems. We are optimistic that it will meet the future water challenges of the city-state and its people.

India won the toss, batted superbly to post 462/6 before declaring their innings. Bangladesh, in reply, fell short by 206 runs in the first innings in front of a classy show of spin bowling from Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh.

Ashwin grabbed a five-wicket haul while Harbhajan, in his comeback Test, got three victims. Following on, Bangladesh went unscratched for the fifteen overs.

Catch all the highlights here. (SCORECARD | FIXTURES)

(All times in IST)

4:00 PM: That's it! The teams decide to shake hands after 15 overs into the last session. It was expected with the light fading quickly. That was a long drawn Test match with the rain being the most consistent performer.

3:43 PM: Bangladesh openers have handled the opening burst pretty well.

3:36 PM: Spin and pace from two ends. The light is fading, flood lights are taking over. Kayes and Tamim looking to hang in there.

3:25 PM: (Bangladesh 2nd Innings, Follow on) Cloudy skies, fast bowler charging in, floodlights on - this is Test cricket. Umesh Yadav is steaming in. A few more close-in fielders would be fun.

3:10 PM: That's it! BANGLADESH ALL OUT for 256. Trail by 206 runs and India have enforced the follow-on. 30 overs for Bangladesh to see out, this can actually work for India.

3:00 PM: WICKET! Shahid goes for the big one and easy catch to long on. A third for Harbhajan Singh.

2:50 PM: WICKET! Litton Das falls for 44 as Ashwin gets a five-wicket haul. Turn and bounce from Ashwin and Das couldn't keep it down.

2:46 PM: As the innings has progressed Litton Das has looked better and better - sound defence, decisive footwork and can give the ball a tonk. He's on 44 now, can he get to a fifty on debut?

2:40 PM: DROPPED! Harbhajan could have had his third there. Litton Das gets the inside edge and the ball flies to leg-slip. Rohit Sharma dives, the ball hits his wrist and a chance missed, should have been taken.

2:35 PM: Back after tea. Bangladesh are in a spot of bother even though Litton Das is batting superbly. Ashwin, on the other hand, is bowling an outstanding spell.

Ashwin celebrates his wicket Â© AFP

2:15 PM: WICKET! Partnership broken and it's that man Ashwin again! Just at the stroke of tea, Ashwin sends Shuvagata 'Hom' (9). Lunging forward to a full delivery gets a fine tickle to Rohit Sharma at leg-slip. Bangladesh 219/7, trail by 243 runs.

2:11 PM: That was a fast over from Umesh Yadav, really fast. He didn't get all of them on the correct line but the ones he did hit the bat hard and Litton Das and Hom looked a touch uncomfortable.

2:06 PM: Litton Das is chancing his arm and his chances are coming off. He sweeps Ashwin and then Ashwin goes through his defences but the ball goes through the keeper and the stumps.

1:56 PM: 200 up for Bangladesh. Litton Das is lighting up Fatullah here. Taking Ashwin on - goes straight over long off and then slams him to the mid wicket boundary. The new Bangladesh keeper looks really solid.

1:43 PM: Bangladesh are struggling here. They look lost in front of Harbhajan's guile and Aaron's pace. Litton Das and Hom need to hold on here because they still nee 81 runs to avoid the follow-on.

1:36 PM: BOWLED! Sarkar (37) chops the ball on his stumps. Aaron gets his first wicket. BAN 176/6

1:25 PM: STUMPED! Imrul Kayes (72) dances down the track and is completely foxed by Harbhajan Singh. The Turbanator saw him coming and shortened the length. Easy stumping for Saha. Bangladesh 172/5.

1:10 PM: Varun Aaron with the ball now. Steady over from the Indian pacer as Kayes fights on for Bangladesh.

1:02 PM: Imrul Kayes takes on Harbhajan Singh and punches his through cover point for a delightful boundary. The ball raced off the outfield. Harbhajan Singh makes a good comeback in the over.

12:57 PM: Two FOURs in the over from Ashwin. Soumya Sarkar has had enough - first pulls him past square leg and them slams him over mid-on. He follows it up with a solid block in front of his pads. Bangladesh still trail by 313 runs.

Ravichandran Ashwin celebrates Â© AFP

12:46 PM: Harbhajan Singh come on now. Flat over, except the last one that really took off! But is there a slight change in the approach to the wicket? Harbhajan Singh seems to have cut down on the big 'flying' hand movement.

12:38 PM: ""Ohs"" and ""ahs"" as Ashwin is giving it a serious rip! Soumya Sarkar is all at sea in front of this tall offie from Tamil Nadu. He's bowling it slow, giving it a lot of air and spinning a web around these Bangla batsmen.

12:27 PM: WICKET! Ashwin sends Shakib (9) back. Tries to cut, too close to the body, not the correct length as well.Edges it to Saha. Bangladesh 121/4

12:23 PM: Not a very good start for Ishant Sharma - goes for a boundary, bowls a no-ball and not threatening Shakib at all.

12:15 PM: Team India in a huddle and Ashwin is going to finish his over. Nice and sunny at the Fatullah now. Maiden over, Kayes negotiates it safely.

12:05 PM: Finally, the sun is out and so are the players. After a few rounds of football, the Indian team players are warming up.

Rain, rain go away - has been the theme song for the one-off Test match between India and Bangladesh at Fatullah. While India have been able to declare their first innings at 462/6, Bangladesh are yet to finish their first innings.

On Day 4, only one session was play was possible in which Bangladesh scored 111 runs but lost three wickets. While the Indian quicks failed to make an impression, the spinning duo of Harbhajan Singh and Ravichandran Ashwin got into their stride before rain invaded to rescue the Bangla batsmen. Ashwin, who took the new ball, picked up two wickets, while Harbhajan Singh made his Test comeback with the wicket of Mominul Haque.

Bangladesh still trail by a massive 351 runs but in one day, India have to put in a herculean effort to get them out twice. Plus, there is always the rain threat looming.

A draw suits Bangladesh perfectly but India, even after putting up a substantial score, would gain precious little with a stalemate.","Sun, 14 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.ndtvimg.com/images/content/2015/jun/806/harbhajan-singh-celebrates.jpg,"['india', 'rainmarred', 'draw', 'ashwin', 'harbhajan', 'test', 'wicket', 'rain', 'ashwinharbhajan', 'litton', 'bcci', 'day', 'stands', 'bangladesh', 'singh', 'das', 'highlights', 'v']",

He has been waiting – living in a hotel in Medan, North Sumatra – for four years.



“My oldest son is now 14. He often asks me what country we are citizens of, because his classmates ask him,” the Rohingya Muslim father of five told BenarNews.



“I don’t know how to answer. Usually I tell him to be patient,” Nur said.



His is one of nine Rohingya families living in a budget hotel in Medan.



The International Organization for Migration (IOM) pays for their accommodation. In addition, each adult receives a monthly living allowance of 1.25 million rupiah ($94), and each child gets 500,000 rupiah ($38).



Nur’s case and others like it illustrate the challenge that Indonesia faces in resettling close to a thousand Rohingya Muslims who were rescued from stranded smugglers’ boats off the coast of Aceh Province in May.



Prior to that influx, Indonesia was already housing close to 12,000 foreign refugees from various countries, according to Foreign Minister Retno L.P. Marsudi.



“UNHCR is still awaiting their placement to a third country,” she said, referring to the U.N. refugee agency.



Migrating for education



Nur, 39, is one of about 270 Rohingya refugees living in four hotels in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province.



Nur left Rakhine state in western Myanmar in 1997 after the government seized his land.



“I fled Myanmar because I had no work there. The government took my land. My life was in danger so I decided to leave,” he said.



He went first to Malaysia as an illegal migrant and worked in construction for 14 years.



But when his oldest son turned seven, no school would take the boy because of Nur’s status as a refugee.



So he paid a smuggler 28,000 ringgit (U.S. $7,432) to take his family to Australia.



The sea voyage involved a stop in North Sumatra, where they were caught by immigration authorities.



Nur and 13 other migrants were detained for six months and seven days in an immigration facility in Belawan, North Sumatra. The OIM then brought them to Hotel Sentabi, where they have lived ever since.



Jobless



Next door lives Abdul Wahed, 29. Wahed says he feels fortunate his children can go to school in Medan.



“We can leave the hotel and go around Medan, but we are not allowed to work in Indonesia,” said Wahed, who has been in Medan since 2013.



Wahed and his family came ashore in Meulaboh, West Aceh, that year, from Malaysia. At the time his wife was pregnant and their daughter was born in Banda Aceh. Another daughter was born four months ago in Medan.



To earn some money, Wahed keeps six chickens and grows vegetables outside his hotel room.



Inside, he teaches his children to read the Quran, which he has memorized.



He left Myanmar in 2008, after escaping from prison where he was beaten, he said.



He and his wife and two children went first to Bangladesh, then to Thailand. After two weeks in Thailand, they went on to Malaysia where he too worked in construction.



“I left Malaysia because my children couldn’t go to school,” he said.



‘We are told to be patient’



Since they have lived in Medan not a single Rohingya Muslim has received political asylum in a third country.



“Sometimes we are sad to see that refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and some other countries are resettled after a year or two in Medan,” Nur said.



“When we ask UNHCR, they say they continue to work on getting us political asylum in a third country. We are told to be patient. How long do we have to be patient?”



Asked about the hundreds more refugees who arrived in Aceh in May, Nur said, “they may have the same fate we do.”



“I always pray to Allah that someday we can go home to Rakhine as citizens of Myanmar, and live in peace,” Wahed said.","Thu, 11 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/rohingya-limbo-06112015182044.html/150611-ID-medan-620.jpg/@@images/image,"['medan', 'refugees', 'malaysia', 'rohingya', 'hundreds', 'indonesia', 'north', 'wahed', 'muslims', 'nur', 'hotel', 'sumatra', 'await', 'myanmar', 'resettlement']",

Nilphamari Water Development Board’s Dalia Division Executive Engineer Mostafizur Rahman said the water had been flowing 10 centimetres above the danger level at Dimla’s Dalia point since 6pm.

Quoting Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Dalia Division, Rahman said the water level in Teesta had been increasing due to incessant rainfall and the onrush of upstream water from the hills since Thursday evening.

“The water level will further rise if the flow of upstream water continues.”

He said all the gates of barrage had been opened to maintain the normal flow of river water.

Meanwhile, overflowing river had inundated Baishpukur, Kisamat Chhatnai, East Chhatnai Jharh, Shingeswar, Bagher Char, Tabur Char, Bhendabarhi, Chhatunama, Haldibarhi, Ekatar Char, Bhashanir Char and Kisamater Char areas, among others, under Dimla Upazila.

Several parts of Jaldhaka’s Golmunda, Dauabarhi, Shoulmari Chargram had also been submerged.

Local public representatives said households were yet to be affected though the lowland and roads in these areas had been inundated.

Dimla’s East Chhatnai Union Chairman Abdul Latif Khan said the households in many parts of the lowland near the river did not inundate despite the river water was flowing above danger mark.

Goyabarhi Union Chairman Ibne Faysal Moon said the North Goyabarhi village was marooned in the morning after water level increased.

The roads to the village went under knee-deep water but there was no information about any of the 173 households being inundated, he said.

Dauabarhi Union Chairman Saiful Islam Mukul said movement of the people were restricted and many families had become isolated.","Sat, 13 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2015/06/13/nilphamari-nil-tiesta.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Nilphamari-Nil-Tiesta.jpg,"['level', 'danger', 'char', 'teesta', 'water', 'union', 'mark', 'chhatnai', 'dalia', 'parts', 'chairman', 'river', 'households', 'crosses']", 
20,20,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Rohingya Man: Enslaved in Thailand For Two Years - benarnews,https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/rohingya-odyssey-06192015191909.html,"Muhammad Arif, 30, fled his native Myanmar 11 years ago and has lived a migrant’s life since, including two years in Thailand as a slave.



He speaks softly and projects an inner calm and authority as he tells his harrowing story.



Arif is one of seven Rohingya refugees in Medan, Indonesia who have memorized all 30 juz of the Quran. He leads prayers, and gives lectures on Islam to other Rohingyas, who call him “Ustad,” an honorific for a highly skilled person.



He has lived at Medan’s Hotel Pelangi for the past three years, along with about 100 other Rohingya refugees, who all await resettlement in a third country. Their rooms are paid for by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).



Until now, not a single Rohingya Muslim in Medan has been granted asylum in a third country.



Hotel Pelangi is outfitted with closed-circuit television cameras. On each of three visits, a representative of Indonesia’s Ministry of Justice and Human Rights questioned BenarNews about the purpose of the visit.



BenarNews ultimately interviewed Arif at a nearby café, but did not independently verify his story.



Arrested by soldiers



At age 19, soldiers in Myanmar arrested Arif after his family refused to hand over their home and land in Maungdaw, Rakhine state, to the military-run government.



He was held for two weeks.



“Every day and night, I was beaten and tortured. They broke one of my teeth, and burned my hands with cigarettes,” he said, displaying a burn mark on his hand.



Then he was freed and given five days to think about handing over his familial land. His mother insisted that they should comply rather than see him thrown in jail again.



“After our house and land was given to the Buddhists, every day soldiers would come to my uncle’s house where we were staying. My mother felt my life was in danger, so I decided to leave Maungdaw,” Arif said.



He went to Chittagong, Bangladesh, and continued studying Islam at a madrassa in that city for four years. In 2008, he graduated and began to look for a job. But he could not work, because he was not a citizen.



“One day, I was invited to get on a boat. I didn’t pay because I had no money. They said just get in, because my presence would be a blessing on the journey,” he said.



It was a seven-day journey with 11 other Rohingyas on a wooden boat.







Forced labor



The boat moored in Thailand.



An agent took him to the owner of a fishing boat. Arif said he was forced to clean the boat day and night, without pay. Food rations were tiny.



Arif was deeply isolated because he could not speak Thai.



“If I asked for food, they hit me. When I was sleeping, they gave me shots to make me strong. I don’t know what they put in my body,” he said.



After working for a year on the boat, Arif was sold to work on a plantation, he said. Conditions were not much better: long hours with no pay. None of the other workers could speak his language.



“I worked from six in the morning to eight at night. If I was lazy at my work, they would give me a shot. I slept alone in a warehouse. I don’t know what the name of that place was,” he said.



After about a year, another Rohingya was brought to the site. Arif was elated to have a friend at last. Two months later, the two resolved to run away. In the middle of the night, while the guards slept, they pulled it off.



“We ran, without knowing where we were going. I prayed to Allah to keep us safe. We ate anything edible in order to stay alive. Two days and two nights we ran, until we came upon a river,” he said.



They followed the river until finally they saw a mosque. They learned that they were now in Malaysia.



With help from some local people, they contacted an uncle of Arif’s companion in Penang state.



In Penang, Arif taught the Quran to the children of six Malay families. From his earnings he was able to eat and set aside a small amount, held for him by one of the families.



Arif met many illegal Rohingya workers. They told him about the possibility of a better life in Australia.



The family holding his money introduced him to an agent from Indonesia.



“I don’t know how much money the family gave the agent, because I never asked,” he said.



The trip began with a bus ride from Penang to Kuala Lumpur.



Then he was taken by boat, along with six other Rohingya refugees, to Belawan Port in North Sumatra; from there they went to Polonia Airport in Medan, where they took a plane to Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, via Jakarta.



The next stop was BauBau, on Buton Island, on the southeastern tip of Sulawesi.



‘Saved by whales’



After 15 days in a warehouse rented by the agent in BauBau, Arif said he boarded a boat with 56 other Rohingya, including women and children, headed for Australia. They were told the trip would take four days.



The boat’s engine died two days later. A speedboat came to fetch the captain and three crew. They sped off, leaving the Rohingyas in the middle of the ocean.



“For two days and two nights we pitched about in the middle of the ocean. Everybody on the boat was crying. The women and children were crying because there was no food. Everyone was weak from hunger,” he said.



“In the middle of the night, an old man told me, ‘Ustad, please pray to God to save us.’ I stood up and told all of them to pray together and read the Quran.”



Then, according to Arif, a miracle occurred. He said he saw whales appear and create waves that pushed the boat to a small island. Before dawn, they landed.



“I don’t know how many whales helped us. But the fishermen who helped us said they saw four whales. I truly believe it was a miracle from Allah who saved us in the middle of the ocean because there were children on the boat,” he said.



In the morning, police and immigration officials arrived, and arrested the Rohingyas. Twenty-three men were put in jail; the women and children were released.



Arif was detained for a year and four months in Manado, North Sulawesi. Finally, IOM officials came and brought him to Medan.



Keeping busy



Since September 2013, Arif has lived at the Hotel Pelangi. Every day he keeps a routine, although he is not allowed to work.



He studies, exercises, interacts with other refugees, leads prayers and sometimes goes on excursions near the hotel.



He is muscular, diligent about maintaining his fitness. His moustache, beard and sideburns are freshly shaved; his hair is styled like that of Real Madrid football star Cristiano Ronaldo.



Arif holds out hope of finding a third country where he can work, get married and start a family. He is afraid to get married when he has no job.



“I always pray to Allah that Muslim Rohingya will be acknowledged as citizens of Myanmar, so that we can go home,” he said. “I don’t know if my mother and my siblings are still alive in Myanmar.”","Fri, 19 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/rohingya-odyssey-06192015191909.html/150619-ID-arif-620.jpg/@@images/image,"['children', 'enslaved', 'night', 'know', 'man', 'days', 'rohingya', 'day', 'arif', 'thailand', 'boat', 'middle', 'dont']",

The model, developed by a team at Anglia Ruskin University’s Global Sustainability Institute, does not account for society reacting to escalating crises by changing global behaviour and policies.

However the model does show that our current way of life appears to be unsustainable and could have dramatic worldwide consequences.

Dr Aled Jones, the Director of the Global Sustainability Institute, told Insurge Intelligence: ""We ran the model forward to the year 2040, along a business-as-usual trajectory based on ‘do-nothing’ trends — that is, without any feedback loops that would change the underlying trend.

""The results show that based on plausible climate trends, and a total failure to change course, the global food supply system would face catastrophic losses, and an unprecedented epidemic of food riots.

""In this scenario, global society essentially collapses as food production falls permanently short of consumption.""

The model follows a report from Lloyds of London which has evaluated the extent of the impact of a shock scenario on crop production, and has concluded that the ""global food system is under chronic pressure.""

The report said: ""The global food system is under chronic pressure to meet an ever-rising demand, and its vulnerability to acute disruptions is compounded by factors such as climate change, water stress, ongoing globalisation and heightening political instability.

""A global production shock of the kind set out in this scenario would be expected to generate major economic and political impacts that could affect clients across a very wide spectrum of insurance classes. This analysis has presented the initial findings for some of the key risk exposures.

""Global demand for food is on the rise, driven by unprecedented growth in the world’s population and widespread shifts in consumption patterns as countries develop.""

22,22,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Study finds that exposure to green spaces improves the cognitive abilities of children - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/study-finds-exposure-green-spaces-improves-cognitive-abilities-children-10324001.html,"When it comes to the physical and psychological benefits of being exposed to nature — and especially to scenery that is filled with lush plant life — the evidence lately has been rolling in.

Recently we reported on a study by Australian researchers showing that brief 40 second micro-breaks, in which students looked at computerized images of a green roof, led to improved performance on an attention-demanding cognitive task.

And now, in what appears to be the first study of its kind, a team of researchers find myriad additional benefits for schoolchildren who go to schools that feature lots of green spaces and natural scenery. Kids exposed to more greenery — as measured by satellite imagery of their schools and neighborhoods — showed not only better attention, but also superior working memory.

The research, conducted by researchers from Spain, Norway, and the United States — and led by Payam Dadvand of the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona — studied 2,593 seven- to 10-year-old children from 36 Barcelona schools over the course of a full year. It was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The students each took four repeated cognitive tests over three-month intervals in the space of a year. At the same time, for each kid, the researchers used satellite imagery to assess the amount of green space around the home, along the path to and from school, and around the school itself. This did not exclusively mean parks but rather included trees, plants, and grasses.

Children generally show improvement over time in these tests, as their brains develop. But kids with more exposure to greenery improved more, on average, in working memory, higher order “superior working memory,” and attentiveness. Interestingly, however, the greenness of the home (or lack thereof) didn’t seem to matter much — rather, it was the greenness of the commute and especially the school that made the difference.

“The kids where there was more green around the school, we saw better cognitive development, so they did better on these tests,” said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a researcher with the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona and one of the study’s authors. “It was about a five percent difference over the time period.” That’s an amount, said Nieuwenhuijsen, that may sound small but “on a population scale, this can have huge effects.”

At the same time, the researchers also assessed levels of what they called traffic-related air pollution, which naturally tends to be lower in areas with more green space. And they found that when the role of pollution was added into their models, this seemed to be a very important factor — it explained 20 to 65 percent of the link between greenery and better cognitive development.

“Our observed beneficial associations between greenness exposure and cognitive development could have been partly mediated by reduction in exposure to [traffic-related air pollution],” the authors wrote. However, based on their data, it appeared unlikely that this factor alone could explain all of the benefit — just a significant part of it.

“We don’t think it’s all air pollution,” said Nieuwenhuijsen. “I think it’s also some kind of direct effect, when you look at green space and mental health, you see quite a beneficial effect of green space on mental health.”

That raises the question of what, precisely, is the mechanism by which exposure to greenery seems to have so many beneficial effects.

The authors list a variety of other possible mechanisms: Less exposure to distracting noise, for instance, or more likelihood of engaging in outdoor exercise.

In addition there is the “biophilia” hypothesis, associated with Harvard evolutionary biologist E.O. Wilson, who postulates that because humans evolved in certain kinds of green landscapes, we in effect have a psychological need for them. Thus, when we are deprived of greenery, it is harmful to our psyches.

In this interpretation, it’s not so much that green spaces help us as that the lack of them harms us. Or as one writer on the subject puts it: “If there is an evolutionary basis for biophilia, as asserted by E.O. Wilson…then contact with nature is a basic human need.”

‘This inborn response to nature can be very instrumental to health, and productivity, and physical and mental well-being,” added Stephen Kellert, a Yale researcher who has collaborated with Wilson in investigating the biophilia hypothesis and is trying to apply it in the built environment, through architectural design.

The implications of the research seem clear — schools should plant lots of trees and gardens and, more generally, cities should foster as much greenery as possible.

“Improved cognitive development in children attending schools with more greenness could result in an advantage in mental capital, which, in turn, would have lasting effects through the life-course,” noted the study authors.

The deeper reason for doing it came from about 30 years of being a community artist and working around themes of race, which means issues to do with global justice and inequality between north and south. For the last eight years, I have also been working on climate justice, which I imagine is a term most people don't really understand.



Can you elaborate?



It's generally used to look at the inequality between north and south as a result of climate. It is usually termed as the people who have contributed least to CO2 emissions that cause global warming are the ones facing the greatest wrath of its effects. And they are predicted to face it to a considerably greater degree in the future.

The exhibition aims to make the idea of climate-induced migration more accessible

That aspect of climate change is very central to the industrial system, to over-consumption, over-production and the myth of continual growth, and was created out of the colonial system. I think that kind of narrative is more or less absent from expressions and dialogue and discussions around issues to do with race and global justice, or within the environmental movement.



Do you believe there is a general understanding of the concept of climate refugees?



Unlike political refugees, people tend to move a very short distance away from where intensive environmental change takes place. The way what's known as slow-onset deterioration of the environment affects migration is poorly understood. It is harder to understand because it takes place over a period of time, although that may be a more significant effect.



If you take somewhere like Bangladesh, where there used to be a serious flood every 20 years, it's now maybe every four years. So while people might once have moved a certain way away and then moved back, that's becoming tougher. Although people are not going to leave the country, increasingly, they can't move back.



How do you feel about the term climate refugee?





One consequence of climate change is flooding in many parts of the world

For a while people were calling it climate-induced migration. The last academic workshop I went to, there was a strong feeling that we have to go back to using the term ""climate refugees"" because otherwise we are watering the entire set of issues down. People are refugees and they need to be recognized as such.



This problem looks set to get worse before it gets better - how important is public awareness?



Climate change is dogged by people trying to find a smoking gun for environmental change. It's very difficult for people to feel that this is real, because even when things happen now, nobody is going to say 'look, that's climate change. I'm pointing my finger at it'. When a problem occurs, nobody wants to say climate is the cause.





Kooj Chuhan is committed to highlighting the issue of climate refugees

That's climate change generally, but with migration we have this feeling we're used to migrants - especially at the moment. People see this migration as largely political, or to do with conflict, or destabilization and that people are hungry and have no future at home. They see that going on, but to say there's something else, something relatively indirect that's going to make things worse, is conceptually difficult. But the scale of this enormous. If you think of environmental degradation of any kind, the first impact is that people won't be able to eat easily, or at all, in certain areas, so they will have to move.



Do you think art can help to open people's eyes to the seriousness of the problem?



The role of art is to try and humanize what can otherwise become statistical endeavors. My big challenge is to make the issue tangible. In our media-saturated world, people are saying 'if you're not on the Internet, you don't exist.' That is one of the difficulties in creating an audio-visual language that says, 'this is real, this is going on, this is happening to people like me and you. They're not those weird others we normally try and ignore, or to take a deep breath and then carry on with the washing up.'



I think documentary filmmakers are really important, but there is a kind of formula to how they tend to film people in poor countries, and you have this unarticulated feeling of 'here we go again, it's another one of those images somewhere in the world. If it's not conflict, it'll be another disaster of some kind.'

One piece of work, called The Level, by Iranian artist, Mazaher, uses verbatim dialogue from a report by the UK Climate Change and Migration Coalition. He has actors express the dialogue as if it were happening to them, and intercuts it with footage from flooding in different parts of the world. It plays with your senses in a very jarring way. It pulls people out of the comfort zone they are in even when watching disasters and difficult narratives.

24,24,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Playing with fire: Ken-Betwa & the flawed logic of river-linking - Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/environment-news/playing-with-fire-not-water-ken-betwa-and-the-flawed-logic-of-river-linking-explained-1434683551.html,"QUICK PILL The project The River Linking Project was first announced by former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.

PM Narendra Modi has made it a core part of his agenda.

The plan is to link 37 of India\'s rivers with 30 river links.

The Ken-Betwa link is the first step. It is due to start in December. The controversy Some see this as a brilliant idea to transfer water from a full river to a dry one, from a flood-prone zone to a drought zone.

Others see it as hubris.

India has a dismal record of assessing the impact of even one dam or hydro project. This plan will alter the life of 37 major rivers.

The Ken-Betwa link will submerge 4,600 acres of the Panna National Park, which is also a tiger reserve. More in the story Water expert Himanshu Thakkar explains the issues at stake. Sets out both the problems and the solutions.

More than 30 years ago, a massive and controversial plan to link India's rivers was set into motion. A decade ago, prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, brought it into the spotlight.

The River Linking Project immediately became one of the most contested ideas of the time. Some hailed it as a brilliant answer to India's problems: bring water to drought-prone areas by siphoning it off from flood-prone rivers and feeding it into dry ones. People like Tamil superstar Rajnikanth gave it enthusiastic support.

Others denounced it as an act of extreme hubris. At the best of times, India has a terrible track record of environmental assessment. Governments often don't know how even one hydro project or dam is affecting a river and people 10 kilometres downstream. The thought of playing at this scale with Nature was almost suicidal.

Linking one river to another is not just a question of transferring water from a full river to a dry one. It means playing with flood plains, erosion, the ecology of a river and the downstream impacts of lessening its flow.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power last year, he resurrected this mammoth undertaking as a central part of his development agenda.

Now, the government shows every sign of going ahead with it.

The first step of the plan is to connect the Ken river near Panna in Madhya Pradesh with the Betwa river near Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. The start date: December. The cost: Rs 7,600 crore.

The idea is to transfer water from the Ken to the Betwa, via a 221-kilometre-long canal, with the eventual goal of bringing water to the water-deficient districts of Vidisha and Raisen in central MP.

Our government is not even concerned about the effects dams and hydropower projects have on our own people

Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams Rivers and People, has good reason to be unconvinced of the undertaking. He spells out the issues at stake:

Why are the Ken and Betwa rivers being linked?

To take what is claimed to be excess water from the Ken to the Betwa. But there is no scientific basis for this.

The water balance studies, on the basis of which this is being pushed, have been manipulated to show that the Ken has a water surplus and the Betwa is dry, but both are, in reality, roughly in the same situation.

The government wants to develop dams on the Betwa, upstream of the link. This will affect water flow to the existing Rajghat and Matatila dams downstream, which are not performing well as it is. So they can only build new dams if the Betwa is supplemented by water from the Ken.

What is the scope of the river-linking project?

The government wants to link some 37 rivers though 30 river links: 14 Himalayan and 16 peninsular. Each link will involve several dams, reservoirs, tunnels and canals.

The full magnitude of the physical infrastructure required is not known. The estimated cost for the project is Rs 11,676 crore, but that was at 2008 prices. At current price levels, it would have almost doubled.

Feasibility studies have not been done for most of the planned links, and most of the studies that were done are not in the public domain.

Some feasibility studies were made public, but only after repeated orders from the Supreme Court. But till date, no pre-feasibility studies or water balance studies have been made public.

Has anything like this been attempted elsewhere? If yes, have they been successful?

Not at this scale. Individual rivers have been linked here and there. I'm not sure if they can be called successful. You can only determine that if you have an established credible scientific basis for river-linking.

Will the project have any benefits?

That's the wrong question.

Suppose I need a glass of water. I can take it from my kitchen, or I can buy a bottle from the market, or I can get it from a beautiful, pure stream near Mount Everest, flown to Delhi via Kathmandu. All of the options benefit me.

The right question is: Does India need river-linking? Is it an optimal, desirable, beneficial option or not?

The answer is no. We don't need river-linking. It isn't required, it's not optimal; not desirable. There is no scientific basis for it.

We have much better options to meet our water needs for agriculture, industry, urban or rural consumption, food security or livelihood security.

Who is pushing for river-linking and why?

The Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) basically functions as a big dam lobby in India. River linking is an extension of the big dam agenda.

Big dams equal big money, big influence, big power, focussed in a few hands. The mindset in the ministry is that big dams are the solution to all problems.

The rationale that is given is that, in India, we have flood prone areas, which have more water than they need. We also have drought-prone areas, which have too little water.

So if we take the excess water from flood-prone areas and transfer it to areas that need more water, we can reduce floods and solve water scarcity.

This is flawed logic.

If you go to north Bihar now, when rainfall is yet to start, you will find vast areas dry and arid. But it will be flooded soon. So is it a flood or drought-prone area? Cherrapunjee is the world's wettest spot, but in April, people are in such bad shape that they are buying water by the bucket.

Even if an area is flood-prone, it is not necessarily a water-surplus area. You have to look at a whole area, across the whole year, over the years, in the context of ecological and social ground realities.

Has any external expertise been sought?

Most of the time, the MoWR doesn't believe there is any expertise outside the government.

Between 2004 and 2011, there was an expert body set up under the MoWR on interlinking of rivers of which I was also a member. But it was dissolved without notice.

What advice did this body offer?

We raised a lot of questions, demanded all reports on the project to be put out into the public domain. The Ken-Betwa link was being pushed even then.

We told them to send the project reports in Hindi to all panchayats in the area, so the people could give their views.

I told them that if you want to arrive at a scientific conclusion on whether a river basin actually has a surplus or deficit of water resources, you have to exhaust all the local water resource management options in that river basin.

What are the local water resource management options?

Watershed development

Ground water recharge

Creating more local water systems, such as small tanks, ponds, small dams, and optimising the benefits of those already in existence

Optimising benefits from existing water infrastructure such as big dams, canals, hydropower projects, urban-rural water supply, and so on. India has the largest water infrastructure of any country, but we are using it poorly

Reducing transmission and distribution losses

Ensuring full treatment and reuse of sewage and industrial waste water

Avoiding inappropriate water use in a given area: e.g. water bottling plants or golf courses or water intensive crops in deficit areas

The use of proper cropping patterns. If you grow sugarcane in Kutch or Rajasthan, that won't work; if you want to cultivate rice, you should not do it in a dry area like the Cauvery basin in Tamil Nadu. You can also reduce water use in a given area by up to 50% using a system of rice intensification (SRI) and similar methods for other crops.

Why is the existing water infrastructure performing poorly?

Because of a lack of maintenance and repairs and lack of participatory governance. We are not ensuring silt doesn't enter our reservoirs. Pollution, encroachment and the dumping of waste are destroying our rural and urban water systems. There isn't even a comprehensive rainwater harvesting system.

None of the planned river links are at an implementation stage. No clearances have been given

How can this be remedied?

Money and human resources are needed for better maintenance. A change in mindset is also required in our water resources establishment. We need to involve people in desilting local reservoirs.

In fact, we need to involve people in every way, at every stage, not only in the implementation of water management but also in decision-making.

What remains to be done before the implementation of the Ken-Betwa link?

The fact is that none of the planned river links are at an implementation stage. No clearances have been given. The government keeps making these noises to give the impression that something is happening.

The Ken-Betwa link has had the most shoddy environment impact assessment. They will need to redo it or they will be open to legal challenges. They also need to go back to all the panchayats in Ken and Betwa basin to get their consent.

Apart from environmental and forest clearances, the Ken-Betwa link will need clearance from the Wildlife Board and the Supreme Court as it will submerge some 4,600 hectares of the Panna National Park. The total submergence area is 8,650 hectares, but the total land requirement for the project will be several times that.

They will also need inter-state agreements between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

How will India's domestic river linking projects affect transboundary water-sharing with neighbouring countries?

The interlinking of rivers will have direct impacts on Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.

We have a water treaty with Pakistan on the Indus, and Pakistan has gone to the International Court of Justice over Indian projects in the past. But we have no such treaty with China for any of the shared river basins.

Say a river is shared between India and China and India has made use of its waters first. If China starts developing an upstream project, which affects India's use of the waters downstream, we can raise the issue under first user rights. But there is no international law or institution to which we can appeal.

There is only one instrument: the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Use of Watercourses (1997). But when this convention was discussed in the UN, India opposed it and abstained from voting. And India has not ratified it.

The Ken-Betwa river link has had the most shoddy Environmental Impact Assessment. It will need to be redone

With what face can India go to the UN and use this provision? And even if they were able to use it, the International Court of Justice is not powerful enough to enforce it on China.

The Mekong basin projects in China have affected Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. But China is not bothered. It does not enter into any water-sharing arrangement with any downstream country.

But why are we talking about neighbouring countries? Our government is not even concerned about the effects dams and hydropower projects have on our own people in downstream areas.

We don't assess the impacts, we don't consult, we don't compensate, resettle, rehabilitate the affected. Millions of people who rely on riverine fisheries are never compensated for the impacts of river projects on their livelihoods.","Sat, 20 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://images.catchnews.com/upload,"['betwa', 'india', 'area', 'flawed', 'logic', 'riverlinking', 'need', 'project', 'link', 'dams', 'water', 'rivers', 'playing', 'river', 'kenbetwa']",

26,26,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Justice on the horizon - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/justice-the-horizon-98320,"Families of the martyred intellectuals heaved a sigh of relief at the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the International War Crimes Tribunal's death sentence handed to convicted war criminal Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed. Asserting their faith in the country's legal justice system, they said the apex court had brought them one step closer to getting justice.

Shawan Mahmud, daughter of martyred music composer Altaf Mahmud, said, ""This is yet another step towards our success in receiving justice. It paves the way for banning Jamaat-e-Islami.""

""This verdict is a befitting reply to these criminals' outrageous claim that there were no war criminals in the country,"" she said, referring to Mojaheed's 2007 comment that there were no war criminals in Bangladesh.

Shawan is confident that the trial of Jamaat-e-Islami will also be held for its heinous role during the Liberation War in 1971.

""Since trial of the individuals involved in crimes

against humanity has started despite long delay, we must wait patiently for the trial of Jamaat-e-Islami.""

Nuzhat Chowdhury Shampa, daughter of martyred physician Dr Alim Chowdhury, noted that the verdicts the SC delivered on three previous appeals did not have a direct link with the pro-liberation intellectuals.

""It is the first Appellate Division verdict which has given death penalty to a war criminal for the killing of intellectuals.""

""Their conspiracy of killing intellectual visionaries of the country is still continuing. Therefore, it is more important to try the criminals involved in killing intellectuals in 1971, so that we can uproot the conspiracy as a whole,"" she said.

""As a daughter of a martyr I would like to bring it to the attention of our policy makers that if we do not try Jamaat-e-Islam and stop the ideological spread of this party and other like-minded extremist groups and break their financial and economic strongholds, I believe that our fight against the war criminals will be futile,"" she opined.

""It will rather only create the ground for the re-emergence of a stronger and more violent form of these extremists that will surely lead to another bloodbath in the future someday,"" Nuzhat stressed.

Shumon Zahid, son of martyred intellectual journalist Selina Parvin, said his family would be fully assured when the sentence was executed.

He said many members of the intellectuals' families could not see the war crimes trial taking place while they were alive.

But he wishes to see that punishment is being meted out during his lifetime. ""So that we can tell our children that we received justice,"" he said.

Shumon opined that banning Jamaat-e-Islami ""is a political decision"" and noted that the party, which had committed despicable atrocities in 1971, even burned people to death to mar the trial process.

""As we learn from newspapers and other sources, no party which opposes a nation's independence is allowed to do politics in that country,"" he said.

Shahriar Kabir, cousin of martyred writer Prof Shahidullah Kaiser and writer and filmmaker Zahir Raihan, said, ""Justice can be delayed but at the end of the day the truth will prevail.""

Kabir, a journalist and researcher who was the first prosecution witness of Mojaheed's trial, said all the crimes committed by the Al-Badr was well documented in Jamaat's own publication in Selim Mansur Khalid's book 'Al-Badr', which was submitted to the court.

Shahriar criticised the law ministry for dilly-dallying with starting the trial of Jamaat-e-Islami and other organisations involved in war crimes.

""All the investigation has been done. But they have stalled the process saying that the punishment for organisations should be included in the law,"" Shahriar said.

""Why should it take one and half years to make this change (in the law)?"" he questioned.","Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/reaction_mojaheed.jpg?itok=Q8bIRCmk,"['horizon', 'martyred', 'involved', 'law', 'trial', 'war', 'jamaateislami', 'criminals', 'justice', 'killing', 'party']",

The local director of operations for Border Guard Bangladesh, Ekram Khan, said the shoot-out was ""the outcome of a total misunderstanding"" � an assessment that chimed with witness reports.



Local fishermen said a Bangladeshi patrol boat on the Naf river which divides the two countries came under fire from Myanmar border guards, who had apparently mistaken them for smugglers.

The area where the shoot-out occurred is notorious for people smuggling between the two countries, which have come under the spotlight over a migrant crisis in recent weeks.But clashes between border forces are rare.One sustained multiple bullet wounds during the clash in Bangladesh's south-eastern district of Cox's Bazar.""Our soldiers started firing in retaliation and private Biplob Kumar sustained injuries to his head and right hand,"" said Abu Russell Siddiki, a spokesman for the Bangladesh force.Another Bangladeshi border guard, Abdur Razzak, was taken by Myanmar Border Guard Police to a border force camp.Khan said the issue would be resolved at a flag meeting whose timing had yet to be confirmed.People smuggling is rife in Cox's Bazar and many former fishermen have joined smuggling rings because they are so lucrative.The scale of the issue was thrown into relief when thousands of migrants, most of them Rohingya from Myanmar or economic migrants from Bangladesh, were stranded in Southeast Asian waters last month.The crisis followed a Thai crackdown on people smuggling that threw the multi-million dollar industry into disarray, leading gangmasters to abandon their victims on land and at sea.","Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://e-pao.net/images/epicon.ico,"['held', 'epao', 'sustained', 'exchange', 'guards', 'hurt', 'shootout', 'smuggling', 'headlines', 'countries', 'guard', 'users', 'bangladesh', 'border', 'jun15', 'bangladeshi', 'myanmar']",

Tal Abyad has been controlled by ISIL since last August.

‘YPG and Free Syrian Army are coming from the east of Tal Abyad,” a young Syrian man who fled the town and arrived in Turkey last week told Al Jazeera.

“YPG and Brigades of Raqqa rebels also came from Kobane from the west of Tal Abyad to surround Tal Abyad to take ISIL positions.”

Turkish military vehicles lined up along the border and Turkish police bulldozers arrived at the border’s gates before the first families arrived one by one, and people then began to flood in.

The Turkish Agency for Relief and Emergency (AFAD) and Turkish immigration administration teams began to register the people.

Many of the Syrians are sleeping outdoors for now.

“We are staying in the streets here. For the moment, the families are not sent to the camps,” Fatmah al-Khalaf, 40, from Tal Abyad, told Al Jazeera.

After visiting the Akcakale border crossing in southern Turkey, where the main influx has been concentrated, Numan Kurtulmus, Turkish deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday that access would be limited to humanitarian cases only.

“Turkey will not accept entries onto its territory from Syria except in case of a humanitarian tragedy,” he was quoted by local media as saying.

However, a Turkish official told AFP news agency that these measures did not put in question Turkey’s open door-policy towards Syrian refugees.

“The restrictions formulated by the local authorities are temporary and local,” the official said.

More than 1.7 million Syrian refugees have officially registered in Turkey, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.","Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1539679dceac40cc866bbcacebbd6d8c_6.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630,"['isil', 'abyad', 'turkish', 'turkey', 'flee', 'began', 'local', 'tal', 'battle', 'syrian', 'border', 'syrians', 'told']",

During the summer months, we’ll continue our Newcastle United nostalgia features, by recalling past seasons at St James’ Park. Today we revisit 1959-60.

For many of us, the years between 1993 and 1997 have come to represent the most exciting, vibrant time to be a Newcastle United fan.

The breathless enthusiasm of manager Kevin Keegan, incredible signings like Ginola Ferdinand - and later Shearer, a tilt at the Premier League title, and a return to Europe were all played out by a team labelled as the “Entertainers”.

Not so famous today, and remembered only by older fans, is another United side hailed - at the time - for its entertainment value.

If the swinging 60s had yet to take off, the season 1959-60 at St James’ Park provided an invigorating campaign of attacking football and a flood of goals with a team dubbed “Mitten’s marvels”.

In the wider world, these were the years Coronation Street first aired on TV; thousands bought the formerly banned book Lady Chatterly’s lover, complete with swear words and sex scenes; and a young President was elected in the United States. His name? John F Kennedy.

Back on home turf, unrest in the Newcastle United board room nearly led to the exit of manager Charlie Mitten, but differences were settled and the club would go on to enjoy a relatively successful season.

Not that the opening three fixture augured well, but successive defeats against Spurs, Birmingham and Manchester United were forgotten as the Magpies picked up momentum as the campaign progressed.

In early November, United demolished Everton 8-2 at St James’ and won the following four games hitting 15 goals in the process.

The New Year brought a 7-3 victory against Man United at Gallowgate in front of more than 57,000 ecstatic fans, while a fine run in February and March saw the Magpies win six games out of seven.

Indeed, the Toon lost just game in eleven as the season drew to a close, before inexplicably taking their foot off the gas and losing the final three matches.

The 1959-60 season saw United fire home 82 league goals, with Len White (29) and George Eastham (20) being the Toon’s most potent marksmen.

However, as ever, the defence remained an achilles heel and a hefty 78 goals were conceded,

But eighth in the table was satisfactory enough and, indeed, it would be United’s highest finish until 1969-70 when Joe Harvey’s gritty, hard-working team finished seventh.

The season 1960-61 would be a different matter altogether","Fri, 12 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article9440715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS65816024.jpg,"['goals', 'flood', 'brings', 'st', 'newcastle', '195960', 'james', 'season', 'ends', 'park', 'team', 'saw', 'today', 'united']",

On her way, Asma's neighbour Yousuf stopped and lured her with the promise of a mango. She followed him to a lonely place of the village where Yousuf raped her.

Young girls like Asma fall prey to this violent crime frequently in this country.

A study by The Daily Star has discovered that 82 percent of rape victims are under the age of 20.

Although we have found 800-900 rape incidents being reported in a year, these numbers, however, do not reflect the whole story.

Because of the social stigma of rape, many rape incidents are not reported. This means that the number of rapes, in reality, is much higher.

The Daily Star compiled all the rape incidents that were reported in the newspaper from January 2011 to June 2015.

From the study, it was found that 52 percent of the victims were raped or violated by an individual male. Thirty-seven percent of the girls or women were gang-raped and 11 percent faced rape attempts but managed to escape or was saved.

The study also found that girls between 2 and 19 years were the most vulnerable.

According to it, 80 percent of the rapists are known to the victims.

ATTACKED WHEN ALONE

More than half of the rape victims, 52 percent, were schoolgirls. Twenty-seven percent of them were raped on their ways to and from school. In many of these cases. the rapists attacked the girls walking unescorted.

Absence of parents at home can also make these girls victims to rape. Twenty-two percent of these girls have been violated when they were left alone at their homes.

LURED TO BE RAPED

A common trick is to lure younger victims with chocolates, candy, toys, books and similar stuffs. Teenage girls, on the other hand, are mostly lured with promises of jobs and romantic relationships.

MOST RAPISTS KNOWN TO VICTIMS

The study also discovered that 45 percent of the rapists are neighbours or men who live in the same locality as the victims. These men are mostly known to the victims.

Rape by romantic partners made up 11 percent of the cases of rapes and seven percent of the rapists have been teachers or private tutors.

Of the victims, 33 percent were taken to a field or an orchard and raped. And, 30 percent were raped at the rapists' houses, according to the study.","Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/rape_infograph.jpg?itok=vMtxx1ZO,"['rapists', 'vulnerable', 'incidents', 'raped', 'rape', 'reported', '20', 'yousuf', 'girls', 'victims', 'study', 'known']",

Fernita Darwis, a senior member of a splinter faction of Lukman’s own party, the United Development Party (PPP), said the minister’s appeal to Muslims not to force food vendors to close during Ramadan, which starts this week, had “hurt the faithful and had a [negative] impact on the PPP”.

“We’ve had a lot of messages from clerics asking us to address this issue,” she said. “The minister must immediately cease taking positions that hurt the Muslim faithful and cause negative stigma in the community.”

Lukman, in a Twitter message on June 5, urged followers not to compel street-side food stalls, or warung, to close during Ramadan, when Muslims are obliged to fast during daylight hours.

“We have to respect the rights of those who are not required to or are not fasting,” he wrote.

In a series of follow-up tweets three days later, the minister sought to clarify his earlier remark.

“There were two things that I wanted to get across with that tweet. First, there is no need to force any warung to close during the fasting month,” he wrote.

“If there are those who close their warung voluntarily, we of course respect that. But good Muslims don’t force others to give up their source of livelihood.”

The second point, Lukman went on, was the need for mutual respect and understanding for those who were not fasting.

“We are obliged to respect the right (to access to food/drink) of those who are not fasting because they are not Muslim,” he wrote.

“We must also respect the right of Muslims who are not fasting because of [certain] conditions (traveling, illness, menstruating, pregnant, nursing).”

Lukman, who took office in June last year, has earned a reputation as being far more progressive and inclusive than his predecessors — a distinction that has drawn criticism from conservatives.

Khatibul Umam Wiranu, a member of the Democratic Party, accused Lukman of trying to curry popular support through the media through statements like his call for mutual respect.

“The way I see it, Lukman is frightened of being replaced in a reshuffle. And the only thing he can do is use the media to build up his popularity,” Khatibul said. “His performance, meanwhile, has been very unsatisfactory.”

Jazuli Jawani, a legislator from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), said Lukman’s call for those who were fasting to respect those who were not was highly regrettable.

“His statement is just going to cause problems. He shouldn’t be stirring up a row in the community,” he said.

Jazuli argued that it was only natural for those “carrying out the faith” to be granted greater respect than those who were not.

“The minister’s logic is backward and he’s giving the impression that he doesn’t understand how to promote tolerance,” he said.

“When Muslims are fasting, it’s customary for followers of other religions or for Muslims who are not fasting to pay them their due respect.”

Clerics have also weighed in on the issue, with one writing off the minister’s statement as “nonsense”.

“Why should the majority respect the minority?” Ali Badri Zaini, the head of the East Java chapter of the Islamic Dakwah Forum, said in Surabaya as quoted by Metrotvnews.com.

“The minority should respect the majority. The minister is [talking] nonsense. The Islamic faithful in East Java will never do as he instructs.”

He said it was considered customary for all warung to at least close off their façade with a tarp so as not to tempt those who were fasting.

“If this rule is overturned by the minister, then it underlines that the minister is taking sides,” Zaini said.

The syndicate members were of Special Branch (SB) of police in Dhaka, Chittagong district range police, and Detective Branch (DB) of Police in Cox's Bazar. They were using their professional identity as shield for their illicit trade, Rab officials claimed.

Rab-7 seized a large consignment of yaba pills and arrested ASI Mahfuzur Rahman, 35, of SB, Dhaka, and his driver Jabed Ali, 29, in Feni Saturday night.

The syndicate was unravelled after a car carrying yaba pills was involved in a traffic accident.

They were shipping around 6.8 lakh of the pills, worth Tk 27.20 crore on the street, in a car owned by Mahfuzur's father, said a top Rab official in Chittagong.

Quoting Mahfuzur, Rab-7 Assistant Director Sohel Mahmud said Mahfuzur got the consignment from SI Belal of Cox's Bazar DB on Saturday.

The consignment was supposed to reach an SB constable and some of Belal's friends in Dhaka, added the Rab official.

Belal and SI Ashique, in charge of Kumira camp of Chittagong district highway police, told Mahfuzur to carry the pills, the Rab official said.

When asked, Ashique denied his involvement in the syndicate and said he did not know Mahfuzur.

A reporter of The Daily Star called Belal on his mobile phone several times but he did not pick up. His phone was switched off later on.

Muhammad Shamsul Alam Sarker, additional superintendent of police in Feni, said they heard about the arrest but Rab was yet to hand over the detainees as of yesterday afternoon, reports a correspondent in Feni.

A press note singed by Maj Mozammel Hossain, Rab-7 company commander in Feni, said a black Toyota Allion hit a boy at Lalpool area on Dhaka-Chittagong highway around 11:30pm Saturday.

Rab personnel on duty there chased the car down and seized it. They found the pills in the car.

Rab-7 also seized Tk seven lakh, four mobile phones, eight ATM cards and three note books from the detainees.

Our Chittagong correspondent reports: Rab-7 in the note books found names of 14 people from whom Mahfuzur took around Tk 28.44 crore in advance for yaba smuggling.

During primary interrogation, Mahfuzur admitted that he got to know some yaba traders while he was posted at the Waikong Police Outpost in Teknaf between 2011 and 2013, sources said.

Whishing not to be named, a top Rab-7 official said Mahfuzur owns a two-storey building and 10 to 12 shops at Sonir Akhra near the capital. He also owns three shops in Gulistan area.

Asked, State Minister for Home Affairs Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal told a TV channel that action would be taken against the accused as per the police law.

“Police has rules and regulation. The arrestee will be tried as per the police law. And proper action will be ensured through investigation,” he said.","Mon, 22 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/cops_yaba_held.jpg?itok=WpMD_pik,"['pills', 'tk', 'cops', 'official', 'business', 'seized', 'rab', 'yaba', 'syndicate', 'mahfuzur', 'sb', 'rab7']",

The country plans to invest a total $208 million on this project and remaining $20 million will be arranged by mobilizing domestic resources.The credit is financed from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group’s grant and low-interest arm. It will be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.The rehabilitation work of Guddu barrage will eliminate possible sources of failure and potentially give the structure another 50 years of life, according to a handout issued by the WB’s country office on Saturday.To close the gap between water supply and water demand, Pakistan is placing emphasis on modernising its ageing hydraulic infrastructure and improving water resources management. The water sector will remain a critical contributor to sustained economic development.According to the statistics compiled by the WB, Pakistan’s irrigation and drainage system has a total investment value of around $300 billion. Nearly 43% of the population gains employment from this system and it accounts for approximately $16 billion or one-fourth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).It said due to the country’s arid climate, high susceptibility to droughts agriculture in Pakistan is predominantly irrigated, and adequate irrigation infrastructure is critical. Sindh Province, in particular, contributes 23% to the agriculture and has high potential for further productive development.The primary function of the gated Guddu barrage is to service the irrigation of over one million hectare of agricultural land by feeding the Beghari Sindh Feeder and the Desert Pat Feeder main canals on the right side of the river and the Ghotki Feeder on the left side. The barrage is also used for river control and flood management. It is also an important transport link across the Indus River and provides cooling water for the thermal power station at Guddu.The continued operation and management of barrages require specialized expertise, experience, decision making, and continuity of the operation, said Rachid Benmessaoud, the World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.He said in addition to physical rehabilitation of barrage infrastructure, the project will also support the Sindh Government in training and technical assistance in procurement, financial, social and environmental safeguards for operating hydraulic irrigation infrastructure.The project will support the gate replacement work to improve the regulation and the flow of the barrage. All the 65 main barrage steel gates, 25 main canal head regulator gates, and hoist gears including all mechanical and electrical equipment will be replaced.This project will also finance the independent Panel of Experts, who will review, monitor, evaluate, and help guide the rehabilitation process with regards to the safety of the barrage.The effective operation and structural stability of the Guddu barrage are important for agricultural production and for averting potential disaster during floods, said Abdulhamid Azad, the task team leader of the project.The primary beneficiaries of the project are over 2.6 million people of irrigated land in Kashmore, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Sukkur, and Shikarpur districts of Sindh, and Nasirabad and Jafarabad districts of Balochistan, who will receive reliable supply of water.The improved structure will mitigate the impact of floods and reduce risks of embankment breaches; since the capacity of the barrage to pass flood waters will improve.","Sat, 20 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://tribune-reloaded.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/906948-guddubarrage-1434798738/906948-guddubarrage-1434798738.jpg,"['approves', 'project', 'million', 'rehabilitation', 'water', 'guddu', 'loan', 'barrage', 'world', 'irrigation', '188m', 'sindh', 'bank', 'river', 'infrastructure']",

During the last three months, the department shut down eleven other stations -- Mohendra Nagar, Annada Nagar, Chowdhurani, Naldanga, Trimohoni, Badiakhali, Mohimaganj, Bhelurpara, Kahalu, Altaf Nagar and Nasratpur.

Earlier, the BR authorities shut down five single track stations at Hasanganj, Kuptola, Salmara, Syed Ahmed College and Panchpir Mazar.

Now only 15 railway stations in this section are operational.

Those are Lalmonirhat, Teesta, Kawnia, Pirgachha, Bamondanga, Kamarpara, Gaibandha, Bonarpara, Sukhanpukur, Gabtoli, Bogra, Talora, Adamdighi and Santahar, said Abul Kashem, stationmaster of Gaibandha railway station.

""It needs ten employees including three stationmasters, two porters, four point men and a sweeper for smooth functioning of a station, but several stations are running with only three to four employees. Quite a few employees will go to retirement by next month. If the vacant posts are not filled up, it will be hard to continue operation of the existing stations,"" he added.

Mostafizur Rahman, divisional traffic superintendent of railway in Lalmonirhat, said, ""Employees' recruitment procedure on different occasions remained suspended due to filing of cases.

“The seminary is the heart of a diocese,” Bishop emeritus Lawrence Thienchai of Chanthaburi said in a June 13 interview.

He was one of the thousands of Catholics who marked the seminary anniversary with a Mass that witnessed the ordination of a new priest.

The bishop compared the minor seminary to a plant nursery. The seminary educates young boys in “holistic formation to become a holy priest”.

He said the seminarians are “formed with an academic discipline and helped to arrive a human maturity and maturity of faith” so that they can witness to Christ.

Even for boys who do not have a calling to the priesthood, the seminary formation imprints a distinct personality. The bishop said that these boys grow up to be laymen who radiate Christian teachings and accept responsibility for the mission of the Church. They also help their own children to discern a vocation to priesthood or religious life.

Bishop Silvio Siripong Charatsri, the current head of the Diocese of Chanthaburi, presided at the seminary’s June 13 thanksgiving Mass with Cardinal Michael Michai Kitbunchu, the Archbishop emeritus of Bangkok.

Two other bishops and over 100 priests concelebrated the Mass at a packed indoor stadium at the diocese’s Darasamutr School in the town of Si Racha. The Mass drew over 3,000 faithful including 150 nuns and 300 seminarians and novices from various religious congregations.

Bishop Silvio reminded the faithful of Pope Francis’ message for World Mission Day 2014: “Wherever there is joy, enthusiasm and a desire to bring Christ to others, genuine vocations arise.”

During the Mass, Bishop Silvio ordained a new priest for the Chanthaburi diocese. “It is a great occasion of joy for us to celebrate and reflect over this walk of 80 years and we are raising our prayers to God in thanks for this gift of priestly ministry,” said Fr Francis Xavier Kritsada Sukkaphat, rector of Sacred Heart Minor Seminary.

Since the permanent establishment of the seminary at Si Racha in 1935, the seminary has educated over 1,159 students. Its alumni include 164 priests, seven bishops and a cardinal. Many of the students who left the seminary continue to help in teaching and in various other ministries. The seminary now houses 85 seminarians.

“I am grateful to all the bishops, priests, formators, the seminarians, parents, parishes and the benefactors who have stood with us in the past and in the present and continue their prayerful support even in the future,” Fr Sukkaphat said.

Although the seminary has been at its current location for only about 80 years, it was founded in Bang Chang, the eastern region of Thailand, in 1872. It was permanently relocated to Si Racha, Thailand in 1934.

Bishop Silvio concluded the celebrations by thanking everyone for their respective roles in the pastoral mission of the Church and the seminary. He encouraged the faithful to pray for vocations and to be active in the mission of new evangelization.

After Mass, congregants sought a blessing from the newly ordained priest. The diocese also served lunch with traditional cuisines to all the faithful who had joined in the liturgy, helping to build friendship among the parishioners from various dioceses.

Thailand has 10 Catholic dioceses, many of which have their own minor seminaries. Older seminarians attend the country’s major seminary Lux Mundi in Sam Phran, north of Bangkok.

Less than one percent of Thailand’s population is Catholic. However, the Church plays a leading role in education and palliative health care.

The Church also plays a role in promoting human dignity and self-empowerment, especially in the tribal and hilly terrains of the country’s peripheries.

49,49,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Wrong message to foreign investors - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/wrong-message-foreign-investors-100429,"The government's plan to take back 2,000 acres of land out of nearly 2,500 acres from the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) would jeopardise an investment of $1.2 billion that South Korean companies are planning to pump into the economic zone.

Experts said it would send a wrong message to foreign investors who see Bangladesh as an attractive destination for relocating their factories at a time when the government is desperately seeking foreign direct investment to create jobs and boost economic growth.

An impasse between Youngone Corporation, the operator of the zone in Anwara in Chittagong, and the government has been going on for a long time over the government's delay in executing the deed transfer of the land it had allocated to the KEPZ in 1999.

However, the government has blamed Youngone for its failure to fully use the industrial land in the KEPZ.

In a meeting of the National Committee on Land Use in February this year, the prime minister asked the officials concerned to reclaim all but 500 acres of land as the rest has remained unused.

Senior officials of the KEPZ said they knew nothing about the meeting, as no correspondence was made with them about the decision.

In 2012, the 17th meeting of the board of governors of the private EPZ cell under the Prime Minister's Office decided that the deed of transfer for 500 acres of land would be executed initially, and the remaining land would be handed over later, depending on how well those 500 acres were utilised.

It prompted the KEPZ to file a writ with the High Court in July 2013, challenging the meeting's decision. The court stayed the execution of the decision and the issue is still pending with the High Court. Later, in May this year, the board of governors decided that the decision would be taken after the disposal of the writ.

Under the circumstances, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said in September last year that the government would take back 2,000 acres of land as Youngone had failed to use the allocated land.

Youngone was allocated about 2,500 acres of land after the deputy commissioner of Chittagong in 1999 received full payment for the land acquired for the industrial estate.

But the deed of transfer was not executed by successive governments although the issue is crucial to bringing investors to the KEPZ, said a senior official of the zone.

The Korea-based company even paid 50% more than the price for the KEPZ land, he added.

Although the government is saying that the KEPZ has not been able to utilise more than 500 acres of the allocated land, Youngone has legal obligations that it cannot use more than 1,200 acres, as it has to set aside 52 percent of the land for plantation, open areas and water bodies.

It can only use up to 48 percent of the land for factories, utilities, roads, accommodation, hospital, schools and other facilities.

The KEPZ has developed 1,165 acres of land so far, building 24 kilometres of roads and constructing 22 factory buildings. The development work of the zone is scheduled to be completed by 2019, according to Jahangir Saadat, president of the KEPZ.

Youngone, a South Korean company engaged in the manufacture and distribution of sportswear and shoes, and other Korean companies plan to invest $1.2 billion in the zone by 2020, setting up 150 factories in which 100,000 people could be employed directly.

Youngone has so far invested $150 million, developing infrastructures and setting up 22 factories despite non-cooperation from the government. It plans to raise the investment to $250 million by 2016.

Of the 22 factories, seven are running commercial operations, creating 11,000 jobs for local Bangladeshis. The rest of the factories would be ready by 2016, creating jobs for 43,000 more workers.

Zahid Hossain, lead economist of the World Bank in Dhaka, said this would give a wrong signal to foreign investors if the government took this unilateral decision on reclaiming the land. “It will set a bad precedent. The issue should be sorted out through a bilateral discussion,” he said.

He also said the government was setting up a number of special economic zones to woo foreign investors. “The foreign investors would seek guarantee that these zones will not be taken back in the future,” Zahid said.

Over the years, several foreign investors such as LG and Samsung contacted the KEPZ authorities to get plots, but had to back out for land-related complications.

Samsung was interested in setting up its factory at the KEPZ by investing funds to the tune of $5 billion to manufacture mobile handsets, but it could not proceed for these land issues, said Lee Yun-young, South Korean ambassador, in December last year.","Sun, 21 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/rmg_1.jpg?itok=3Dcvn_lI,"['zone', 'investors', 'wrong', 'kepz', 'acres', 'foreign', 'message', 'setting', 'factories', 'land', 'korean', 'youngone']",

During the entire tenure of UPA-II, the figure stood at 1,023. The citizenship to these refugees have been given at the initiative of Home Minister Rajnath Singh following BJP's declared policy that India is a ""natural home for persecuted Hindus"" who will be welcome to seek refuge.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, during the Lok Sabha election campaign, said that Pakistani and Bangladeshi Hindu refugees will be treated like any other Indian citizen.

There are around two lakh Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan currently living in India.

Ever since the Modi government assumed charge in May 2014, nearly 19,000 refugees have been given long-term visas in Madhya Pradesh.

Around 11,000 long-term visas were given in Rajasthan and 4,000 long-term visas were given in Gujarat, official sources said.

In April, the Home Ministry had rolled out an online system for submission of Long Term Visa application and for its processing by various agencies.

51,51,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Khaleda follows in Zia's footsteps - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/khaleda-follows-zias-footsteps-97276,"Is Khaleda Zia doing politics going against the philosophy and ideals of BNP founder General Ziaur Rahman by forging and maintaining electoral alliance with the anti-liberation and fundamentalist force Jamaat-e-Islami?

To find the answer, one must revisit the history of BNP.

Her reluctance to cut ties with Jamaat has a long, solid history. It goes back to General Zia – whose ascendancy to power as a military strongman after the August 15, 1975 bloody changeover was the beginning of the brightening future of the anti-liberation forces.

As Gen Zia gradually grabbed state power and transformed himself into a political leader, he introduced his own style of politics -- which appeared as a blessing for the anti-liberation forces and religion-based political parties.

In his efforts to consolidate his position in politics, Zia did not hesitate to make anti-liberation leader Shah Azizur Rahman a minister in 1978 and the prime minister the following year.

In 1978, Zia also made Abdul Alim a minister. Alim was convicted of crimes against humanity in 2013.

The military ruler also picked Justice Abdus Sattar as his vice president. Sattar had worked as Pakistan's Chief Election Commissioner after the independence of Bangladesh and he returned to Bangladesh later on. After Zia's assassination, Sattar kept on pursuing Zia's politics and appointed Shah Aziz as the prime minister again in 1981.

Gen Zia amended the constitution through martial law proclamations in 1977 lifting a constitutional ban on religion-based politics. This opened the door for anti-liberation political parties including Jamaat-e-Islami to resume activities in independent Bangladesh. Jamaat and some other parties had been constitutionally banned after the country's independence for their role against the country's Liberation War in 1971.

In addition, the Collaborators Order of 1972 was earlier repealed in the interest of anti-liberation politicians as the law had disenfranchised those parties and politicians who had opposed the birth of Bangladesh.

Eminent political scientist Rounaq Jahan in her latest book ""Political Parties in Bangladesh"" analysed that these leaders then became Zia's political allies and gradually became rehabilitated in Bangladesh politics.

Around 11,000 alleged collaborators who were detained under the Collaborators Order were also released by Gen Zia.

Zia also deleted secularism from the constitution for the same purpose. He did all this with the goal of strengthening his political power base.

BNP's senior leader Moudud Ahmed, who was an influential leader and minister of Zia's government, recollects the politics of Zia in his book ""Democracy and the Challenges of Development.""

He writes that as the party in power the BNP attracted all sorts of people into its fold -- the conservative right, Freedom Fighters, collaborators, communists, secularists, touts, opportunists and shameless sycophants -- all of them had to be accommodated.

""His (Gen Zia) sole aim was to maintain a balance between these widely divergent forces and in this he was successful. As a result every committee he formed was a mixed group that helped establish his own preeminence at the cost of cohesion and comradeship,"" writes Moudud.

Now come to the politics of the BNP under Khaleda Zia's leadership.

The BNP led by Khaleda had forged an unofficial compromise with the anti-liberation force Jamaat in some constituencies in the parliamentary election in 1991 to defeat the Awami League. The BNP also extended support to some Jamaat backed candidates in the same way.

Khaleda's BNP, after winning the 1991 election, made anti-liberation leader Abdur Rahman Biswas Speaker of the parliament. Within six months, he was elected the President of Bangladesh on BNP's nomination in October 1991.

In so doing, Khaleda followed in the footsteps of her husband Zia who had made Biswas a minister of his cabinet in 1979.

Khaleda Zia, however, had taken it to the next level.

During Gen Zia's regime, anti-liberation politicians were given important positions in the government only after they had joined the BNP.

But Khaleda Zia had shared power with Jamaat directly after winning the 2001 polls in which BNP and Jamaat were electoral alliance. She inducted Jamaat's Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami into her cabinet and gave him important portfolios -- first the agriculture and later the industries.

She also made Jamaat's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed a technocrat minister.

Both Nizami and Mojaheed were sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal on charge of committing crimes against humanity during the liberation war in 1971.

The International Crimes Tribunal-1 last year, while delivering the verdict in the Nizami case, strongly denounced the appointment of Nizami as a minister by the then BNP-led government in 2001.

The court said the appointment was a great blunder and a clear slap in the face for the Liberation War as well as three million martyrs and two lakh women who had sacrificed their honour for the liberation of Bangladesh.

The ""slap in the face for the Liberation War"" has no meaning to the BNP high commands.

For them, electoral alliance with Jamaat is a winning strategy for elections, as they did in 2001.

Together they had waged unprecedented violent street agitations in several phases against the AL-led government since 2013, but their agitation failed.

Khaleda still opts for maintaining a tie with Jamaat for returning to state power by winning the election. This clearly shows that she is following the political philosophy of Zia to consolidate power base by any means. Till date Khaleda Zia has not really done anything that disowns the anti-liberation forces.","Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/khaleda_2.jpg?itok=u3m7drcZ,"['follows', 'footsteps', 'minister', 'zia', 'antiliberation', 'politics', 'political', 'power', 'khaleda', 'jamaat', 'bnp', 'zias']",

Sources said that as a result of North Korea’s “military first” policy, the military police wield a vast amount of influence over a far-reaching network of contacts in the nation, which allows them to facilitate smuggling by soldiers along the border with China.



“Most smuggling has been carried out by soldiers, and it’s particularly difficult to smuggle in massive quantities without the help of the military police,” a source in North Hamgyong province on the border with China recently told RFA’s Korean Service.



“The military police smuggle precious metals, such as gold, silver, copper, nickel, industrial diamonds and molybdenum. They also smuggle resources belonging to the nation, and plants and animals, as well as historical items, cultural artifacts, drugs, and medicinal herbs,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.



Military police help smuggle the goods into China in return for consumer goods, such as food, fertilizer and daily necessities, which are then peddled inside of North Korea, he said.



North Korea’s military police force is divided into the Pyongyang Military Police under the direct control of the military’s central General Staff Department, the Mobile Military Police, the Garrison Military Police serving each provincial branch of the military, and the Train Crew Military Police, the source said.



The Garrison and Train Crew divisions are those most directly involved in smuggling, he said.



A second source living in Yanggang province, which also borders China, confirmed that the Garrison Military Police have been particularly helpful in furthering the work of the nation’s smugglers.



“There’s no problem using trains and cars [to smuggle] with the help of the Garrison Military Police, and people say, no matter how severe the crackdown is, all paths lie open if you have pull with that division,” said the source, who is a resident of Yanggang’s capital Hyesan.



“A few days ago in Hyesan, a military policeman stopped a vehicle and forced the people to get out and load [smuggled] goods sent for a military camp, but driver and passengers couldn’t say a word [in protest].”



Likewise, he said, smuggling has been carried out systematically by members of the Garrison Military Police along the border with China.



Sources in North Korea agreed that as long as the economy remains in shambles and the “military first” policy remains in effect, not only resources belonging to the nation, but historical items and cultural artifacts, will continue to flood out of the country into China.



Lucrative practice



In March, sources told RFA that authorities in North Korea were offering a variety of incentives, including increased food rations and Workers’ Party membership, to informants on would-be smugglers who try to cross the frozen Tumen River into China during the lean months of the winter season.



The sources said the rewards appeared to have been ordered by the Kim Jong Un regime as part of a bid to crackdown on the country’s pervasive smuggling problem.



In January, sources said that demands by North Korean border guards for a greater share of the profits of smuggling had slowed the movement of commodities across the border with China, causing hardships for North Koreans who earn a living by trafficking in goods.



They said at the time that because of tightened security measures put in place over the last year, the fees charged by guards delivering goods across the border had risen as high as 30 to 40 percent of the smugglers’ profit compared to 11 percent previously.

54,54,FL-2015-000068-BGD,A beginner's guide to fossil fuel divestment | Fossil fuel divestment - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/a-beginners-guide-to-fossil-fuel-divestment,"What is fossil fuel divestment?



Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of your investment capital from stocks, bonds or funds. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations.

It is the fastest-growing divestment campaign in history and could cause significant damage to coal, gas and oil companies, according to a study by Oxford University. Previous divestment campaigns have targeted the tobacco and gambling industries and companies funding the violence in Darfur. Divestment is perhaps most well known for its role in the fight against apartheid in South Africa.

What is the case for divestment?

Almost all of the arguments in favour of fossil fuel divestment fit into two categories: moral and financial.



First, the moral argument, which is rooted in basic maths. Scientific research shows that in order to keep to international targets to limit global warming to a 2C rise and thus prevent catastrophic levels of climate change, between two-thirds and four-fifths of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground. But fossil fuel companies are currently banking on these targets not being met so are extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. In doing so they are setting the human race on a route to irreversible climate change that will cause rising seas, flooding, droughts, rising disease, increased conflicts and refugee crises.

What is fossil fuel divestment and why does it matter? Guardian

The UN has lent its “moral authority” to the divestment campaign, while Desmond Tutu has said that “people of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change”.



Second is the financial argument, which rests on the premise that if international agreements on climate change are met, the investments will become worthless. The theory that these “stranded assets” are creating a trillion dollar “carbon bubble” that could plunge the world into another economic crisis is now the subject of an investigation by the Bank of England, after Governor Mark Carney said publicly that “the vast majority of reserves are unburnable.”

The World Bank has come out in support of the financial argument for divestment, with president Jim Yong Kim stating that: “every company, investor and bank that screens new and existing investments for climate risk is simply being pragmatic”.

Although the impact of divestment on share prices may be relatively small, the reputational damage can have serious financial consequences.

What is the carbon budget?

The carbon budget is the amount of greenhouse gas that can still be released into the atmosphere without exceeding dangerous levels of climate change – the 2C target agreed by governments. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) put a figure on the carbon budget for the first time, announcing that the world burns through about 50bn tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. It is also very likely that more than 20% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years after manmade emissions have stopped. This means that if we continue to emit at current levels, we will “spend” the carbon budget within 15 to 25 years. Given that we have already used two-thirds of the budget, the IPCC have urged governments to act quickly, using the carbon budget as the basis for international negotiations.

What is the carbon bubble?

The “carbon bubble” is a term that has been used by regulators, financial companies and campaigners to describe the over-valuation of stocks in coal, gas and oil reserves owned by fossil fuel companies around the world. If governments pursue international targets on carbon emissions in order to curb climate change, then between two-thirds and four-fifths of these reserves cannot be used, rendering them worthless. As fossil fuel companies are among the richest in the world these “stranded assets” have the potential to trigger a new global economic crisis if investors pull out in quick succession.

The carbon bubble could be inflating stocks worth trillions of dollars, according to a study published in 2013 by thinktank Carbon Tracker and economist Lord Nicholas Stern. He authored an eponymous 2006 report commissioned by Gordon Brown, then UK chancellor of the exchequer, into the economic consequences of climate change.

Shell has refuted the concept, predicting in a letter to its shareholders that fossil fuels would account for between 40% and 50% of the energy supply in 2050 and beyond. The Bank of England is currently conducting an investigation into the potential of a “carbon bubble” to damage the economy.

Who has divested?

More than 220 institutions around the world have now committed to some form of fossil fuel divestment, including pension funds, foundations, universities, faith organisations and local authorities.

A coalition of philanthropic foundations, including the heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune, started to pull out their investments last year, while cities divesting include San Francisco, Seattle and Oslo. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), recently revealed it had dropped 114 companies, including tar sands producers, on climate grounds.

The Church of England has divested from the most heavily polluting fossil fuels, while the World Council of Churches, which represents half a billion Christians worldwide, has ruled out all fossil fuel investments.

In October 2014, Glasgow University became the first in Europe to make the commitment. In the US, Syracuse University is the largest to divest from coal, oil and gas while Stanford University is removing its assets from coal companies.

On 23 June, the Lutheran World Federation of churches said it would divest from fossil fuel companies, which would affect current and future investments, though it did not yet know the value of funds that would be divested.

The rise and rise of the fossil fuel divestment movement

Who has decided against divestment?

A number of key institutions have explicitly refused to divest from fossil fuels.



In May, Swarthmore College in the US, the birthplace of the fossil fuel divestment movement, made the shock decision not to divest from any fossil fuels, stating that it would focus its environmental efforts on changing consumption habits.

In March, the Guardian launched Keep it in the Ground, a campaign calling on the world’s biggest charitable foundations – the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – to divest. Both institutions have so far refused to do so. The Wellcome Trust argue that engagement with fossil fuel companies is a more effective way to reduce carbon emissions, while the Gates Foundation have declined to comment.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson has recently rejected a call from the London Assembly to divest City Hall’s pension fund from fossil fuels. He said that divestment is “a cliff edge” and that the UK needs to rely more on fracking as an energy source.

UK environment secretary Liz Truss has refused to encourage the MPs’ pension fund to divest, telling the Guardian: “I believe the right way [to affect investment] is through carbon reduction targets.”

The president of Harvard University, Drew Gilpin Faust, has rejected divestment as “neither warranted or wise”, calling its endowment “an economic resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change”. The University of Edinburgh rejected calls for divestment, saying it would prioritise engagement with fossil fuel companies.

Is there a difference between divesting from coal, oil and gas?

Opinion is divided between campaigners and institutions on what level and type of divestment is necessary.

According to Liberal Democrat peer Lord Dick Taverne, the Keep it in the Ground campaign “ignores the need to discriminate between [fossil fuels]. The greatest threat of a dangerous rise in global temperatures comes from the world’s reliance on burning coal ... In the short or medium term, the most effective substitute for coal is gas. The US has recently reduced its carbon emissions more than any other major country, because it has switched from coal to gas.”

Several institutions have taken a similar line in their divestment decisions. Stanford university in the US and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine are two that have divested from coal alone, while the Church of England has specified thermal coal and tar sands oil, on the basis that these fuels are the most polluting in terms of carbon emissions.

But Jamie Henn of 350.org says it is important that institutions divest from coal, oil and gas: “none of [these fuels] are compatible with a liveable future. Coal is an easy target. Most coal industry stocks are so low that if you’re still holding on to them at this point, you’re either stupid or just spiteful. Divesting is just good common sense. That said, the commitments still make a huge impact, since they hasten the industry’s decline and help push governments to take action.

“Coal does the most to pollute our climate, but it’s the oil industry that does the most to corrupt our politics. They’re the major power players we need to stigmatise in order to make the space for progress,” he says.

Some, such as author and activist Naomi Klein, have called for the plummeting oil and coal price to be used as an opportunity to tackle climate change and “kick oil while the price is down.”

What are the arguments against divestment?

Critics of the fossil fuel divestment movement say that it is hypocritical because a globalised western society (and the individuals within it) are dependent on coal, oil and gas for their everyday lives. One group supporting an anti-environmentalist firm built it into their PR strategy, releasing this film:

Breaking up with fossil fuels is hard to do – Environmental Policy Alliance

Others, such as the Financial Times’ John Gapper, say that the movement should be targeting the companies emitting high quantities of carbon, rather than the producers alone. He argues that divestment is only a “grand symbolic gesture” that will not have a financial impact because others will pick up the shares.

Some, such as Times columnist Matt Ridley, argue that the movement is unethical on poverty grounds, because fossil fuels are needed to build the economies of developing countries. He says it demands that institutions “prioritise the possibility of the start of net harm in the time of our great-great-grandchildren over the plight of the poor today”.

Many of these arguments are refuted in 10 myths about fossil fuel divestment put to the sword.

We all use fossil fuels – isn’t divestment hypocritical?

Of course, much of the goods and utilities – from heating to plastics – that we use in daily life are dependent on fossil fuels. But the fossil fuel movement will not bankrupt the industry overnight – and indeed its impact is being felt largely though political means, not financial. Instead it argues that fossil fuels are driving us towards catastrophic levels of climate change and that the world needs to transition to much greater dependence on renewables – and do so much more quickly.

Consumers can of course be pro-active and make changes to their own lifestyles, which is important. Yet it is the producers who have the power to make the difference that will – or will not – see global temperatures breach internationally agreed targets to prevent climate change occurring on a catastrophic and irreversible scale. These producers are currently committed to business models that will take us well beyond that.

Won’t the fossil fuel stocks be bought by others?

Yes, others may buy the stocks, although the amounts being divested are too small to flood the market and cut share prices, so they won’t be going cheap.

This cuts to the heart of the impact of the fossil fuel divestment movement – which is not to bankrupt the industry financially, but to do so morally and politically. As research by Oxford University pointed out, the financial loss of the divestment campaign – the fastest growing in history – will not be felt through the shares sold but through the reputation lost by these companies by being stigmatised.

But the fossil fuel divestment campaign does not only make a moral assertion; it makes an economic one. Shares invested in fossil fuel companies are invested in a business model that is completely incompatible with international agreements on mitigating climate change. If governments abide by them, such investments will become worthless – so pulling them out now makes good financial sense too.

Will organisations that divest lose money?

Not necessarily – in fact they may even make money. Companies such as HSBC have warned clients about the risks of fossil fuel investments. Even though fossil fuel companies are some of the most lucrative on the planet, the “stranded assets” argument – that fossil fuel investments will become worthless if international agreements on climate change are met – suggests they are several times overvalued.

Coal prices have dropped significantly in the past few years and the oil price has also done so more recently. A recent analysis by MSCI, the world’s leading stock market index company, indicated that portfolios free of fossil fuel investments have outperformed those with assets in coal, oil and gas companies over the last five years.

There is also ample opportunity for investment in the green economy. Researchers predict that renewable energy will become the cheapest source of electricity in the next decade, with the cost of solar having fallen by two-thirds between 2008 to 2014, according to the IEA thinktank.

Won’t divestment mean losing influence with the companies?

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, takes this view arguing that “all fossil fuel companies are not equal” and can be influenced by active shareholder engagement. This is lost if an institution divests.

But there are few examples of engagement resulting in significant change. The Wellcome Trust, for example, say that they cannot share any such results without losing the confidence of those they engage with.

The one recent example that is often used are the shareholder resolutions at BP and Shell asking them to test the extent to which their business models are compatible with international agreements on climate change. However questions have been raised about the potential impact of the resolutions and the extent to which activists collaborated with the oil giants behind the scenes.

Shareholder engagement can work – to persuade companies to pay their workers the living wage or to adopt better recycling practices – but as campaigner Bill McKibben has pointed out, it is unlikely to persuade a company to commit to eventually putting itself out of business. Leading environmentalist Jonathon Porritt spent many years engaging with such companies but concluded recently that his efforts had been futile. It’s also worth noting that some market regulators, such as in the US, do not allow this kind of engagement.

Is my own money invested in fossil fuels?

Almost certainly. Most of the high street banks, including HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander, have millions invested in fossil fuel companies. Most investment funds, including the trillion dollar pensions industry, are heavily invested in fossil fuels and do not offer savers a fossil free option, although demand is rising. Responsible investment charity ShareAction can support you to approach your own pension provider, while Move your Money are campaigning for banks to divest.

As part of the Keep it in the Ground campaign, the Guardian has partnered with ShareAction to create an online tool to help you contact the right person at your pension fund easily. We will then help you decipher the responses.

Ok, I’m interested in divesting – what does it entail? How long does it take?

If you are interested in personally divesting or in putting pressure on institutions with which you are connected to divest, then see the previous question. If you are in a position of power in an organisation that may consider divestment, you should first consult your investment advisers. It is likely that they will direct you to the UN’s Principles of Responsible Investment, which although not insignificant they are principles alone and do not require any divestment.

A common first step is to freeze any new fossil fuel investments while conducting a review, which can often take several months. Different institutions have defined divestment in different ways, but the divestment movement asks for the removal of funds from the top 200 companies globally (100 coal companies and 100 oil and gas), as defined by the projected carbon emissions of their reserves.

Once an institution has committed to divestment, it can remove its direct investments in these companies – some do so with immediate effect, others choose to phase them out more gradually over a set time frame.

Next comes the issue of indirect investments: these are much more difficult to remove because they are in commingled funds which which are a blend of assets from different accounts. Managers who offer fossil-fuel-free options are currently in a minority. Investors can engage with managers or consultants about carbon risk or switch to managers who are able and willing to create fossil free accounts. This takes much longer; a five year time-frame is common.

Other organisations, such as the university of Sydney and a number of large pension funds, have gone down the route of decarbonisation. This means they commit to phasing out carbon emissions from all the companies in their portfolios rather than exclusively targeting those in fossil fuels. The UN has also supported a coalition of investors taking this approach, called the Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition

Where can the money divested from fossil fuel stocks be reinvested?

Although the fossil fuel divestment movement doesn’t stipulate where investors should move their money to, some institutions and campaigners have called for a focus on investing in the green economy. When Syracuse University divested from fossil fuels it also committed to investment in a number of clean energy solutions, including solar, biofuels and advance recycling. A number of key foundations who are part of the Divest-Invest coalition have taken this approach, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Wallace Global Fund.

Ikea is an example of a multinational that has focused on investment in renewables rather than divestment from fossil fuels – it has invested £1.1bn in renewable energy equipment, and last year met almost half of its global energy demand by generating its own renewable energy power. Ethical investment platforms can help with building a positive investment portfolio, such as Ethex, a non-profit that works with individual investors, financial advisers and social businesses to highlight financial viable alternatives to traditional investments on the stock market.

Navy Chief Muhammad Farid Habib and Air Chief Abu Eshrar adorned Abu Belal with the rank badge of General at Gono Bhaban in presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Welcoming the new army chief, the PM said Bangladesh Army is the pride of the countrymen. The military has been playing significant role in tackling aftermaths of natural calamities and consequent humanitarian aids apart from safeguarding country’s independence and sovereignty.

The prime minister also said her government has been sincerely working to build the armed force a modern and international standard professional force, and it will continue in future as well.

“We are a victorious nation in the liberation war and Bangladesh Army has been established during the liberation war,” Hasina said, and expressed hopes that the armed forces would move forward with the spirit of the liberation war.

Speaking on the occasion, Gen Belal said Bangladesh Army would be working for the development of the country as per the guidelines of the prime minister, keeping unwavering confidence on the constitution and the government, says a PMO press release.

Gen Belal succeeded Gen Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan who handed over the charge to him through a simple ceremony at the Army Headquarters.

Earlier in the morning, Gen Bhuiyan was given Guard of Honour at the Senakunja. He also placed floral wreaths at Shikha Anirban at Dhaka Cantonment paying rich tributes to those armed forces personnel killed in the liberation war of Bangladesh.

Gen Bhuiyan made best wishes to his successor and other army personnel present at the handing over ceremony and sought blessings for him.

It marks the first time that bears have been seen killing and eating dolphins. Usually, the dolphins only go up north during the warmer summer — but this year they have arrived in spring.

The bears catch the dolphins in a similar way to the seals that they usually eat. Both animals keep holes in the ice which they use to come up and breathe from — at which point, if the bear is lucky, it will snatch them up and eat them.

The researchers observed the behaviour for the first time last year. At least six different bears have been seen eating the dolphins since then, scientists write in a new report, ‘White-beaked dolphins trapped in the ice and eaten by polar bears’.

After eating the dolphin, the bear seemed to cover it with ice so that it could be kept for later. Such behaviour is rare in polar bears, and could be a result of the animals not having enough to eat.

The authors of the study describe the bear as having “clearly visible ribs” and being “very skinny”.

The habitat of polar bears is shrinking drastically as the Arctic warms. As such, scientists expect to be able to observe them much less in the coming years.

The same global warming appears to be trapping the dolphins, leaving them stuck and so able to be caught by the bears.

“We suggest [the dolphins] were trapped in the ice after strong northerly winds the days before, and possibly killed when forced to surface for air at a small opening in the ice,” the authors of the study write. White-beaked dolphins tend to travel north to Svalbard during the warmer summer, but haven’t been reported so far north in the early Spring.

58,58,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Litchis not that safe - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/litchis-not-safe-96262,"Last month, we ran a report on the bumper production of summer fruits and the government measures to check contamination of the produce. The report contained some encouraging developments. Recently, our correspondents visited different areas in the north to know about the situation on the ground. Today's report is on our findings on litchis.

The extent and incidence of applying pesticide on litchis in two Dinajpur upazilas looks alarming this year in the absence of government monitoring.

Following media reports for the past few years that farmers use excessive pesticides and harmful ripening agents on summer fruits, the government this season took some measures, however inadequate, to check it.

But talking to about a dozen litchi growers in Dinajpur Sadar and Biral upazilas, it was found that there is no programme or monitoring mechanism to prevent unnecessary use of insecticide, growth hormone and ripening agent on this fruit.

“I sprayed insecticide only yesterday [last week],” said Abdul Aziz Sarkar of Auliapur in Dinajpur Sadar while plucking litchis at his orchard.

Aziz is happy to have spent around Tk 40,000 on fertiliser and pesticide for his 42 litchi trees. The yield is high and he has made about Tk 2 lakh from the sale already.

From flowering to harvest, the permissible limit of spraying pesticide is three times, according to agro officials.

But Aziz, 50 years a litchi farmer, applied it around 20 times. For him, protecting his fruits from pest attack is all; he does not know the doses or the harmful effect of chemicals on health.

“Insects are increasing every year and we need to spray insecticide and medicine [hormone] at least once in every two weeks. I eat litchis on the day I apply pesticide. It is not harmful at all to our health,” he said.

CRACKS ON LITCHI SKIN

During a recent visit to an orchard at Maheshpur village of Biral upazila, The Daily Star found two workers using chemical on litchi. They said they usually sprayed insecticide once a week and even more when it rained.

Thanks to the overuse of growth hormones, the litchis in their orchard have grown so big that cracks have developed on the skins of most litchis.

“It happened because of the overuse of medicine [growth hormone],” said Obaidul, one of the workers, showing cracks on China-3 litchis in a tree.

Alarmingly, Obaidul could not even tell the name of the pesticide he was applying. He has no idea about its doses either.

Most of the time farmers rely on the advice of pesticide dealers who always push for maximising their sale. As a result, sale of pesticides and growth hormones shoot up during fruit season, agro officials say.

“We record the maximum sale of pesticides during the fruit season. It goes up by up to 60 percent during this time,” said Abdur Rashid, a pesticide seller from the Cheradengi area of Dinajpur town.

CAUSE FOR CONCERN

Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) has been examining seasonal fruits and found high quantity of pesticide like Organophosphorus in the sample.

“We have detected pesticides in 14 percent sample of litchis that came from Dinajpur [this season],” said Syed Nurul Alam, chief scientific officer of BARI.

Farmers do not need to use Organophosphorus on litchis, but they still do it on instructions of pesticide dealers, he said, adding that chemical residues remain in fruits for 10 to 12 days after application.

Experts say consumption of pesticide-contaminated fruits could cause serious diseases, including cancer, and damage kidney.

According to the Department of Horticulture, Dinajpur is growing litchis on 4,100 hectares land, compared to 3,100 hectares last year.

Production in the district is expected to be 30,000 tonnes, about 15 percent of the country's total production.

Asked about control and regulation, Imrul Ali of Dinajpur horticulture centre said they offered advice when farmers visited the centre and sought help.

“But we do not have any fund to visit their orchards or undertake monitoring programmes,” he told The Daily Star.

In June 2012, 14 children aged between two to 16 died in Dinajpur and Thakurgaon several days after eating litchis.

The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) suspected that the litchis were contaminated.

For confirmation, the IEDCR later sent to the US samples of blood and urine of children who had similar symptoms. The test found traces of pesticides in the blood and urine.","Sat, 13 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/litchis_1.jpg?itok=juXBWEc6,"['pesticide', 'insecticide', 'growth', 'season', 'dinajpur', 'litchis', 'sale', 'pesticides', 'litchi', 'safe', 'fruits']",

Kalinich, global practice leader for cyber/network risk, at consulting firm Aon Risk Services, was a panelist at the Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services 2015 Insurance Conference this week in New York where experts stressed the importance of underwriters working together to gain a better understanding of the market so they can properly assess and price cyber risk.

Demand for insurance covering cyber attacks is mounting and the risk is evolving rapidly, panelists noted. A number of U.S. insurers are testing the waters but panelists said that even the insurers with larger market shares have thus far been cautious due to the lack of actuarial data available in this nascent market. They have been writing policies with low limits and a slew of exclusions such as excluding damages resulting from data handled by an external contractor.

Current Marketplace

Right now, a handful of players — American International Group Inc., ACE Ltd., Chubb Corp., Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd., and Beazley Group Ltd. — dominate the market for cyber insurance, but panelists said clients are looking to buy more coverage than insurers are willing to offer.

As the market develops, providers will need some time to model risk sufficiently and to set premiums accordingly. This will remain difficult, Kalinich said, because the threat is evolving fast. He said two decades of reliable data are needed to feed models.

“We’re much farther along than we were two years ago; we have much better information now,” he said. “But it’s not a static model. It changes over time, and in two years it will be much better.”

Regulators have taken steps to guide insurers toward a consistent approach to the market. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) recently adopted guiding principles for insurers underwriting cyber risk.

Regulators Involved

The NAIC is also developing a set of best practices for insurance company examiners to test protocols and processes, as well as a consumer bill of rights so that consumers know when data has been hacked.

“The primary issue— the cornerstone of the whole effort-— is making sure we are seamless in information sharing,” said Adam Hamm, the North Dakota insurance commissioner and chair of its NAIC Cyber Taskforce. “The good news here is that that is happening. There’s a substantial amount of work being done to ensure that we’re working together and collaborating.”

So far, risk assessment has been inadequate because initiatives don’t specify the need for aggregated estimates of maximum possible loss, said Aon’s Kalinich. For example, if an insurer covers 1,000 companies, half of which share a particular risk, it’s difficult to gauge the aggregated risk, he said.

Relation to Other Lines

At the same time, it’s important for insurers and clients to understand where stand-alone cyber insurance fits with other lines–coverage could fall under a property/casualty policy, for example.

“If there’s a cyber attack that causes tangible damage to property, it could be covered under your property policy,” Kalinich said. “If there’s an attack that causes tangible damage to a third party, your general liability policy could cover it.”

Currently cyber insurance is written on a claims-made basis and primarily covers third-party liability in the U.S. First-party coverage (covering the cost of investigating and securing the site of the technology breach, as well as losses) is available only sparingly in the U.S.

With large retailers such as Home Depot and Target, banks such as JPMorganChase and Citibank, and health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross all suffering cyber breaches, experience shows no company is safe.

National Security

Jason Healey, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative for the international affairs think tank the Atlantic Council, looks at the issue from a national security perspective.

“From that perspective, none of the attacks have been big,” Healey said. “One of the reasons I don’t think cyber-attacks have been that bad yet is that it’s relatively easy to bounce back from them.”

He said it does not appear anyone has died from a cyber-attack. “Essentially, what’s lost are ones and zeroes, and it’s really easy to replace ones and zeros,” he said.

Yet with the increased linking of concrete-and-steel structures–such as power grids–to the cyber world, there’s an increased danger that people could be hurt or killed, and that an economy could suffer irreparable damage, according to Healey.

“It’s going to get worse before it gets better–without a doubt,” Healey said.

Lax Controls

Kalinich said he sees little coordination within companies themselves. He related a tale in which Aon visited a client and found that 19 percent of employees were still using their system’s default password–which was “PASSWORD.” When advised of this, the company implemented a policy to force workers to change their passwords to access the system. During a visit six months later, Aon discovered that 23 percnt of employees had their new passwords on notes stuck to their computers.

Hamm agreed that better intracompany coordination is essential. “If this is an issue that stays in your IT department, you’re probably not going to be around much longer,” he said.

Healey warned that risks change quickly and hackers have become sophisticated. “It used to be that those with intent didn’t have capabilities and those with capabilities didn’t have the intent; that has changed,” he said. “I think we’re coming up on the Internet’s most dangerous moment.”

61,61,FL-2015-000068-BGD,MLZD's visitor centre has rammed-earth walls and an aviary - Dezeen,https://www.dezeen.com/2015/06/22/mlzd-lakeside-ornithological-visitor-centre-rammed-earth-walls-aviary-lucerne-switzerland-lake-sempach-birds/,"Walls made from compressed earth combine with timber-clad surfaces and glass to help this visitor centre for the Swiss Ornithological Institute complement its natural setting on the banks of a lake (+ slideshow).

The institute is situated on the shore of Lake Sempach to the north west of Lucerne in central Switzerland. It houses a non-profit organisation that studies wild birds and their habitats, raising awareness of their needs among stakeholders including the Swiss government, planners and nature conservancy groups.

Swiss architecture studio MLZD was invited to design a visitor centre for the institute accommodating a new exhibition space and information services for the public, as well as a care centre for treating sick or injured birds.

The new facility replaces an existing centre that was situated in a protected area close to the lake. It is now located outside of this area on an irregularly shaped plot between the lake and a road leading to the village of Sempach, which informed its angular plan.

""The architecture formulates a passage or entrance from the urban to the natural surroundings,"" the architects told Dezeen. ""The building shapes reflect these different surroundings by reacting differently.""

""The shapes differentiate the spacial and visual connections so the building appears well integrated and much smaller than it really is. But the shapes also refer to the restrictions set by the given area and building laws of the lake protection area.""

The centre comprises two angular structures connected by a large foyer. Elevations facing the road are largely solid, while the rear facades incorporate full-height windows that provide expansive views towards the lake.

The building's load-bearing outer shell is constructed from rammed earth using a technique involving the gradual compacting of layers of damp earth in a mould to form solid walls.

This building method, which uses natural materials and has a low environmental impact, was chosen in response to a brief calling for a building that exhibits a strong ecological profile. Rammed earth is also extremely durable and has excellent thermal properties.

""We designed the building to be integrated with the lakeside,"" explained the project team. ""Wood and rammed earth intensify this impression because both materials are found at the lake.""

One of the building's volumes contains a flexible exhibition space dedicated to birdlife and the work of the institute.

The other houses an auditorium and care centre on the ground floor, with a learning space on the level above and minimally decorated bedrooms for boarding interns who spend time working at the institute on the top floor.

The foyer area features a reception desk and entrances to the various facilities accommodated in the two structures on either side, as well as a glass-walled aviary housing birds that are too weak to survive in the wild.

A casual seating area positioned next to the aviary enables visitors to observe birds in this enclosure, or look out on the lake through the adjacent windows.

""The exhibition area doesn't show living birds so the aviary and the lookout at the lake give a connection to the living creatures,"" said the architects. ""We incorporated the aviary because it forms a transition between inside and the nature outside.""

In the foyer, the external walls of the two polygonal structures become internal surfaces with openings carved into them to accommodate doorways and windows.

The earth surfaces are complemented by wooden canopies over the main entrance at the front and a terrace at the rear.

Decking and joinery including exposed roof beams continue the application of natural materials throughout the exterior and interior of the building.

Rammed earth has seen a revival in recent years, with architects around the world using it to create structures that are more environmentally friendly than their concrete counterparts. Mexican architect Tatiana Bilbao used the material on a weekend house, while Herzog & de Meuron specified it for a herb processing plant in Switzerland.

Eating Together

Rating:

All telly is escapism, but the property shows that go househunting abroad, on the Med or further afield still, are more than merely fantasies. Many of these buyers seem to be running away from reality.

Lots of us would love a second home, a source of endless holidays. Uprooting yourself and leaving friends, family and familiar foods behind for ever is very different.

The presenters playing estate agent on shows such as A Place In The Sun never mention this, of course. They’re peddling the illusion of a perpetual vacation. But I can’t watch without fretting.

What happens when the runaway homebuyers get fed up of the local food? Anyone who has tried shopping in a Spanish or Italian grocery store knows how impossible it is to get a proper tin of baked beans.

What about Marmite? And teabags? And orange squash? An Englishman can live without these staples for a fortnight, at a push . . . but after six weeks, panic would start to take hold.

Kevin McCloud shares my concerns about foreign travel, on Escape To The Wild (C4). He doesn't hide his doubts over the wisdom of building a home on a desert island or in the depths of a rainforest — in fact, he never stops grumbling about how ridiculous the entire project is.

The Atkinson family, Londoners fighting for survival in their own jungle clearing in Belize, treated their guest with amused tolerance as he stumbled around, terrified of snakes and scorpions, and plainly loathing the heat and humidity.

Former publishing executive Richard, his wife Alisa and their three children have struck camp in a patch of lush forest where the annual rainfall is four times greater than Britain’s. With no savings, they live on what they can barter for their crops of bananas and coffee.

Richard has planted 800 cacao trees, and dreams of developing a range of chocolate bars for connoisseurs. Kevin was dubious but, though he likes to complain, he’s too polite to spell out to people how dangerously mad their schemes really are.

Never mind the poisonous creepy-crawlies — the Atkinsons’ pet dogs had been killed by jaguars. How can it be safe for children to play outside when big cats are marauding?

Kevin is the presenter of the long-running architecture programme Grand Designs, and what he’d really come to see was Richard’s spectacular folly . . . a jungle palace built from 25,000 plastic bottles, 1,000 car tyres filled with earth, and 18,000 transparent bricks made from glass bottles.

All the building materials had been scavenged from the local rubbish dump, a fetid, smouldering hell-hole two miles away, haunted by vultures.

The presence of this rotting landfill pointed to the greatest danger threatening this castaway family: they were not alone in their jungle. Somewhere nearby, there were slum towns — and Belize is one of the most violent, crime-ridden countries on Earth.

Richard carried a gun but he and Alisa, their teenage son and their two young daughters were appallingly vulnerable. This was no ‘escape’ — it was blind folly.

64,64,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Ethics of Self-Driving Cars: Should They Kill Driver to Save Others? - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/06/16/371939.htm,"Imagine being in charge of the switch on a trolley track.

The express is due any minute; but as you glance down the line you see a school bus, filled with children, stalled at the level crossing. No problem; that’s why you have this switch. But on the alternate track there’s more trouble: Your child, who has come to work with you, has fallen down on the rails and can’t get up. That switch can save your child or a bus-full of others, but not both. What do you do?

This ethical puzzler is commonly known as the Trolley Problem. It’s a standard topic in philosophy and ethics classes, because your answer says a lot about how you view the world. But in a very 21st-century take, several writers (here and here, for example) have adapted the scenario to a modern obsession: autonomous vehicles.

Google’s self-driving cars have already driven 1.7 million miles on American roads, and have never been the cause of an accident during that time, the company says. Volvo says it will have a self-driving model on Swedish highways by 2017. Elon Musk says the technology is so close that he can have current-model Teslas ready to take the wheel on “major roads” by this summer.

If autonomous vehicles turn out to be far safer than regular cars, would the government be justified in banning human driving completely?

Who Watches the Watchers?

The technology may have arrived, but are humans ready?

Google’s cars can already handle real-world hazards, such as cars suddenly swerving in front of them. But in some situations, a crash is unavoidable. (In fact, Google’s cars have been in dozens of minor accidents, all of which the company blames on human drivers.) How will a Google car, or an ultra-safe Volvo, be programmed to handle a no-win situation — a blown tire, perhaps — where it must choose between swerving into oncoming traffic or steering directly into a retaining wall? The computers will certainly be fast enough to make a reasoned judgment within milliseconds. They would have time to scan the cars ahead and identify the one most likely to survive a collision, for example, or the one with the most other humans inside. But should they be programmed to make the decision that is best for their owners? Or the choice that does the least harm — even if that means choosing to slam into a retaining wall to avoid hitting an oncoming school bus? Who will make that call, and how will they decide?

“Ultimately, this problem devolves into a choice between utilitarianism and deontology,” said UAB alumnus Ameen Barghi. Barghi, who graduated in May and is headed to Oxford University this fall as UAB’s third Rhodes Scholar, is no stranger to moral dilemmas. He was a senior leader on UAB’s Bioethics Bowl team, which won the 2015 national championship. Their winning debates included such topics as the use of clinical trials for Ebola virus, and the ethics of a hypothetical drug that could make people fall in love with each other.

In last year’s Ethics Bowl competition, the team argued another provocative question related to autonomous vehicles: If they turn out to be far safer than regular cars, would the government be justified in banning human driving completely? (Their answer, in a nutshell: yes.)

Death in Driver’s Seat

So should your self-driving car be programmed to kill you in order to save others?

There are two philosophical approaches to this type of question, Barghi says.

“Utilitarianism tells us that we should always do what will produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people,” he explained. In other words, if it comes down to a choice between sending you into a concrete wall or swerving into the path of an oncoming bus, your car should be programmed to do the former.

Deontology, on the other hand, argues that “some values are simply categorically always true,” Barghi continued. “For example, murder is always wrong, and we should never do it.” Going back to the trolley problem, “even if shifting the trolley will save five lives, we shouldn’t do it because we would be actively killing one,” Barghi said. And, despite the odds, a self-driving car shouldn’t be programmed to choose to sacrifice its driver to keep others out of harm’s way.

Every variation of the trolley problem — and there are many: What if the one person is your child? Your only child? What if the five people are murderers? — simply “asks the user to pick whether he has chosen to stick with deontology or utilitarianism,” Barghi continued. If the answer is utilitarianism, then there is another decision to be made, Barghi adds: rule or act utilitarianism.

“Rule utilitarianism says that we must always pick the most utilitarian action regardless of the circumstances — so this would make the choice easy for each version of the trolley problem,” Barghi said: Count up the individuals involved and go with the option that benefits the majority.

But act utilitarianism, he continued, “says that we must consider each individual act as a separate subset action.” That means that there are no hard-and-fast rules; each situation is a special case. So how can a computer be programmed to handle them all?

“A computer cannot be programmed to handle them all,” said Gregory Pence, Ph.D., chair of the UAB College of Arts and Sciences Department of Philosophy. “We know this by considering the history of ethics. Casuistry, or applied Christian ethics based on St. Thomas, tried to give an answer in advance for every problem in medicine. It failed miserably, both because many cases have unique circumstances and because medicine constantly changes.”

Preparing for the Worst

The members of UAB’s Ethics and Bioethics teams spend a great deal of time wrestling with these types of questions, which combine philosophy and futurism. Both teams are led by Pence, a medical ethicist who has trained UAB medical students for decades.

To arrive at their conclusions, the UAB team engages in passionate debate, says Barghi. “Along with Dr. Pence’s input, we constantly argue positions, and everyone on the team at some point plays devil’s advocate for the case,” he said. “We try to hammer out as many potential positions and rebuttals to our case before the tournament as we can so as to provide the most comprehensive understanding of the topic. Sometimes, we will totally change our position a couple of days before the tournament because of a certain piece of input that was previously not considered.”

That happened this year when the team was prepping a case on physician addiction and medical licensure. “Our original position was to ensure the safety of our patients as the highest priority and try to remove these physicians from the workforce as soon as possible,” Barghi said. However, after the group met with Dr. Sandra Frazier — who specializes in physicians’ health issues — he said they “quickly learned to treat addiction as a disease” and totally changed the course of their case.

Barghi, who plans to become a clinician-scientist, says that ethics competitions are helpful practice for future health care professionals.

“Although physicians don’t get a month of preparation before every ethical decision they have to make, activities like the ethics bowl provide miniature simulations of real-world patient care and policy decision-making,” Barghi said. “Besides that, it also provides an avenue for previously shy individuals to become more articulate and confident in their arguments.”

The association’s chief executive, Liz Mann, said unlike other field crops that are potentially climate sensitive, maize can be grown Australia-wide. Mann added that there was stong global demand for the crop, with new export opportunities opening up, particularly in Asia.

“Maize production is unique compared to other field crops in Australia because it has the widest geographical spread; growing from tropical North Queensland, down to Victoria and Tasmania, and across to the Northern Territory and the southern regions of Western Australia,” Mann explained in a press release. “Its hardiness and its potential for higher returns in comparison to some other traditionally grown crops makes it a perfect addition for those who are thinking of branching out and diversifying from their current cycle of crops.”

New South Wales farmer John Bruce began planting maize almost two years ago in a bid to diversify his cropping operations. While the additional crop helps boost his income, the move was also influenced by his access to water, the need to maximise his land assets better and access to reliable local markets.

“They call maize the recipe crop because it’s very easy to grow, however it is critical that it’s planted properly,” Bruce said. “It doesn't compensate like other crops so if you don’t have good crop emergence because of poor sowing techniques or other factors you are costing yourself yield. We grow our maize on flood irrigation so it is quite labour intensive as opposed to rice, which we also grow, but it is a very ‘feel-good’ crop and the return on investment is very good.”","Mon, 22 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://upload.evocdn.co.uk/fruitnet/uploads/asset_image/2_23138_e.jpg,"['crop', 'good', 'field', 'crops', 'maize', 'root', 'mann', 'grown', 'taking', 'australia', 'grow', 'bruce']",

69,69,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Why Ted Nugent's Uneven 'Scream Dream' Marked End of an Era - Ultimate Classic Rock,https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ted-nugent-scream-dream/,"Ted Nugent woke up from a Scream Dream in June 1980. It was a rather fitting title for Ted’s sixth full-fledged solo effort (notwithstanding earlier releases with the Amboy Dukes), since Nugent’s high-flying solo career was losing altitude fast.

Epic Records, his longtime label, was losing faith in an artist who, until very recently, seemed as unstoppable as a force of nature. With the release of a career-defining triumvirate of LPs (1975's Ted Nugent, 1976's Free-for-All and 1977's Cat Scratch Fever), Nugent had established himself as a reliable platinum seller. Before too long, Nugent had been crowned the highest-grossing tour act in America, too.

His studio magic began waning, however, when 1978’s Weekend Warriors barely went platinum. That was followed by 1979’s merely gold-certified State of Shock. Now, Scream Dream was lending further evidence to this disturbing commercial trend, as it quickly slid down the Billboard chart after the brief promise of a Top 15 debut.

The reason: Scream Dream’s songs rarely paid the rent on the vinyl grooves they occupied. Obvious exceptions included a momentary return to gonzo greatness via by the album’s undeniable first song, “Wango Tango,” and the ensuing, frantic title track (backed by a quaint, pre-MTV music video where Ted practices facial contortions worthy of comedian Jim Carrey while being haunted by the same animals he was so fond of hunting).

Listen to Jeff Beck Perform 'Wango Tango'

Elsewhere, intense rockers like “Hard as Nails,” “Violent Love” and “Come and Get It” may have had their moments, but they were largely recycled from those aforementioned peak-period LPs. The promising “Spit it Out” lost every ounce of goodwill because of its lyrics.

Even worse, second guitarist Charlie Huhn’s “I Gotta Move” and “Don’t Cry” were little more than jumped-up ‘50s rock workouts; “Flesh and Blood” was poorly produced and “Terminus Eldorado” saw Ted on some weird ZZ Top trip that didn’t pay off in the end.

Ultimately, the wildly inconsistent Scream Dream was emblematic of difficult era for Ted Nugent, who was by turns either experiencing some career growing pains or – given the almost impossible standards set by earlier LPs – a victim of his own success. In any case, time was running out on Nugent’s Epic deal, as this marked his final studio effort for the label.

Epic would also release the following year’s reliably explosive live document, Intensities in 10 Cities. The next decade, however, would be filled with constant change and adversity – just like a sequence of not-so-good dreams. Even so, Ted Nugent did everything on his terms, then as now.

Because of this necessity, insurance practitioners are expected to practice applying a high ethical standard; they are expected to know their profession. Education is one part of that higher standard.

But, how is ongoing, continual education viewed within the insurance industry? Does the insurance industry view ongoing education and training as a “nice-to-have” or a “must-have?” More importantly, how does a true insurance professional view insurance training and education? (How do you view education?)

Formalized ongoing career training within and outside the insurance industry is generally undertaken for one of five reasons:

To satisfy an employer requirement (to “check the box”); As a way to obtain a better performance rating on the annual employee evaluation (stay out of trouble); Solely to move up the corporate ladder (a selfish motive); Simply to meet statutory requirements (many in the insurance industry fall into this category); or As a way to improve and increase career-related knowledge to become proficient (and professional) in the chosen career.

Key Assertion: True insurance professionals actively seek relevant and continual education, training and improvement to become more and more proficient. These professionals have and apply high ethical standards when making decisions regarding education.

Can this assertion be supported? Yes, provided there is an understanding of what “ethics” are and how a truly ethical professional prepares to help his fellow man (including clients / customers).

In the following paragraphs ethics are defined, societal standards are presented and specific questions are posed to help you define your personal standards regarding education.

Defining Ethics

Ethics derives from the Greek word, “ethos.” An ethos of a people is the group customs or character. Webster’s defines “ethics” as: “The discipline of dealing with right and wrong, or with moral duty and obligation.”

Ethics allows man (in the broad sense) to understand human behavior by creating expectations of another person’s behavior. Ethics create the boundaries or rules of “acceptable” behavior, allowing a society to “judge” whether a particular person’s behavior is right or wrong.

Note, that ethics are a group decision, a group opinion of what is right or wrong. Because of this fact, ethics can vary from group to group, country to country or even industry to industry (meaning the insurance industry has its own ethic).

“Types” of Ethics

Ethics can be discussed and debated or actually practiced – thus there are two types of ethics:

Theoretical / philosophical ethics; and Practical / applied ethics.

Theoretical or philosophical ethics are those about which we debate, discuss and pontificate. These delineate the “ideal” – in a given situation, “THIS” is how a man should act or respond. Theoretical ethics are the basis for the case-study answers the class gives in every ethics class. But are the answers given in class and theoretical ethics the reality?

Practical or applied ethics are what we actually do, what we allow from our fellow man and what we accept from a particular industry. Applied ethics are a bit less stringent and far less consistent than theoretical ethics. One example of this type of “ethic” is the “little white lie” fallacy – “It is OK to lie if no one gets hurt or someone’s feelings are spared.”

In our daily lives, is lying right or wrong? Apply theoretical/philosophical ethics and the answer is always “no.” But if my wife asks me, “Do you like my hair;” or one of my kids ask, “Do you like the drawing I made for you,” and my applied or practical ethic regarding lying might be different.

Which type of ethic should be applied at work? Which type is actually practiced? Think hard before giving an answer. Consider recent dealings with the boss, an underwriter, the agent, the client or a regulator. Are there any “little white lies” or “relative truths” (not really a lie, but not totally the truth) in any of these interactions?

Behavioral Standards and Ethics

Picture behavioral standards like a pyramid – a bottom-up construction with the lowest level being the easiest to accomplish and successive levels more challenging to reach. This pyramid has four levels:

Legal standards; Governmental standards; Business and professional standards; and Moral standards.

Legal Standards: Legal standards are the lowest standard and hopefully the easiest to reach – just don’t break the law. But there is a paradox in play in how legal standards relate to ethics (right and wrong): Being legal doesn’t make the action “right,” it just makes it allowable. But sometimes, all that is expected of the person (the “right” thing to do) is that he meets the legal standard because no higher standard is expected.

Governmental Standards: These standards are just a little higher than the “legal standard.” Governmental or regulatory standards are necessary when the industry being regulated is necessary for the optimal operation of a free market society. Legal standards don’t go far enough to protect the public, thus regulators make industry-specific rules. Insurance is an integral part of and necessary for our free market society, thus regulators have developed laws that apply specifically to the insurance industry (i.e. laws related to rebating, twisting, claims settlement, etc.).The same paradox applies governmental standards that applies to legal standards – sometimes this is the only standard expected.

Business and Professional Standards: This is the highest level of group opinion. Business and professional standards are set by the industry to represent and enumerate the ideal actions of a person within that industry. But as the legal and governmental paradox states, sometimes to meet business and professional standards, one must only meet legal and governmental standards. The best attribute of business and professional standards is that compliance with them is largely voluntary. Individuals and entities voluntarily agree to abide by the standards of a group. Once the decision is made to act in accordance with these higher standards, performing at less than those standards is unethical behavior (this includes education).

Business and professional standards are created by one of three types of organizations:

Trade Associations (i.e. IIABA, NAPIA, NAMIC, etc.); Professional Societies (CPCU Society); or Service Organizations (Rotary, Kiwanis, etc.).

Moral Standards: Unlike ethics, morals are the standards of the individual rather than the group. Thus, “moral” and “ethical” are not necessarily synonymous. There can actually be a gap between the individual’s morals and the group’s ethics. In fact, the gap between a person’s morals and the group’s ethics can widen over time as the group opinion of right and wrong changes.

The actions of a moral person are ALWAYS greater than and sometimes equal to the expectation of the group. Why? If a person’s “moral standard” (their individual standard) falls below society’s ethical standard (society’s expectations), he is considered unethical.

Ethics and the Four Behavioral Standards: Ethics and “ethical behavior” actually fall outside the standards pyramid, encompassing every level in the pyramid. Remember, to be ethical requires the person to act in a manner that is acceptable to the group. A person’s actions may be considered ethical if all she meets are the legal or governmental standards. Conversely, some interactions require a person to act in accordance with the standards of the trade association (or professional society, or service organization) to which he belongs for the actions to be considered ethical.

A Fifth “Standard”: There is fifth standard that does not fit within the standards pyramid – the corporate standard. The corporate standard is a “non-person” standard – the standards of the company for which the person works. This is better known as the “corporate culture.” This “standard” has a direct impact upon the individual and her adherence to the various standards.

Some corporations seek to do only what is required – meeting the legal and regulatory standards. Some pay lip service to high ethical standards, but in daily activities do little more than is required. But some corporate entities actually do more than is required for their customers and employees.

Education and Your “Standards”

True insurance professionals understand the necessity of ongoing, career-focused training and education. Insurance professionals apply high business and professional standards when deciding among various training and education options. Conversely, non-professionals seek the lowest level of the ethical pyramid when making education choices.

What is your goal and motivation when seeking and undertaking training? What guides you in your decision to take (or not take) a particular class or course of training? True insurance professionals and those who just “work” in insurance answer these questions very differently.

Do you take a specific class simply to garner the necessary continuing education hours to avoid losing your license? If so, you are satisfied with meeting the lowest behavioral standard. This attitude and action falls below business and professional standards.

Likewise, will you NOT undertake useful training simply because CE is not given? “I would love to take that webinar, but there is no CE provided.” If your sole reason for not undertaking particular training is the lack of CE that indicates a low personal standard.

True insurance professionals view the availability of CE as a bonus, not the sole or main reason for taking a specific class. Check your reason for taking or not taking class.

Are you motivated to learn? Do you read the newspaper or something else during class just to pass the time? If learning is not a key motivation, this, too, is a symptom of your acceptance of a less-than-professional standard.

Regardless of your reason or motivation, there are times when you don’t have a choice, the “corporate standard” insists itself upon your standard. “I would like to take that class, but my employer won’t let me (or won’t pay) because there is no CE.” Short of paying for the class/training yourself, you are a victim of the corporation’s lower standards. Shame on the culture for not approving relevant and useful insurance education and training.

Insurance professionals seek to apply the highest standards regarding education and training. Content is king. Every effort is made by the professional to obtain highly useful training and education rather than simply staying compliant with the law.

“Ethical” Conclusion (or Dilemma)

Given the importance of insurance to a free market economy, being a well trained professional is absolutely necessary. Because on-going, career-related education is necessary, there is an “education ethic” for those calling themselves insurance professionals. Failing to meet this standard is a matter of individual morals and personal standards.

What is YOUR education standard – your “education ethic?”

Imphal, June 17 2015 : Once a beautiful village, Chadong village is now flooded with water from the Thoubal Multipurpose Project built over the Thoubal River (Yangwui Kong) .



The project which consists of Maphou (Mapithel) Dam was constructed against the wishes of upstream dwellers.



With construction nearing completion, water from Thoubal River has started flooding almost all farmlands which belong to villagers of Chadong village.



Strongly reacting against the action of the State Government for not considering the pleas of villagers affected by the project, villagers of Ramrei, Chadong, Riha and Thawai today held a public meeting to reaffirm their stand against the project.



Representatives of Mapithel Dam Affected Villages Organization (MSAVO), Citizens Concern for Dams and Development (CCDD), village authority members and women society of Chadong village took part in the public meeting where they discussed their next move against stopping the Thoubal Multipurpose Project.









Protest staged against the project

Headman of Chadong village, Wungnaoyo commented that the State Government has been constructing the project without taking any consent from villagers in the name of development.This so called 'development' has forced hundreds of innocent villagers out of their homesteads.The act is more of human right violation rather than development.""The Government adopted forceful methods to construct the dam using military might and divide and rule technique on the affected villagers"", he added.Meanwhile, secretary of Mapithel Dam Affected Villages Organization (MSAVO) P Grace expressed concern on the plight of the villagers as the river has been blocked by the authorities concerned and the water has begun to submerge the village.""With the onset of monsoon, Chadong village will be completely submerged in just a week's time and villagers will be forced to become refugees in their own land"", said Grace.He further demanded the construction of Mapithel Dam be stopped and let the Thoubal river flow freely.He added that the project is destined to fail as it has been constructed against the wish of many people.Grace added that the project is a covert agenda to acquire land through the Land Acquisition Bill which may be enforced soon in the whole country.Further he expressed concern that the impact of the dam will be felt well and there is high possibility of natural disaster in the area.The project has victimized many communities of the State and has destroyed land and natural resources which must be stopped, stated Convener of Citizens Concern for Dams and Development (CCDD) Jiten Yumnam.""The way Maphou Dam has been constructed raises serious question on how well it will perform as many multipurpose projects in the State have failed in the past,"" stated Jiten.Recommendations of the Expert Review Committee which was formed in 2008 was completely neglected by the State Government in the construction of the project showing signs of aristocracy, stated a pastor of Chadong village in the meeting.It may be mentioned here that there is a pending case against the State Government for constructing the project from the High Court of Manipur and the National Green Tribunal.As a sign of unwillingness against forceful blocking of Thoubal River, militarization in the area and destroying the livelihood of the people, villagers held a slogan protest and reaffirmed their stand against the Thoubal Multipurpose Project.","Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://e-pao.net/images/epicon.ico,"['chadong', 'state', 'project', 'epao', 'multipurpose', 'turned', 'villagers', 'lake', 'thoubal', 'mapithel', 'headlines', '18th', 'dam', 'jun15', 'river', 'village']",

©Notts Sport

As part of Cricket World's goal to assist clubs in areas such as groundcare, administration and fund-raising, we bring you the latest in a series of articles where experts in their field give their top tips, this time focussing on artificial pitches.

Plenty of work goes into the successful maintenance of an artificial pitch throughout the season, so we have teamed up with James Coney (total-play Ltd), Mark Wood (Notts Sport), Mandy Greenwood (Playrite) and Kevin Underwood (ClubTurf).

You can of course ask any questions of your own or make your own observations in the comments below!

Why choose an artificial surface/wicket?

James Coney: Not only are artificial playing surfaces a low-maintenance option – a great choice for grass-roots clubs without full time professional grounds staff – but they offer consistent, balanced performance whatever the weather. They also offer balanced play between bat and ball so ensure all members/players are kept happy!

Mark Wood: Notts Sport’s ECB approved non-turf match pitches offer different pace, bounce and spin characteristics. Systems can be tailored toward ‘starter pitches’ for young players, through to a facility for 1st XI matchplay. Maintenance on Artificial surfaces is easier to maintain than natural surface and can also be played in most weathers and straight after a heavy downpour.

Mandy Greenwood: An artificial wicket is a durable and cost effective way to give your club a low maintenance, consistent cricket playing surface. Another benefit is for clubs with small squares or limited space an artificial wicket is ideal for junior matches and practice.

Kevin Underwood: Participation is key and there is no doubt that artificial match pitches can increase participation. Most cricket clubs and a lot of schools will already have an established cricket square but the cost of maintaining and looking after fine turf pitches has escalated over time.

Groundstaff salaries have risen and demand for cricket pitches for junior and senior cricket has increased dramatically over the last 20 years. Clubs and schools have finite resources so something has to give.

Sadly it is often junior cricket pitches that take the brunt as the resources are spent on preparing the senior team’s pitches. A well maintained and looked after grass pitch is undoubtedly the best surface to play cricket on especially for the young. However, a poorly maintained or tired grass pitch can be dangerous and detrimental to the development of young cricketers. An artificial match pitch can take the pressure off the groundstaff and in a lot of cases provide a better and more consistent surface for cricket.

Why choose an artificial surface for nets and practice areas?

Mark Wood: For non-turf practice areas, Notts Sport can configure practice lanes pace, bounce and spin characteristics to suit players of all ages and abilities. Maintenance on Artificial surfaces is easier to maintain than natural surface and can also be played in most weathers and straight after a heavy down pour.

Artificial practice lanes can also include the Notts Sport coaching lines which are incorporated in to the surface and help with training.

Mandy Greenwood: Artificial surfaces are ideal for nets as they can take an extreme amount of use, are hard wearing with good longevity and minimises maintenance costs on the upkeep on natural practice areas. The performance on artificial are consistent and available to play in poor weather conditions without damage to the grounds.

They also enable players to start pre-season practice outdoors when natural wickets will not be fit.

Kevin Underwood: If a grass cricket square is expensive and difficult to maintain the costs of a grass practice area are beyond all but the richest cricket clubs and schools.

The problem is that during practice the bowler bowls from one end and the batsman bats at the other end. On a grass or artificial match pitch the wear and tear is evenly balanced at both ends. If you use a practice pitch for the same length of time as a match pitch you double the wear and tear in the same area at both ends.

There is a limited life to natural grass practice pitches which results in having to produce as many practice pitches as you do match pitches to produce one lane for practice. If you want two lanes you would have to produce double the amount of practice pitches as match pitches. A grass practice square will produce more work than a grass match square and as I have already said most club’s and schools can barely afford to maintain the match cricket square.

Artificial practice pitches don’t suffer the same wear and tear as grass practice pitches so the maintenance cost is a fraction. There are two standpoints on what a practice pitch should provide. Some believe practice pitches should closely mimic the grass match pitch you play on and provide the variability and movement of a grass pitch.

Others put more of a onus on development and coaching which requires more consistency and less realism. ClubTurf and the other companies in the industry supply systems to meet either of these requirements.

James Coney: One of the most attractive things is cost – fine turf wickets and practice nets can cost thousands to constantly prepare and maintain, non-turf wickets and practice nets are an ideal solution for restricted budgets like schools, council owned sites, youth clubs, grass-roots clubs etc....

Durability is also a benefit – practicing on an artificial surface will reduce wear and tear on your natural wickets. In terms of performance, investing in a surface that meets ECB approved performance standards will mean that you get to hone skills on a playing surface that has been proven to meet the requirements of the National Governing Body for cricket in England and Wales.

For example, our tp365 ECB approved design (pictured below) has been developed to offer cricketers a balanced game between bat and ball; encouraging thus helping batsmen develop all the key skills they need for the modern game.

How much maintenance is required on an artificial wicket/surface? What sort of maintenance?

Mandy Greenwood: Maintenance will still be required on your artificial wicket, but the intensity will be much lower in both cost and time.

An artificial wicket will still require rolling at certain times of the year. Moss and algae repellent will need applying again periodically. Costs are difficult to say and dependent on whether local voluntary labour is available, actual material costs are minimal.

Kevin Underwood: All artificial pitches require some maintenance. Even concrete and tarmac pitches may require weed kill and moss kill and will require regular brushing and marking. Dynamic based pitches which include the majority of artificial pitch systems require further maintenance to ensure the consolidation of the upper base or hard porous layer. This may include worm deterrent if there is an issue in that area.

Dynamic based pitches require maintenance to ensure that the hard porous surface is level and even and any marks made by the ball are ironed out even through performance pads. If the hard porous surface becomes dinted the pitch will become inconsistent and this will be made worse as the surface dries and hardens.

In dry conditions the maintenance reduces back to just brushing and marking but if the bounce gets too high or there is inconsistency you can water and roll to produce lower or more consistent bounce.

The systems without performance pads like our ClubTurf “Natural” are the most realistic or play the most similar to natural grass. The balance is that they require greater maintenance as the hard porous layer is more open to impact and dinting so these systems require a greater level of rolling after use in wet weather.

The thicker or the greater quantity of performance pads slows down the pitch and provides a less realistic bounce characteristic. The balance is that these pads provide greater protection to the hard porous layer thus reducing the amount of rolling maintenance.

James Coney: Low maintenance does not mean NO maintenance. To ensure your artificial playing surface fulfils its potential both in terms of longevity and performance, you will need to carry out regular maintenance tasks such as clearing the surface of debris and carefully checking any seams to nip any problems in the bud.

Our premier tp365 system doesn’t require rolling or watering by the client and carries a extensive warranties (10 years for carpet; 30 years for the aggregate sub-base) – however, we do prescribe a series of simple, regular maintenance tasks for clubs to undertake to ensure their surface continues to offer optimum performance throughout its lifespan.

This includes guidelines on what footwear is suitable; and how to clean, brush and carry out surface edging and paint crease lines. We also explain works that clubs should definitely NOT attempt to carry out themselves – like surface re-levelling, carpet re-tensioning and repairs, and replacement of worn carpets and shock-pads that should only be carried out by skilled operatives.

Mark Wood: With regards to maintenance, this table shows an overview of what is required:

Requirement Detail Frequency Sweeping Removal of debris and grass cuttings Weekly (& Before each match or practice session) Marking Re-marking of lines Weekly as required before match or practice session Surrounds Mowing of the surrounding grass Weekly (During the season) Vegetation Deal with any moss, algae or weeds. Also apply a yearly prophylactic treatment Monthly if required / Annually Rolling Roll to firm the base up prior to the start of the season and roll during the season to increase pace Annually / As and when required Repairs Inspection Check for damage or wear on the surface or the nets and cage Weekly Stump Box Water, roll and work the clay in the stump box if required Every 2 months (or as required)

Of this, the most important aspects of the maintenance are:

Clean, sweep and weed kill the top surface regularly to counter weed/moss growth.

Keep the facility’s sub-base fully compact and level by rolling as and when needed – if compaction falls this will reduce the set pace (water the base first or wait until after heavy rainfall – roll across the width of the pitch).

Guard against ‘bat tapping’ at the popping crease and the use of spiked footwear as, all though very resistant, artificial grass is unlikely to withstand constant misuse of this nature.

Where is the best place to put your artificial surface for nets?

Kevin Underwood: Most grounds have limited space so that is usually the main limiting factor.

The first thing we look at is orientation and we try wherever possible to install the facility as close to north-south as possible. The sun sets in the west in the evenings and if the sunset impacts on the practice area dazzling the batsman or the bowler there are obvious health and safety issues.

Ideally the practice area will be off the ground so that practice can take place during games without impacting on the ground. If we can fully enclose the practice area then we achieve the same goal of ensuring practice is possible during games. This isn’t always possible and we have to install practice areas that hit out onto the outfield.

As the facility won’t be used during games this limits the amount of nights the facility can be used and increases the amount of capacity you need (increase lanes) and the cost.

The main concern for the club is always cost as even though grant funding is sometimes available the club will have to provide some if not all of the funding for the facility. As we have said practice areas that can be used while games on require fewer lanes (lower cost) but there are a number of different factors that can increase the cost. Levels, drainage, services, concrete or walls, trees or roots and ground conditions to name but a few.

We always recommend that practice areas be near access points if possible as they will be used more. However we also like to move them to the edge of grounds to maximise the use of the land and to ensure full maintenance of the area around and behind the facility. Sometimes if you don’t move into the corner the area behind gets neglected and unsightly as it is unused and unusable.

James Coney: This is very site specific, but the minimum requirement is to position new nets and wickets on a North – South orientation to avoid dangerous sun glare at certain times of the day.

Ideally, we’d recommend facilities are built close to existing pavilions/club houses to provide security and ensure younger members can be observed by parents whilst buying refreshments to help boost club funds through secondary spend.

Wickets should be positioned on the edge of a square as opposed to in the middle and practice nets ideally on a flat area. However, with our in-house experience, plant and machinery we can turn even the steepest site into a non-turf practice area that meets ECB guidelines.

Mark Wood: It is easy to go for an unused are in the corner of the ground as it is wasted space, but in reality who is going to walk to the other side of the field to practice? It is best to site them as near to the pavilion as possible so that they will get the most use.

You should pick an area that offers a decent run-up for the bowler, that ideally doesn’t encroach on to the outfield, as it would not be of use when playing a game.

Also, try and look for somewhere as flat as possible; whilst work can be done to level an area, it is important that the run-up is level with the facility too. Finally, the orientation is important; you should choose ideally a North or South direction so that the batsman is not troubled by the Sun setting during evening practice.

Mandy Greenwood: Apart from avoiding the sunset in the evenings the location is best to suit each individual club.

Do artificial surfaces require animal/pest control measures?

James Coney: In the case of practice nets yes - rabbits and foxes love to chew netting, and this can be managed by using anti-rodent measures such as skirts (PVC and mesh netting) or by installing gates at open ends to stop pests entering the system.

With wickets, you just need to regularly brush the surface to remove any animal droppings, but other than that they don’t tend to attract much activity.

Mark Wood: The only thing that comes to mind on this is the need for a Vermin skirt around the bottom of netting on a practice facility. This reduces that chance of rabbits etc chewing holes in the netting. There aren’t really any other measures I am aware of.

Mandy Greenwood: Prior to the base being laid protection should be considered to prevent damage.

Kevin Underwood: As I have said under maintenance all artificial grass can suffer from weeds and moss and this should be treated as required. The bound systems concrete and tarmac don’t suffer from worms but any dynamic system can be infected by worms.

Some grounds have a natural propensity to be worm infested and some grounds don’t. Worms can have a very bad impact on cricket squares and outfields and attract other animals such as moles. The simple answer is if the area you choose for your practice area or match pitch has had signs of worms you should treat with a worm deterrent.

Worms bring soil into the hard porous system of artificial pitches gradually breaking down the dynamic base. The more open the system the greater the likelihood of worm infestation but even sealed systems can have worm problems as it only takes the smallest space for worms to infest.

Are artificial surfaces resistant to all weather types?

Meet The Contributors James Coney (total-play Ltd)

James Coney, Business Development Manager at total-play Ltd, an ECB Non Turf Pitch Code of Practice installer which has developed its own range of artificial playing surfaces, including the ECB approved tp365 design Mark Wood (Notts Sport) Operating from headquarters in Leicestershire, England, Notts Sport has built a world-class reputation which doesn't rely on high-profile marketing strategies, but on high-quality products and word of mouth recommendation. Mandy Greenwood (Playrite) Mandy is marketing manager at Playrite, who pride themselves on innovation and offering the highest quality synthetic surfaces. Kevin Underwood (ClubTurf) Kevin is Operations Director at ClubTurf, providers of ECB-approved artificial pitches. He has worked for ClubTurf for the last 13 years.

Mandy Greenwood: Artificial surfaces are billed as all-weather surfaces because they can be used in most types of weather, by this we mean that the surface and the playing characteristics are not affected by the weather, an artificial wicket is usually a free draining surface which will not hold water.

Mark Wood: Certainly whilst in the ground it is resilient to a lot of weather, but there are occasions you wouldn’t use it due to the rest of the area / ground being too wet.

During the winter a pitch can affected by frost heave which can cause movement in the base, meaning that it needs rolling after winter to firm up (as mentioned under maintenance).

Flooding is also an issue for artificial pitches, as levels will be affected by the amount of water and in some cases materials have been lifted during floods. But during normal weather the pitches should be fine.

Kevin Underwood: The name “all weather” used to be used about artificial surfaces but it isn’t completely true.

Certainly you can’t play with lying snow or ice. The artificial grass used for cricket pitches tends to be quite short but this also makes it not stud proof. If the bowlers and fielders are not wearing studs then play is determined by ground conditions in the outfield so if the ground is very wet and slippy play will not be possible.

On the same topic just because play is possible on the artificial it doesn’t mean that it is in the interests of the club for play to continue in heavy rain. Clearly the grass pitches for the weekend will not be able to be covered and the dead ends of old pitches will become mud baths if players walk and skid through them when they are wet.

Practice areas can be used in wet conditions but the surface can become slippy if mud from outside the area is carried on to the surface on the bowlers shoes. If the area is fully enclosed or has an extended run up then this will open the area up to being used more in different conditions. The answer is that an artificial pitch can be used in a lot more weathers than a natural grass pitch which is a definite plus in rainy countries like the UK.

James Coney: Artificial surfaces are designed to withstand reasonable year-round weather conditions, but it’s important to regularly clear surface debris and check for any problems that may have occurred.

Inundation by flood or extremely heavy, long-lying snowfall may cause problems including very small particle detritus left on the carpet and disturbed surface levels, so we’d recommend calling in the experts to carry out a thorough check of the system under these circumstances.

How long do artificial wickets normally last?

James Coney: Different suppliers use different designs and materials, so it’s hard to give a ‘one size fits all’ answer, but our tp365 ECB approved system carries a warranty of 10 years for the carpet and 30 years for the aggregate sub-base, so as long as maintenance advice is followed and any component replacement/re-levelling works carries out as recommended by the supplier, these facilities can last decades.

Kevin Underwood: This is more than one question really as there are different components that make up an artificial pitch. Our systems are made up of three or four layers and each layer has a different life expectancy.

If we start at the bottom we install a lower base or stone raft which provides good drainage and a solid foundation. The lower base will improve with age and in theory may never need replaced as it will have moved with the land and the land will have moved with it to a point where it has become part of the land.

The upper base will require regular maintenance to keep it consolidated and to keep it level. There will be some movement and filtration of the hard porous layer and it will need topped up. We recommend a periodic maintenance every 5 years. In reality you are not replacing the whole upper base but actually just adding a little bit of material that it has lost so the actual base will last indefinitely.

The performance pads and shock pads have a lifetime but as they are not open to the sun UV light they have a long lifetime of 20-25 years depending on impact and wear and tear. In heavy use areas the pads will need renewed as often as 10-15 years but in low impact areas they can have a very long lifetime.

The surface carpet is impacted on by UV light and therefore has the shortest life expectancy. I am not going to get into the debate about carpets but we choose to use wilton woven carpets out of a choice of many different types of carpet as we think it is the best.

Our ClubTurf wilton woven carpet has an average life expectancy of 10-12 years. We have pitches that ClubTurf have surfaced 4 times since the brand started in the mid 1970’s a recent example was a pitch that we installed in 1978 resurfaced in 1990, 2002 and again last year 2014.

Mandy Greenwood: The life-span of a wicket depends upon the construction, with woven wickets proven to have surpassed the life-span of a tufted surface time and time again, from a replacement fund being put in place you should expect up to 10 years on the playing surface.

Mark Wood: A good quality surface should give you 10 years plus if maintained correctly with top quality ones offering over 12 years. And if you choose a quality base system, it should then just be a case of re-surfacing rather than replacing the whole base. For example, our Envelope system which protects the aggregate. A good base could last up to 3 times as long as a surface.

Are artificial surfaces suitable for all ages?

Kevin Underwood: A large part of the answer to this question is dependent on how well the facility has been looked after and maintained since installation. This is also true for natural grass surfaces.

If a natural grass surface is suitable for all ages then an artificial surface is as well. In some ways performance pad pitch systems are more consistent and sanitized and probably more suitable for young cricketers than natural grass pitches.

Having played a lot of cricket in my life I have played on a lot of cricket pitches in many different parts of the country and there is no such thing as a perfectly consistent natural grass pitch. If you watch test cricket it is glaringly obvious that the pitches have their own pace and bounce and there are variances. If this is true at test level then multiply infinitely for club level especially for under prepared junior pitches.

Mark Wood: Absolutely. They are an ideal coaching aid as they offer a more consistent performance than grass and so it can give young players confidence when being coached knowing that they can for example get forward without fear of a ball suddenly shooting up.

Especially with something like the NottsBase D System, which is consistent all year around and ideal for coaching. They are also ideal for junior matches as little preparation is needed especially when matches tend to take place early in an evening when there isn’t time to prepare a grass strip. They even offer a good surface for something like Kwik Cricket rather than using an uneven outfield with long grass.

James Coney: Yes, total-play systems are ideally suited for players of all ages and all abilities; this is reflected in clients that range from grass roots clubs and primary schools through to first-class/county clubs including Essex CCC and Hampshire CCC.

Mandy Greenwood: Yes, they are great surfaces to play on. Often improving the enjoyment for younger players as they have a consistent bounce, which helps greatly in practice.

C ement prices are climbing as U.S. construction picks up and a mix of factors -- industry structure, strict environmental rules on factories and limited imports -- keep a lid on cement capacity.

Demand for cement comes primarily from construction of homes, office buildings, highways and infrastructure. Drilling of oil and gas wells also creates a portion of demand. Cement is the gray powder made from limestone and clay in industrial processing plants called kilns.

Cement producers also generally quarry and refine aggregates -- sand, gravel, and crushed stone. Mixing cement with crushed stone and water makes concrete, the stuff of skyscrapers and backyard porches.

Cement makers build factories close to their main markets. Moving cement by truck is so costly that it rarely travels more than 250 miles by road. Aggregate suppliers generally stick to a range of around 50 miles.

Cement production is largely concentrated in Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Michigan, and Alabama. Prices for cement varies from $85 to $100 per ton, depending on the local market, says Trey Grooms, analyst at Stephens.

Prices have posted high single-digit increases in Texas, despite a slowdown in oil production, mainly thanks to spending on public infrastructure. An upswing in construction is boosting other local markets.

""Texas is pretty well sold out, we've seen some rapid price increases there over the last year and a half, and even with the tough weather prices seem to be holding up,"" said Grooms. ""Some price increases in other markets are getting traction. It's a regional business. At the other end of the spectrum, you're in the 65% to 70% capacity utilization range in California. Denver's been sold out, that market has been strong. The Midwest is probably closer to 80% range and parts of the South are in the 80% to 85% range.""

Mergers Drive Industry Benefits

IBD's building-construction group ranked No. 44 on Friday out of 197 industries. An improved outlook for residential and commercial construction has pushed up group EPS estimates. Aggregates pricing has accelerated nationwide, according to a Goldman Sachs report.

Martin Marietta Materials ( MLM ), which acquired Texas Industries in 2014 in a deal valued near $3 billion, is looking at 2015 EPS growth of 45%, analysts estimate, followed by estimates for a 42% gain in 2016. Its earnings rose 41% in 2014.

Vulcan Materials' ( VMC ) current-year EPS is expected to rise 120% as it continues to rebound from three years of losses through 2012.

Eagle Materials ( EXP ) estimates project a 27% gain, down from 37% in 2014 but still healthy. Earnings growth for the thinly-tradedU.S. Concrete ( USCR ) is projected at 28%, before a 4% decline in 2016.

""Last fall and into the beginning of this year pretty much all the companies revised their numbers up, with industry checks suggesting pricing was getting stronger on cement and aggregates,"" said Grooms. ""Recently, some markets have been hard hit by weather and there may be some revision to Q2. But the underlying demand is still very good and there may be some pent-up demand.""

Martin Marietta's purchase of Texas Industries has been positive for the industry, says Todd Vencil, analyst at Sterne Agee CRT. Martin Marietta is much more aggressive on pricing than was Texas Industries. In Q1, Martin Marietta reported an 18% price increase for its West group, primarily driven by Texas Industries facilities.

Martin Marietta in 2012 tried to acquire Vulcan Materials, leading to a legal dispute. Analysts do not expect merger talks to rekindle.

While Martin Marietta, Vulcan Materials, Eagle Materials, andSummit Materials ( SUM ) are regional players, global cement players have a big U.S. presence. They include Lafarge of France and Switzerland's Holcim as well as Mexico'sCemex (CX), Ireland'sCRH (CRH), Italy's Buzzi Unicem, and Germany's Heidelberg.

Lafarge and Holcim have been grappling with merger negotiations for more than a year. Lafarge reported $12.8 billion in 2014 revenue, while Holcim hovered just below the $20 billion mark. (For comparison, both Martin Marietta and Vulcan's 2014 revenues were a bit more than $2.9 billion.) Holcim has the bigger U.S. presence of the two and, in 2009, opened a huge cement plant off the Mississippi River in St. Genevieve, Mo.

Divestitures required by regulators in order to approve the combination will shift some U.S. assets. Summit agreed to buy Lafarge's Davenport, Iowa, cement plant in a $450 million deal.

""It's a good deal for Summit,"" said Vencil.

Summit, whose biggest investor is Blackstone group, went public in March. The Denver-based operation has been on an acquisition spree since 2010, rolling up aggregate, ready-mix concrete and other building materials suppliers.

The proposed Lafarge-Holcim union is also benefiting CRH, which has seen its revenue flatten at just above $24 billion over the past four years. CRH agreed in February to purchase divested operations in Canada, Brazil and the Philippines for about $7.5 billion. In the U.S., CRH operates through Atlanta-based Oldcastle Materials. North America is a bright spot in the global cement market as building momentum weakens in Asia, especially China -- a market that is already oversupplied with cement.

U.S. Anchors Solid Growth

The Portland Cement Association forecasts that worldwide cement consumption will grow 2.2% in 2015, 3.7% in 2016 and 4% in 2017.

The U.S. market is expected to grow 7.5% in 2015 and 7.9% in 2016, says the PCA.

While the U.S. will provide a near-term boost, most global players are still focused on expanding production in emerging markets, where countries like Indonesia and Morocco are expanding public infrastructure and housing. India is a key market for Holcim and others, but price competition is intense. In the Middle East, Lafarge has been set back by political turmoil.

""In terms of the near-term financial performance, the U.S. is absolutely important (to global companies),"" Edward Sullivan, the PCA's chief economist, told IBD. ""But when you build a plant, you're building it for a minimum of 30 years. If you look at the expansion that has gone on worldwide, it's outside developed countries. The long-term ROIs (return on investment) are in sub-Saharan Africa, emerging Asian-Pacific areas and in South America.""

When construction slows, cement demand dries up. The average U.S. factory capacity utilization rate fell to the low '60s after the U.S. housing bust of 2007. Cement consumption peaked at around 121.8 million tons in 2005, says the U.S. Geological Survey, falling to 68.1 million tons in 2010. The aggregates industry saw production volumes peak in 2006 at 3.1 billion tons and trough in 2010 at 2 billion tons, says Grooms.

During the recession, cement makers mothballed some factories and closed others. U.S. cement plants now number at 98, down from 107 several years ago, says Sullivan. Companies may put some idle plants back to work as utilization rates rise, he says.

A hike in cement imports won't come until utilization rates top 90%, Sullivan added.

Imports aren't likely to flood the market and pressure prices, Vencil says, because major cement producers control most marine terminals. During the early 2000s housing boom, imports accounted for 30% of cement consumption as demand boomed.

The PCA has forecast that cement consumption will rise to 93.3 million tons in 2015 and 103.2 million tons in 2016.

Environmental regulations make permits to expand cement plants difficult to obtain. To get them, companies must upgrade to cleaner, more energy efficient technology. Cement plants generally burn coal for energy. Cement plants produce large amounts carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. Cement kilns must comply with new limits on mercury emissions starting in September.

About five plant expansions are in the works through 2018, including Lafarge factories in Ravena, N.Y., and Joppa, Ill.

Industry capacity may creep, but not jump up, says Sullivan. He estimates that industry capacity could rise to 105 million or 110 million tons, up from 99 million tons, where it has been stable in recent years.

Grooms has a similar view.

""You don't have to get back to prior industry peaks to see capacity constraints get tighter, which will translate into higher pricing,"" he said. ""As we see demand improve, (the) market will get tighter and tighter. Within the next few years, the entire U.S. will likely be in a sold-out scenario, with more pricing increases. This cycle could last several years.""

Worse than those compilations of Inzamam-Ul-Haq run-outs. Worse than Steve Harmison bowling to second slip or Darryl Tuffey’s 14-ball over. You can watch it again and again, squirming more each time yet strangely compelled to click replay, the only time Channel Nine’s lunchtime filler has approached the genius of The Office.

It’s the Boxing Day Ashes Test in 2013. Michael Slater – the accidental David Brent – is presenting with Michael Vaughan. Their guests are Australian players Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry. Women’s cricket is getting six minutes of airtime amid five men’s Tests. In those six minutes Vaughan’s contribution consists of four questions about the men’s series and 35 seconds narrating footage of himself on a British dance show. Slater manages to praise the women for being attractive, admit he doesn’t know who won their last series, make cat-fight noises to portray them sledging, ask how they physically cope with playing cricket, and claim credit for Perry’s career after “I let her get me out” in an exhibition game.

It’s a tour de force. But the champagne-fountain centrepiece of this glittering shit-show comes with a segue-free transition. Lanning is vice-captain of a national side at 21 while Perry represents Australia in two international sports. So, logically, the producers cut to footage of both women doing modelling shoots. The host has been prepped: he gives what passes in Slatish for an introduction, then as the camera lingers uncomfortably on images of Perry in a bikini, so does he. “Ellyse is just… it’s just taking full flight with these shots. What’s going on there, you are… you are looking fantastic! Do you enjoy doing that?”

Safe to assume she doesn’t while a dude twice her age is sitting next to her, frothing at the corners of his mouth like the creepiest of uncles. “It’s much better wearing a set of cricket whites on the field,” says Perry pointedly. Freshly-sharpened-pencil pointedly. “Don’t be embarrassed,” replies Slater with a time-honoured deflection, as though embarrassment is an innate personal phenomenon and not the result of unwelcome attention.

Cricket Australia still have the segment on their website. No worries boys, this is how to talk to the ladies. Point out things like this and there is always someone who will call you humourless, but you need a sense of humour to truly appreciate the woeful. The first mention of women’s cricket was probably enough to see half of you close the page, but the article in front of you is a lot more relevant to men. In writing it I could only conclude that cricket has deeper problems with women than tone-deaf interviews, even interviews that array those problems in perfect microcosm. Women in the game don’t need this pointed out, but those of us who outnumber them might stir our natural curiosity about things we haven’t had to notice.

The most embarrassing cricket footage I’ve ever seen

A month after that interview its key participants returned to the scene. Australia and England had a Twenty20 double-header – first the women, then the men. I walked into the MCG that day and stopped dead. Having followed the women’s game through scoresheets and TV, this was my first glimpse of a live field of play.

I’d previously scoffed at Big Bash boundaries: acres of unused space left to a passing array of henchmen, jugglers, acrobats and flamethrowers, so that any toe-ended slog hanging in the air like limp asparagus might plop apologetically for six amid the circus where a not-so-deep midwicket would once have held a catch. But for this game the boundary was further circumscribed – of the mighty MCG turf it seemed barely half was used.



All I could wonder was how the women about to take that field could fail to feel demeaned. On 8-bit logic it made sense: if women can’t hit as far, make the boundary smaller. But any game is about using your skill to gain mastery of its conditions, not easing the conditions to the point that you can master them. Repainting an entire dartboard as a bullseye will not improve your aim.

It’s part of a pattern whereby the women’s game is – in all respects – reduced. Women play Tests over four days, not five. Those Tests are one-offs, not series. Their Ashes contest rests on limited-overs games. Double-headers are granted like favours, but their summer decider could be a curtain-raiser to a meaningless men’s T20.

Whatever the practical arguments, these things can’t help but give a perception of the women’s game as quantifiably lesser, smaller, a pat on the head. Don’t strain yourselves, there’ll be extra breaks. And peppermint tea stalls. And hair curlers in the change rooms. And smelling salts if you feel faint. Sessions will be half an hour, and 30 runs is a century.

The ICC and its member boards took control of women’s cricket in 2005, and are still looking at it like a jumble-sale impulse buy. Its Test history – from the first in 1934 through a five-match Ashes in 1984 and a five-day Sydney Test in 1992 – has faded into a barren decade. England and India played the last mathematically definable series in 2006. In nine years since, cricket-playing nations have collectively managed eight matches. England captain Charlotte Edwards has played 19 years for 22 Tests. Men’s captain Alastair Cook has over a hundred Tests in half the time. Female captains still name Test cricket as the sport’s pinnacle, but for them it’s a sporadic exhibition. All domestic women’s cricket is now 20 or 50 overs. It’s cheaper to stage, easier to sell and has some prayer of being telecast.

So why bother with the token remainder? Women are picked for Tests based on performance in a different game. They can’t develop the familiarity or stamina to excel. Effectively the structure sets them up to underperform. It’s not complex: if you want to call something an Ashes series, build it like one. If Tests are too hard, have a different series. If women’s Tests are the pinnacle of the sport, have first-class competitions to support them. Players are bound by nonsense, deciding major trophies with a form they never play. You don’t ramp up a 200m sprint final to 800m just to see how they go. You can’t use shreds of Test cricket for fig leaves – oh, we respect the game so much that we’ve made it biennial. The final call should belong to the cricketers: do they want to base their game around the long form or short? Right now we’re stuck in a condescending middle ground with a nowhere strategy – a set of administrators sitting so hard on the fence they’ll need a proctologist and a carpenter to get themselves free.

It’s true that the last three years have seen improvements in Australia and England: players have modest professional contracts, games are more available via digital TV and streaming, the last two Ashes had an increased profile and plans are afoot for a Women’s Big Bash League. But India has actively run its team into the ground, and while West Indies and Sri Lanka have provided onfield highlights, other teams still live in the margins. The degree may vary, but wherever you look the women’s game is still secondary – an obligation to be expended rather than an opportunity seized.

Inevitably, such conversations detour into the relative worth of female sporting endeavour. Articles on the subject prove irresistible to a subset of men personally aggrieved to find it under discussion. First, the biology lecture: men are on average stronger than women, you will be stunned to learn. They are more suited to athletic excellence, you shall hear intoned. Men will be depicted as sparring stags, women as dun-coloured bowerbirds waiting to be impressed. O teach me, teach me, whose muscle mass is greater – as the grimy clerestory window of your mind’s eye is flung wide and the cascaded sunbeams of enlightenment flood in. Then we shift our Darwinism to the social: men’s sport is richer because it is popular, and popular because it is better.

All these claims share a few characteristics: they’re partly true, readily apparent, and analytically shallow. There is a sense of manifest destiny: holding a position of power means its tenant was fated to assume it. Some will argue that women’s cricket doesn’t deserve spending when the men’s game earns the money; the more pompous will tell you that this is true equality. Harrumph.

But seeing the men’s game as more deserving – the put-upon breadwinner in some domestic fable – is absurd when it has enjoyed an effective monopoly and a couple of centuries’ headstart. With the rivalry of one village versus the next, cricket was public entertainment in an age when sport was left to men. And frankly when it became popular there wasn’t a hell of a lot else to do – Maypole dancing and the Black Death only filled so much of your time. Once leisure options diversified in the 20th century, cricket had the appeal of tradition. Instead of being supplanted by radio or television it became part of them. Women’s cricket is starting from the back of a vastly more crowded field.

To dismiss female cricketers empirically, strength is the preferred criteria: they can’t bowl as fast or hit as hard. Its significance though is debatable. Most men are stronger than most women, just as some women are stronger than most men. Men are the fastest servers in tennis, but the top women still serve plenty fast, and are just as entertaining. Greater strength is not greater skill, and cricket has many facets.

There’s no masculine advantage to keeping wicket or bowling spin. The marker of batting elegance and excellence is timing: “barely seemed to hit that” is the praise for the best flicks and drives. So why look down on women who have no choice but pure technique? Why look down on bowlers who use seam and swing in the absence of pace? England seamer Kate Cross has excelled against men’s teams in Lancashire League cricket this season, with 3 for 19 on debut and 8 for 47 three weeks later. The focus is always on the men that women can’t beat, not the ones they can.

But team sports are not about first place: meaningful competition needs top players in their hundreds, even thousands. Even if the very best are male, there’s no inherent reason that women can’t make that group. It’s a numbers game. Of course, male internationals are currently more skilled: compare a history of 2,163 Tests to 137, or 3,650 ODIs to 944. Try a dozen competitive nations compared to four or five.

Most importantly the women’s game draws from a far smaller talent pool. Elite athletes are outliers in natural aptitude and sufficient development. Around the world, women who could have been great cricketers never considered playing. That’s why it matters when boards are publicly indifferent. Increase opportunities, make the game seem worthwhile, and you’ll start to find more of those outliers coming through.

It’s not like women can’t hit sixes the old-fashioned way: in that same Ashes series I remember Lanning creaming a slog-sweep over the fence at Bellerive. Deandra Dottin has made the West Indies famous with her long striking, including a T20 century off 38 balls. Increase player numbers, find more power hitters. Women may never bowl at 90mph, but if enough of them try then you might find some who can. Men bowling 95mph are rare: sides can go decades without one, but it doesn’t mean they aren’t around.

Thirteen-year-old baseballer Mo’ne Davis messed with some heads last year, pitching fastballs at 70mph to outpace most boys in her age bracket. “I just go out and throw strikes,” she said with a smile. You can see her as an anomaly, but if as many girls were encouraged into sport as boys, you would find a lot more anomalies. Or they would start to seem less anomalous. The people now arguing that Davis can never play Major League would once have insisted a girl could never pitch a shut-out at the Little League World Series. Everything’s impossible until it happens.

In any case, it’s not like women must aspire to play like men. As with so many sports, women play a subtly different game, the same field and equipment met with varied rhythms and strategies. That’s why it grates to see the tiny boundary. There’s no excitement to a smaller mimicry, nor dignity to the achievement. Bradman didn’t bother with sixes and it didn’t stop people watching him. Maybe women would hit more threes, a game built on placement. With sixes becoming rarer they would be more exciting, and those who could hit them would grow in importance. Tactics would develop in response, all part of the intrigue of an evolving game. Set the ropes back and more women will learn to clear them. What is sport if not a spur for endeavour?

In late 2014, Roar Radio ran a commentary stream of Australia’s UAE tour against Pakistan. During the second Test our rotation brought Cat Jones, cricket coach and columnist, on air with former ABC sport presenter Katie Bailey. The pairing was as random as any, but messages started coming in: this was the first time, said listeners, they had heard two women calling men’s cricket. If there were a precedent none of us could recall one. But rather than the triumph of a pioneering moment, it felt mildly embarrassing that the combination should be notable.



Just like switching on ABC radio deep into the World Cup and listening to Alison Mitchell – the first woman I’d heard calling ball-by-ball on a major broadcast. Mitchell was excellent. The world, entirely unended, spun on its way. The year was 2015. Mitchell is rare not because women can’t do the job, but because they’re overwhelmingly discouraged from thinking they ever could. For decades commentary has been an all-male affair. Tanya Aldred’s 2013 Telegraph profile on Mitchell makes for wonderful entertainment, its comment section brimming with expostulation (fully sic):

“LEAVE TMS ALONE. Its one of the final bastions of broadcasting i can actually stand, the LAST thing it needs is to be infected by political correctness.”

“A woman in the commentary box would change the wonderful dynamic of repartée.”

“After you have successfully campaigned for male presenters of Womans’ Hour then you can start campaigning for female presenters of Blokes’ Hour.”

“Other sports have tried the ‘female’ presenter who stand there spouting irrelevant nonsense for no good reason.”

“Too much talk about the cricket and it was not easy relaxed listening.”

Several tested the rhetorical flourish that supporting women’s advances in hostile industries is itself sexist – “ah ha!” you can see them shouting, brandishing a quill at the keyboard. Online comments often come from the least reasonable readers, but these still reflect pervasive attitudes – that women in sport have nothing to offer, that their presence can only be a token gesture, that there’s no value in the full range of voices. Weighed with its boots on, this is a bitter conclusion: that half our citizens have no place discussing the teams that represent them.

The outrage is really over a threatened sense of familiarity. On professional grounds Mitchell is quality: no one gains by promoting the unsuited. Which doesn’t mean other female broadcasters won’t disappoint, dullness not being chromosome- dependent. The issue is that women entering male fields are held to represent their gender: a woman being rubbish means that women can’t commentate, a bloke being rubbish means he can’t.

Still, there’s progress. No one expected the IPL – home of cheerleaders and decorative boundary riders – to hire Lisa Sthalekar, Mel Jones, Isa Guha and Anjum Chopra for regulation commentary. It’s gone better than Channel Nine’s use of Lanning for domestic 50-over games last year, where instead of being one of the standard three callers she was tacked on each stint as a fourth. As Cat Jones observed, the regulars “seemed unsure about whether they were interviewing Lanning or commentating with her.”

Not to mention that to get Channel Nine’s attention Lanning had to be appointed Australia’s youngest-ever captain, win a T20 World Cup and prove herself the most exciting player in her sport – and even that may not have been enough had she not met Australian TV’s Home & Away standard of being sufficiently blonde and photogenic. Appearance is an extra box that female presenters must tick – the IPL announcement was illustrated with its female commentators in cocktail dresses – while Ian Botham can roll in looking like someone shot the arse off a hungover rhinoceros and still plonk his jowls on the telly. The industry’s women are islands in a sea of unremarkable middle-aged men.

My first press corps tour at the 2013 Ashes was another study in geography. I met Aldred at Trent Bridge, did Guardian podcasts with Emma John and Lizzy Ammon, saw Antoinette Muller for a day at Old Trafford, caught up with ABC reporter Mary Gearin, and nodded to Nine’s Roz Kelly and The Age’s Chloe Saltau. That was it – seven women, not at one Test but across the lot, in press boxes that each held a hundred people or more. Since then I’ve worked with nine other women in cricket media. That I can name them individually says everything about the status quo.

Truth bomb: more men do like cricket. But that’s partly because in so many ways over so many years women are implicitly or explicitly told they’re not welcome. The game is seen as a male domain inherently, not just historically. I may bat like a seasick deckhand putting out a galley fire, but by virtue of birth I’m granted some assumed authority. This perpetuates the media imbalance, which manifests in so many little ways that suggest women are less worthy of our regard: framing questions to female players in reference to their counterparts; covering Tests by webstream from a single dodgy camera; running every article with a revealing photo of Perry; barely bothering to report because we think no one will read it; the TV cameraman filming some poor woman in the crowd for so long you’re sure you can hear him breathing. For me it’ll always be a couple of supercilious English press-box lifers in 2013 enjoying their ascendancy. When would anything go right for the Australians, one rhetorically enquired.

“Well,” said the other, “one of the Southern Stars hit a century today.”

“Ha!” shot out the first. “Marvellous.”

Behind everything else lies the state of cricket administration. The International Women’s Cricket Council was an amateur body that survived tour to tour. The ICC swallowed it without bothering to spit out the bones. There are 15 ICC directors and eight alternate directors, all male. Leadership is conducted across all areas by 11 overlapping committees. Outside the Women’s Committee, Clare Connor is the only woman among 73 men.



Cricket Australia’s website entrées its board with a photo of Delissa Kimmince nailing a sweep shot. Click her to reveal one woman among nine directors. CA’s proportion of female players is a world-best 22%. The ECB has two women on its board of 14, and participation at 7%. Indian cricket’s nine office-bearers are men, and the next few hundred probably are too. The BCCI isn’t just indifferent to women’s cricket: it is hostile.

Domestic and international games have plummeted in number, with opportunities such as the Asian Games ignored to save the cost of a motel. National players fund their own training while officials haggle over match fees that you could pay out of a car ashtray. With the team’s promise before the takeover and its parlous state now, the BCCI increasingly plays Jabba the Hutt, smearing itself in food while chuckling throatily at the desperate.

After decades of women organising their own matches on next-to-no funding, the three richest national boards are whimpering about the bill. You know, the boards that are signing broadcast deals worth billions, running lucrative T20 leagues and scooping the biggest serve of ICC revenue on to their own plates. Yet they claim non-profit status and tax exemptions on the grounds of growing the game, and the national service they provide in doing so.

So serve, dudes. Nationally. Internationally. Put your card on the bar and shed some dollars. It’s cricket’s money anyway. The advances are good, but ultimately you still make the women’s game look like the budget rip-off replica. Treat the format with respect and coverage will follow suit. The more we report like games matter, the more people will accept they do. The more people follow the game, the greater its standing with the boards. On you go, a slow burn, adding fuel as more people start to play, more teams register, more kids think about a Test cap, more lifelong diehards sign their pledge without even knowing it.

All these things come together in a glorious feedback loop, the feats on the field and the perception off it. Prestige cannot be built, but treat things right and it grows. The crowd will swell, the standard will rise, and one day a bunch of people will be watching the game without a second thought, wondering what we were fussing about, saying it was always destined to end up here.

Discussing equality is tricky. People get defensive, as though they’re personally being blamed. They dismiss problems as trivial or invented, and scoff about do-gooders as though doing good is a lamentable character defect. Suggest improvements and you’ll be accused of an agenda, some murky plot to force interpersonal respect. Observing a measurable inequity is classed as a political act in a way that observing a pot of geraniums is not.

Few of cricket’s issues are born from conscious malice, but they reflect systems that benefit men ahead of women. These are the attitudes reflected in that press-box sneer – that women don’t count, what they do isn’t worthy. The same attitudes manifest in uglier ways.

Last November Sri Lanka Cricket launched an investigation into reports of officials using team selections to extort sex from players. In 2013, five Pakistani teenagers spoke out about the same practice at Multan Cricket Club: they were brushed off by an inquiry, banned by the PCB and sued by the chairman. One of them killed herself. Whatever the detail of these cases, we know that this kind of abuse happens in many places and never comes to light. Constant to all such cases are structures where men have power and women are not seen as credible.

Refusing to acknowledge these things can be apathy: complaints are tedious when you’re not affected. Or we love the game and don’t like conceding there’s anything wrong. Or we’re fearful of change – cricket and its broadcasters are a point of stability in so many lives. But it’s OK. No one is telling us what to like, even if what we like has more to do with habit than whatever post-hoc logical linoleum we lay over that response.

If we open the game, more people will come in, and that’s only for the better. It’s not about special-interest groups when addressing things that involve literally everyone. It’s not about trying to point out bigger problems elsewhere when we can take the useful course of getting our own house in order.

It’s probably tennis that has best arranged the furniture. There’s the odd spat about fashion-focused interviews or the three-sets-to-five split that so suits the schedulers, but by alternating men’s and women’s games in major tournaments, the two are shown the same respect. Fans follow suit. The game’s iconic players don’t divide on gender lines. Girls see making the tour as a viable ambition, so the standard remains excellent. No one loses in this arrangement, no one panders, and no one ruins the game forever. If you excised the women’s half of the draw now, most enthusiasts would agree that tennis would be a poorer, duller and less colourful place. All of us would win if – someday – cricket could say the same.","Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434119521415/a4b5340e-785b-4b9c-a16d-766a7448f180-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48e1fb7d5cd01e78905a76c74235b8a6,"['game', 'cant', 'players', 'tests', 'female', 'stop', 'women', 'secondclass', 'treating', 'cricket', 'mens', 'womens', 'citizens', 'men']",

At least 17 trees that died of the disease were removed from the orchard of the district administration at Court Bagan in Chapainawabganj town recently.

The disease usually affects trees from the tip and spreads downward, causing cracks on the infected stem and numerous pycnidia are formed on dead twigs.

Twigs die, giving a scorched appearance to the limb.

The young green twigs start withering first at the base and then extend outwards along the veins of leaf edges, said scientists of Regional Horticulture Research Station in Chapainawabganj.

The affected leaf turns brown and its edges roll upwards. Leaves scorch and fall, leaving a dead branch.

In severe condition, branches dry one after another and the whole tree dies eventually.

It is a fungal disease caused by lasiodiplodia-theobromae, scientists said after observing the affected trees at different places in the district.

The disease, which normally spreads from November to March, has affected quite a few orchards in the district, causing death even to old trees.

If the disease could be detected at initial stages, the trees could be saved by using Bordeaux paste, said Dr Shorof Uddin, a senior scientific officer of the research station.

""The pathogen can live on dead wood and bark of dead trees and twigs where the spores are released by air and spread to healthy trees. Spread of the disease can be checked by removing dead trees,"" he said.

Regular monitoring and integrated pest and disease management techniques can help reduce loss of mango yield, he added.

Mango is the most important cash crop in Chapainawabganj that produces nearly 350 varieties of the delicious summer fruit, said sources at Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) and Regional Horticulture Research Station.

Some of the well-known commercially grown varieties are gopalbhog, khirsapat (himsagar), fazli, langra, lakkhanbhog, and ashwina.

Last year, 2.30 lakh tonnes of mango was produced from 18.50 lakh trees on 24,250 hectares of land in the district, DAE sources said.","Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/dieback-disease-mango.jpg?itok=bKf0hoHa,"['twigs', 'spreads', 'dead', 'disease', 'chapainawabganj', 'mango', 'district', 'growers', 'worries', 'research', 'dieback', 'trees', 'affected', 'varieties']", 
78,78,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Why India's medical schools are plagued with fraud - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1188743,"MUZAFFARNAGAR: Last December, Dilshad Chaudhry travelled with about 100 of his fellow villagers by bus to a local Indian medical school hospital. They'd been told that foreign doctors were coming to tour the facility, and check-ups would be free.

There was nothing wrong with Chaudhry; he was accompanying his brother, who had a back problem. But “every person was told to lie in a bed even if they're not sick,” he said. The 20-year-old electrician said he never saw any foreign physicians that day, but the hospital's Indian doctors kept checking that the phony patients were in bed.

“They wanted to make sure no one escaped,” he said.

That was the same month government inspectors visited the hospital, which is at Muzaffarnagar Medical College, 129 kilometers northeast of New Delhi.

The inspectors checked, among other things, whether there were enough patients to provide students with adequate clinical experience. They determined there were.

But a year earlier, inspectors had found that most of the college hospital's outpatients “were fake and dummy and seems to be hired from nearby slum area,” according to the official report.

“In the paediatric ward, all children were admitted ... without any medical problem and were hired from a nearby area!” “I am not very keen to reply,” said Dr. Anil Agarwal, the school's principal, when asked about the episode with Chaudhry.

Read: Cheating in exams on the rise in India

India's system for training doctors is broken. It is plagued by rampant fraud and unprofessional teaching practices, exacerbating the public health challenge facing this fast-growing but still poor nation of about 1.25 billion people.

The ramifications spread beyond the country's borders: India is the world's largest exporter of doctors, with about 47,000 currently practicing in the United States and about 25,000 in the United Kingdom.

Schools and Scandals

In a four-month investigation, Reuters has documented the full extent of the fraud in India's medical-education system. It found, among other things, that more than one out of every six of the country's 398 medical schools has been accused of cheating, according to Indian government records and court filings.

The Reuters probe also found that recruiting companies routinely provide medical colleges with doctors to pose as full-time faculty members to pass government inspections.

To demonstrate that teaching hospitals have enough patients to provide students with clinical experience, colleges round up healthy people to pretend they are sick.

Government records show that since 2010, at least 69 Indian medical colleges and teaching hospitals have been accused of such transgressions or other significant failings, including rigging entrance exams or accepting bribes to admit students.

Two dozen of the schools have been recommended for outright closure by the regulator.

Paying bribes – often in the guise of “donations” ─ to gain admission to Indian medical schools is widespread, according to India's health ministry, doctors and college officials.

“The next generation of doctors is being taught to cheat and deceive before they even enter the classroom,” said Dr. Anand Rai. He exposed a massive cheating ring involving medical school entrance exams in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in 2013.

Rai was given police protection after he received death threats following the bust. The poor state of India's medical education reflects a health system in crisis.

The country has the highest rates of mortality from diarrhea, pneumonia and tuberculosis, creating pressure to train more physicians. Patients are regularly denied treatment at public hospitals that are so overcrowded, often the only way to see a doctor is to pay a bribe.

The causes of the crisis are manifold: too few doctors. A government-backed surge in private medical schools which, to boost revenue, frequently charge under-the-table fees for admission.

Outdated government regulations that, for example, require college libraries to keep paper copies of medical journals and penalise those that subscribe instead to online editions.

Charged with maintaining “excellence in medical education” is the Medical Council of India (MCI). But this government body is itself mired in controversy. Its prior president currently faces bribery allegations.

The council is the subject of a mountain of lawsuits, many of them pitting it against medical schools challenging its findings. The cases often drag on for years.

“The best medical schools in India are absolutely world class,” said David Gordon, president of the World Federation for Medical Education. But, he added, the Indian government's process of accrediting a “huge” number of recently opened, private medical schools “has at times been highly dubious.”

India has been rocked by a series of recent medical scandals, including doctors accused of serious crimes. In November, a group of junior doctors at a medical college in the eastern city of Kolkata allegedly tied a suspected mobile phone thief to a pillar, slashed him with a razor and beat him to death with bamboo sticks, according to local police.

Nine of the accused men remain in jail; they deny murder charges, say lawyers involved in the case. Three suspects remain at large.

The Scalpel Thrower

The system's problems are felt abroad, too. Tens of thousands of India's medical graduates practice overseas, particularly in the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada.

All of these countries require additional training before graduates of Indian medical schools can practice, and the vast majority of the doctors have unblemished records.

But regulatory documents show that in both Britain and Australia, more graduates of Indian medical schools lost their right to practice medicine in the past five years than did doctors from any other foreign country.

In the United Kingdom, between 2008 and 2014, Indian-trained doctors were four times more likely to lose their right to practice than British-trained doctors, according to records of Britain's General Medical Council (The US and Canada lack publicly available centralised databases of disciplined doctors).

The British cases include that of Dr. Tajeshwar Singh Aulakh, who received his medical degree in 1999 from Punjabi University in Patiala, India, according to Indian government records. He was assisting during a hip operation in 2008 in Shropshire, England, when he allegedly grabbed a scalpel, slashed the patient's stitches and threw it toward a nurse, according to British government records.

The United Kingdom later struck him off its list of approved physicians. He could not be reached for comment.

The Australian cases include that of Dr. Suhail Durani, who graduated from an Indian government medical college in the northern city of Jammu in 2003. He was imprisoned in Perth for more than 18 months after being convicted in 2011 of sexually assaulting a female diabetic patient who had shown up in the emergency room with symptoms of a potentially serious illness.

In an interview, Durani maintained his innocence and described his medical training in India as excellent. He currently is not practicing medicine.

Dr. Ramesh Mehta, vice president of the Global Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said there are “major problems” with some private Indian medical schools. But he added that a doctor's success depends as much on “personality and attitude” as on his or her college training.

Fake Degrees

About 45 per cent of the people in India who practice medicine have no formal training, according to the Indian Medical Association. These 700,000 unqualified doctors have been found practicing at some of India's biggest hospitals, giving diagnoses, prescribing medicines and even conducting surgery.

Balwant Rai Arora, a Delhi resident in his 90s, said in an interview that he issued more than 50,000 fake medical degrees from his home until his forgery ring was broken up by the police in 2011. Each buyer paid about $100 for a degree from fictitious colleges. Arora was twice convicted and jailed for forgery.

“There is a shortage of doctors in India. I am just helping people with some medical experience get jobs,” said Arora. “I haven't done anything wrong.” India currently has about 840,000 doctors - or about seven physicians for every 10,000 people. That compares with about 25 in the United States and 32 in Europe, according to the World Health Organization.

The shortfall has persisted despite India having the most medical schools of any nation. That's because the size of graduating classes is small ─ typically 100 to 150 students.

Indeed, gaining admission to India's top medical schools is akin to winning the lottery. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi has been rated the best medical school in India Today magazine's past five annual surveys.

According to the registrar's office, it takes in only 72 students for its undergraduate course each year out of about 80,000 to 90,000 who apply ─ an acceptance rate of less than one-tenth of one per cent. As in the United Kingdom, most medical school students attend an undergraduate program.

Similarly, Christian Medical College, a top-ranked school in the southern city of Vellore, received 39,974 applications this year for 100 places, according to a school official ─ an acceptance rate of 0.25 pc. By contrast, the acceptance rate at Harvard Medical School for its entering class in 2014 was 3.5 pc.

Health ministry officials and doctors say India's medical-education system began to falter following a surge in new, private medical colleges that opened across the country during the past few decades, often in remote areas.

In 1980, there were 100 government-run medical schools and 11 private medical colleges. Thirty-five years later, the number of government medical colleges has nearly doubled. The number of private medical schools, meanwhile, has risen nearly twenty-fold, according to the Medical Council of India. There are now 183 government medical colleges and 215 private ones.

'Little Better Than Quacks'

“The market has been flooded with doctors so poorly trained they are little better than quacks,” Rao told Reuters. — AFP/file

Many of the private colleges have been set up by businessmen and politicians who have no experience operating medical or educational institutions, said MCI officials. Sujatha Rao, who served as India's health secretary from 2009 to 2010, said the boom in private colleges was driven by a change in the law in the early 1990s to make it easier to open new schools because the government was struggling to find the money to build public medical schools.

“The market has been flooded with doctors so poorly trained they are little better than quacks,” Rao told Reuters.

A study in India published in 2012 compared doctors holding medical degrees with untrained practitioners. It found “no differences in the likelihood of providers' giving a diagnosis or providing the correct treatment.” The study, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, concluded that in India, “training in and of itself is not a guarantor of high quality.”

Last year, an individual described as a “concerned” student at a rural government medical college in Ambajogai, in western India, posted a letter online with a litany of allegations about the school, Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Medical College.

There were professors who existed only on paper, he alleged, and “no clinics and no lectures” for students in the medicine and surgery departments. Conditions were unsanitary at the hospital, and pigs and donkeys roamed the campus, he wrote. The writer also alleged that students had to pay bribes to pass exams.

“We are not taught in this medical college,” the letter stated. Students have graduated “without even attending a single day.” The writer said the letter had been sent to various government agencies and health officials.

Records from the MCI, the body charged with maintaining the country's medical education standards, show that an inspection of the college this January found numerous deficiencies, including a shortage of faculty, residents and lecture theaters.

Dr. Nareshkumar S. Dhaniwala, who served as the principal of the college between 2011 and 2013, said “there is some truth in the letter.” Animals, such as pigs and cows, do roam the campus, teachers and students don't turn up for lessons, and there is a scarcity of running water in the dormitories, he said.

And before he joined, he said, he heard students had to pay to pass final exams.

“I found the students were not very interested in studying, they don't come to classes, they don't come to clinics,” Dhaniwala said. “Medical education has gone downhill all over the country because the teachers are not as devoted as they used to be.”

Sudhir Deshmukh, the college's current principal, did not respond to requests for comment.

The MCI, which was established by the government in 1934 and oversees medical education, has itself been swirling in controversy. Dr. Ketan Desai, the council's former president, faces criminal charges related to his arrest in 2010 for allegedly conspiring to receive a bribe to recommend authorising a private medical college to accept more students.

The case is still pending; Desai has denied the charges.

'Junk Body'

In interviews, medical school officials complained that the MCI had onerous inspection requirements that were outdated and arbitrary.

“The Medical Council of India is a junk body,” said Dr. AK Asthana, principal and dean of Subharti Medical College in the northern city of Meerut, which has been accused of demanding illegal fees for admission. Asthana denies the allegations. The council has tried ─ unsuccessfully so far ─ to close the school. “I'm totally frustrated with the MCI. Totally frustrated,” he said.

Dr. Vedprakash Mishra, the head of MCI's academic committee, told Reuters that the agency has created “discipline and accountability” among medical colleges by imposing fines and, in several cases, prohibiting schools from admitting students for up to two years.

“We don't compromise and mitigate on the requirements,” he said. Asked about allegations of corruption within MCI itself, Mishra abruptly ended the interview.

“This is not what I want to be discussing,” he said.

Under the government's current regulations, private medical colleges generally must have campuses on at least 20 acres of land. Because urban real estate in India is expensive, many schools open in rural areas where recruiting qualified, full-time doctors to teach is difficult because pay scales are low and living conditions are tough.

Interviews and MCI records show that some private colleges solve the problem by cheating ─ they recruit doctors to pose as full-time faculty members during government inspections. The physicians work there for just a few days or weeks. Two MCI officials estimated that there are several hundred Indian companies involved in recruiting them.

In October, a doctor in New Delhi received an email from a local company called ‘Hi Impact Consultants’ with the subject line: “Urgent requirement of doctors for MCI Inspection in Ghaziabad.”

The email offered up to 20,000 Indian rupees a day (about $310) if the doctor appeared for an inspection at Saraswathi Institute of Medical Sciences in Hapur, east of New Delhi. The doctor, who requested anonymity, has no connection with the college.

“If interested please revert back ASAP,” the email concluded. The sender described itself as “a medical executive search firm.” In an interview, Sanjeev Priyadershi, Hi Impact's executive director, confirmed that the firm had tried to recruit doctors to appear during government inspections at medical colleges where they don't normally work.

“My client wanted to hire full-time faculty members for inspection purposes,” he said.

Dr. Shailendra K. Vajpeyee, the principal of Saraswathi, said the college is constantly struggling to recruit qualified professors. Vajpeyee said he knew of Hi Impact Consultants, but denied he had employed them during his 18-month tenure.

“I don't know why that email was sent” by the company, he said. He declined to comment further about the matter.

'Biased' Inspectors

At Muzaffarnagar Medical College, where electrician Dilshad Chaudhry was taken in December, students can read medical journals and books in a sprawling, circular library and take classes in clean and modern lecture halls.

But finding enough patients to provide students with clinical experience at rural, private teaching hospitals like Muzaffarnagar is a challenge. Many people in rural India simply can't afford the cost of treatment.

School principal Mr. Agarwal denied the allegations by MCI inspectors that the college's hospital had inflated its number of patients during a 2013 inspection. “Sometimes the inspectors are biased, that is for sure,” he said. He also denied the hospital had ever recruited local villagers to pose as patients.

But Dr. Vaibhav Jain, a former student at the college, told Reuters that the hospital would conduct “free check-up camps,” to lure rural villagers to the facility on inspection days. He said the hospital sometimes would promise free ultrasounds, but only a small number of people would be tested. Villagers often later complained about it to students at a clinic in Bilaspur where he worked, he said.

“We used to say we can't do anything, the machine was not working,” he said. Medical education is in trouble across India, said Jain. “The truth is that many medical students aren't prepared to be doctors when they finish” college. “And the result is the patient suffers.”","Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2015/06/5581338ed86bc.jpg,"['indias', 'india', 'doctors', 'mci', 'private', 'colleges', 'plagued', 'schools', 'students', 'fraud', 'indian', 'medical', 'college']",

A trip to the island readily accessible by speedboat from Cox's Bazar town won't leave the visitor feeling they're not a part of it.

It's advisable to walk in from the jetty to the start of the road before taking a rickshaw, for a better fare. Anywhere in Gorakghata town will be about twenty taka. I'm lucky. I find an honest driver. But as he rides others excitedly call out, “Hoto!” meaning “How much?” in their local Bangla. They're wondering how much overcharging has gone on, but when the driver calls back “one hundred taka!” they know he's criticising them.

“Ah, Bengalis!” says the honest driver, displeased. But he's Bengali too.

For anybody presumed to be without Bangla accommodations are made. “Good night!” one man calls out, remembering whatever English he can. It hardly matters that it's early afternoon.

Another man is busily buying roadside fish. He seems engrossed in the sale but the sight of an outsider is too tempting. “How is your country?” he asks. Should I take him literally? “Well, most of it is quite dry, desert in fact… Large parts are flat but in other areas there are mountains…” Or should I just say “Australia”, answering the “Which country are you from?” that he actually means?

At the Adinath Temple there's a fair going on and one college professor has been tasked with making loudspeaker announcements. I stop for a chat. As I walk away I hear a new announcement, “Thanks to our Australian friend who says he just ate jelabis!” It'd be difficult to feel more welcome!

In a local eatery I'm stunned. “Do you speak Bangla?” someone asked, a simple question but I'm lucky I caught it since it's uttered in what sounds like one long syllable! I'm not used to Chittagonian-style Bangla. “I speak a little Bangla,” I'm thinking, “But do you?”

To the outsider, Bangla in Moheshkhali sounds a bit like an electric saw unsure if it wants to cut a tree. It sounds choppy like the speedboat getting there that banged, wave to wave, across the channel. It sounds like chewing on gum. It sounds a bit Burmese.

“Chittagong dialect,” reads the District Gazetteer, “is almost unintelligible even to the people of neighbouring districts like Noakhali and Comilla. The most noticeable feature that strikes the stranger is the tendency of the people to slur over consonants, to clip syllables and to substitute aspirates for sibilants.” I think that's a more sophisticated way of saying the same as above.

By evening I find myself in Chandan's tea shop. He says he'll soon be married which is my queue to question him like a relative, though we've just met. “Is the girl from a good family? What's her qualification? What does her father do?” He returns from the counter with an invitation card in shiny gold. “This is the very first invitation I'm giving,” he says, and he's hoping for two hundred guests.

Meanwhile Jamal the betel seller over the road is concerned for my wellbeing. He gives his mobile number. “If you have any problem, you just call me!”

I ask if that also applies if I'm in Cox's Bazar and he says it does. “But what if I'm further away, like maybe in London or Tokyo? Should I call you then?” Bless him! He offers to shut up his betel shop and come to my rescue anywhere, worldwide, anytime!

In Moheshkhali, everybody's watching the foreigner, but I'm told I'm lucky. “A few years ago two foreign women came here,” I hear, “and a crowd of at least a hundred followed them as they walked along the road.”

About the jetty on the muddy shoreline are mudskippers basking, lounging and fighting for ground. Larger specimens are charging; forcing smaller ones back into the tide. As I'm boarding a speedboat to follow the tide to Cox's Bazar myself, I can only smile at the memories of friendliness and curiosity that the people of Moheshkhali have given me.","Fri, 12 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/passengers_arrive_on_moheshkhali_island.jpg?itok=-zWTsYLm,"['moheshkhali', 'bangla', 'eyes', 'speedboat', 'theyre', 'foreigners', 'hes', 'shop', 'driver', 'lucky', 'sounds', 'im']", 
80,80,FL-2015-000068-BGD,Rafael de La-Hoz encircles cultural centre with a raised storey - Dezeen,https://www.dezeen.com/2015/06/13/rafael-de-la-hoz-espacio-miguel-delibes-cultural-centre-alcobendas-spain-raised-upper-storey-concrete/,"This cultural centre in the Spanish town of Alcobendas comprises an elevated concrete structure supported by rows of pillars and a pair of grand public courtyards (+ slideshow).

Spanish firm Rafael de La-Hoz Arquitectos designed the Espacio Miguel Delibes to accommodate a university, the local headquarters of the PhotoEspaña International Centre, and amenities operated by the local council including a media library and a citizen's advice centre.

Situated in the developing Avenida de Pablo Iglesias area of the town – which is located on the northern outskirts of Madrid – the building occupies a 6,000-square-metre plot that is open on three sides to enhance its connection with the neighbourhood.

The facility comprises three main built components that, according to the architects, ""clearly differ from each other but are completely interrelated"".

""Each of these volumes have independent use and access from the street,"" said the studio. ""They can thus be used at different times and in different ways, which allows for a completely flexible use of the complex.""

The first of these structures is a raised frame-like structure containing the classrooms and lecture halls of the university, which is named Universidad Popular.

Corridors along the inner edges of this volume are lined with glazing, allowing views looks down onto the central courtyard below.

Rows of slender rectangular concrete pillars along two of the building's edges prop up the upper storey, forming a sheltered cloister-like walkway that leads to the rear of the site.

Contained within the central open space are two additional structures – a glazed cube and a taller tower clad in a perforated metal mesh – that create a pair of publicly accessible patios.

""The gap generated by the perimeter crown forms a large void, a spacious patio in which the other two volumes are inserted, leaving spaces filled with air and light between them,"" the team said.

A landscaped area in front of the building merges with the largest of these outdoor spaces, which functions as a patio outside the centre's main entrance.

The second courtyard is flanked on one side by the glazed cube and on the other by the taller tower. It receives less sunlight and therefore offers a comfortable shaded environment during the hot summers.

The glass box positioned at the heart of the facility houses a multipurpose event space and reception area on the ground floor, with a dedicated exhibition hall and a lounge on the first floor.

""Its centred position in the complex, between the two patios and tangential to the perimeter volume, turns it into an isolated body which, thanks to its crystalline materiality, looks like a huge night lantern from the outside,"" the studio added.

The use of glass was intended to give this structure an ethereal appearance that contrasts with the solidity of the concrete used throughout the rest of the complex.

Behind the glazed volume is the larger structure containing the citizen's advice service, PhotoEspaña's facilities, and rooms for the university's director and teachers.

A staircase that ascends along one edge of the larger courtyard provides access to the upper storey of the glass cube.

The three co-workers whose stories are told here are the winners of the 2015 Helmut Kutin Award, a biannual award named for a former President of SOS Children’s Villages International, which celebrates the achievements of some of our extraordinary caregivers. Finalists are selected by the Hermann Gmeiner Academy Board and then voted for by SOS Children’s Villages employees around the world.

Maria Merlina Sabela: Protecting her children from a typhoon

Maria Merlina Sabela, also known as Nanay Merlina, an SOS mother from the Philippines, was recognised for her courage during Typhoon Yolanda. When the typhoon struck, Merlina made an escape hole in the ceiling.

She and her nine children huddled on their roof while flood waters swirled below. She comforted her children and kept them calm while the typhoon raged around them, damaging their home and everything around it.

Once the danger passed, Merlina was the first to leave the safety of the roof, to check it was safe for her children to come down.

After the typhoon, she strove to repair her house as soon as possible, so her children could come back home. Hers was the first house in the village to be ready for children to move back.

When asked about the impact her mother has had on her life, Merlina’s daughter Bianca turns to the words of Celine Dion: “The song ‘Because you Love Me’ best describes Nanay Merlina because you, Nanay, were my strength when I was weak... you gave me faith because you believed. I’m everything I am because you love me.”

Abebech Kibret: A mother figure to young women

SOS aunt Abebech Kibret from Ethiopia was recognised for her unfailing support for the children and young people in her village. Abebech spent 16 years as a cook in the village, developing strong bonds with the children and young people there. Now an SOS aunt, she is a mother figure for many of the adults who grew up in the village, receiving regular phone calls and visits.

Lidiya and Helina were two young women who had grown up in the village. When they gave birth for the first time, Abebech took on the traditional grandmotherly role, showing them how to look after their new babies.

Another young woman in the village, Hanna, fell in love and dropped out of school to get married.Abebech convinced her to continue her education and insisted Hanna be given a second chance so she could go back to school. Hanna is now a qualified kindergarten teacher.

Bisrat is another young woman from the SOS Children’s Village who was inspired by Abebech to become a kindergarten teacher. She says, “When I think about the good deeds of aunt Abebech, my eyes fill with tears of joy. I don’t know where to start, but I can only say that I wouldn’t be here if she were not by my side next to my SOS mother.”

Isaac Adowk: A dangerous journey to keep children safe

Isaac Adowk, a youth leader from South Sudan, received a special distinction from the Hermann Gmeiner Academy Board for his outstanding courage in a dangerous situation. The European Commission featured Isaac and the children’s story on World Humanitarian Day 2014, in the series ‘Humanitarians at Risk’. When rebels entered the SOS Children’s Village, he took the children to safety, facing armed soldiers, a crocodile infested river, and grenade fire during the 200 km journey. Find out more about Isaac’s amazing story.

The trait that unites these three winners is courage: the courage to fight for the children in their care, keeping them safe and encouraging them to reach their full potential.","Sat, 21 May 2016 05:51:47 GMT",https://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/sites/default/files/field/image/twin-sisters-smiling-louga-senegal-65959-800x530.jpg,"['helmut', 'children', 'award', 'winners', 'typhoon', 'mother', 'young', 'abebech', '2015', 'villages', 'merlina', 'sos', 'commitment', 'kutin', 'village', 'childrens', 'courage']",

Samad Said (pic) is no longer content to be a writer and wants to be involved in the political development in the country.

That, he said, was the reason why he join DAP, a party that he described as “fragrant” and has a clear policy.





“I have been following the national political development and feel that as a National Laureate I should not only confine my activities to writing, but to also be physically and mentally involved in political development,” he said when met after receiving his membership card from DAP adviser Lim Kit Siang here yesterday.

Samad said he had thought deeply about joining DAP for a long time before deciding to do so.

“I have been thinking about this for several years now and I cannot remain just a writer anymore, but to also play a role after this,” he said, adding that many were happy with his decision while many others were against it.

Samad and Lim were here to witness the handing over of house keys to flood victims whose houses were rebuilt by a non-governmental or­­ga­nisation called Gabungan Impian Kelantan (GIK).

Lim said Samad's entry into DAP was considered a historic milestone for the party, and he also described Samad as a “warrior of change” for the party.

“Gua Musang was chosen as the place for this event because Samad is the GIK adviser,” he added.","Sun, 14 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['national', 'involved', 'joins', 'development', 'lim', 'writer', 'political', 'samad', 'dap', 'musang', 'party']",

The black Prado belongs to ruling party lawmaker Pinu Khan, Rony’s mother, Monirul Islam, spokesperson of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), told the media today.

“The vehicle was seized from Nam flats yesterday. We have primarily confirmed Rony fired the shots from inside the black Prado,” he said adding that police traced the car with help of CCTV footages.

The vehicle bore the seal of a parliament member when it was produced before the media today. However, later the seal was removed.

Meanwhile, Awami League MP Pinu Khan said she had complete respect for the law and handed over the vehicle for the purpose of fair investigation.

Rony said to have shot down two persons in Dhaka in a drunken rage in the night of April 14. Now in jail, he is a leader of the Jubo League. His mother is general secretary of Mahila Awami League.

He said to have told investigators that he fired the shots “out of frustration” over the post-midnight traffic.

Media reports say that police have filed a statement to the court withholding information that the bullets killing the two persons were fired with Rony’s gun.

It has also been reported that police themselves fear that Rony is powerful enough to influence the witnesses and plaintiffs and requested the court not to let him out on bail.

However, police have asserted that they are not favouring Rony in any circumstances.","Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/seized-vehicle.jpg?itok=bDidQqYZ,"['shots', 'dhaka', 'car', 'mp', 'mothers', 'rony', 'ronys', 'fired', 'seal', 'riding', 'told', 'shot', 'todaythe', 'vehicle']",

Talking to media persons at UDH, Dr.Shyamsunder said that this move is initiated to ensure that the public receive quality and wide range of health services at the hospital so as to bring down the number of patients rushing to private clinics elsewhere.He further said that from now on this hospital will be a first referral centre for the whole district, before adding that the unit can now handle various major operations like C-section, gastro-duodinal perforation and other critical injuries.While exuding confidence that the new transformation will immensely benefit the public, he nevertheless added that successful continuity of the unit would also largely depend on cooperation of the specialists posted here.Meanwhile, State Project Manager Irengbam said that the State Medical Authority has arranged to provide free medication to all patients who undergo operations at the hospital, apart from exempting surgical charges which are exorbitantly high in private clinics anywhere.Pertaining to diagnostic services, he said that a fulltime Sonologist would be provided for Ultra Sound service at the hospital shortly after a shortterm training.In the case of X-Ray and other facilities, he pointed out that due to lack of stable power supply, targets remain unatainable.""For this, we have repeatedly appraised the State Power department to provide a separate power transformer for the hospital but there has been no response as yet,"" he rued.","Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://e-pao.net/images/epicon.ico,"['state', 'unit', 'hospital', 'epao', 'turns', 'referral', 'dist', 'district', 'ukhrul', 'headlines', 'services', 'health', '18th', 'power', 'jun15', 'fru', 'medical']",
