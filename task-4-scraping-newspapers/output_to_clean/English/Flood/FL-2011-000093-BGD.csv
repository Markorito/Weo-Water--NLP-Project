2,2,FL-2011-000093-BGD,Best friend honoured - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-195772,"



Former Indian premier Indira Gandhi was yesterday conferred the ""Bangladesh Freedom Honour"" for her unparalleled support and contributions to Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971.

Her daughter-in-law also president of India's ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, received the posthumous award from Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman on behalf of Indira Gandhi at a ceremony in Bangabhaban.

Indira Gandhi is the first among the foreign friends of Bangladesh to be conferred the highest state honour.

Expressing her heartfelt thanks for the honour, Sonia recalled the tumultuous days of 1971 when her mother-in-law took a firm stance to side with the Bangalee people fighting to establish their own country.

""If Indira Gandhi could have been with us, I know she would have been overwhelmed by the high honour you have bestowed on her,"" Sonia said.

""There can be no honour higher than the one conferred for the freedom of an oppressed people and the birth of a great nation,"" she said.

She said she felt humble and privileged but also proud to accept the award on her mother-in-law's behalf. ""I do so with a very full heart and consciousness that the honour is not her alone but also India's, and in a sense yours as well.""

She said she came to Bangladesh not just to visit another country.

""Memories and emotions flood my mind. My husband and I were present at the airport along with Indira Ji amid massive crowds on the historic morning on January 10, 1972, when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was welcomed in Delhi on his way to his newly free country,"" recalled Sonia.

""The amount of excitement and sense of optimism, indeed the knowledge that history was being made, I can never forget,"" she said.

Sonia concluded her speech by saying, ""Joy Bangla, Joy Bangladesh-India friendship.""

President Zillur Rahman said, ""This is a very special and historic occasion for us, an occasion that will certainly be written in golden letters in the history of both of our nations.""

He said Indira Gandhi inspired millions of Bangladeshis and Indians to fight against all oppression and injustice.

""She launched an intense and bold diplomatic move for Bangladesh, despite challenges by some major powers. She also vigorously pursued the Pakistani authority for safe release of Bangabandhu,"" he said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Indira Gandhi as a true and great friend of Bangladesh, its people, and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

""On Bangabandhu's request, she withdrew the Indian soldiers within three months of Bangladesh's independence. That was a unique gesture of Mrs Indira Gandhi,"" Hasina said.

""We are delighted to honour her with our highest award,"" she said, recalling the eventful days of Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971.

She said Indira Gandhi travelled the world to rally support of the world community for the independence of Bangladesh, and for saving the life of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was then facing capital punishment in a Pakistani jail.

Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said, ""We are here to honour a friend who played the most critical role among all our foreign friends in our nation's journey to statehood. Indira Gandhi changed the course of events in the fateful months of 1971. And with the support she gave to our embattled people, the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh was born. Today we are here to recognise and express our gratitude, and to honour Indira Gandhi.""

The award's teak frame contains two gold plates on both sides of a folded box. Fifty-year-old teak, preserved by the Department of Forest, has been used for the frame.

Sreemati Indira Gandhi's name is inscribed on the plate on the left side in Bangla and English while the plate on the right has the signatures of Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The plate on the left mentions that the award was conferred as the highest token of respect and gratitude of the Bangalee nation to Indira Gandhi for her immense contribution to Bangladesh's War of Independence.

A brief audio-visual documentary was played at the 50-minute ceremony which showed images of Bangladesh's Liberation War, Indira Gandhi's activities during that period, and some of her moments with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The documentary made the audience quite emotional.

The entrance of Bangabhaban was decorated with pictures depicting historic moments of Indira Gandhi during Bangladesh's struggle for liberation. Both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Sonia Gandhi saw the pictures with curiosity.

State Minister for Liberation War Affairs Capt (retd) AB Tajul Islam gave the welcome speech. A large number of dignitaries including some foreign guests were present at the ceremony.

Cabinet Secretary M Abdul Aziz read out the citation conferred on Indira Gandhi.

The event concluded with the playing of the national anthem of Bangladesh.

Indira Gandhi was the third prime minister of India for three consecutive terms from 1966 to 1977, and for a fourth term from 1980 until her assassination in 1984.","Tue, 26 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/all/themes/tds/favicon.ico,"['gandhi', 'rahman', 'minister', 'war', 'sheikh', 'bangladesh', 'indira', 'best', 'bangladeshs', 'honour', 'liberation', 'honoured', 'friend']",

Experts from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal gathered in Kathmandu in late July for discussions on long-term energy security in the Himalayas, concluding a series of planning sessions that aim to put an ambitious10-year regional climate change adaptation plan in motion.



Experts from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal gathered in Kathmandu in late July for discussions on long-term energy security in the Himalayas, concluding a series of planning sessions that aim to put an ambitious10-year regional climate change adaptation plan in motion.The energy meet saw participating nations develop five key strategies for regional cooperation in climate change and energy security, including the diversification in supply and use of cleaner energy resources, enhancing access to clean energy and improving efficiency.“The Himalayas are one of the biologically richest areas on Earth. But they are also among the most vulnerable to climate change,” said Tariq Aziz, leader of WWF’s Living Himalayas Initiative. “Creating conditions that make the uptake of clean energy technologies feasible is an important part of ensuring the needs of local communities are met without negative impacts on the environment,” he said.Held in advance of the November 2011 Climate Summit for a Living Himalayas , the series of meetings examined how the 4 nations can ensure water, food and energy security while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the region.The Himalayas feed seven of Asia’s largest rivers and contain the largest store of freshwater outside the polar ice caps, resources on which the livelihoods of more than 1.3 billion people depend.But climate change is causing many Himalayan glaciers to retreat at a rapid pace, which could contribute to water shortages and have a major impact on freshwater flows. These changes would have a devastating impact on regional food security, the availability of energy resources and biodiversity.Known as the ""roof of the world"", the Himalayas face numerous challenges in addition to climate change. As mountain glaciers melt, wildlife poachers are running rampant, and forests are being cut down for timber or agriculture expansion.As many communities depend on the region's natural resources to maintain their livelihoods and traditions, conservation is an important part of their lives.In 2009, climate change pushed the Thorthormi Tsho glacial lake to the verge of a potentially catastrophic breach in the remote Lunana area of northern Bhutan. Its growing instability required a team of 300 volunteers to artificially lower its water levels before an outburst flood devastated crops, caused massive livestock losses, destroyed vital bridges and roads, and damaged hydropower facilities.Although Thorthormi Tsho was the largest and most dangerous glacial lake in Bhutan at the time, an additional 82 glacial lakes were also identified as growing risks. The potential for these increasingly unstable lakes to breach and flood the area’s fragile landscape illustrate some of the many devastating impacts of climate change in the Himalayas.Recognizing the urgent need for Himalayan nations to build resilience to the impacts of climate change and promote sustainable development, the governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal have agreed to convene the Climate Summit for a Living Himalayas with WWF’s support.“It is encouraging to see four neighboring Eastern Himalayan countries come together to create regional action to adapt to the impacts of climate change on water and biodiversity – two key providers of environmental services in the region”, said WWF’s Tariq Aziz.","Fri, 05 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://awsassets.panda.org/img/scr_239533_370613.jpg,"['regional', 'water', 'climate', 'nations', 'roadmap', 'lead', 'security', 'himalayan', 'develop', 'change', 'bhutan', 'impacts', 'energy', 'himalayas', 'resources', 'summit']", 
4,4,FL-2011-000093-BGD,The Plastic Bag Wars - RollingStone.com,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-plastic-bag-wars-243547/,"–American shoppers use an estimated 102 billion plastic shopping bags each year — more than 500 per consumer. Named by Guinness World Records as “the most ubiquitous consumer item in the world,” the ultrathin bags have become a leading source of pollution worldwide. They litter the world’s beaches, clog city sewers, contribute to floods in developing countries and fuel a massive flow of plastic waste that is killing wildlife from sea turtles to camels. “The plastic bag has come to represent the collective sins of the age of plastic,” says Susan Freinkel, author of Plastic: A Toxic Love Story.

Many countries have instituted tough new rules to curb the use of plastic bags. Some, like China, have issued outright bans. Others, including many European nations, have imposed stiff fees to pay for the mess created by all the plastic trash. “There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore, anywhere,” the United Nations Environment Programme recently declared. But in the United States, the plastics industry has launched a concerted campaign to derail and defeat anti-bag measures nationwide. The effort includes well-placed political donations, intensive lobbying at both the state and national levels, and a pervasive PR campaign designed to shift the focus away from plastic bags to the supposed threat of canvas and paper bags — including misleading claims that reusable bags “could” contain bacteria and unsafe levels of lead.

“It’s just like Big Tobacco,” says Amy Westervelt, founding editor of Plastic Free Times, a website sponsored by the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition. “They’re using the same underhanded tactics — and even using the same lobbying firm that Philip Morris started and bankrolled in the Nineties. Their sole aim is to maintain the status quo and protect their profits. They will stop at nothing to suppress or discredit science that clearly links chemicals in plastic to negative impacts on human, animal and environmental health.”

Made from high-density polyethylene — a byproduct of oil and natural gas — the single-use shopping bag was invented by a Swedish company in the mid-Sixties and brought to the U.S. by ExxonMobil. Introduced to grocery-store checkout lines in 1976, the “T-shirt bag,” as it is known in the industry, can now be found literally every­where on the planet, from the bottom of the ocean to the peaks of Mount Everest. The bags are durable, waterproof, cheaper to produce than paper bags and able to carry 1,000 times their own weight. They are also a nightmare to recycle: The flimsy bags, many thinner than a strand of human hair, gum up the sorting equipment used by most recycling facilities. “Plastic bags and other thin-film plastic is the number-one enemy of the equipment we use,” says Jeff Murray, vice president of Far West Fibers, the largest recycler in Oregon. “More than 300,000 plastic bags are removed from our machines every day — and since most of the removal has to be done by hand, that means more than 25 percent of our labor costs involves plastic-bag removal.”

The initial resistance to plastic bags came from manufacturers of paper bags, who saw them as a major threat. Environmentalists took up the cause of eliminating single-use bags in the 1990s, but they made little headway until a sailor and researcher named Charles Moore passed through the North Pacific Gyre in 1997 and drew international attention to the vast flood of plastic trash polluting the world’s oceans.

The first nationwide ban was enacted a decade ago in Bangladesh, after plastic bags clogged storm drains and caused massive floods. China issued a top-down order banning plastic bags in June 2008 — just two months before it hosted the Olympics — in an effort to reduce the amount of “white pollution.” Even though the ban is openly flouted by street vendors, it has still made a tremendous impact: In the first year alone, China decreased its use of plastic bags by two-thirds, eliminating some 40 billion bags — a move that saved the energy equivalent of 11.7 million barrels of oil.

The Indian city of Delhi boasts some of the world’s most aggressive legislation on plastic bags, not only fining individual users and businesses that hand out the bags but also threatening jail time for offenders and plastic-bag manufacturers. This year, Italy became the first European country to issue a nationwide ban on plastic bags, while Ireland places a 15-cent fee on every bag — a move that reduced usage by 90 percent in the first three months. All told, 25 percent of the world’s population now lives in areas with bans or fees on plastic bags.

While other nations have effectively cracked down on plastic bags, the U.S. government has left local communities to fend for themselves. In 2007, San Francisco became the first American city to ban plastic bags, and Washington, D.C., has imposed a five-cent fee per bag, cutting monthly use from 22.5 million bags to barely 3 million. Unlike attacks on plastic products such as Styrofoam, which were orchestrated by well-known environmental groups, the fight against plastic bags has been led for the most part by community organizers and concerned citizens who put pressure on their local businesses and governments. In recent years, a growing number of U.S. communities — from 30 townships in Alaska to the Outer Banks of North Carolina — have introduced some 200 anti-bag measures.

The widespread mobilization against plastic bags has sparked a counterattack by the plastics industry, which was slow to react to the rising tide of negative sentiment among consumers. Leading the charge to protect the plastic bag is the American Chemistry Council, an industry group whose members include petro-chemical giants like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical. With 125 employees and more than $120 million in annual revenues, the ACC and its members are using their deep pockets and extensive political connections to overturn bans on plastic bags, cast doubt on legitimate scientific studies and even file lawsuits against anti-bag activists. The council, which spent $8 million on lobbying alone last year, has also put together a front group called the Progressive Bag Affiliates, made up of top bag manufacturers like Hilex Poly, Superbag and Unistar Plastics.

The industry campaign has already won several victories. In 2008, after Seattle imposed a 20-cent fee on plastic bags, the ACC spent $180,000 to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot, then devoted another $1.4 million to overturn the fee — the most spent on any Seattle referendum. The industry campaign relied largely on scare tactics, falsely claiming that the fee would cost the average consumer an extra $300 a year. In the end, it came down to money: The bag fee was soundly defeated.

Last year, the ACC weighed in to defeat AB 1998, a California proposal to ban the use of plastic bags in supermarkets, liquor stores and convenience stores statewide. The bill was supported by a broad coalition that included major grocers and retailers as well as recyclers and environmentalists, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger threw his support behind the measure. “There is no question that getting rid of plastic bags would be a great victory for the environment,” he told Rolling Stone. “In California, we put together a coalition of grocers, environmentalists and labor to confront this issue head-on, and it is my hope that the coalition will continue fighting until single-use plastic bags are an ancient memory.”

The ACC and its member companies were determined not to let that happen. In the months before the vote, the industry spent $2 million on contributions to key legislators, extensive lobbying and media ads that portrayed the ban as a “hidden tax on grocery bills” that would “create a new state bureaucracy.” Yielding to industry pressure, the state Senate rejected the ban by a vote of 21 to 14. Even some industry insiders lamented the decision. “AB 1998 was not perfect, but it would have settled the issue and we could all have moved forward,” Robert Bateman, president of bag manufacturer Roplast Industries, wrote in an industry trade journal. “As it is, the uncertainty remains and we are having to deal with a new initiative to ban thin bags each month — or is it each week?”

The warning proved prophetic. In June, the Oregon legislature rejected a statewide ban on plastic bags after the industry moved to aggressively defeat it. “I’m blown away by the campaign to block this bill by out-of-state interests,” says state Sen. Mark Hass, who co-authored the measure. Hilex Poly, a leading bag manufacturer, went so far as to meet with Hass and suggest that it might be willing to build a plant to recycle plastic bags in Oregon — if he agreed to not only drop the statewide ban but also prevent cities and counties from placing their own restrictions on plastic bags.

Hass rejected the deal. “The more I look into the recycling of plastic bags,” he says, “the more I think these recycling plants are more of a PR stunt than anything of substance.” Because most recycling plants can’t handle the ultrathin trash, fewer than nine percent of plastic bags in the U.S. are recycled in any form.

In an even more disturbing tactic, the industry has begun filing lawsuits against activists who raise the alarm about plastic bags. The suits — known as Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation, or SLAPP — are a form of corporate bullying, designed to intimidate and silence opponents who lack the resources to defend themselves against billion-dollar companies. The industry has sued every city or county in California that has passed anti-bag legislation, demanding that the local governments pay for expensive, independent studies on the environmental impact of eliminating plastic bags. And in January, three leading plastic-bag manufacturers filed suit against ChicoBag, a small California company that makes reusable shopping bags, accusing it of causing “irreparable harm” to their business by defaming their product.

ChicoBag was founded by Andy Keller, an unemployed software salesman who visited his local landfill after an afternoon of landscaping in 2004 and was appalled by the blizzard of plastic bags he saw floating around the dump. That same day, he sat down at his kitchen table and started sewing together his own version of an ultrathin, reusable bag. Since then, Keller has become an outspoken opponent of plastic bags, creating a character called the “Bag Monster” to raise awareness about the environmental impact of disposable bags. Volunteers dressed as the monster — wearing a jumpsuit covered in 500 plastic bags, the number used annually by the average American shopper — have visited schools, shopping malls and even the White House.

The industry is suing ChicoBag in South Carolina, the home state of Hilex Poly, which offers little protection against SLAPP suits. Although the lawsuit could put Keller out of business — he has few resources to devote to a prolonged legal battle — it has also backfired on the industry, drawing even more attention to the excessive waste caused by plastic bags. “The whole idea of them suing me is to stop me,” Keller says. “But instead, it has ended up galvanizing the entire movement. It’s like a big school bully that came to try and take my lunch money, and then all the other kids who got picked on start standing up and saying, ‘Hey, we’re not going to take it anymore.'”

Whatever the outcome, the lawsuit reveals just how much the growing movement to eliminate plastic bags has frightened the plastics industry. Banning plastic bags is ultimately a statement against the disposable, throwaway culture we all have become accustomed to and dependent upon. If the plastic bag falls, what’s next? Styrofoam? Plastic water bottles? “We’re going to keep pushing this issue,” says Sarah Sikich, director of coastal resources for Heal the Bay, an environmental group based in Southern California. “It’s a battle we can win. In the end, public awareness and the grassroots movement will overcome the deep pockets of industry groups like the ACC.”

How Microsoft Partners Are Selling Office 365

Now that it's available, partners are prepared to start offering Microsoft's biggest bet in the cloud to date.

The release of Office 365 is arguably the most disruptive new offering to the Microsoft channel in recent memory and one that will change the way many partners sell messaging, collaboration, productivity and communications.

Even if you continue to sell only the on premises-based versions of Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Office, partners know they will have to have a discussion about Office 365 with their customers.

How quickly Office 365 takes off is anyone's guess, but Microsoft has gone out of its way to make it appealing to small and midsize businesses (SMBs), while hopeful of penetrating large enterprises as well. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says the company has sold millions of Business Productivity Online Services (BPOS) seats and by all accounts Office 365 is a major improvement over BPOS.

""Office 365, where Office meets the cloud, is a big step forward,"" Ballmer said on June 28, when he announced the global availability of its new cloud service. The questions that remain are: Will there be a spike in demand for Office 365? Or will it be more measured?

""I think you'll see the flood gates open,"" says Chad Mosman, principal consultant with Microsoft partner MessageOps and one of the first Office 365 MVPs. The reason, he argues, is the technology behind Office 365, namely Exchange 2010 and SharePoint 2010, were designed to run in the cloud. ""The 2007 versions that were used for BPOS were not designed to run in the cloud, yet Microsoft forced them to run in the cloud,"" Mosman says. Specifically, the older versions were not built on a multitenant architecture, while the 2010 releases are.

Now that Office 365 is available, primarily to new customers while BPOS migrations will likely start happening this fall, many of Microsoft's largest cloud partners anticipate a quick surge in demand. ""We feel like a lot of prospects in the market have been in a holding pattern,"" says Tony Safoian, CEO of SADA Systems Inc. ""Now that the product is actually in market, we expect many more organizations to take a look at it seriously.""

Adds Niv Dolgin, SADA's director of IT services: ""I think it will certainly be a floodgate situation but actual numbers are difficult to estimate. But we're very optimistic that the opportunity will be such that we can be selective about the accounts and projects we undertake.""

Avanade, meanwhile, sees more measured movement to Office 365 from BPOS. ""My guess is over the next 18 months we'll be doing a lot of work in helping customers transition to Office 365,"" says Bob Fahey, senior director for cloud services at Avanade. ""We've taken some big strides in making sure people are fully trained and ready to help deliver as quickly as we can.""

Jay Ritchie, a technical architect at CDW, a large account reseller with one of the largest BPOS customer lists, is not certain whether there will be an immediate spike in demand or whether it will be more measured. ""We're not sure what will happen, but we are ready for both,"" Ritchie says.

""Office Pro Plus will give us a lot of momentum due to customers looking to update their current Office suite -- we'll be able to leverage that in a larger collaboration conversation.""



Jay Ritchie, Technical Architect, CDW

CDW is a Cloud Accelerate partner, Microsoft Premier Deployment Partner and Cloud Partner Advisory Council member, ""all of which gives us great insight to planning, allowing us to solidify our go-to-market strategy,"" he says. ""We'll begin to move beyond hosted e-mail and focus more on the value of the entire suite, including Office Pro Plus. Office Pro Plus will give us a lot of momentum due to customers looking to update their current Office suite -- we'll be able to leverage that in a larger collaboration conversation.""

Dave Cutler, general manager of Slalom Consulting in Chicago is planning a similar approach. With BPOS, the big seller for Slalom was Exchange Online. ""It was the e-mail side,"" Cutler says. ""It had SharePoint, it had Office Communicator, it had Live Meeting, which were valuable tools, but people were really interested -- at least in our experience -- in the e-mail side.""

What Cutler has seen so far with Office 365 is that there's an increased interest in the full suite. ""Certainly e-mail continues to be a strong driver, but people are really interested in the capabilities of SharePoint, people are really interested in the capabilities of Lync, and we're seeing people look to deploy the suite,"" he says.

As such, Cutler is changing his sales motions around the full value proposition of the Office 365 suite. ""You get the 'better together' message; three products with presence that links them all together, the coordination that brings them all together. I think Office 365 really opens that door to that better together message. So we're changing the way we sell it, we're changing the way that we represent it, and the way we position it with our customers to make sure people understand the true value of the platform, not just a single product in the platform.""

Services Opportunities

As with BPOS, partners who sell Office 365 subscriptions earn 12 percent of revenues for net seat additions plus 6 percent on renewals, totaling 18 percent margins in year one and 6 percent in subsequent years. That's a far cry from the margin opportunities associated with deploying on-premises Exchange and SharePoint systems. But Microsoft officials say there's plenty of opportunity to earn services dollars with Office 365.

""The real opportunity for partners is the professional services they surround Office 365 with,"" says John Betz, director of product management for the Microsoft Business Online Services Group. ""Whether it's help desk or deployment or SharePoint customization -- the subscription fees are nice but the larger opportunity is for making the technology apply to the business. It's partners upping their game, getting out of patching and managing servers and spending the contract dollars on addressing the business need.""","Thu, 04 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://rcpmag.com/~/media/ECG/rcpmag/rcplogo.jpg,"['channel', 'microsoft', 'selling', 'bpos', '365', 'cloud', 'partners', 'partner', 'office', 'sharepoint', 'way', 'redmond', 'suite', 'services']",

8,8,FL-2011-000093-BGD,UK Minister Compares Inaction on Climate Change to Hitler Appeasement - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2011/07/22/207750.htm,"World leaders who oppose a global agreement to tackle climate change are making a similar mistake to the one made by politicians who tried to appease Adolf Hitler before World War Two, a British government minister said on Thursday.

Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Huhne said governments must redouble efforts to find a successor to the United Nations Kyoto Protocol on emissions, although it was unlikely that a breakthrough would be made at a conference later this year in Durban, South Africa.

The global economic crisis has pushed the search for a legally binding treaty to limit planet-warming emissions down the political agenda and countries do not want to lose their competitive edge by going it alone on strict climate targets, he said.

In a speech urging countries to keep pressing for a climate deal, Huhne evoked the memory of British wartime leader Winston Churchill and the fight against Nazi Germany led by Hitler.

“Climate change is getting less political attention now than it did two years ago. There is a vacuum, and the forces of low ambition are looking to fill it,” he said. “Giving in to the forces of low ambition would be an act of climate appeasement.

“This is our Munich moment,” he added, referring to the Munich Agreement, a 1938 pact that gave Hitler land in the former Czechoslovakia as part of a failed attempt to persuade him to abandon further territorial expansion.

“Winston Churchill…once said that ‘an appeaser is someone that feeds a crocodile, hoping that it will eat him last’.”

The Kyoto Protocol, which controls greenhouse gas emissions only in developed countries, expires at the end of 2012. Developing nations want to extend Kyoto, but Japan, Russia and Canada want a new, wider agreement.

Poorer countries say rich nations have emitted most greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution and must extend Kyoto before poor countries can be expected to sign up.

But Huhne said there was no time to lose if the world was to avoid higher temperatures that would bring a catastrophic mix of drought, storms, disease and rising sea levels.

“We cannot wait for every country to become equal, because that would mean waiting for an eternity,” he told an audience at the Chatham House think tank in London. “At some point, we must draw a line and say: this starts now. This starts here.”

He said temperatures must be kept within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change. They have already risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius [1.44°F] and even if all emissions were stopped today, they would rise by a further 0.5 of a degree [0.9°F], he said.

“Sticking to our 2 degree limit means global emissions must peak by 2020 at the latest,” Huhne said.

While major progress in Durban looks unlikely, there is scope for optimism in two years’ time, he added.

“From 2013, there will be new political leadership in the world’s major economies. We hope to have put the global recession behind us. The stars may be more closely aligned in favor of a binding legal deal,” he said.

Irony has a way of emerging in tragedies. For example, there is a village in Thatta named Mazdoor, which means labourer or construction worker, that is painfully going through the process of “rebuilding” itself after the flood. Luckily though, it has some help. The United Nations Development Programme and a non-profit HANDS are pitching in.





In order to mark the first anniversary of the 2010 floods, the UNDP has set up an early recovery project with HANDS to reconstruct 198 houses in the village, install solar-powered street lights, rehabilitate community infrastructure and assist with vocational training for women and girls.The latest addition to this project was the donation of $10,000 from the United Nations goodwill ambassador for early recovery, tennis star Aisamul Haq Qureshi, who travelled through Thatta this weekend to hand over the keys of the newly constructed houses.It takes four hours to reach the village in Jati tehsil, where the men are still laying bricks and fixing up roofs with wood and reed. The women are learning to sew in the hope of earning some money with the skill taught to them by the United Nations Development Programme workers.Despite the challenges, the Jatti sense of hospitality was ever present. Qureshi’s arrival was feted by a tent and a big ‘Welcome’ written on the ground. UNDP country director Toshihiro Tanaka was present. The excitement evaporated with the women’s smiles that disappeared when they began to speak of their losses and how much damage was done by the waters.As they speak, it is difficult to ignore that the whites of their eyes have turned yellow because of the impossible hygiene conditions, water supply and nuitrition problems. HANDS worker Asma Maheen explained that most of the people here are suffering from Hepatitis B or C. As the village does not have any clinic as such they die on the way to hospital because of the bad roads.The villagers also struggle to get three meals a day on the table. They are addicted to gutka which helps kill the hunger and bind like glue their senses into thinking that the visits from “big” people from the city will help them rebuild their lives.The villagers survived almost entirely on the aid provided by NGOs, explained Rahila Rahim, who works on gender, development and poverty alleviation programmes with HANDS, which has worked in these areas for 12 years with UNDP and USAid funding. As the government did not come to help, the UNDP had to start from scratch as these areas do not have proper roads, gas, electricity or water.The rehabilitation project is focused on building houses for 250 people in the village. The one-room house would serve as a verandah, bedroom and lounge for a family and has a cubical kitchen in front with a basic bathroom at the back. So far only 25 have been built and they still need roofs.As Qureshi and Tanaka handed the keys to one family, the rest of the village crowded around them, not because they had a celebrity in their midst but because they were still waiting for their houses to be madeThe new house owner, Lali, was grateful but dreaded getting her husband to plaster the walls. But despite the long haul, the aid workers are optimistic. They’ve already seen results in Dadu which was hit even harder by the waters. The reconstruction there has taken place and looks good, leading to the hope that Jati will soon look the same or even better.Sohni, a woman with eight children who is struggling through life by working as a maid in Thatta, also received her new house keys. “This is my house, it is complete, just that the roof has yet to be laid,” she said. “It’s a relief that these people are still coming. It gives us the hope that our lives will change.” She admitted though that their basic struggle was to get through each day. She also eyed the sewing machines given out.Meanwhile, the men in Jatti look just as fragile and unhealthy as the women. They do not know exactly what to do to make money since they do not have enough resources to start planting crops again.The UNDP project has, however, provided them with carts. But unfortunately, there are no donkeys or livestock to pull them. There is no produce to pile on to the carts either. “I really don’t know what to do with the cart, I have no cow or a donkey,” said Basheer. “I’ve asked the city-people [UNDP staff] about the livestock but they have told me that they cannot provide it at the moment.” He has six children who he tries to feed by doing odd jobs in Thatta.Meanwhile, the children have little else to do except run around in their bare feet with their crowns of matted hair. They try to go to school the non-profit set up because there is nothing much else to do.Non-government organisations can only do so much, however. The conditions in Jati speak volumes of the absence of government. The difficulty is that because the State is nowhere to be seen, the villagers pin all their hope on the aid workers. Given the condition, work is grindingly slow.Tanaka has had experience with this situation. The work started in April and is unlikely to be finished by September. “Rehabilitation is always slow but in my opinion once the project finishes they will have a better life,” he said. “They will have things they never had before [solar-powered lights and concrete houses]. However, my concern is continuity.” He acknowledged that the six-month project will not be done in time but in the grand scheme of things the deadline is not necessarily what matters. The ability of the HANDS team to continue to work with the villagers is of essence. “These people have already suffered a lot and leaving them in the middle with incomplete infrastructure is worse than not giving anything at all.”Published in The Express Tribune, July 25, 2011.","Mon, 25 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/216591-VillageBaghoPHOTOUNDPPAKISTAN-1311534080.jpg,"['villagers', 'hands', 'hope', 'cases', 'undp', 'houses', 'work', 'named', 'project', 'house', 'women', 'pitch', 'workers', 'reconstruct', 'village', 'mazdoor', 'aid', 'neediest']",

Partners: 6 Ways To Get Free Microsoft Product Licenses

Hidden in plain sight within the Microsoft Partner Network are six places where partners can get free product licenses. Hint: Check your Internal Use Rights.

When it comes to Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) benefits, sometimes not even the most connected partners are aware of what's available to them. Julie Bennani, general manager of the MPN, recounted a recent conversation with one of the company's longest-standing ISV partners.

""The [business decision maker] brought the CTO up with him,"" Bennani recalls. ""The three of us were in a room. I looked at the CTO, and said, 'Do you know that we have online technical communities with an SLA and phone-based presales advisory hours?' His face lit up. He went back and he started to get his full technical team plugged in directly.""

Microsoft, of course, doesn't offer its partner benefits for no reason. The company wants partners to leverage them. ""We want to help partners, we want them to be current, we want them to be agile,"" Bennani says.

Nowhere is this truer than with one of Microsoft's most valuable benefits. Known as Internal Use Rights, or IURs, they basically amount to free licenses for Microsoft products, one of the most critical benefits for Microsoft partners.

Why Internal Use Rights Exist

The advantages of the licenses for partners are obvious. When it comes to running an IT-based company, one of the biggest expenses is software costs. For a few hundred dollars, partners can find ways to fully outfit a 10-person firm with more Microsoft software than they would otherwise use. For less than $4,000, partners with up to a few hundred people can completely outfit their organizations. And for partner companies interested in putting their infrastructure in the cloud and selling Microsoft cloud-based solutions, a free sign-up supports an organization of up to 250 people.

""There's a small percentage of partners who completely maximize their IUR and then there's a lot of partners that aren't even close.""



Julie Bennani, General Manager, Microsoft Partner Network

""It's a very valuable benefit both for the partner organization as a whole, but then [also for] skilling their people. The best way to do that is to play with the product,"" Bennani says.

Naturally, MPN membership requires a fair amount of training, and IURs help partners' technical staff prepare for exams.

Obviously, Microsoft has a vested interest in minimizing software costs to reduce the start-up costs for businesses that will sell Microsoft solutions and any friction those partners might have in getting their people trained.

But there are other, more complex reasons. The more familiar partners are with Microsoft products from everyday, in-house use, the better they're able to articulate the benefits of those products in presales discussions. Partners who use the software know the features at a deep level and understand the core value proposition of the products in a more visceral way. The more they troubleshoot the products in their real-world internal deployments, the more experienced their technical people are when it comes time to install and support their customers' Microsoft-based systems.

Even partners who use products internally that they don't sell or support can become important advocates for the value of those products in their roles as trusted advisors for certain customers.

One example is Brittenford Systems Inc., a Washington, D.C.-area Gold Certified Partner. While most of the company's business is in other areas, the 30-person firm has been on Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 internally for two and half years and recently moved to Lync 2010.

CTO Ryan Risley recommends the product for other partners, even if they don't plan to sell Lync.

""The cultural aspects have been astounding,"" Risley says. ""It's really helped us become even more tight-knit [as a company].""

Brittenford uses Lync to bring new staff up to speed more quickly through the presence-aware contact lists and screen-sharing capabilities, to help the office manager route service calls immediately and to brainstorm through the shared whiteboarding capabilities.

Risley is finding one other benefit that every consultant can relate to: ""Our old phone system was at headquarters, and we didn't have soft phones. If you called out from a client [to another client] and you used your cell phone, they'd love to hang onto that cell phone number. Having a client have your cell phone is not always the best solution.""

For Microsoft's mature products that are rich in little-known features, partner enthusiasm often grows with familiarity -- helping the partners make a solid case for the products and helping Microsoft's bottom line.

That said, this win-win is rarely fully utilized by partners. ""There's a small percentage of partners who completely maximize their IUR and then there's a lot of partners that aren't even close,"" Bennani says.

While many partners had a pretty good idea about their IUR allowances under the old Microsoft Partner Program (MSPP), Microsoft rearchitected its benefits in the gradual rollout of the MPN over the last few years. Given the new structure of the MPN, a refresher on where to find the license benefits in the new MPN is in order.

There are many ways to obtain IURs from Microsoft. Here we provide detailed descriptions of six of Microsoft's best caches of software licenses intended for partners.

1. Action Pack Solution Provider

Under the old MSPP, Microsoft Action Pack Subscription (MAPS) was one of the best deals for partners interested in getting a lot of software to test and use for a very minimal commitment. In the MPN, Microsoft has changed the program somewhat, dividing it in two parts, tinkering with the exact benefits and changing the price. Nonetheless, the changes haven't altered the fundamental character of the Action Pack. The kit remains one of the best tools for jump-starting a solution provider or developer business in the Microsoft channel ecosystem.

The Solution Provider version costs $329 (all prices in this article are for U.S. partners), and the rule of thumb as far as licenses go is 10 for client and one for servers. Client software in bundles of 10 in the Action Pack Solution Provider are

Office 2010 Professional Plus 2010,

Windows 7 Professional,

Visio Professional 2010,

Business Contact Manager 2010,

MapPoint North America 2010 and

Client Access Licenses (CALs) for Lync Server 2010 Standard, Exchange Server 2010 Standard, SharePoint Server 2010 Enterprise, SQL Server 2008 R2, System Center Data Protection Manager 2010, System Center Essentials 2010, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 Terminal Server and Windows Small Business Server 2011.

There's one license for each of the servers for which the Action Pack offers CALs, except for the two System Center products, each of which comes with three server licenses.

Exceptions to the 10 client/one server rule are Project Professional 2010 with five, Windows 7 Ultimate with one and Dynamics CRM Workgroup Server 2011 with one server and five users. An upgrade is available for partner organizations looking to support more than five users.

Action Pack Solution Provider also comes with TechNet subscription benefits.

All the software in the Action Pack is provided via digital delivery; for an extra $100 per year, partners can get discs mailed to them.

2. Action Pack Development & Design

For ISVs and custom-development partners, the Action Pack Development & Design is a low-cost way to flood the organization with licenses. Generally the program will also outfit an organization or department of about 10 people.

The developer version includes just about all the software in the Solution Provider version, but combines that software licensing with some critical development tools. These tools include a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscription, Visual Studio 2010 Professional, Expression Studio 4 Web Professional, SQL Server 2008 R2 Datacenter, Office SharePoint Designer 2010, Hyper-V Server 2008, Virtual PC 2007 and Virtual Server 2005 R2.

The kit sells for $429 for digital delivery and $529 for physical media.","Mon, 08 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://rcpmag.com/~/media/ECG/rcpmag/rcplogo.jpg,"['channel', 'products', 'microsoft', 'software', 'action', '2010', 'free', 'partners', 'benefits', 'licenses', 'pack', 'partner', 'server', 'redmond', 'ways', 'product']", 
12,12,FL-2011-000093-BGD,Why Wall Street Likes Reinsurance Business - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2011/08/09/209906.htm,"Warren Buffett’s entry into the bidding for Transatlantic Holdings is drawing fresh attention to the reinsurance industry, which specializes in writing insurance for insurers in a way that frees up those companies to take on more risk.

With cheap valuations and the potential for quick returns and lucrative fees, it is little wonder that Wall Street has always liked the reinsurance business.

From hubs in Bermuda, London, Switzerland and Germany, the largest reinsurers collectively write more than $100 billion a year in new premiums, and as long as major disasters don’t sap their capital, they hum along as steadily as anything else in the financial sector.

“Within the overall financial services sector you have one of the most attractive valuations, and you have a catalyst that is somewhat separate from some of the macro issues out there,” said Cathy Seifert, an insurance equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s who covers many of the Bermudan players. “The financial sector is sort of not an in-favor sector right now but in that sector these stocks look attractive.”

While shares in investment banks and brokers trade at a multiple of 1.34 times their book value, for example, reinsurers trade at closer to 0.74 times book in the current market, according to Thomson Reuters data.

BERKSHIRE BUYS IN

That in and of itself makes the business attractive to the likes of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway entered the fray for Transatlantic last weekend with an offer that values the company at less than 0.8 times book.

As one financial services banker put it, Buffett could buy Transatlantic, shut it down and still make money on it as its already written book of business runs off over time.

If he succeeds, the Transatlantic deal could vault the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group into the No. 3 slot globally behind European titans Munich Re and Swiss Re.

“Predictability is difficult in this business, but at the end of the day Buffett likes insurance businesses because he gets to put float to work,” said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst at Edward Jones, referring to the cash pile insurers hold and invest while waiting to pay claims.

Whichever way Transatlantic answers, no one expects Berkshire to get into a three-way fight over price with the other two potential buyers.

“I don’t think Berkshire will be in a bidding war. I think they made an offer and that’ll be that,” said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, whose largest shareholding is in Berkshire.

LONG INVESTING HISTORY

Putting the float to work, as Buffett may aspire to do with Transatlantic, is one of the factors that has drawn Wall Street to the reinsurance business in past.

Transatlantic suitors Allied World and Validus Holdings were both co-founded by affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

Each is part of a disaster “class,” a group of reinsurers founded after a major capital-absorbing event like the 9/11 attacks or Hurricane Katrina. When a disaster like one of those events suddenly takes up tens of billions of dollars of reinsurance capital, companies rush in to take advantage of the subsequent increase in insurance pricing.

In fact, according to a 2008 economic analysis of the Bermudan insurance market by the Wharton School, at least four of the 11 insurers from the “class of 2005” had investment banks or top-tier private equity firms as lead investors. The same was true for at least three of the 10 firms from the 2001 class and four of the nine firms from the 1993 class.

In some cases, those Wall Street sponsors have started a company and then cashed out with an initial public offering or a trade sale as quickly as they could. In other cases, they have kept a significant stake in the business and maintained a banking relationship with the company.

Some of that has to do with what the insurance industry refers to as “long-tail risk” versus “short-tail risk” — in other words, how quickly the insurer is likely to see claims for coverage from insureds.

Long-tail risk, where claims may come in years after the fact, would include things like medical malpractice coverage and worker’s compensation policies. Short-tail risk, on the other hand, is the reinsurance people think of more typically, such as hurricane coverage.

The financial services banker said Wall Street firms like short-tail reinsurers for their ability to start them and sell them quickly, but they also like long-tail reinsurers because they can obtain deals to manage the float for those insurance companies and be paid fees as a result.

CLASS OF 2011?

Given the attraction, there has been speculation in the industry that 2011 could eventually host its own disaster class. Insurers and reinsurers have lost more than $60 billion this year on natural disasters like the Japanese and New Zealand earthquakes and U.S. tornadoes.

That has not been enough to cause a so-called “hard market,” where insurers can raise prices across the board, but it has come close. Given that the worst of hurricane season is just starting, many believe a single U.S. landfall of a major hurricane would be enough to force that market turn.

If so, capital could rush in quickly; in 2005, for example, some of the new reinsurers were formed within two months or so of Katrina devastating New Orleans.

“It’s not 2001, and it’s not 2005 but slowly and gradually, it is a catalyst, and it is a catalyst that is bearing down on a group that is trading below their tangible book value,” S&P’s Seifert said.

13,13,FL-2011-000093-BGD,How Rigid is Scrum? - InfoQ.com,https://www.infoq.com/news/2011/07/rigid-scrum/,"Scrum is seen as an adaptive and flexible software development methodology which aims to improve the development process. Over the years, there have been many success stories which have been attributed to Scrum. However, some teams continue to smell a good amount of inflexibility and rigidity. Is it Scrum at fault or is it a flawed adoption process?

Terry Bunio, in his letter to Scrum mentioned, how he was initially charmed by the processes and procedures in Scrum. However, slowly he felt that the rigidity of the framework did not help him with the freedom that was required for the success of the project.

I really did need a process where I could add requirements during a sprint when it made sense. I didn’t want to be limited in the duration of retrospectives if I thought there was more to discuss. … I hated being referred to as a Scrum Master. The actual role seemed to diminish my value as a Project Manager and made me just a coach of the process instead of a valued team member. I felt that I wasn’t actually part of the team anymore.

Marek Blotny, had a similar feeling about the practice of daily standup. According to Marek, he did not like the idea of team members being in a 'hold state' until their turn to speak. This killed spontaneous knowledge sharing. He mentioned that at times, keeping to the hard set limit of 15 minutes did not help either. If there is a good discussion going on and the entire team is involved then that discussion should flow.

So if you ask me if enforcing so rigid structure of daily scrum make sense. I will answer … definitely not! On one hand you have effective and useful daily scrums which encourage teamwork and on the other quite rigid structure and doing everything by the book.

Rod Claar mentioned that though Scrum is flexible, teams adopting Scrum tend to make it rigid so that they can do right when they are doing it for the first time. Rachel Davies also saw this tendency in teams adopting Scrum. She mentioned,

When I hear about Scrum Masters or teams attempting to ""do Scrum by the book"" it sets alarm-bells ringing for me. Scrum is a starting point on a team's journey towards agile software development. Being Scrum is not the real goal. We use Scrum to deliver product increments. No one is going to come along to your team to check up on your Scrum conformance.

Geoffrey Wiseman added that rigidity of a process and agility are not necessarily diagrammatically opposite. The process might define that there should be no interference once a sprint is started. The sprint might be seen as an atom of planning and implementation but it is definitely open to practical flexibility.

Is that a hard line to take? Perhaps, yeah. Some might argue that if you can't live within those constraints, you shouldn't use that process. But practically speaking, can a sprint survive a momentary re-routing of a resource? Yes, I think it can, both in letter and in spirit.

Thus the rigidity of the process is as strong as the team wants it to be. Though, it is good to adhere to the constraints lest the entire process ends up in chaos however, being rigid to the extent of ignoring practical conditions is detrimental both to the project and the team.","Thu, 28 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.infoq.com/statics_s2_20210511-0409/styles/static/images/logo/logo-big.jpg,"['development', 'good', 'rigid', 'team', 'mentioned', 'teams', 'scrum', 'rigidity', 'sprint', 'process']", 
14,14,FL-2011-000093-BGD,The psychoanalysis of Pakistan - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/213755/the-psychoanalysis-of-pakistan,"The door creaked open as the therapist led Pakistan into the room, his clothes drenched, his hair wild, his shirt unbuttoned, his hands covered in mud. “This is the last time I see you without an appointment, Pakistan.” The therapist tried not to reward Pakistan by obliging to his unannounced visits and subsequent tantrums, but this time, she knew that there was something terribly wrong.



Pakistan lay on the couch, with the therapist sitting behind him close to the door. She dimmed the lights, giving the weathered wood paneling a bronze glow. She hadn’t known Pakistan for long, but long enough to detect a disturbing pattern. Having changed several therapists, Pakistan followed a predictable course with all of his previous shrinks — starting off in a blaze of intimacy, slowly withdrawing, reaching a point of violent confrontation and then starting over with someone else. She knew that he badly needed her to understand him, even as he erected every possible obstacle in her endeavours to do so. Every session with Pakistan was a struggle — both for the therapist, as she tried to decipher his thoughts and motivations beneath the white noise of his obscurantist denial and obsessive paranoia — and for him, as he resolutely prevented her (and himself) from reaching his innermost chambers.



The therapist had no idea just how old Pakistan was, for even by his own accounts, his birth was a matter of great dispute. Pakistan was born either in the Bronze Age when the Indus Valley Civilisation was established in Mohenjodaro. Or, in the 8th century with the arrival of Muhammad bin Qasim, the 17-year-old Arab general, who became the first man to plant the flag of Islam in the Indian Subcontinent. Along the way, he also planted seeds in the collective Jungian psyche, the shoots from which continue to surface to this day. Sometimes he claimed to be born as a reactionary ideal in 1857. His real genesis, in 1947, was corroborated by an official birth certificate. Though that might simply be the day he was separated from his Siamese twin in a rather bloody operation.



The therapist took out her file to review her notes. From session to session, Pakistan varied from bouts of extreme pride and grandiosity– touting the mark on his forehead from excessive prostration during prayer, picking fights with the toughest boys in the neighbourhood, showing off the missile tattoos on his biceps — to states of despicable self-loathing — slitting his wrists to atone for his ‘sins’, claiming to have disavowed his religion and his brethren, shooting up heroin to disassociate himself from self-reflection. It was difficult to pin a diagnosis on him. Her initial hunch was that he had manic depression, swinging from grandiosity to doom and gloom. But she couldn’t pick that diagnosis, since these personality traits had persisted since about as long as the therapist could note. She relied on what she knew of Pakistan’s life thus far to inch closer towards a diagnosis.



Pakistan’s childhood remained of great interest to the therapist. While it was a topic that Pakistan refused to confront directly, drawing from his nightmares, his rambling digressions, and notes she had received from his previous therapists, a vague picture had come together. Born on the stroke of midnight, Pakistan and his twin brother, India, had had a tumultuous childhood, resulting in frequent fights, bleeding noses and cut lips. Orphaned in his infancy with the premature death of his father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, frequently beaten by his estranged brother (who also took away Pakistan’s favourite cashmere sweater), deeply insecure due to his short stature, and lacking any sort of guiding hand, Pakistan had a tormented upbringing. Once he attacked his brother to take back his sweater but failed (though he still claims it was his brother who started that particular round of fisticuffs). To this day, Pakistan refused to acknowledge any blood relationship with his brother, claiming to be a separate entity from him.



After his companion and childhood friend, Bangla, abandoned him in the early ‘70s, instead of reflecting on the many years of neglect and abuse he had inflicted on her, Pakistan transitioned into another high of energy. His charisma won him many friends and he formed a relationship with a mysterious sheikh, who would go on to have a deep impact on him. Sheikh Al-Wahab charmed Pakistan with his white robes and his shiny Rolexes (which he would jingle whenever he wanted Pakistan’s attention). The therapist could see that Pakistan believed that the sheikh, and his devout breed of Islam, offered him a chance to reconstruct his identity … but it was a dangerous façade.



Armed with this new identity, Pakistan entered a phase of gradual psychological self-mutilation, wherein he began to erase all memories that contradicted his new self. He grew a beard, rode his pants high on his tummy and learnt Arabic, but forgot his own native tongue. In his attempt to be born anew, he began to loathe himself: his brown skin, the festivals he celebrated, and the culture he shared with his estranged brother.



Pakistan’s newly found religiosity didn’t go entirely unnoticed. In fact, Uncle Sam encouraged Pakistan’s violent streak in order to settle a score against its long time adversary by training Pakistan’s crazy cousin, Talib. With his AK-47 loaded with incendiary rounds and an even more incendiary faith, Talib, with the help of his Arab roommate, Qaeda, and Pakistan’s full backing, did for Uncle Sam what no one else could have. After the fight, when Pakistan and Talib turned around to celebrate their victory with a series of high-fives and ‘Allah-u-Akbar’ chants, Sam was nowhere to be found. All they had to show for their efforts was a crate full of Kalashnikovs, heads full of grandiose delusions and a stash of smack to ensure insight remained an unwanted guest.



Pakistan, far from smothering Talib’s zeal, channeled it to settle scores with India in his unending struggle to regain his cashmere sweater. But in his efforts to agitate Talib against India, it was Pakistan who was influenced by his oddly appealing cousin. Meanwhile, Qaeda ran out of his supply of Ritalin® and, no longer in the spotlight, grew increasingly bored in his suburban house-cave. Convinced that Sam, who no longer showered him with attention, was the root of all the evils in the neighborhood, Qaeda went to Sam’s house with his bamboo stick and poked it right into Sam’s eye. Sam, infuriated, attacked Qaeda, who had taken refuge in Talib’s house-cave next to Pakistan’s, and demanded of Pakistan that he too join him in fighting both Qaeda and Talib. Scared out of his wits by the heavily muscled and belligerent Sam, Pakistan shaved his beard and donned a suit to convince Sam that he was ‘with him, not against him’. But in his heart, Pakistan could not abandon Talib, and banking on Sam’s short attention span (possibly due to serious ADHD), hoped to be able to hold off any Public Displays of Affection with Talib until Sam’s interest fizzled out.



But Talib just didn’t get it. He began to attack Pakistan for supporting Sam. Talib and Qaeda dealt Pakistan blows the likes of which he had never received, tearing into him, ripping apart whatever was important to him. But for all the pain they inflicted on him, Pakistan blamed everyone else in the neighborhood. Unable to remove himself from his association with Talib and Qaeda, and yet fully aware of their actions, the therapist noted that Pakistan found himself more confused, more in pain, more depressed and more vulnerable, than ever before.



The therapist formulated Pakistan’s history into what she regarded as a pattern of unstable identity, unstable relationships and fearful attachments. She started crossing out all the different diagnoses she had written on her sheet including adjustment disorder, substance abuse, depression with psychotic features, dysthymia and anti-social personality disorder, until the only diagnosis un-maimed by her pen was borderline personality disorder.



And yet, even armed with this knowledge, the therapist continued to have a difficult relationship with Pakistan. She knew that this was not just because Pakistan was, to put it mildly, un-normal, for she barely knew anyone in the entire neighbourhood who was.



“What happened, Pakistan? You look terrible.”



Pakistan remained mum, looking blankly up at the ceiling. The therapist prodded on, “Why do you have mud on your hands?”



“A great flood destroyed my house. I had to dig myself out of the rubble. My cow, Rani, my princess, I couldn’t find her. The waters took her away. My crops have all run a-waste.” Pakistan spoke in a monotone, staring blankly at the ceiling. The therapist didn’t know what to feel. A part of her believed he was pre-schizophrenic, his ability to process reality crumbling slowly. Another part felt that the heroin was like a virus, forever impairing his ability to test reality. She tried to feel sympathy for him, but found herself unable to do so. “Did anyone help you out?”



“Sam helped me out, not because he cared, but because he feared that if I lost my mind a bit more, I would blow up in his face.”



The therapist carried on, without believing his entire flood story. Just a few years back he had come running to her, with an earthquake-story in which his house was leveled, and here he was again, carrying on what was now becoming a comically long list of tragedies, some real, some imagined. “Why do you think these catastrophes happen to you?”



“It is a test of my faith, or a punishment for my transgressions, I can’t seem to understand.” The therapist’s attempts at objectivity began to fail, as Pakistan’s contradictions started to amuse her. His misery became a source of mirth, rather than solemn reflection.



“What transgressions?”



“I have failed my religion and no matter how much I pray for forgiveness, Allah continues to punish me. And I continue to be Sam’s slave. I have shaved my beard and started wearing suits just so that he does not suspect me of being with Talib. But inside, I know that I am in the wrong, and that is why Allah-Almighty punishes me.”



“But haven’t these Muslim ‘brothers’, hurt you more than even those who you claim are your enemies, including your actual sibling? Look at how you’re bruised, scarred, hurt — isn’t that the work of your so-called brothers?”



“They are angry, and justified in being so.”



“So they have the right to spew hatred and commit violence, but no one else does? Why bend the rules for them? Your sheikh has taken more from you than even your worst enemies: he took away you.”



“What is that supposed to mean? I have me.”



“What me, Pakistan? What of you do you have left?” The therapist’s frail figure shook, her spectacles danced on the bridge of her nose, as she continued to unabashedly counter-transfer.



“All of me is here in front of you. Me, born to live life governed by the laws of Islam, and to vanquish the apostates who tarnish its name.”



“But how can that be! Don’t you remember that when you were born, not in the 8th Century, but in 1947, your first law minister was a Hindu, and your finance minister was an Ahmadi, a sect you now consider as worthy of murder!”



“That cannot be true! Why wouldn’t I remember it if it were so? Wait, you are right, but how…?”



The blank look left Pakistan. Suddenly, he was awash with palpable emotion. The therapist knew what was going on, a rock had been upturned, and from beneath it had scampered out a thousand repressed memories. Memories of a father who never said his prayers, who swore by his suit and his whisky, of a time when festivals were marked with kites flying in the sky rather than blood from sacrificial animals running in the streets. Clearly in pain, Pakistan held his head. He tried to get up from the couch, before falling onto his knees, his hands covering his ears, ensuring that nothing but the voice within was heard. The therapist ran to the door, but stayed on to look at Pakistan writhe as alarmed guards ran in to pin him to the ground. Her unfinished case history was still lying next to her chair in the room. She was shaking. This would be her last session with Pakistan not so much because Pakistan’s malady awoke no empathy in her anymore, but because she knew she had stepped on the wrong side of Pakistan’s split monochromic psychological spectrum of blacks and whites.



Pakistan’s search for reflection began anew; a search that he ensured was always a never-ending spiral, where the journey itself is enacted only to avoid the destination. The therapist wondered who Pakistan would be if she were to meet him after some time; she wasn’t even sure if she would recognize him. She held the notebook tightly next to her chest and walked off determined to hold on to her diagnosis, if nothing else. And yet, she knew that in spite of all that he had endured (and inflicted) he had still lived to tell the tale. A survivor and stubborn to the core, she knew he’d be back. And while he wouldn’t be pretty for his pains, she knew, irrationally, that she might just like to see him again.

“I’m a teacher.”



“Teacher of what?”



“I teach film.”



“Sir jee he is lying! Who on earth teaches films after all?’’

“Bloody civilian!”

“What do you do?” an officer asked.After an anguished bit of silence, I replied.This was about two weeks back, while I was entering the Lahore Cantonment, when army personnel stopped me at a check-point. The minute I was about to leave after the usual investigation, I heard an army officer say something out of the blue, that offended me to the core:I instantly turned back and strictly asked the reason for their immoral stunt, also impelling them to apologize. They did not expect such a reaction, and thus resorted to harassing me in the way I’ve mentioned above.What had given the courage to this uniformed gang to affront the people? Our people’s almost sacred love for the military A constant delusion of Pakistan’s majority regarding their armed forces has been the most effective tool for the military forces to keep their hegemony alive. This delusion is the upshot of our state’s policy of distorting and narrowing the history since its inception in 1947.""Hindus are our worst enemies, India is behind every misery, Islam is the center of the universe and Pakistan is the greatest nation"" are the compulsory clichés of our curricula and hence the first few things our children begin to learn and believe in. Why are we surprised over this hate culture which culminated in an era of terror and horrid bloodshed? What else can be expected from a generation which has grown up in the siege of state-sponsored illusions and cultural narcissism?On the one hand, the content of our state-prescribed text books inject our minds with hatred for almost everything that has officially been declared “against the religious and national sentiments” of the country. On the other hand, they continue to preach the 'heroics' of Pakistan’s military forces, with a strong emphasis on the “great nationalist” army dictators, portraying them as the protagonists of the state's chaotic history. This nauseating propaganda is the foremost reason behind this delusional culture. People mostly see the military as the most “organized, committed and corruption free” national institution, ignoring a history of their crimes and failures.An exaggerated fear of India’s conspiracies has been a stereotypical justification for supporting and strengthening the military forces since 1947, although according to all records outside of Pakistan, they have lost all four wars with our neighbouring country.Pakistan’s military has also frequently imposed martial laws and emergencies. They had also inevitably brutalized the people of the former East Pakistan during the war of 1971. They, along with the ISI and CIA as their key backer, are responsible for producing and training the Mujahideen against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, an act whose fallout in the form of Islamic extremism keeps haunting us Pakistan’s military has also turned out to be a trained syndicate which is the major stake holder in every immense business of the country ranging from commercial banks, housing societies, airlines to hospitals, schools and super stores, not to mention the greater percentage of GDP our poor country spends on defence every year. This haunting tale that has left Pakistan as a traumatic state, doesn’t merely end here. The vicious circle has reached to a point where they feel pride in calling usIf the Pakistani masses choose to shut their eyes from reality, we may soon see a time when our children will be forced to memorize that India was once a part of Pakistan!","Tue, 02 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/application/../wp-content/uploads/2011/08/7299-pakistanarmy-1312275894.jpg,"['history', 'lessons', 'pakistans', 'country', 'military', 'army', 'bloody', 'forces', 'turned', 'india', 'civilians', 'children', 'pakistan']",
