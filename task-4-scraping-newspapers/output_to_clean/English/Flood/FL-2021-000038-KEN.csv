Floodwaters around the giraffes’ home island in Lake Baringo were slowly rising for years, but in 2020, the rate of rising floodwaters increased, ""flooding lakeshore homes, businesses, and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschild’s giraffe on Longicharo Island, in Ruko Community Conservancy,"" according to a Save the Giraffes Now news release.

Video released by the Northern Rangelands Trust of the final rescue showed Ngarikoni and her calf, Noelle, being tranquilized in order to be ferried to safety without causing the animals further stress.

In the footage, Ngarikoni is seen strolling through the brush as conservationists shoot her with a tranquilizer. She then gallops around as they corralled her to a safe location. Nagarikoni is then seen with a cover over her head as the crew guides her to a barge.

An aerial view shows the giraffe being ferried across the lake to another landmass nearby where she is released and gallops off into the brush once again.

Shortly after Ngarikoni was released, her calf, Noelle, was also released and is seen galloping off the barge to rejoin her mother.

""We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue,"" said David O’Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now. ""With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.""

The urgency to relocate the nine giraffes was essential to preserving their species.

""Rothschild’s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya,"" according to the Save the Giraffes Now organization.

1,1,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Solution for Kenya's flooding ahead of rainy season – New Business Ethiopia - New Business Ethiopia,https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/solution-for-kenyas-flooding-ahead-of-rainy-season/,"The annual rainy season in March – June, in conjunction with climate change, is a major concern for Kenyans across the country. Dirty flood waters rendering the roads unusable, and submerging residential areas, are expected again this year, and experts warn that better waste management, urban planning and warning systems are needed to help protect citizens.



So says Simon Thomas, an international consultant and board member of Megapipes Solutions Limited which provides sustainable stormwater, sanitation and flood alleviation solutions throughout Kenya and East Africa. “The lack of adequate drainage and sanitation systems in Kenya has been well documented, however, not enough attention is being paid to how the sewerage systems have been designed and set up, or where excess water ends up,” he says. “Compounding the problem, there are multiple settlements that do not have adequate sewerage and sanitation services that edge onto Nairobi’s three main rivers, namely Mathare, Ngong and Nairobi.”







According to him, citizens who live in flood-prone regions are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. “And it’s always those living under the poverty line that are most vulnerable and need the most help and support in the event of such a disaster.”

He says in the past few years, many regions in Kenya have had above-normal rainfall, resulting in flooding across the country. “To lessen the potential impact of floods, the government has to map out and implement strategic plans to address flood disaster risk. These plans must pinpoint the projects and initiatives that are needed to manage and prevent floods.”

Currently, many densely populated formal and informal settlements in Kenya employ open drainage channels, which are used to discharge rainwater, to address the problem. However, Thomas says while drains can help prevent flooding, when they are left open, they can easily become clogged with solid and domestic waste, making the problem far worse.

“Moreover, multiple environmental hazards go hand in hand with open drainage channels, including groundwater contamination, a slew of easily preventable diseases, a lessening of soil productivity, and the contamination of vegetables and crops.”

Unfortunately, building exposed drainage systems has been around for decades and has become the norm. “Various regions in Kenya are prone to flooding, and at the same time, are notorious for blocked drainage systems. Also, town planners, do not seem to grasp the fact that open drains use land, which takes away space for pavements and walkways, forcing pedestrians, onto the streets and putting them in danger of being hit by motorists.”

The bottom line? Thomas says that if Kenya is to achieve its Millennium Development Goal for increasing access to water and sanitation this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.







Thomas says a wider implementation of properly engineered and sustainable drainage initiatives is required, which mitigate the effects of large amounts of rainfall coming down in urban areas. While other solutions exist, including putting in additional drainage ditches, these are unable to cope with significant rainfall or extreme weather.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. “At Megapipes, we understand there is an urgent requirement for better systems that would be able to cope with larger volumes of waste and stormwater, particularly in fast-growing urban environments. With this in mind, we conducted studies into new large diameter pipe technology, already widely used with big success in other parts of the world. Megapipes Solutions made the visionary decision to opt for Weholite HDPE structured wall pipes, manholes, chambers and tanks, which address Kenya’s need for sustainable water systems.”","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://newbusinessethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-cropped-logo-orange-sub-Title-1-e1578818531794-1-32x32.png,"['solutions', 'waste', 'season', 'kenya', 'rainy', 'kenyas', 'water', 'ahead', 'ethiopia', 'thomas', 'business', 'drainage', 'open', 'systems', 'solution', 'flooding', 'urban', 'sanitation']", 
2,2,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Last Two Giraffes Rescued From a Disappearing Island in Kenya - Smithsonian Magazine,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/last-two-giraffes-rescued-disappearing-island-kenya-180977512/,"On April 12, wildlife authorities and conservationists completed a tall task: ferrying the final two giraffes off of a sinking island in Lake Baringo, Kenya, George Dvorsky reports for Gizmodo.

For many years, Rothschild’s giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) have lived on a peninsula in the lake. The lake's water levels had been slowly rising over time, but in 2020, torrential rains caused severe flooding, covering a stretch of the giraffes’ peninsula and turning the end into a muddy, shrinking island. Nine giraffes became stranded with limited resources available for survival. Planning the complex rescue mission took 15 months to coordinate and implement.

Now, the last two individuals—a mother and a calf, named Ngarikoni and Noelle—stuck on a remote part of the land mass have been safely transported to the mainland.

When the giraffes reached the shore, they galloped out onto the 4,400-acre Ruko Wildlife Sanctuary, where conservation groups involved in the project hope to support a growing population of the endangered subspecies.

When the giraffes first became stranded on the island, Ruko wildlife rangers began delivering food for them, per Gizmodo. But they soon realized the need for a more sustainable long-term solution. The flood became severe last year, damaging businesses and homes along the shore of the lake, and one giraffe, named Asiwa, became separated from the rest of herd when flooding bisected the island once again.

Convincing a 14-foot-tall animal to get on a boat is no small feat, however. First, the team needed to develop a vessel fit for the task. The result, a barge that is kept afloat by 60 empty drums, decked-out with reinforced walls and pulled by a motorboat, was named the “GiRaft.”

To guide the animals to the raft, the team first had to sedate them, and then quickly apply a reversal drug. (When a giraffe is tranquilized and falls to the ground, it is in danger of choking on its own saliva, or being harmed by a change of blood pressure to its brain.) During the brief period when a giraffe is sedated, the team covers its face with a blindfold and sets up guide ropes around its shoulders. Then when the giraffe is able to walk, the team guides it to the raft.

When the rescue brought Asiwa to the raft, “she was incredible,” said O’Connor to CNN’s Ami Vitale in December. “She's a very, very tough girl. … Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.”

Rescue workers accompanied the GiRaft on its one-mile journey to shore by standing on the steel beams or boating alongside in kayaks and canoes.

As Mindy Weisberger reports for Live Science, the Rothschild’s giraffe has lost about 80 percent of its population in the last 30 years, making it one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies. Out of a population of less than 3,000 animals, 800 live in Kenya. Now that the once-stranded giraffes are on the mainland, the conservation groups hope to relocate other giraffes of the same subspecies to the wildlife sanctuary to support a healthy, genetically diverse population.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/0K5H2oQfiLDqN82h8MZZgRcd650=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/e8/f4/e8f4ec27-ed40-4565-9e9e-a66eba16d6e4/14_giraft.jpeg,"['kenya', 'team', 'named', 'population', 'lake', 'task', 'rescued', 'giraffes', 'island', 'disappearing', 'shore', 'giraffe', 'wildlife']",

By Helen Lock

When extreme weather is increasingly common, it can be life-saving to know what's coming.

It might seem simple, but having access to the weather forecast is something that's often taken for granted — even if the results are disappointing.

But lack of knowledge about the upcoming weather makes communities around the world vulnerable. Climate change means extreme conditions are becoming more common everywhere, so it is crucial to be able to prepare for rainfall, heatwaves, droughts, and more.

Without a weather forecast, everything from flood preparation to what clothes children should wear to school that day becomes difficult.

A UK aid project in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, is attempting to fill this gap. It used a new weather information system to help keep communities living in informal settlements better informed.

The project is called Daraja, meaning “bridge” in Swahili, because of the connection to the meteorological updates it provides. As well as providing this bridge, the project serves a wider goal of building climate resilience, because it means residents can take action to help protect themselves from the potential impacts of extreme weather.

“We get the weather forecast from the Kenya Meteorological Department and after we get it we translate it into a language that is commonly used here, [like] Sheng’ and Swahili,” explains James Kirika, a community leader working with Daraja project organisers in Kibera, a vast informal settlement on the outskirts of Nairobi.

Kikira and his fellow “weather community leaders” gather regularly to discuss the upcoming forecast and then distribute the information to the rest of the community. The group also had an input in designing easily identifiable symbols for the different types of weather too.

One way the information is sent is by SMS, a text messaging format, which is very useful for families with no television or computer, and for people on the go.

""The Kenya Meteorological Department advises that it is going to rain the whole week in the afternoon except for Monday,” reads one of the community weather advisers in a video created about the project, delivering a text message update.

“We are advising you to open the trenches, put on rain jackets, and not allow your kids to play along the rivers,"" she says.

Kikira is also shown in the video discussing the weather and the new project on local radio, helping it to reach an even wider audience. The Daraja project was developed by Resurgence, a weather and climate science systems design consultancy, in close partnership with two local enterprises: the Kounkuey Design Initiative (KDI) in Nairobi, and the Centre for Community Initiatives (CCI) in Dar es Salaam. The project ran from April 2018 to September 2020.

They now want to scale up the model and take it to other places. Having already reached over 1 million people living in these two cities, their ambitious plan means that in five years, the Daraja project aims to be serving 250 million people living in informal settlements in 30 cities across the globe, Resurgence says.

It’s a service that is badly needed, with the impacts of climate change already being felt around the world.

Changing weather conditions has already impacted agricultural production in Burundi, for example, making it the most food insecure country in the world, according to an analysis by Christian Aid.

Meanwhile, the Climate Action Network predicts that 63 million people in countries in South Asia will be displaced as a result of climate change by 2050.

The importance of adaptation has been highlighted by Alok Sharma, who is serving as COP26 president this year — as the UK prepares to host the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference (COP26) in November.

On a visit to the Daraja project in Nairobi in March, Sharma told Reuters: “Globally as extreme weather events become more frequent and more severe we need to build resilience among the most vulnerable communities.”

He praised the project as an “innovative” example of that work and said that he wanted the UK’s COP Presidency to put “adaptation and resilience front and centre.”

Daraja was largely financed by the UK aid budget, managed by the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office. This aid budget now faces a 30% cut, worth £4.5 billion this year, with some programmes already being told to cut back by 70% to accommodate the reductions.

The FCDO has said it will still spend £11.6 billion on climate finance for developing countries over a period of five years.

But climate campaign groups such as Greenpeace UK and WaterAid have raised concerns that it will be harder for poorer countries to adapt with these aid-backed interventions at risk.

The UK Met Office’s Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme managed the funding of the Daraja service.

A report on the project for WISER explains why the Daraja has had such an impact. It describes the two cities as being “complex” and “fragmented” and argues that as urban areas continue to grow rapidly, weather information services need to expand too.

Bringing in local organisations and leaders to help design the services right from the start helped in their success, the report explains. The process meant there was a feedback loop between the community and the service, creating “a more tailored and actionable forecast.”

A survey of 700 households in the two areas participating has revealed that, as a result of Daraja, communities living in the informal settlements of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam have been able to take better preventative action ahead of high impact weather events.

""This has resulted in both avoided loss and improved livelihoods for the communities,” it says.

Jane Brown, a teacher who works at the Keko Mwanga Primary School, in Dar es Salaam, said that being able to share updates with her pupils during the country’s rainy season in April and May 2019 was especially useful to them. She was part of a Whatsapp group created by the Daraja project, giving her access to the updates.

“Students informed their parents, especially those who live at the valley, who used the information to protect their belongings, including school books for children, which were usually destroyed by floods. This time, the case was different as precautions were taken much earlier,” she explained.

As well as the practical benefits, those involved in the project noted a shift in attitudes too. Kirika says that before Daraja, people in his community didn’t always take weather information seriously because they couldn't access regular forecasts.

Speaking to a local radio host, Kirika said that he himself used to see weather bulletins as “false information”, but now sees their importance.

Emmah Mwangi, a climate scientist at the Kenya Red Cross, added: “Seeing Daraja make that first step of providing climate information to communities and asking them to act on that information has really changed the perspective and the effect of disasters.”","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,"['weather', 'kenya', 'project', 'community', 'communities', 'used', 'uk', 'forecasts', 'change', 'tanzania', 'lives', 'information', 'changing', 'climate', 'daraja']",

Water levels in Lake Baringo in Kenya have been rising for some time, but in 2020, the rate increased — flooding lakeshore homes, businesses and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschild’s giraffe on Longicharo Island in Ruko Community Conservancy.

Conservationists have worked around the clock for more than a year to save them. Now, the last two, a mother and calf, are the final pair to be rescued from the island.

The rescuers constructed a special steel barge — “The GiRaft” — in order to carry the giraffes to safety a mile away. Now, with the transfer of the calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni, all the animals are safe.

The giraffes have been moved to a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland.

David O’Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, which works on over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries, said: “We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue.

“With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.”

Park rangers had to lure the animals onto the barge using food they were fed on the island, including pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos.

Each time a giraffe joined the barge, it was sealed, and they were driven to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

The towermates (as groups of giraffe are called) are together again and safely exploring the Ruko Conservancy, where they have plenty of food and securty.

Approval to move the giraffes was needed from Kenya Wildlife Service. The first giraffe, named Asiwa, was moved in December without incident.

Rothschild’s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

The situation could last until end of the year, based on the current weather forecast. The drought is a result of the La Nina dry weather.

Kenya Red Cross Society predicts the situation could stabilise from October only if the short rains season will bring adequate rainfall.

On Friday, Red Cross appealed for Sh800 million to reach both drought-hit Kenyans and another 30,000 people facing floods in Western Kenya.

“We are dealing with two natural disasters that essentially should be mutually exclusive—drought in one region and flooding in the other,” Red Cross secretary-general Asha Mohammed said.

According to the Met Department, the current heavy rains in Western Kenya will not reach most parts of northeastern Kenya.

In an interview with the Star, Asha said the current drought condition is worse than last year.

“It's, unfortunately, worse because it has been compounded by Covid-19. When people in towns have lost jobs, they cannot remit money to relatives upcountry. So it’s not just people being unable to grow food, but also the purchasing power of people has been reduced yet the food prices have increased,” she said.

She explained why a bumper harvest in the Western region often does not alleviate the food shortage in Northern Kenya.

Asha said while food distribution is one problem, different parts of Kenya consume varying types of food.

“For example, maize and beans is not acceptable in some communities,” she noted.

In the appeal, Red Cross said Sh483 million will go to flood victims while Sh315 million will buy food for drought victims.

She said the projections show that between 15,000 and 30,000 families around Lake Victoria will be displaced by the ongoing heavy rains and will need shelter, food, clean water and basic healthcare.

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, while Western, Rift Valley, Coast and Central Kenya will have enhanced rainfall this season, rainfall in Northern Kenya will be depressed.

Red Cross says this time everyone is affected by the drought, as opposed to just women and children in the past.

“Again, I would blame Covid because a lot of the men today have lost jobs. They have gone back to the rural area and they all just live there with their families. So we are targeting entire families.”

She also emphasised early warning systems as being more effective than waiting for emergency responses.

These include advising people to move to higher grounds in flood-prone areas and also digging boreholes in drought-hit regions.

The society is coordinating with Somalia and Ethiopia, which are also facing a prolonged drought.

“We are talking together as counterparts from Somalia and Ethiopia. We are talking with our [global] secretary to also to see how we can support the Somali Red Crescent and people in Somalia because even in 2011, very many people came from Somalia because of the drought and crossed over into Kenya,” she said.

The society’s secretary General Asha Mohammed said while some parts of Kenya are being washed by floods, in arid areas thousands of people still have nothing to eat.

“What this means is that we are dealing with two natural disasters that essentially should be mutually exclusive—drought in one region and flooding in the other,” she told journalists in Nairobi on Friday.

The Kenya Meteorological Department says while western, Rift Valley, Coast and central Kenya will have enhanced rains this season, northern Kenya will have depressed rains.

Dr Mohammed said from the appeal, Sh483 million will go to flood victims while Sh315 million will buy food for drought victims.

The emergency situation is likely to continue until September, or end of the year depending on response.

She said the Sh800 million was based on projections made jointly by Red Cross, relief agencies and county governments in affected areas.

Dr Mohammed said the projections show between 15,000 to 30,000 families around Lake Victoria will be displaced by the ongoing heavy rains and will need shelter, food, clean water and basic health.

She said they are targeting 37,000 drought-hit people in Marsabit and 35,000 in Tana River with relief food.

“We are also expecting to reach 85,000 people in Mandera, Wajir and Turkana in the next phase of distribution,” she said.

The society will also transfer cash assistance of Sh5,400 per month for three months to each of 15,000 families in Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, Wajir, Isiolo, Samburu and Garissa counties.

“Evidence has shown that cash assistance programmes can play a critical role in meeting immediate needs and enhancing economic recovery while promoting dignity,” she said.

Mohammed said theirs is a direct response to the appeal made by the National Government through Spokesman Cyrus Oguna on April 1.

Oguna said said 1.4 million Kenyans are threatened by drought and the situation may worsen.

“With the performance of the 2021 long-rains season forecasted to be poor, the situation is likely to dip a little, and the number of those in need of humanitarian support likely to increase towards August 2021,” he said.

Oguna said county governments, in collaboration with the national government, are distributing water to households in Turkana, Mandera, Garissa and Wajir counties.

“Other interventions include the provision of relief food in Turkana county by the county government, cash transfer under the Hunger Safety Net Program, which is currently in Phase 3. Every household receives Sh2,700 every two months, and targets over 101,800 households in the counties of Turkana, Mandera and Marsabit,” he said, adding that the government spends about Sh2 billion on the programme every year.

The meteorological department has warned of heavy rain in the coming days

The flood alert comes as families that had been displaced by rising waters in Kihoto estate return to their homes after the levels went down.

The warning was issued by Kenya Red Cross and Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association.

They warned that indications show the projected rains could cause floods.

“This is to request you to move to higher grounds once the water levels start rising,” Red Cross said in a message put out in Kiswahili.

LANAWRUA chairman Enock Kiminta said the lake’s levels had dropped from 1891.56m above sea level last year to 1891.10m.

“When the water levels dropped some families whose houses had been flooded decided to return and we are worried by the move,” he said on Wednesday.

Kiminta said going by the weatherman’s projections, the rains could be heavier and could cause more displacement than last year.

“We have seen water levels in the lake drop sharply in the last three months but this should not be a reason for those displaced to return to their houses,” he said.

Kiminta said the fuel pipeline in Kihoto had been flooded raising fears among residents and environmentalists.

“Water from this lake is very corrosive and we fear that it might have effects on the metallic underground pipes that ferry millions of litres of fuel every day,” he said.

However, a senior officer from Kenya Pipeline Company downplayed any leaking fears, saying the pipeline had been built to withstand weather changes.

“It’s true the fuel pipeline is currently under water but studies indicate that it has a lifespan of over 20 years before the water can have any effects on the materials,” said the officer who declined to be named.

Residents living along the river have also been urged to move to higher and safer grounds to avoid loss of lives.

The Meteorological Department has warned that the area will experience heavy rains in the coming days and this is likely to cause heavy flooding and disrupt water intake on the river.

Water CEC Abdi Omar said significant mud and debris expected to flow into Tana River would increase turbidity levels, reducing the quantity of water produced at the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company treatment plant. Turbidity is a measure of water clarity in streams, rivers, lakes, and the ocean.

He said when the turbidity of raw water is higher than 5,000 Nephelometric turbidity units it can cause operational problems for water treatment.

“There will be potential spillovers from hydroelectric power generating dams upstream that would consequently raise water levels. This will further increase the sediments and silts in the river, posing a huge challenge in water works,” he said.

“It would therefore be advisable for residents to store water and use it sparingly during this rainy season.”

Omar said his department has created a proactive and essential emergency response to cater for water shortages in the affected areas.

The CEC said the relevant departments, among them Gawasco, are closely monitoring water levels at the river.

On Friday last week, the Kenya Red Cross issued a similar call to residents living along the river, asking them to move to higher and safer grounds before the water levels rise.

Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Kenya Red Cross regional head Mohamed Abdikadir said all signs were pointing to the possibility of the water rising above normal levels.

He said the floods are likely to have devastating effects, especially on communities residing along the river.

“Our plea is that the communities residing along the river start moving out in earnest. They don’t have to wait for the water to submerge them because by then it will be too late. Chances of losing lives will also be high,” Abdikadir said.

On April 12th, 2021, the last of the affected giraffes was evacuated from the island, a vulture named Noelle, born on the island during the Christmas season of 2020. Rescuers waited until the calf was strong enough to make the journey on a custom-built barge to the newly built giraffe sanctuary on the north shore of Lake Baringo. This is the end of a rescue mission for 9 Rothschild’s giraffes, launched 15 months ago by Save Giraffes Now, the Ruko Community Conservancy, the Northern Rangelands Trust and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).

“This mission is a significant success for two reasons. Not only did it save these giraffes, but it also marks their reintroduction to the continent for the first time in 70 years,” says O’Connor, chairman of Save Giraffes Now. This subspecies of giraffe was reintroduced to Longicharo Island in 2011. At the time, no scientist predicted that this natural habitat would one day become an island in decline. The gradual rise in the water level of Lake Baringo has flooded Longicharo Island, depriving the giraffes of food.

Rothschild’s giraffes, an endangered species

The urgency to save the 9 affected giraffes on Longicharo Island is based on the fact that they are an endangered subspecies. Kenya is home to about 800 of the approximately 3,000 Rothschild’s giraffes that roam the African savannah. Despite their small numbers, these mammals face a multitude of threats, including habitat loss and poaching.

After the rescue of the 9 giraffes on Longicharo Island, the long-term goal of the NGOs behind the mission is to introduce more Rothschild’s giraffes into the new Ruko sanctuary. According to Save Giraffes Now, these introductions will help build a genetically healthy population of giraffes that can eventually be released into a larger ecosystem outside the sanctuary.

Malnutrition, COVID-19, and food affordability are emerging as growing worries as Timor-Leste digs out from its worst flooding in decades.

Days of heavy rain triggered severe floods and landslides that swept through parts of the Pacific nation in early April. As relief operations ramp up, aid agencies say cases of diarrhoea are appearing in evacuation centres.

“There is an immediate need to establish a referral system for severe [and] critical cases of malnutrition,” UN agencies said in a 16 April report.

It took nearly a week for significant donor funding to kick in after the country’s most severe floods in 40 years. Heavy rains, worsened by a tropical cyclone that also damaged parts of eastern Indonesia and Western Australia, caused a sudden deluge concentrated in the capital, Dili. At least 45 people died.

The government says some 25,000 households are affected, which would add up to about 10 percent of the country’s population. Some 8,800 people were still in evacuation centres as of 15 April.

“The people who are still staying at the IDP camps right now, they lost pretty much everything,” said Berta Antonieta Tilman Pereira, a community organiser who helped launch an early response to the floods. “They didn’t even have food to eat. They didn’t have clothes to wear.”

The disaster overlaps with a surge in coronavirus infections. The government relaxed COVID-19 restrictions after the floods; since the end of March, cases have doubled to more than 1,100.

Food prices are also rising, raising fears that a population already hit by widespread job losses and hunger during the pandemic will face more hardship in the coming months. The UN said the price of rice has jumped by 7 percent in the last two weeks after the floods damaged rice fields and maize crops, and by more than 20 percent in a year.

“It’s a concern about what happens next,” said Peter Goodfellow, country director for the NGO CARE International in Timor-Leste. “We are concerned about what happens if there were to be another even minor emergency, be it a cholera outbreak or dengue. The resilience isn’t there. It could quite quickly become a very significant problem.”

Volunteer response, donor delays

Local volunteer groups were the first to respond as thousands of people headed to evacuation sites in churches or public buildings.

Antonieta was part of a group that set up an online campaign that raised more than $50,000. The funds helped run community kitchens serving hot meals to evacuees. The volunteers also distributed kitchen and hygiene kits.

“We need to be organised,” Antonieta said. “The system that we’re actually supposed to trust and rely on in case of emergency is totally slow and not responding, so the community themselves needs to be organised.”

The government declared a state of calamity and asked for international help on 8 April – at least four days after the disaster escalated. It called its first coordination meeting with humanitarian groups on 9 April, according to UN situation reports.

International funding has also lagged. Australia’s 11 April aid pledge of about $5.4 million came a week after the disaster.

The government didn’t clarify what it needed early on, which meant donors “were not able to be clear about what their response was”, Goodfellow said, though he added that many government employees and facilities were also hit by the floods.

Donors have now promised about $7.5 million in humanitarian funding, according to the UN. “Given the scale of damage, it is feeling underfunded,” Goodfellow said.

Climate change

Fundasaun Mahein, a Dili-based civil society group, said the “slow governmental response” is part of longer-term problems that have grown, especially through the pandemic: The disaster “exposes further the state’s lack of capacity to respond to emergencies and meet our people’s basic needs”, the group said.

Analysts also say poor urban planning in Dili exacerbated the floods’ impacts. Timor-Leste sees frequent drought and floods, including a disaster that washed away some 200 homes last year. But this month’s floods have been particularly severe.

Timor-Leste’s government has budgeted about $1.4 million over three months to respond.

“People are suffering, families are suffering; they are homeless, without water, without electricity, and everything is flooded with mud,” said the country’s prime minister, José Maria de Vasconcelos, who is also known as Taur Matan Ruak.

As relief operations continue, aid groups warn that Timor-Leste needs to better prepare for weather extremes amid a global climate emergency.

“Climate change is clearly exacerbating the intensity and impact of these disasters,” the NGO Oxfam said in a statement.

“I wish they were more prepared,” Antonieta said. “The decision-makers, the government, need to be prepared for any crisis that’s coming.”

The year 2020 rivalled 2016 as the world’s hottest recorded year despite the absence of a strong El Niño effect. Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, the year was dominated by climate-related disasters. These were largely responsible for the 389 recorded events which resulted in 15,080 deaths, 98.4 million people affected, and economic losses of at least US$ 171.3 billion. The statistics used in this report are drawn from the latest updates in the emergency events database, EM-DAT, maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED, UClouvain).

At the outset, it is acknowledged that these statistics pale in comparison with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which by the year’s end had claimed almost two million lives, resulted in more than 90 million confirmed cases, trillions of dollars in economic losses, and “extreme poverty back up to levels not seen in a generation” as the UN Secretary-General has said.

In comparison to the previous two decades (2000-2019), 2020 was higher than the annual average in terms of number of recorded events and the annual average of economic losses, which is US$ 151.6 billion. There were considerably fewer deaths compared to the annual average of 61,709 and fewer people directly affected compared to the annual average of 201.3 million people. This decrease in impacts is due to the absence of mass casualty events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (227,000 deaths) and the 2010 Haiti Earthquake (222,500 deaths) or high impact events, such as the 2015/2016 drought in India (330 million people affected). However, in 2020 there were 26% more storms than the annual average of 102 events, 23% more floods than the annual average of 163 events, and 18% more flood deaths than the annual average of 5,233 deaths.

This snapshot of the year in climate and geophysical disaster events does not consider the overlap with the impacts of the on-going pandemic. The additional losses inflicted by these reported events likely impacted those who have already suffered loss of income and employment because of COVID-19, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries. Unravelling the impacts of one from the other is a challenge and may have contributed to under-reporting of the impacts of non-biological hazards during the year under review. There is an existing problem of chronic under-reporting of economic losses from disasters, particularly from low-income countries.

The impacts of the events were not equally shared: Asia experienced 41% of disaster events and 64% of total people affected. Heatwaves in Europe accounted for 42% of total reported deaths. In a year of record-breaking storms and wildfires the Americas suffered 53% of total economic losses, largely in the USA which experienced the bulk of the year’s most costly climate-related disasters. Indonesia had the highest number of disasters (29 total events), including 25 floods. However, India and China suffered the largest human impacts with 19.6 million people and 14.9 million people affected, respectively. Floods were the most common disasters worldwide (201 events), while storms affected the highest number of people (45.5 million) and caused the most economic losses (US$ 92.7 billion). Extreme temperatures were the deadliest type of disasters accounting for 42% of total deaths, followed closely by floods which accounted for 41% of total deaths.

Summer heat waves in Europe were the deadliest events for the 2nd year in a row. Heat waves in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK caused a total of 6,340 deaths, more than double the figures for heatwaves in 2019. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2020 was the hottest year for the Northern Hemisphere on record, however, underreporting on the impact of heat waves in many countries likely leads to gross underestimations in global death tolls.

The impact of floods was felt heavily throughout Africa and Asia. In Africa, floods affected seven million people and caused 1,273 deaths, the highest figure since 2006. Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan suffered seasonal flooding that affected approximately one million people in each country, while Kenya had the highest loss of life in Africa with 285 flood deaths. In South Asia, monsoon flooding, often associated with landslides, affected 5.4 million people in Bangladesh and caused 448 deaths in Nepal. In India, flooding was responsible for the 3rd deadliest event of the year costing 1,922 lives. China also faced significant flooding as a series of four summer floods across the country killed a total of 397 people, affected 14.3 million people, and caused US$ 21.8 billion in economic losses.

With 30 named storms, the 2020 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season broke the record for the highest number of named storms. Hurricane Eta was the most impactful of these storms, killing 394 people and affecting 7.1 million people in 10 countries stretching from Colombia to the USA. Honduras and Guatemala suffered the worst impacts with 4.6 million people and 2.4 million people affected, respectively. Despite the record in the Atlantic, Asia accounted for the highest number of people affected by storms in 2020. In May, Cyclone Amphan struck South Asia affecting a total of 18 million people in India and 2.6 million people in Bangladesh. In the latter part of the year, a series of storms in South-East Asia caused widespread damage. In Vietnam, six successive storms, combined with flooding and landslides over three months, killed a total of 294 people and affected 2.2 million people, and in the Philippines, five storms over the same period killed a total of 185 people and affected 9.2 million people. The quick succession of these storms in the same areas provided little respite for those affected.

Droughts were most heavily experienced across the Sahel, affecting a total of 13.4 million people in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Wildfires across the west coast of the USA marked the 3rd year in the past four years with US$ 10 billion-plus in economic losses due to wildfires. Finally, although it was a relatively quiet year for geophysical events, an earthquake that killed 115 people in Turkey served as a reminder of the severe threat of earthquakes, the deadliest type of disaster over the previous 20 years.

Overall, the most notable features of the year were significant flood events across East Africa, South Asia, and China; a record year in the number of storms in the Americas; a series of storms in quick succession to strike South-East Asia; and summer heat waves across Europe which accounted for the deadliest disaster events for the 2nd year in a row.

16,16,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Landslides Mar the “Pearl of Africa” - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/landslides-mar-the-pearl-of-africa,"Behind Uganda’s lavish beauty, climate change has taken its toll: Death, destroyed properties, and displaced communities increase as above-normal rainfall floods the country.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

19,19,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Global warming's extreme rains threaten Hawaii's coral reefs - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/global-warming-s-extreme-rains-threaten-hawaii-s-coral-reefs-1.5388981,"HONOLULU -- As muddy rainwater surged from Hawaii's steep seaside mountains and inundated residential communities last month, the damage caused by flooding was obvious - houses were destroyed and businesses swamped, landslides covered highways and raging rivers and streams were clogged with debris.

But extreme rain events predicted to become more common with human-caused global warming not only wreak havoc on land - the runoff from these increasingly severe storms also threatens Hawaii's coral reefs.

“These big events are the ones that have the greatest damage because they are the ones that put the most sediment and nutrients out onto the reef,” said C. Mark Eakin, senior coral advisor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the former director of the agency's Coral Reef Watch program.

A warmer climate tends to amplify existing weather patterns, said Hawaii's state climatologist, Pao-Shin Chu, noting the islands have an overall wet climate and that powerful storms are expected to become more frequent.

“Given this climate change or global warming, as we have seen over the last hundred years, the atmospheric water vapour pressure is increasing,” said Chu. “We have some evidence showing that we already have some increasing, very intense rain.”

Coral reefs make up much of Hawaii's nearshore ocean ecosystem and are critical to the state's economy.

Hawaii's reefs protect populated shorelines from massive ocean swells and storm surges from tropical storms - a benefit the U.S. Geological Survey valued at more than $860 million a year.

Adding tourism, fishing, cultural value and other factors, the state's reefs are worth more than $33 billion, according to a NOAA-funded study.

March's flooding was caused by a weather system that stalled over the islands and brought two weeks of rain, much extremely heavy.

On Oahu's North Shore, “a very large flood wave” rushed down from the mountains and flooded the town of Haleiwa, said National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Kodama.

“That's a big challenge in Hawaii, where we have small, steep watersheds,” Kodama said. “Most of the basins in the state will produce flash flooding.”

Last month had 11 flash flood events and was the wettest March in 15 years, he said.

The runoff problem is multifaceted. Deforestation and grading on construction sites and farms lead to increased runoff. Feral animals such as goats, pigs and deer clear vegetation, causing erosion and excessive sedimentation on reefs. And constant, low-level runoff carries gasoline and oil from roadways, household chemicals, trash and pesticides into the ocean.

Any significant change in ocean conditions, such as an influx of fresh water alone, can harm coral health. Contaminants and soil from land accumulate on reefs and can smother and kill the coral. Scientists say suspension of material in the water can also block sunlight coral needs to survive.

One of the biggest problems for Hawaii reefs is sewage. There are about 88,000 cesspools throughout the islands, many in coastal areas.

“Cesspools are essentially a hole in the ground where there is no treatment prior to wastewater entering the environment,” said Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer with NOAA who lives on Oahu's North Shore.

Cesspools leak into groundwater - and with heavy rains, they overflow and send pathogens and other harmful contaminants into the ocean.

In the town of Pupukea, where professional surfers compete at the famed Banzai Pipeline reef break, more than 330 million gallons (1.25 billion litres) of wastewater enters the ocean each year - enough to fill hundreds of Olympic size swimming pools.

On the North Shore during the recent flood, “brown, polluted water just blanketed the entire town,” Gove said. “You could just smell it everywhere.”

More than half the state's cesspools are on the Big Island, home to some of the state's most expansive and pristine coral reefs. And Gove said some areas have shown a clear decrease in coral cover where sewage routinely enters the ocean.

A reef off the town of Puako - an extensively monitored location - has seen significant losses, he said. Coral cover there has declined by about 70% since 1975.

“This is probably one of the more dramatic examples since coral cover is not this high in a lot of places,” he said. “But since we don't have this type of data everywhere, we can't say for sure this isn't a more common story.”

NOAA is providing data on the issue to the state, and efforts to remove cesspools and change infrastructure to slow and distribute floodwater could help Hawaii's reefs.

The state has banned cesspools in new construction and is attempting to remove the existing ones by 2050.

Although coral reefs worldwide face threats from global warming, including marine heatwaves that bleach and kill coral, storm runoff could prove a more serious and immediate threat to reefs in Hawaii.

“In Hawaii, I would rate runoff much higher than marine heatwaves in driving coral decline,” said Greg Asner, director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University.

In 2019, Asner and his team used imaging technology on aircraft coupled with satellite data to create new detailed maps of all living coral in the Hawaiian Islands. The data, now being used by federal and state scientists, shows a correlation between land-based pollutants from runoff and coral health.

“More runoff impacts reefs, mostly by mobilizing more chemicals and sediment on land,” Asner said. “Increased chemical pollution and sedimentation is a major driver of coral decline.”

March's floods were not the first of their kind.

A 2018 rainstorm on Kauai caused widespread flooding that cut off a community for weeks. The storm set a new U.S. record for rainfall in a single day with nearly 50 inches (127 centimetres).

Ku'ulei Rodgers, a coral reef ecologist at the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine Biology, studied that 2018 flood as well as a 2002 flood in the same area. The 2002 rains swept earth from a construction site into the sea and “killed almost an entire reef,” Rodgers said.

After the 2018 flood, a review found fish abundance on a nearby reef had been reduced by 20% and urchins, which help clean reefs and keep coral healthy, were reduced by 40%.

When making policy decisions about how to safeguard reefs, Rodgers said, it's important to understand that land and oceans are intertwined.

“(Native) Hawaiians knew there was a connection between the two because whatever they did upland would affect their fishing downstream,” she said. “The better the watershed, the better the reef and vice versa.”","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5389009.1618510967!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['flood', 'water', 'warmings', 'global', 'runoff', 'threaten', 'extreme', 'reef', 'reefs', 'state', 'rains', 'coral', 'states', 'town', 'hawaiis']",

However, deployment of this multibeneficial adaptation option is fundamentally constrained by how much water is available for recharge (WAFR) at present and under future climate change. Here, we develop a climate-informed and policy-relevant framework to quantify WAFR, its uncertainty, and associated policy actions. Despite robust and widespread increases in future projected WAFR in our case study of California (for 56/80% of subbasins in 2070–2099 under RCP4.5/RCP8.5), strong nonlinear interactions between diversion infrastructure and policy uncertainties constrain how much WAFR can be captured. To tap future elevated recharge potential through infrastructure expansion under deep uncertainties, we outline a novel robustness-based policy typology to identify priority areas of investment needs. Our WAFR analysis can inform effective investment decisions to adapt to future climate-fueled drought and flood risk over depleted aquifers, in California and beyond.

Our study provides the first thorough analysis to quantify the potential of floodwater (defined as high-magnitude-flows) for groundwater recharge over California and its changes in response to a warming climate. We find that future maximum WAFR potential in California will increase overall, but to what extent this maximum potential can be captured is largely constrained by the physical diversion capacity, further complicated by large climate and policy uncertainties. Moreover, a warming climate will likely exacerbate existing regional differences in water availability by elevating WAFR in Northern California and decreasing it in Southern California. Elevated regional differences in WAFR are likely to place increased burdens on California’s already taxed water infrastructure systems. Our generalizable screening approach (i.e., climate-informed hydrological modeling and policy typology) can inform management options and help prioritize the development or enhancement of diversion infrastructure in the face of large uncertainties. While this paper demonstrates its application in California, this framework can be readily transferred to other jurisdictions to support the integrated management of droughts, floods, and depleted groundwater aquifers.

Here, we develop a scalable and climate-informed framework to estimate WAFR with explicit uncertainty quantification, using hybrid physical-statistical model chains (see Materials and Methods and the Supplementary Materials for details). Recognizing the large uncertainties surrounding WAFR estimates and the potential limitations of existing conveyance structures to deliver floodwater to recharge facilities, we also introduce a novel robustness-based policy typology informed by WAFR characteristics to identify the physical feasibility of expanding conveyance infrastructure. To demonstrate the value of this framework for future infrastructure prioritization, we apply it in California, home to some of the world’s most productive agricultural regions benefiting from its complex, yet stressed, water infrastructure systems. Despite the infrastructure that transports relatively abundant surface water from Northern California to the agriculturally intensive San Joaquin Valley (SJV), many groundwater basins throughout the state are in a chronic state of overdraft. In 2014, the California legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which requires local public agencies to balance groundwater budgets by 2040 or 2042, depending on basin conditions. Passage of SGMA has prompted local groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) to actively explore opportunities to capture and recharge floodwater to augment water supply and thereby mitigate the groundwater pumping reductions that might otherwise be necessary to comply with SGMA.

While Flood-MAR presents a host of potential benefits, there are trade-offs between conflicting objectives (e.g., irrigation and ecological flows) that need to be balanced when planning Flood-MAR programs. Decisions about how much floodwater can or should be directed toward Flood-MAR will need to be made within a larger community dialogue about management goals. Thus, in any particular water-resources context, it is critical to understand how the water available for recharge (WAFR) is likely to vary depending on different policy and infrastructure assumptions and the extent to which these assumptions are subject to climate and other hydrologic uncertainties. Given implications for political and capital investment decisions around Flood-MAR policy and infrastructure, the analytic ability to rapidly and flexibly make such assessments is a crucial first step toward scaling up and normalizing recharge practices. However, how climate change will affect WAFR remains elusive and how much WAFR can be captured remains poorly characterized.

The dual threats of heightened drought and flood risk require transformational changes to existing water management practices to simultaneously manage droughts, floods, and depleted groundwater aquifers. In contrast to strategies that mitigate each hazard in isolation, integrated management can mitigate flood risk while conserving floodwater in wet periods to draw upon during future drought episodes. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is one innovative way to achieve such integrated water management ( 13 ). Its practical implementation involves improving the connections of surface-built infrastructure (e.g., reservoirs and conveyances) and underground infrastructure (e.g., groundwater aquifers and wells) to transfer floodwater across regions and store floodwater across seasons/years. Compared to conventional surface storage options, using floodwater for MAR (Flood-MAR) can be more cost-effective ( 14 ), sustainable, and adaptive to keep pace with a changing climate. In addition to augmenting groundwater supply, Flood-MAR can provide other benefits, such as flood risk reduction and ecosystem services enhancement ( 13 , 15 , 16 ). To date, Flood-MAR is a relatively untapped management strategy compared to traditional surface water infrastructure, even though growing evidence has demonstrated the large potential for underground water storage ( 17 , 18 ).

As natural reservoirs, groundwater aquifers store ~90% of our planet’s nonfrozen freshwater ( 10 ). This vast subsurface storage provides a crucial buffer against surface water variability (both seasonal and interannual) to ensure reliable water supplies, especially during drought periods. However, more intense and frequent droughts increase demands on regional groundwater aquifers, many of which are already in a state of chronic overdraft ( 11 ). At the same time, increases in heavy rain and earlier snowmelt exacerbate the risk of flooding ( 7 , 12 ), threatening existing surface water infrastructure and further jeopardizing water supply reliability.

Climate uncertainties play a dominant role in infrastructure investment for subbasins assigned the medium high priority (type 2). Over these regions (such as Upper Merced, fig. S7C), capacity expansion beyond the initial range (C R ) is primarily sensitive to projected climate conditions but negligibly sensitive to policies (e.g., high-magnitude-flow-threshold). As large climate uncertainties are both epistemic and aleatory ( 27 ), they are usually not easily reducible in the near term. For subbasins with medium investment priority (type 3), capacity expansion decisions are primarily sensitive to uncertain policies, not to future projected climate conditions (e.g., Big-Navarro-Garcia; fig. S7D). As policy uncertainties are potentially reducible in the near term, the value of resolving those uncertainties can be high, suggesting that decision-makers could at least “wait-and-see,” or better yet, work to accelerate resolution of those uncertainties via information gathering efforts or engagement on the relevant policy fronts. More than one-third (53/135) of subbasins in California have medium-low priority (type 4, such as Upper King, fig. S7E) for infrastructure provision due to both high policy and climate uncertainties. Investment decisions need to be carefully assessed at the beginning of the decision-making process before construction actions take place and need to be regularly adjusted at a later stage.

High investment priorities for capacity expansion are identified for nine subbasins in California. These regions have high C R , and the likely ranges of further expansion beyond C R due to uncertain policy (C P ) and climate (C C ) are both low (belong to type 1, see example in fig. S7B). Capacity expansion is therefore worth including in the management portfolio with an initial investment and is better paired with long-term contingent plans. Traditional cost-benefit analysis combined with multiobjective, multistage sequential optimization techniques could be implemented to determine the size, sequence, and location of these proposed diversion infrastructure but needs to factor in the nonmonetary costs of infrastructure (e.g., environmental impacts).

We find that most of subbasins (67 of 135) in California have limited near-term opportunities to invest in diversion infrastructure, due to the low potential of initial robust expansion (C R ) ( Fig. 3B ). These subbasins land on the low-priority space within the typology (type 5). They are mostly located in the Southeast part of California, where WAFR is limited by the dry climate (e.g., Mojave subbasin, fig. S7A). Note that there could be some watersheds within this type where near-term resolution of policy uncertainty could still yield some expansion potential, but this can be assessed in a more focused regional planning effort. We envisage that nonphysical interventions (e.g., demand management and market-based policy instruments such as water trading and banking) and alternative water sources beyond surface floodwater (e.g., treated wastewater in urban areas, reclaimed water produced from oil extraction, and desalinated brackish groundwater) could be considered over these areas to facilitate groundwater recharge.

( A ) Schematic illustration of the conceptual framework for developing policy typologies informed by three WAFR-derived metrics C R , C P , and C C (see Materials and Methods for details). C R represents the robust potential of expanding diversion infrastructure before running into the uncertainty band. C P shows how different high-magnitude-flow threshold policies could influence the marginal increase in captured WAFR (δWAFR cap , y axis). Here, C P is used as a proxy measure of policy uncertainty which is reducible in near term. C C is similar to C P , but it shows how different climate models and different emission scenarios could influence δWAFR cap . Detailed description of types 1 to 5 can be found in Table 1 . ( B ) Priority of future (2070–2099) investments in diversion infrastructure based on the policy typology in (A) and Table 1 . Example subbasins are highlighted.

To inform adaptation strategies on the appropriate levels of infrastructure investment, we outline a screening-level policy typology informed by key WAFR-related metrics ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ; see Materials and Methods and figs. S6 to S7 for details). We first consider the initial potential of robust expansion of diversion capacity (C R ) regardless of how uncertainties in WAFR cap will evolve in future. Here, C R is the minimum diversion capacity one region may consider expanding to, while remaining confident that the gains of expanding diversion capacity (i.e., marginal increase in WAFR cap , δWAFR cap ) will exceed a threshold level of benefit [a generalized conception of diversion capacity marginal cost (MC), horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 3A ]. C R is a conservative measure of WAFR potential and therefore can be used for the immediate recommendation; in other words, how much infrastructure investment can be considered regardless of the realization of future uncertainties. Our framework also explicitly incorporates uncertainty quantification beyond C R , acknowledging the important role of WAFR cap uncertainties in investment strategies. We partition total uncertainties into two general categories, climate and policy (i.e., nonclimatic factors such as the choice of high-magnitude-flow threshold) uncertainties, which are proxies for the broader concepts of whether the uncertainty is resolvable in the near term (e.g., policy questions that are yet to be settled) or not [as is the case for climate, ( 27 )]. We further estimate the expected average increase in robust expansion (C P ) if policy uncertainty is reduced (still conditional on climate uncertainty), as well as the range of further expansion (C C ) subject to learning about currently irreducible long-term climate uncertainties. To provide an initial guide to high-level prioritization, we then cluster all subbasins in California into five typologies mapped to different investment priorities informed by these three key metrics ( Fig. 3A ).

To determine policy implications for infrastructure investment, we further partition uncertainties in WAFR cap to different sources. We find that dominant uncertainties are from climate models (fig. S5A), followed by greenhouse gas emission scenarios (fig. S5B). Together, model and scenario uncertainties account for more than half of the total variation in WAFR cap over the majority of subbasins. In addition, large disparities in WAFR projections could also come from internal variability and its irreducible uncertainty, which is another type of climate uncertainty that could be similar or even larger than intermodel variability ( 25 ) and deserves further exploration. These findings highlight the need to take climate uncertainties into account in risk management practices and adaptation strategies ( 26 ). Although climate uncertainties are dominant, there are also considerable uncertainties from nonclimatic factors, including the choice of high-magnitude-flow thresholds (fig. S5C) and the constraints of diversion capacity (fig. S5D). This highlights the important role of infrastructure provision as a key adaptation strategy to buffer future uncertain climate locally and the potential to partially bridge the north-south geographic mismatch of WAFR, evidenced by California’s historical development of state-wide water transfer projects. The importance of expanding diversion capacity to capture high-magnitude-flows is further supported by a recent recharge survey in California ( 22 ). It shows that local stakeholders (e.g., GSAs) are highly concerned about infrastructure capacity issues (e.g., system conveyance and district basin capacity), but funding these gray infrastructure might be difficult due to the potential large environmental impacts.

We find that about a quarter of projected WAFR pot over SJV can be captured in the far future with a diversion capacity equal to the design capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal (=150 m 3 /s). Albeit a small WAFR share, the absolute volume of captured high-magnitude-flows is probably enough to replenish groundwater aquifers over the San Joaquin River Basin with its historical annual groundwater deficit of 0.2 km 3 (WAFR cap contours are above groundwater overdraft contours, see Fig. 2, E and F ). However, even with its original capacity, the captured high-magnitude-flows are still not enough to offset the groundwater overdraft for Tulare River hydrologic region (long-term annual groundwater deficit is 1.96 km 3 ). Purely relying on WAFR cap to bring Tulare’s groundwater into balance will require a total diversion capacity larger than 800 m 3 /s, even under a higher WAFR potential future (i.e., RCP8.5) with a low-threshold setting ( Fig. 2F ). This reinforces the need for pairing physical infrastructure with nonphysical measures (e.g., reservoir reoperation) to jointly manage the increased WAFR potential.

The choice of high-magnitude-flow threshold, combined with the diversion capacity, further shapes how much WAFR can be captured. Here, we explore the sensitivity of WAFR cap to joint changes of these two factors over the SJV ( Fig. 2, E and F ). We find that diversion capacity plays a key role in balancing the nonlinear trade-offs in terms of how to allocate high-magnitude-flows to achieve recharge benefits versus other benefits (e.g., ecosystem services). This is reflected in the concave-upward WAFR cap contours, which show that if the allocation of high-magnitude-flows for nonrecharge purposes increases (by setting a high threshold to define WAFR), then diversion capacity will need to be expanded to achieve the same potential recharge volume. There even exists a distinct knee in the curve, beyond which the marginal value of expanding diversion capacity is close to zero. For example, under the target of capturing 0.5 km 3 of high-magnitude-flows, when the threshold passes 98%, diversion capacity needs to increase substantially. This is likely due to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall ( 23 , 24 ), which translates to more flashy streamflow conditions, as evidenced by the widened space between the 25 and 50% contours of WAFR share under the RCP8.5 scenario ( Fig. 2F ) compared to the RCP4.5 scenario ( Fig. 2E ).

The overall projected increase in WAFR pot ( Fig. 1 ) highlights the maximum recharge potential from high-magnitude-flows. The extent to which these maximum volumes can be captured (WAFR cap ) at a particular site is limited by several factors, including the diversion capacity of physical infrastructure, legal constraints, and land and recharge basin availability—collectively referred to here as “diversion capacity” for convenience ( Fig. 2 ). Given the nature of the hydrograph, the volumetric constraints of WAFR cap respond nonlinearly to diversion capacity, as reflected by the captured WAFR share (defined as the ratio of WAFR cap to WAFR pot ). For example, with a referenced diversion capacity of 150 m 3 /s (equivalent to the design capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal, an aqueduct that delivers water within the southern SJV) ( 22 ), the median WAFR share across all 135 subbasins is 70/58%, and more than 35/44% of California’s subbasins have WAFR share less than 50% during 2070–2099 under RCP4.5/RCP8.5 ( Fig. 2, A and B ). The share of captured WAFR is likely to further decrease in the future and is associated with increased WAFR seasonality, mainly over the Northern half of California, implying a heightened winter flooding risk (fig. S3, A and B). Decreasing diversion capacity to 50 m 3 /s results in a 37 and 45% reduction in the median WAFR share and the percentage of subbasins with WAFR share less than 50% increases to 56 and 66% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (fig. S4, A and B). This implies that in a warming climate, especially in a high-warming scenario (RCP8.5), an increased fraction of subbasins could miss opportunities to fully tap the elevated potential of WAFR, if existing diversion capacity is not added. However, diversion capacity expansion needs to be carefully assessed, as the marginal gain in captured WAFR decreases rapidly per unit expansion in diversion capacity and is associated with large uncertainties resulting from climate models and scenarios ( Fig. 2, C and D ).

Making the most of high-magnitude-flows for recharge could bring a large portion of depleted groundwater aquifers into balance over the SJV, California’s largest agricultural region. On the basis of the median (outlier-robust) response of multimodel ensembles and streamflow observations, our long-term (1976–2005) regional estimates of the water-year (October to September) WAFR pot are 1.62 and 1.80 km 3 /year, respectively, and are similar to other existing estimates (see detailed comparison in Materials and Methods). If completely captured and recharged with no losses, this could make up 73 and 81% of the historical groundwater depletion [2.22 km 3 /year over 1988–2017, ( 22 )]. Compared to historical estimates, there is a tendency toward higher median estimates of WAFR pot in future projections, but these are associated with large interannual variability ( Fig. 1E ). Therefore, capturing and stabilizing these high-magnitude-flows will likely require concerted management actions, including reservoir reoperations and expansion of existing conveyance infrastructure. We find that increases in future projected WAFR pot relative to historical estimates are statistically significant (P < 0.05) for both near-future and far-future periods (see box plots in Fig. 1E ). Such increases are more pronounced in the 2070–2099 period (median increase is 0.68/1.38 km 3 /year for RCP4.5/8.5) but are associated with larger model uncertainty with a stronger dependence on the emission trajectory, compared to the near-future horizon (median increase is 0.48/0.58 km 3 /year for RCP4.5/8.5).

Increases in future projected WAFR pot reveal great opportunities for state-wide recharge practices ( Fig. 1, C and D ), but climate change is likely to exacerbate the uneven north-south distribution of WAFR pot , especially under a high-emission trajectory (RCP8.5, Fig. 1D ). We find that there are widespread (over 56 and 80% of subbasins) and robust (P < 0.05) increases in WAFR pot in the far-future period (2070–2099) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The largest robust increases are concentrated over WAFR-abundant Northern California, including the Sacramento River and North Coast hydrologic regions. These findings are in line with previous research ( 19 , 20 ), which also found substantial and widespread increases in high-magnitude-flow events, especially for basins in the northern and central Sierra Nevada. In contrast, there is almost no increase (and in some cases, even a decrease) in the WAFR-limited dry Southern California ( Fig. 1, C and D ). This implies that existing disparities in WAFR pot will likely deepen under climate change, with an emerging pattern of “wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier” in high-magnitude-flow availability (fig. S2). This will pose additional challenges to California’s existing diversion infrastructure and ecosystems if more intersubbasin north-to-south water transfers are required for Flood-MAR implementation, especially during wet seasons when reservoirs and aqueducts are already at full capacity and therefore may not be able to move future intensified high-magnitude-flows further south. Moreover, future WAFR pot will be concentrated over a narrower wet season compared to historical periods, as shown by the projected increase in WAFR pot sharpness (a measure of WAFR seasonality, see fig. S3 and its definition in Materials and Methods), due to increased seasonality of extreme rainfall ( 9 , 21 ).

Historical (1976–2005) maximum WAFR potential (WAFR pot ) is unevenly distributed across California, as evidenced by both observations ( Fig. 1A ) and model simulations ( Fig. 1B ). Here, WAFR pot is defined as the annual maximum volume of water above a specific high-percentile (e.g., 90th) threshold, independent of capacity to divert it for recharge purposes. While the percentile threshold used to define WAFR pot can vary in time and space (see Discussion), all plausible thresholds show that large volumes of WAFR pot are distributed in Northern California. The semiarid southern half of California has limited WAFR pot but greater groundwater depletion and therefore potentially higher needs for harvesting high-magnitude-flows for recharge practices, compared to the WAFR-abundant Northern California.

DISCUSSION

MAR has been proposed to tackle groundwater overdraft in California and elsewhere in the world, but only a handful of studies (22, 28–30) have focused on WAFR, a key constraint on the implementation and scale-up of MAR practices. Moreover, existing WAFR studies only focus on historical periods and therefore are not adequate to facilitate long-term, forward-looking climate adaptation strategies. To fill this research gap, we develop and implement a scalable and policy-relevant modeling workflow to quantify the changing characteristics of WAFR under climate change.

Our future projections of WAFR provide clear evidence that increases in high-magnitude-flows are highly likely under climate change in California (Fig. 1), as supported by previous studies reporting substantial and robust increases in projected extreme precipitation (23, 31) and streamflow (16, 19, 20). Earlier snowmelt and larger increases in rain-on-snow events also contribute to more extreme streamflow (32), implying higher WAFR under climate change. However, increases in high-magnitude-flows under climate change are anticipated to be more concentrated in a narrower window of the wet season (fig. S3). This could be due to increased seasonality of extreme precipitation (9, 21) and increased rain-on-snow events in a warming climate (32), leading to more rainfall-driven and rain-on-snow–driven floods in the winter season (32).

The changing timing and magnitude of these floodwaters may place additional burdens on California’s existing and aging water infrastructure, requiring long-term reoperation and adaptation of these systems. These trends are likely to be exacerbated by the spatial disparities observed in future WAFR projections (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that a warming climate will produce additional north-south disparities in high-magnitude-flow availability. The geographic mismatch between high-magnitude-flow availability and groundwater overdraft reveals a profound challenge for recharge practices, in terms of how to move high-magnitude-flows from where they are available (Northern California) to where they are most needed (southern half of California). This spatial mismatch will also increase the challenges of simultaneously alleviating flood and drought risks within regions. Northern California is likely to face an increased risk of flooding, which can cause larger damages, compounded by the accelerated deterioration of existing infrastructure; while there will be less WAFR over the southern half of California. Challenges are particularly acute over the agriculturally intensive SJV, which has more than half (11 of 21) of the state’s critically overdrafted groundwater basins and will require the largest reductions of groundwater pumping to meet the sustainability requirements under SGMA. Previous studies estimate that without additional surface water supplies, SJV farmers may permanently retire on the order of 90,000 hectares and temporarily fallow even greater amounts (33), with some estimates suggesting fallowing of up to one-fifth of the total farmland in the Valley, resulting in an estimated 42,000 direct job losses and $7.2 billion annual farm revenue loss (34). Such potential consequences due to SGMA requirements reinforce the need to explore opportunities to harvest floodwater as an alternative to augment water supply to lessen the simultaneous impact of climate change and SGMA.

Besides assessing the long-term response of WAFR to changes in the climate system, our study conducts the first uncertainty attribution analysis for floodwater-related recharge potential by partitioning WAFR uncertainties to different sources. Such uncertainty analysis could aid regional water managers and local GSAs to understand the dominant sources of uncertainty and thus develop targeted programs or analyses to minimize them. A specific focus is the inadequacy of diversion infrastructure to capture floodwater on-site and conveyance infrastructure to deliver captured floodwater to recharge facilities, which is also an important concern of local GSAs (22). Given aging infrastructure in California, conveyance infrastructure may need to be rebuilt or expanded to accommodate increased WAFR potential to scale up recharge practices. Intertwined with diversion capacity, policies that set high-magnitude-flow thresholds add another layer of uncertainty and complexity. These thresholds could be time- and context-dependent and involve complex floodwater allocation trade-offs between recharge and nonrecharge (e.g., ecological flow) purposes. Moreover, the range of high-magnitude-flow thresholds reflects the degree of flexibility of allocating floodwater among different purposes. With a high and strict threshold, and assuming not much infrastructure expansion, there is only a limited amount of floodwater that can be captured. This will require more substantial and immediate reduction of groundwater pumping to meet SGMA requirements and such actions could be very costly (34). To balance the trade-offs among multiple conflicting goals, diversion capacity may need to be expanded at an appropriate level.

To facilitate infrastructure planning to realize the potential benefits of expanding diversion and conveyance infrastructure, we develop a policy typology to identify priorities for future investment needs. Our typology framework explicitly incorporates and classifies uncertainties with a focus on their nature (i.e., whether reducible or deep) and source (i.e., whether climate induced or policy driven). At the subbasin scale, local managers can use this analytical framework (fig. S6) to quantify the range of potential capacity expansion through estimates of C R , C P , and C C , which are key metrics to develop tailored investment policies to adapt to future changing WAFR. Application of this conceptual typology (Fig. 3A) to a regional scale (Fig. 3B) allows regional planners to have a full picture of where to invest in floodwater capture infrastructure and with what degree of priority, although they will likely benefit from local parameterization of marginal capture and benefit parameters.

Policy actions and investment priorities are well defined for subbasins landing on the two ends of the typology spectrum (types 1 and 5). However, it is challenging to develop specific policies for subbasins falling between these two end members (types 2 to 4) because of large climate and/or policy uncertainties or both. Therefore, more effort and resources will need to be devoted to developing tailored solutions. Additional monitoring and exploratory modeling efforts could be useful to better quantify uncertainty and the value of its possible reduction (35), which could be achieved through improved physical understanding of climate processes, using weighted model ensembles or removing poorly performed models, and assimilating new information (e.g., local observations and empirical knowledge) in existing modeling platforms. We suggest that instead of building rigid infrastructure through immediate actions, subbasins in typology classes 2 to 4 should design agile, flexible, and adaptable infrastructure guided by planning approaches for deep uncertainty, including Robust Decision-Making (36, 37), Decision Scaling (38, 39), or hybrid frameworks combining adaptive management and optimization, such as Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (40, 41) or Engineering Options Analysis (42). In particular, subbasins suffering from deep climate uncertainties (types 2 and 4) could consider building out a certain amount of capacity at the beginning, and building more as climate behavior is realized. For large-scale infrastructure, it is safe to consider modular capacity expansion. For small and localized projects, they can be paired with green infrastructure and other types of recharge approaches, such as designing multiple recharge basins in a series with different recharge priority and frequency to facilitate flexible and adaptive capacity to manage WAFR increases. As for subbasins only sensitive to near-term reducible uncertainties (type 3), efforts and resources should be expended to proactively resolve these uncertainties first. Dynamic planning approaches with a focus on stochastic learning [e.g., (43)] to assimilate new knowledge are good options to reduce such policy-related uncertainties. Besides modeling efforts, state and local agencies can set practical guidelines and prepare manuals to clarify the definition of WAFR (e.g., the choice of high-magnitude-flow thresholds) as a means to reduce uncertainties.

The spatial snapshot of typology (Fig. 3B) provides indicative results with coverage across the state but should not be overstretched to imply highly local-level (GSA) priorities. Rather, it is most helpfully taken as an illustration of classification and prioritization that can be reexamined at a regional planning level with locally relevant parameters. In applying such a prioritization for policy purposes, several dependencies should be noted. First, our clustering algorithm to classify subbasins into different typologies is presented under the assumption that each subbasin has the same threshold level of benefit. While locally varying and adjustable thresholds would be more realistic to be included within the algorithm, their estimation was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, results are similar as we vary the threshold (fig. S8). Moreover, the relative importance of climate and policy uncertainty for decision-making is scale dependent. At the regional scale, it may be reasonable to assign equal weights to climate and policy uncertainty for typology clustering. With improved knowledge of local infrastructure conditions, weights of policy and climate uncertainties may need to be adjusted on the basis of their relative importance. For a certain subbasin, this could potentially change the priority class from one type to another. In other words, the current static typology map (as shown Fig. 3B) serves as a long-term outlook and additional dynamics could be included. Nevertheless, the recommended policy actions (Table 1) for a particular typology will stay the same. Regional managers may need to periodically revisit the priority class.

It should also be noted that our current priority assessment is only based on the physical availability of floodwater, while socio-technological, financial, and environmental feasibility, in reality, may play equally or more important roles in the investment decisions. In particular, the current policy typology does not take into account variations in the local governance context (44). California has decentralized and fragmented groundwater governance, whose jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., GSA) in many cases do not overlap with the geographical boundaries of our policy typology (i.e., hydrologic unit at the subbasin level). Recent studies find that 80% of the land area subject to management requirements under SGMA are managed by multiple management entities (45), with as many as 24 management entities within a single groundwater basin (46). In addition to the standard contestation of objectives and priorities among different agencies and stakeholders, such degree of fragmentation may create specific challenges for decisions on cross-basin infrastructure investments, which require high levels of coordination and collaboration. Policy-makers should not use the proposed typology as a prescriptive plan for practical guidance, but rather as a tool to catalyze or stimulate endeavors across various stakeholders toward sustainable and adaptive investment. Given the above governance issues, it may also be worth extending the typology to account for variations in governance context.

There is increasing recognition that climate change will place additional burdens on water systems around the globe. Heightened drought and flood risk are likely to tax aging infrastructure and require policy-makers and water managers to think creatively about mitigating these risks while protecting the environment and minimizing costs. Recharging floodwater to overdrafted groundwater aquifers presents a significant opportunity to mitigate these risks. However, doing this requires water managers to develop a proactive vision of managing the drought-flood nexus simultaneously. Although there is an increasing trend (5%/year) of MAR implementation at the global scale, this is recharging only ~1% of global groundwater extraction (13), far from being adequate to bring depleted groundwater aquifers into sustainable use. The untapped MAR potential demonstrated for our California case study could be a proof of concept that helps translate MAR from local aspiration to global practice, supported by the growing evidence of increased likelihood of heighted peak flows elsewhere in the world (4, 7, 47). However, the potential to generalize the framework to other areas needs to consider regional differences in hydroclimatic conditions (e.g., precipitation and streamflow generation mechanisms), water management policies (e.g., environmental flow requirements versus recharge needs), as well as data availability and quality for reliable WAFR estimates. Beyond California, other stressed aquifers, such as the U.S. High Plains and the North China Plains aquifers, also benefit from high-resolution climate projections and long-term historical observations and therefore could rapidly deploy this framework to develop similar policy typologies. However, this could be challenging over aquifers with limited data, such as in Africa, where additional downscaling and bias correction of climate projections may be needed as well. Such uncertainties associated with downscaling may be dominant over smaller geographies (e.g., local subwatershed level) compared to climate and policy uncertainties and therefore may need to be incorporated into current typology. With increased dimensions of uncertainty, and to better account for their relative importance, machine learning–based algorithms could be used to aid a more automatic typology classification.

In addition to challenges on the large-scale uncertainties of WAFR, there are other recharge-related concerns that will need to be considered. While our study focuses primarily on active recharge, recharge happening naturally also contributes to groundwater recovery. This includes mountain system recharge, diffuse recharge, focused recharge, and recharge from irrigation (48). In California, there is high confidence that projected mountain system recharge will decline in a warming climate due to the loss of the winter snowpack (49) and shifts from snow to rain (32), which increases the likelihood of surface runoff rather than percolation. Diffuse and focused recharge may decrease in Southern California due to combined effects of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature, but their changing directions are not clear in Northern California, given that extreme precipitation will largely increase in future climates (9, 21, 23, 31). It is also challenging to quantify projected changes in irrigation recharge (48). On one hand, warmer temperatures will lead to increased irrigation water demand, which can potentially increase irrigation return flow and therefore percolation (50). Alternatively, they may result in similar or declining recharge rates as evapotranspiration rates increase. On the other hand, adaptation strategies such as increased irrigation efficiency and changing crop practices could potentially reduce irrigation. Robustly quantifying these natural recharge fluxes in addition to our projected estimates of managed recharge water availability is therefore necessary to provide a more comprehensive picture of the magnitude and timing of the total recharge potential. This requires more detailed physically based hydrological modeling to better understand how projected changes in precipitation and temperature may propagate through the above recharge mechanisms and how they interact with various types of human interventions. Other nonclimatic factors also need to be factored in before undertaking local or regional-scale recharge efforts, including land use planning and zoning requirements, land acquisition and permitting, evaporation loss from open surfaces, crop recharge suitability [for on-farm recharge, (51)], and potential impacts to water quality (52). Moreover, the ability to recover the recharged water for use in later periods requires better regulatory policies on water rights and permits. More holistic assessment considering hydrologic, hydrogeologic, regulatory, social, and institutional constraints is needed. Future work also needs to explore how to incorporate WAFR information to facilitate a more integrated strategy of pairing Flood-MAR with other diversified portfolios (e.g., demand side management and reservoir reoperation) across different scales. Nevertheless, our climate-informed WAFR database and the stylized typology are key first steps toward facilitating the transition of our water management to a more resilient and adaptive future under a changing climate.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabe6025/F1.large.jpg,"['policy', 'managed', 'hydrologic', 'guide', 'diversion', 'uncertainties', 'water', 'recharge', 'modeling', 'aquifer', 'climateinformed', 'infrastructure', 'typology', 'capacity', 'wafr', 'fig', 'groundwater', 'climate']",

Kenyan traders have asked their government to tighten the ban on Uganda’s poultry imports.

The demand comes just days amid talks in which Kenyan officials were in Uganda last week to discuss trade barriers on a number of products including sugar, maize and milk.

In January, Kenya’s Directorate of Veterinary Services banned importation of poultry and beef products as it sought to protect its farmers from competition as well as support the resumption of the sector that had been dampened by Covid-19 related disruptions.

However, reports by Business Daily yesterday indicated dealers in Kenya, specifically Yo Kuku, were still trading in poultry products processed from Uganda, which has prompted traders in to petition government to tighten the January ban in order to protect dealers amid a second wave of Covid-19.

Mr Zack Munyambu, the Kiambu Poultry Farmers’ Cooperative Association director, told Business Daily that the Kenyan government needed to protect its farmers from imports amid restrictions occasioned by the second curfew.

“Our farmers have been affected heavily by this second curfew and we need to protect them at all costs,” Mr Munyambu said, noting there was need to tighten the ban to ensure that farmers are not exposed by imports that are smuggled into the country.

In the same measure, Business Daily reported the Federation of Poultry Farmers, had demanded that: “… the importation of poultry meat and poultry products ceases as soon as possible so that the industry ... can hold on until times are less volatile.”

This is the second time Kenya farmers have sought for protection with the first plea in December resulting into a ban on poultry exports from Uganda that had been recovering from a 2018 ban occasioned by suspected bird flu.

Business Daily yesterday reported that Ugandan poultry products, despite an ongoing ban, had been located in Yo Kuku outlets in the Nairobi suburbs of Roysambu, Kawangware, Umoja and Kitengela.

However, Mr Rahim Manji, the Yo Kuku executive director, yesterday told Daily Monitor, the company had ceased exporting its products to Kenya months ago, noting there was a possibility that what is being sold now is stock before the ban was instituted.

“That is not true. We are not exporting our products to Kenya. The borders were closed. What is on shelves is stock before the ban,” he said.

Mr Aga Ssekalala Jr, the Poultry Association of Uganda chairman, said the ban has impacted business in Uganda, forcing some companies to heavily downsize operations while others have temporally closed.

Mr Ssekalala also noted that it was disappointing that a delegation from Kenya, which was in the country last week, had only dealt with sugar and maize with poultry issues referred to a later date.

Production capacity

Data from Uganda Bureau of Statistics indicate that between 2014 and 2018, Uganda’s poultry production capacity increased to 42.9 million birds with 87.7 per cent of these being indigenous.

A total of 930 million eggs were produced in the period up from 856 million eggs in 2014. The increase indicates a 2.6 per cent rise in eggs in 2018 from 907.1 million in 2017.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/3371142/040b8cbbe473d2767175daceeabc8527/mark002-pix-data.jpg,"['kenyan', 'seek', 'uganda', 'ban', 'farmers', 'kenya', 'million', 'traders', 'poultry', 'daily', 'tougher', 'ugandas', 'protect', 'products', 'imports', 'second']",

2021 must be the year for climate action – “the make it or break it year,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres at the launch of WMO’s report on the State of the Global Climate 2020 which highlighted accelerating climate change indicators and worsening impacts.

“This is a frightening report. It needs to be read by all leaders and decision-makers in the world,” Mr Guterres told journalists.

“This report shows that 2020 was also another unprecedented year of extreme weather and climate disasters. The cause is clear. Anthropogenic climate change -- climate disruption caused by human activities, human decisions and human folly,” he said.

Mr Guterres joined WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas in releasing WMO’s trademark report, which includes input from national meteorological services, UN partners and the broader climate and scientific community.

The report is accompanied by a story map showing details of key climate indicators, including record greenhouse gas concentrations, increasing land and ocean temperatures, sea level rise, melting ice and glacier retreat and extreme weather. It also highlights impacts on socio-economic development, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.

“All key climate indicators and associated impact information provided in this report highlight relentless, continuing climate change, an increasing occurrence and intensification of extreme events, and severe losses and damage, affecting people, societies and economies,” said Prof. Taalas.

“It is therefore important to invest in adaptation. One of the most powerful ways to adapt is to invest in early warning services and weather observing networks and hydrological services,” he said.

2020 was one of the three warmest years on record, despite a cooling La Niña event. The global average temperature was about 1.2° Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) level. The six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record. 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record.

“Our challenge is clear,” said the UN Secretary-General.

“To avert the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that we must limit global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees of the pre-industrial baseline. That means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050,” he said.

“We are way off track.”

Mr Guterres listed a number of concrete advances in the run up to the UN Climate Change negotiations, COP26, in Glasgow this November.

These include:

A global coalition committed to net zero emissions – to cover all countries, cities, regions, businesses and financial institutions.

The next 10 years need to be a decade of transformation, with more ambitious nationally determined contributions and climate plans under the Paris Agreement.

These commitments should be backed up with concrete immediate action. The trillions of dollars spent on COVID-19 recovery must be aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Subsidies to polluting fossil fuels must be shifted to renewable energy. And developed countries must lead in phasing out coal -- by 2030 in OECD countries, and 2040 elsewhere.

Developed countries also need to deliver on climate finance for the developing world, particularly the promise of $100 billion dollars per year. Half of all climate finance from donors and multilateral and national development banks must flow to resilience and adaptation, from a much lower level of 20 per cent today. Access to these sources of finance must also be made easier for the most vulnerable.

“I count first on developed countries to deliver on climate finance and, as I mentioned, the promised 100 billion dollars a year at the G7 Summit in June. Then, I will urge the G20 countries to take on the greening of the broader financial architecture, to address debt and make climate-related financial disclosure mandatory,” said Mr Guterres.

“This is truly a pivotal year for humanity’s future. This report shows we have no time to waste,” he said.

The Kenyan team is led by Betty Maina, Cabinet Secretary for Industrialization, Trade, and Enterprise Development.

Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Kenyan and Ugandan officials will conduct a sugar verification exercise as well as discuss market access challenges for poultry, maize and dairy products, and other non-tariff barriers.

Earlier this year, Kenya restricted importation of milk, maize and poultry products from Uganda, and Ugandan legislators threatened to retaliate.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni on Tuesday said he met with the Kenyan team and discussed trade relations between the two countries in light of trade barriers.

""Competition has been generated by the fact that we are trading in a common market, however, the ultimate logic of EAC (East African Community) integration is that one who is more efficient should be allowed to sell. We should eliminate irregularities with strategic analysis, not endless fights,"" Mr Museveni said.

Grace Adong, Uganda's acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, said the interactions between the two sides aim at building a strong regional block with less trade restrictions.

Ambassador John Weru, the Principal Secretary of Kenya's State Department for Trade, was positive that the ongoing week-long deliberations would bear positive results.

The team will this week embark on a sugar verification mission which will see them visit more than 14 sugar factories around the country to ascertain Uganda's sugar production capacity.

Uganda's annual sugar production capacity currently stands at approximately 550,000 tonnes but its domestic consumption is 360,000 tonnes, according to official data.

In March 2019, Uganda secured concessions to increase its sugar quota to Kenya from 36,000 to 90,000 tonnes on condition that it meets the rules of origin criteria established under the EAC.

Following a midterm review in December 2019, the two parties noted that the sugar exports had increased from 36,000 to 57,273 tonnes as of October.

It was then agreed that a verification mission would be undertaken by Kenya to ascertain the origin of Uganda's sugar before Nairobi can consider increasing the quota to 90,000.

Uganda's sugar stocks have now accumulated to 65,000 tonnes worth $40 million and are held in various stores across the country.

More by this Author Summary Gaping investment holes in climate-friendly projects is one of the major barriers facing Kenya in its drive towards greening the economy.

The other is a highly disproportionate climate finance portfolio, where only a few sectors receive the lion’s share of investments as many others barely scrape by.

These twin challenges have given rise to fragmented efforts, which can at best only partially address climate issues.

Gaping investment holes in climate-friendly projects is one of the major barriers facing Kenya in its drive towards greening the economy.

The other is a highly disproportionate climate finance portfolio, where only a few sectors receive the lion’s share of investments as many others barely scrape by. These twin challenges have given rise to fragmented efforts, which can at best only partially address climate issues.

What Kenya needs instead is a fully integrated approach, where green finance is ramped up in a structured way and different sectors are each given their fair share of attention and resources.

Currently, climate finance also known as green finance is disproportionally heavy on renewable energy, largely solar, wind and geothermal. On the other hand, other key sectors such as agriculture, forestry, transportation, clean cooking and water and waste management are dramatically underfunded.

It doesn’t help that Kenya’s economy is deeply rooted in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, energy, tourism and wildlife. This has effectively put East Africa’s economic powerhouse at high risk whenever climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods occur.

There has been a steady pick-up in the intensity and frequency of such disasters in recent years, estimated to cost the economy an equivalent of up to 2.8 percent of its GDP every year.

While the country has lined up a number of climate mitigation and adaptation measures as outlined in its climate action blueprints, financing remains a big puzzle that will require innovation to solve.

Kenya desires is to increase investments in green projects to drive green growth and development, and achieve a low-carbon economy. At the same time, it looks to strengthen the resilience of existing infrastructure projects to withstand climate-induced shocks.

While there has been a steady increase in flow of climate investments in recent years, it is still considered a trickle compared to required volumes.

Climate investments in Kenya totalled Sh243.3 billion ($2.4 billion) as of 2018, according to a report I supported under KCIC Consulting. Out of the Sh243.3 billion green investments, Sh144.3 billion came from the public sector (59 percent), with private investors putting in Sh98.9 billion, and accounting for 41 percent of the share.

For Kenya to meet the goals outlined in its nationally determined contribution (NDC), both public and private climate finance should be scaled up.

Kenya targets to slash its greenhouse gas emissions, the culprit behind global warming and climate change, by 32 percent by 2030.

However, if the finance flow maintains the same scale and speed, the country will no doubt fall short of reaching this rather ambitious goal.

To this end, we need to see a steady pick-up in climate financing instruments such as green bonds, alongside creation of green financial products among commercial banks with support from development finance institutions.

A total of Sh180.4 billion went into green energy investments as of 2018, making it the single most financed sector. Coming at a distant second was water and the blue economy, which attracted only Sh15.3 billion in green investments, far short of the Sh100 billion needed per year.

Third placed is forestry, wildlife and tourism, and food security having attracted Sh14 billion in climate investments in the review period. This is a drop in the ocean compared to the Sh49 billion spending plan the sector requires annually. Kenya urgently needs sustainable and regenerative agriculture, given that the sector ranks first in greenhouse gas emissions (40 percent), largely through livestock enteric fermentation, manure and fertiliser application.

The volume of green finance flow into manufacturing stood at Sh11.9 billion as of 2018, and Sh9 billion for health, sanitation and human settlements. Drought and flood risk management attracted Sh2.4 billion against the required annual budget of Sh17.4 billion while clean transport attracted the least amount at a paltry Sh200 million.

These green investment gaps alongside the skewed structure should trigger commercial banks, the government and private investors to redirect their attention towards areas most in need of improvement if we’re to have holistic interventions.

Here, the private sector could play a crucial role in filling deep investment gaps and rebalancing sector investments, with the right support.

For instance, the government may roll out incentives and subsidies to create a more attractive enabling environment for private investment in the underfunded climate industries.

Pretty much every sector of Kenyan economy is exposed to climate change, and therefore climate mitigation and adaptation efforts should be given top priority.

The time to scale up climate finance is now, for better climate results.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3318586/6842ace847bac51d3f1d08d40f182c30/energy-clean-data.jpg,"['kenya', 'finance', 'sector', 'investments', 'split', 'investment', 'private', 'ecofriendly', 'projects', 'sectors', 'green', 'climate', 'billion']",

On Monday, President Farmaajo landed in Kinshasa to meet with his host Felix Tshisekedi, also the current Chair of the African Union. A statement from Villa Somalia said President Farmaajo will be on a 'working visit' to speak with Mr Tshisekedi in his capacity as the African Union Chair.

""During the visit, the two leaders will discuss how to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Somalia and the DR Congo,"" Mr Farmaajo's office said.

The meeting though forms part of the latest shuttle diplomacy by Mr Farmaajo to seek support following a controversial extension of his term by two years.

This week, the African Union Bureau of Heads of State and Government is expected to discuss the situation in Somalia, following the decision by the Lower House to delay elections by two years.

Chaired by Tshisekedi, it also includes leaders from Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa and Senegal. It was unclear on Monday if these leaders will be travelling to Kinshasa as well.

Although Mr Farmaajo has argued that Parliament was merely providing more time for the country to conduct proper universal suffrage, international partners including the AU have rejected the delay.

Parallel electoral processes

A joint statement issued last week said the international partners would not accept any extensions of mandate, parallel electoral processes nor any activities that could worsen the security situation in Somalia.

Mr Farmaajo has dismissed international critics and accused them of interfering with Somalia's internal affairs. He said last week Parliament had created a ""historic chance"" for Somalis to choose their own destiny after the failure of FMS members to support the implementation of the initial September 17, 2020 Agreement.

He said Somalia will ""not tolerate external interference in sensitive sovereign affairs especially elections which were issues of independence to the people and the Federal Government of Somalia.""

But after the EU, United States of America and the UK warned of ""re-evaluating"" their relationship with Somalia, including suspension of crucial support programmes, he summoned their representatives in Mogadishu on Saturday.

The meeting took place at the 'Big Tent' near the former Somali Air force Headquarters inside Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle International Airport.

It was the first meeting between Somalia's development supporters and President Farmaajo since the Lower House of Somalia's parliament voted for an extension of the elected institutions for two years.

The endorsement, which occurred on April 12, mandated the National Electoral Commission to prepare for one-person-one-vote elections for a period not exceeding two years.

No statement was immediately issued after the meeting, but the partners had in the past stated they would not support a partial or parallel electoral process or initiatives to extend prior mandates.

Election agenda

President Farmaajo signed the piece of legislation just hours after the Lower House's endorsement last week on Monday.

There are fears tensions over the election agenda could either divert attention from war on al-Shabaab or allow militia to crop up defending their political kin.

Last week, the African Union Mission in Somalia, the combat force created by the AU to fight terrorism in Somalia, announced it would be gradually handing over key security responsibilities to Somalia National Army.

The duties to be granted by December this year include guarding of crucial installations, al-Shabaab combat strategy and border security.

An impasse on an electoral deal, however, could delay the transfer.

On Friday night, government forces reportedly surrounded Shirkole neighbourhood in Mogadishu's Hodon district where General Sadaq Omar Hassan alias Sadaq John, the former Mogadishu Police Commander who attempted to block the entrance of the Lower House of the parliament on Monday, is hiding.

Sadiq John was immediately fired by Commissioner of Somali Police Force, Hassan Mohamed Hijar and endorsed by President Farmaajo. Since then, Sadaq John has surrounded himself with a unit of the police force that remained loyal to him while the Somali security forces are attempting to seize him.

Reliable sources privy to the plan said DRC president, Felix Tshisekedi invited both Uhuru Kenya of Kenya and Farmajo to attend meeting in Kinshasa town. Talks will be brokered by Felix who is serving as the chairperson of African Union (AU).





Uhuru is expected to arrive in Kinshasa in the forthcoming hours.





The relations between Somalia and Kenya hit bottom after the horn of Africa nation withdrew its diplomats from Kenya and expelled Kenyan diplomats from Mogadishu.







Somalia accused Kenya of frequent violation of Mogadishu's sovereignty, a claim dismissed by Kenyan authorities.





The decision by Somalia influenced by Kenya’s invitation to Somaliland president Muse Bihi Abdi who arrived in Nairobi last December and inked cooperation agreement with President Uhuru. However, the Somali government insists that Somaliland is part of its territory.





Both Somalia and Kenya are also contesting ownership of a triangular territory measuring 100,000km2 in the Indian Ocean boundary.





Somalia went to International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2014 following what it termed as failure to settle the matter with her neighbour, Kenya bilaterally.





The court had concluded the hearing of the maritime border dispute between Somalia and Kenya and is expected to release its verdict.





The verdict of the court is final and not subject to appeal.

It is a very concerning situation that over 100 million people in Africa are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification-3 and above) and the situation may worsen in the coming months especially between June and August 2021. The socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 have become wider and deeper especially in developing countries.

The secondary impacts of COVID-19 could have long-lasting affects across the continent, particularly for those living in poverty.

In Africa, a continent with a high proportion of workers in the informal economy, the most vulnerable have been hit hard. In Africa, people face the challenges of either too little water or too much water – cyclic patterns of drought to floods to droughts – impacting vulnerable groups either by floods or by famine silently due to profound impacts of climate change.

People are becoming more vulnerable due to civil unrest, displacements, population movement and other complex socio-political and economic factors.

Justice Marete who was appearing before the Judicial Service Commission panel interviewing candidates shortlisted for the position of Chief Justice, said the nature of the disability was listed erroneously.

Marete however clarified that he had a visual and a diabetic condition.

""No, I have no mental issues. There was an error on my card and I have never had the time to correct the issue. When I applied for the card at the National Council for Persons with Disabilities, I highlighted that I have visual disability and Diabetes from time to time,"" he told the panelists.

He termed the mental disability inscription a 'non issue' but acknowledged being aware about it since 2015 although he, ""never got the time to rectify.""

""It never occurred to me that it would come to haunt me. I am a workaholic and have been so busy, peripheral issues like those didn't bother me but I will amend it instantly,"" he said when questioned by commissioner Felix Koskei.

The Employment and Labour Relations Court judge was further put to task over an impasse with the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary over his dislike for police drivers.

Marete noted that owing to his condition and rigid schedule, he prefers civilian drivers who he said are easy to manage.

He said he had successfully requested the Judiciary to hire a civilian driver identified as Mwangi on a contract basis but he was never fully employed prompting him to leave.

Marete noted he had stints with police drivers whom he described as very impatient. Since their departure, the judge hired a driver out of his own resources.

""One lasted a day with me; another lasted a week while the best lasted three months. They are impatient and all left, the reason why they left, I do not know,"" he said.

Much of that experience in recent years has focused on leveraging advances in digital technology to increase different aspects of resilience. Examples below cover shared datasets and maps in Bangladesh, drones and mobile devices in Tanzania, and digital representations of vulnerable shorelines and population centers in the Marshall Islands. Collectively, these tools increase the power of decision-makers to chart a better future in the face of increasingly challenging climatic conditions.

Mapping and assessing vulnerable areas in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, one of the climate vulnerable countries in the world, cyclones over the Bay of Bengal have already increased in frequency and are projected to become more intense. Mapping vulnerable areas using Geographic Information System (GIS) and making datasets available across agencies is leading to better informed decision-making.

While location data and maps were held previously by individual, non-networked agencies, they are now available for cross-referencing on a platform called GeoDASH, supported by GFDRR and transferred to the Bangladesh Computer Council in December 2015. As of April 2021, over 3,700 users representing 55 public, private, and civil society organizations have shared data, making available 740 datasets from road network maps and building footprints to the location of water, gas, and utilities in a secure platform. All of these datasets are available to the public in a widely usable format.

The platform has been used by the Directorate of Primary Education of Bangladesh to assess 35,000 schools with respect to the type of infrastructure, water and sanitation facilities, access to roads, and overall capacity during natural disasters. Bangladesh’s Local Government Engineering Department used geospatial layers to produce cyclone risk maps that will guide investment plans for cyclone shelters in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. GeoDASH was also instrumental in the design of the first phase of the IDA and CIF-funded Coastal Embankment Improvement Project, a project focused on improving 10 vulnerable coastal polders of Bangladesh with coastal embankments, hydraulic structures and protective works. And geospatial data analysis supported by the platform informs the ongoing Urban Resilience Project that is strengthening the capacity of government agencies to respond to emergency events and reduce the vulnerability of future building constructions to disasters in the cities of Dhaka and Sylhet.","Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2021/apr-2/iStock-1282964559.png,"['countries', 'available', 'project', 'world', 'deploying', 'lowincome', 'coastal', 'used', 'change', 'bangladesh', 'datasets', 'maps', 'vulnerable', 'climate', 'platform', 'withstand', 'tools', 'digital']",

The financially crippled firm was producing ethanol after milling of sugar stalled over two years ago. It was doing close to 150,000 litres in two shifts, boosted by the high demand for alcohol needed in the production of hand sanitiser.

The receiver manager appointed by the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Ponangipalli Venkata Ramana, told staff a shortage of molasses had forced them to close shop indefinitely.

The miller had been relying on raw materials from private factories in the region, such as Butali Sugar Mills, Nzoia Sugar Company and the Busia Sugar Factory.

The shortage is reportedly linked to traders who have been selling molasses to firms in Uganda, where they fetch up to Sh20,000 per tonne compared to Sh10,000 locally.

Other reports attributed the shutdown to challenges involving the management of the revenue generated from the sale of over a million litres of ethanol over the past 19 months.

""We usually ensure that we have a minimum of 3,000 tonnes of molasses before we start ethanol production,"" said an employee.

""We have been away for close to a month. We have been asked to stay away but there has been no communication on whether we will keep our jobs or not.""

The miller has been struggling with debts, ageing equipment and cane shortage despite a Sh3.6 billion government bailout.

Mumias' loans stood at Sh12.5 billion as of June 2018. It owed Ecobank Kenya Sh2 billion, French development finance institution Proparco Sh1.9 billion and Commercial Bank of Africa Sh401 million.

Other creditors are the Treasury (Sh3.1 billion) and Kenya Sugar Board (Sh1.6 billion). Mumias was also operating on bank overdrafts worth Sh2.7 billion from various lenders.

A fortnight ago, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya inspected the factory with a team from KCB and a 'potential investor'.

""My instructions were to take him (investor) around the factory so that he does due diligence and make a decision,"" said Mumias lawyer, Patrick Mutuli.

According to the Sugar Task Force report, which was presented to President Kenyatta in February last year, the miller is indebted to the tune of Sh20 billion.

The government promised to act on all the recommendations but there has been a delay in the implementation of the report.

The pandemic consumed the efforts of many nations that struggled to steady their economies and keep inundated health care facilities functioning. But with COVID-19 vaccines gaining regulatory approvals and access to the shots expanding, some are looking at 2021 with renewed hope of climate action.

One country that will likely face calls to action is Australia.

Despite a growing number of citizens who believe the effects of climate change are real, Australia is largely seen as falling behind other countries in its climate change pledges.

""I just really wouldn't expect Australia to be a leader on this front,"" says Lachlan Carey of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It's going to have to be sort of pulled kicking and screaming into any serious climate action.""

Australia's Climate Change Views

Of developed countries, Australia is one of the most at-risk for impacts of climate change. Yet it ranked second to last on climate change policy in the Climate Change Performance Index 2021 report .

Further, Australia's citizens fall in the lower range of countries when asked if they believe climate change is real, according to data from the 2021 Best Countries report . With roughly 82% of respondents in Australia agreeing with the statement, ""The effects of climate change are real,"" Australia's results line up with countries like Sweden, Norway and Russia and are several percentage points lower than the global average of agreement, which was 89%.

Just 85% of respondents in the United States said they believe the effects of climate change are real, while respondents in countries annually affected by severe weather had the highest levels of agreement with the statement; 96% in Kenya and nearly 97% in Indonesia.

Australia's results from the Best Countries data are roughly in line with polling from the Australia Institute, a progressive think tank based in Canberra. The institute's 2020 ""Climate of the Nation"" report found that 79% of Australians believe that climate change is occurring, which is the report's highest result since 2012.

Catastrophic bush fires in 2019 claimed dozens of lives and brought renewed attention to the effects of climate change, says Richie Merzian, the director of Australia Institute's Climate and Energy Program.

""The felt experience of climate change is coming through in our surveys and polls, and that finds that more Australians are feeling the impacts of climate change now, and that is driving a more consistent push for climate action,"" he says.

Photos: Fire and Fury View All 22 Images

But it's hard to know if events like the deadly bush fires or more recent flooding have a lasting impact on public opinion.

""Evidence about the impact of extreme weather events suggests that there can be an impact on some people in the short term but that influence decays over time, the further they get away from that severe weather event,"" says Rebecca Colvin of Australian National University. ""For other people, they can be totally transformative, depending on their experience.""

Australia's conservative government has long been seen as unwilling to take influential climate action, and its economy, dependent on fossil fuels, is a major reason why. The country is one of the biggest exporters of coal in the world.

""That puts Australia in a very tough position of, how do you take action on climate change, without undermining one of your key sources of export revenue, and our solution to that has been to try and avoid the question,"" says Carey of CSIS's Energy Security and Climate Change Program, and who is from Australia.

Colvin says some use the term ""carbon entanglement"" to describe the government and coal industry's interests.

""The influence of the sector in the public sphere is very much in pursuit of the interest for the sector, and not necessarily – not at all – looking for the public good,"" Colvin says.

International Pressure

While more Australians are acknowledging the effects of climate change in recent years, pressure from nations could be what the Australian government needs to propel it into taking substantial action on climate change.

""Australia is a middle-income country, really, but we like to think we can play with the big kids,"" says Merzian, who suggests that larger economies can create change in the country.

As one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels, Australia relies heavily on trade and can therefore be influenced by other countries, he says. China, Japan and South Korea – three nations that have goals to reach net zero emissions – are some of Australia's biggest coal customers.

""The government kind of knows it will have to ride the international trends,"" Merzian says. ""Allies are moving, and they're not just moving more towards climate action. They're driving the ambition towards climate action.""

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that the country's goal is to reach net-zero emissions as soon as possible, preferably by 2050. But that hasn't translated into federal policies, according to Colvin of ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy.

""It's a very strong sense that Australia is not well-regarded internationally for our climate action,"" Colvin says.

On the other hand, Carey of CSIS says that negotiations from other countries on climate efforts could make some difference but that domestic pressure could have a larger impact.

""Really countries have to figure this out each on their own in terms of their local politics, and G20 and [United Nations] pressure might be able to make a bit of a difference at the margin, but it's really not the driving force in these actions, unfortunately,"" Carey says.

Big Year Ahead on Climate

This week world leaders will gather at U.S. President Joe Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate . Australia's Morrison, as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Xi Jinping of China, have been invited to attend.

While allies will likely be aligned with the Biden administration's goals for the summit, it is unknown what could come from other countries, particularly China, Eurasia Group Vice Chairman and Senior Advisor Gerald Butts said this week during a press event.

Butts said China could be a ""big wildcard"" but noted that he expects the country to say ""very little"" during the summit. While Xi could have aggressive climate commitments to make before the United Nations conference in Glasgow later this year, he likely won't be announcing them at Biden's summit.

""There is a 0% chance – and trending down – that [Xi] wants to be seen to make those commitments at the behest of Joe Biden and the United States,"" Butts said.

But some say Biden's administration, which has said that climate change will be a top priority while he is in office, along with other countries could influence Australia's next steps on climate change.

""I would expect to see a pretty heavy hand placed on the scales by Biden – but in particular his special envoy, John Kerry – to get Australia and other large emitting countries to commit to both a 2050 net zero target but then sort of intervening targets leading up to that, particularly 2030 targets and probably sectoral targets, as well,"" Carey says.

The White House called its summit a ""key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow."" That conference is the successor to the landmark Paris meeting of 2015, where global leaders made the goal of keeping global temperature rise ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, though countries were encouraged to aim for a 1.5 degrees goal.

Carey says he expects to see countries, particularly across Europe, shift their focus from COVID-19 pandemic recovery plans to climate investments leading up to the conference in November.

""All of this is really about coming away with some pretty tangible outcomes at COP26, and how tangible those will be remains to be seen. I'm personally worried that it will be more targets and timetables rather than real dollars and action plans … But I think there's a huge amount of momentum and pressure building with COP26 as the sort of end goal for all of it,"" Carey says.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e29176e/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F3a%2F80%2F50dd33ab4cd7955b558a5694a116%2Fgettyimages-1309581679-594x594.jpg,"['countries', 'united', 'action', 'real', 'change', 'effects', 'faces', 'address', 'nations', 'battle', 'uphill', 'australia', 'climate', 'carey']",

Watching An Inconvenient Truth in your middle-school science class. Hearing Greta Thunberg’s calls to join weekly school strikes. Driving away from smouldering wildfires engulfing dry California hillsides.

These are some of the moments that made young people realize the climate crisis will define their lives — and the future of human life on Earth. We’ve heard the facts so many times that it’s easy to become numb to them. The world is steadily growing warmer, certain parts of the world are facing extreme droughts or floods, many wildlife populations are shrinking — and things are only projected to grow worse, with carbon emissions rising and countries contributing to mass deforestation. Despite these emergencies, many U.S. politicians, including Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, deny the reality of climate change. And the Western world, particularly the United States, is currently the biggest contributor to the climate crisis. Though the climate crisis is affecting everyone on Earth, it’s effects have been particularly felt by those living in the global south, lower-income people, and younger people, whose futures are being shaped by how we handle the crisis.

These overarching facts are important to reiterate. But it’s also critical to understand what climate change feels like on an everyday level — how it affects our mental and physical health. It’s a problem so enormous and disorienting that it’s often easier to just shove it into the darker corners of our minds, where we don’t want to look. Living under the spectre of climate change can make it feel surreal to try to plan an education, a career, a family, or any concrete aspect of your future.

That’s why younger generations have risen up, calling on global leaders to treat our rapidly changing climate like the emergency it is. Teen Vogue heard from more than 80 young people about how they imagine the climate crisis might define their future. A selection of their responses is below.

Editor’s note: These responses have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Ariana Matondo, Tampa, Florida, 19, college student

In eighth grade, we learned about the sea levels rising in Florida, and that Florida could go partially underwater because of this. When the teacher told me this, fear plagued my body and I immediately started making plans to move out of Florida when I became a college student. Seven years later, however, and I’m still here. I’ve definitely become more sustainable in my own way since then. I started going second-hand shopping more often and started a community garden with my friends a few years ago. Some things that give me hope are going to beach clean-ups and the many sustainability options that people use in downtown Tampa Bay, such as solar panels and other energy management systems.

Delina, Houston, Texas, 21, college student

I live in Texas, so the recent winter-storm outage has scared people around me and made us want to take matters into our own hands. I am a coordinator for mutual aid efforts in the Austin area, and seeing people share funds, housing those in need, and sharing food and water has brought me so much hope when seeing how we can help those who are victims of climate disaster. Through social media and listening to community leaders, I am educating myself on how to live a low-waste life and having discussions with those around me to take small steps in living sustainably.

Ace, Brooklyn, New York, 28, astrologer

I go through moments of realizing that this will define my future, but it’s hard to understand that fully. When I was 21, I remember having a moment [in which] I learned that climate change is irreversible. COVID has been an exercise in learning that crisis happens slowly. In the past few years, NYC has been reclassified into a subtropical climate. That has been scary. I feel anger at those in power. I feel fear for my family members in the developing world.

Mariana, El Paso, Texas 17, high-school student

Unlike some of my friends, I don’t feel a lot of anger towards older generations. I think people conjure up very stereotypical ideas of old people that they can be mad about. But my parents didn’t do this. My grandparents didn’t do this. They are poor laborers. Certain members of the older generation were more responsible than others, and we can be mad at some of them. I just want them to understand how very serious this is and how important it is to act now. The longer we wait, the harder it will be. So even though they won’t be around, say, 40 years from now, they still can and should join with us in trying to fix this problem, for their kids and grandkids.

Kiran Misra, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 24, Government Partnerships Officer at the World Food Programme

My hometown has experienced two ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ natural disasters in my lifetime — first, a flood in 2008 and next, a ‘derecho’ inland hurricane in 2020. Seeing homes underwater, roofs torn off, and more, really hit home that the effects of climate change aren’t just happening in coastal areas or deserts — it can happen in Iowa too. Of course, the impacts of these disasters are most felt by those who are non-white or low income: when a city floods, those living on higher elevations can often emerge relatively unscathed, and during the derecho, those with stronger roofs who could afford to get them replaced or repaired more often experienced less damage to their homes.

Gloria Kisilu, Nairobi, Kenya, 25, entrepreneur

We were getting ready for planting season with my dad on the farm but the rains delayed us for weeks, while in other parts of the country, they were experiencing a drought. The lack of rain was just the first among many effects of climate change that I’ve experienced since then. I’ve participated in clean-ups, changed my daily routine — especially in the amount of plastic I buy, reuse, and recycle — and also started a blog on how to be sustainable in Kenya. I’ve learned that responsible consumption and production goes a long way.

Tanusha Singh Patel, Brighton, U.K., 17, college student

As someone with a South Asian heritage, this hits me harder than it might others. It’s well-known that climate change is disproportionately affecting those who are the least able to deal with it. People I know, friends and family overseas, are being affected by this. In the west, climate change is posed as a futuristic apocalypse — but climate change is actively destroying homes, crops, and livestock. It’s destroying lives.

Monica, Mexico City, 24, biomedical engineer

As long as I can remember, there have been different campaigns in Mexico City to raise awareness for the lack of water, but they made it seem like it was a remote possibility in the distant future. But when I was in middle school, we couldn’t wash our hands or go to the bathroom some days because the district didn’t have water. That was the moment I realized the lack of water was already happening and at a worse rate than they made us believe.

Rebecca, Florida, 28, political organizer

I was a junior in high school when the BP oil spill happened, and I remember arguing with my more ignorant classmates about the effects of the spill and why it mattered for the governor to close the beaches along the Panhandle. Florida is not safe when it comes to climate change, and it will only get more unsafe as things get worse. Given our senior population, major weather events and rising temperatures are deadly, and our Republican legislature doesn’t care. But we have a president again who knows that climate change is a threat. We also have politicians who understand what a threat it really is and the structural problems that make tackling climate change difficult and are committed to fighting it. The legions of climate change activists are moving the Overton window [of what’s politically possible], and that’s really great.

Molly, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 23, administrative assistant

Seeing creative ways to live more sustainably has brought me hope. I’m disabled, and a lot of the methods are just so work- and time-consuming that I’m not able to do it. I can’t afford to eat vegan and I don’t have access to some options. But I’m realizing that little things in my everyday life, like using a reusable water bottle and other small things, are useful. Ultimately, I know the best thing I can do is pressure corporations and lawmakers.

Nia, Houston, Texas, 18, high-school student

I first learned what climate change was in policy debate in ninth grade. Debaters spoke about it as if it would be one big catastrophic day that we wouldn’t expect. They were talking about the importance of STEM education in schools so that students could grow up to become leaders in climate policy. This past February, when Texas was suddenly hit with a winter storm, I realized climate change wouldn’t happen in the distant future — t’s happening now. Being stranded in my apartment for three days with my grandmother in the cold and in the dark with no food and water, realizing that nobody was coming to save us — these were the climate disasters we argued about in debate.

I’m going off to college soon, but I wonder how this will affect the rest of my family who have no choice but to live in the south. The conversation has been the same since President Obama: reduce carbon emissions. That’s not it…at least not all of it. How are we going to make infrastructures in the south better prepared for floods? How are we going to hold corporations accountable? Why do people have to suffer for us to learn these lessons?

Michael, New York, 25, writer and labor organizer

The climate disaster defined my life when Hurricane Sandy hit Long Island, my home, in 2012. I was 17 at the time, and it really dawned on me how everything can come to a standstill when we don’t invest in our infrastructure for future climate disasters. Becoming a labor organizer two years ago has helped me better develop these thoughts and feelings, and it helped me want to reach out and do more in my own way.

EF Newsome, Los Angeles, California, 24, coordinator at a record label

I often get frustrated when white people talk on climate change because it’s always them trying to sell you an industry — veganism, bamboo utensils, metal straws — without talking about corporate emissions, returning land to Natives, the fossil fuel industry, and the impact on poor communities.

Katie Robertson, Frederick, Maryland, 18, high-school student

I like to compare climate change to a computer tab at the top of your screen; you’re aware that it’s there, and may keep it open for weeks saying, ‘Oh yeah, I should probably get to that,’ and never do. Up until I was 14 or 15, climate change was this little tab in my brain; I knew it was an issue but didn’t know the magnitude of it all. Especially with the lack of climate education in schools, many students remain unaware of the severity of the state of our planet. I, among others, took our own time to watch documentaries, read articles and scientific papers, along with our good friend Google.

Nina Haug, St. Rose, Louisiana, 26, law student

Living through Hurricane Katrina was a big moment for me — just seeing the city underwater and knowing that probably within my lifetime, much of the area where I grew up would be uninhabitable. Then, when I was in high school, I was put onto corticosteroids for severe asthma. I grew up right by gas and petrochemical refineries in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley.” That point in high school was when I realized that the climate crisis wasn’t something I’d be able to escape by moving away from southern Louisiana. It would live in my body forever. Nearly 10 years later, I was diagnosed with endometriosis, which is also tied to pollution. Even if we somehow miraculously start to address the climate crisis, my health problems, and those of so many other people, won’t go away.

Deeana, 30, U.S.A., sex worker and poet

The Land Back movement brings me hope. Native people’s knowledge of how to sustain the earth’s relationship to human life has been kept and passed on even through many centuries of capitalist colonizers committing genocide. I donate to Native activists and their causes and in general move the capital I can get my hands on into Native people’s lives. I work on my own relationship with my local environment and gardening practices. People are fleeing from the effects of climate change now, but we are going to need people-led food solutions because the government has proven it cannot be counted on to steward our food resources.

Mae, Seattle, Washington, 25, assistant manager at homeless shelter

I feel like I grew up hearing about Greenpeace, saving the whales, polar bears needing ice floes, and how important composting is. In terms of the actual science of climate change — the icebergs melting, the seas rising, and such — I probably became aware of that in middle school. It was several more years before I made the connection between climate change and capitalism/the global economy/imperialism.

I remember trying to explain to my parents a year or two ago how omnipresent and generationally defining climate change feels. I was talking about how I don’t see myself ever having children or retiring because I think the world is going to change so rapidly in the next few decades, and I don’t want to be responsible for raising a child in that world even though I desperately want to be a parent, and I don’t know that there will be a functional world to retire to. I think they understood somewhat, but my dad kept saying that every young generation feels like it’s going to be the last one.

I was, and still am, so angry. […] When I give myself the space to be scared, I’m scared, but it feels so pointless that I don’t usually let it happen. I don’t buy into the personal-responsibility solution to climate change, where, if we all shower every other day instead of daily and bring reusable bags to the grocery store and bike to work once a week instead of driving, everything will be okay. Seeing people around me of all ages radicalize themselves and one another, waking up to the effects of capitalism and imperialism, and asking, ‘What the f**k are politicians even doing for us?’ is what gives me hope. For anything to get better, everything has to change.

Bridges and homes collapsed on Monday as hours of heavy rain fell on the ocean-facing city, swamping streets and sweeping away cars and trees.

Citing the spokesman for the national civil protection agency Faustino Mingues, news agency Angpop said most of the victims were either crushed by debris or electrocuted.

Rubble was scattered along Luanda's streets on Tuesday as residents took stock of the damage, wading through water-drenched patches of land.

Several houses had caved-in roofs and broken down brick walls.

One woman was spotted by an AFP reporter scooping brown water out of the windows of her house with a large plastic bucket.

Heavy downpours are not unusual in Angola during the southwest African country's rainy season.

Forty-one people died and more than 300 homes were destroyed by flooding in January last year, affecting more than 2 000 families.

Similar to an outbreak that happened there last spring, local officials say the clouds of hundreds of billions of locusts are harming the food supply of people there.









Locusts are a collection of short-horned grasshoppers that go through a swarming phase. In great numbers, they can wipe-out crops, harming the food supply needed by people. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, locusts don’t attack humans or animals and there doesn’t seem to be evidence that they carry diseases that could harm humans. Nevertheless, because of their sheer number, it’s difficult to walk outside without getting locusts in your mouth, in your hair, and in your clothes.

This week, Namibia appears to be hit hard. Local elected official Immanuel Shikongo told the newspaper “The Namibian” that many crops have been destroyed there this week. Beyond eating crops that humans eat, they’re also decimating grasses that grazing animals depend on for their feed. In his interview with the newspaper, he said, “I would like to urge our people to yell and burn tyres when they see locusts in their mahangu fields.” Local police have also been using their sirens to help spook the locusts away.

Swarms of locusts impacted Angola earlier this month, Kenya in March, and Somalia in February.











Wet weather could be to blame for the locust outbreaks. Experts believe that tropical cyclones that left portions of the continent wetter than usual in 2018 followed by warmer than usual temperatures in 2019 helped spawn the massive population of locusts that hit eastern Africa, portions of the Middle East, and southeastern Asia last year. In November of last year, Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gati made landfall in Somalia, making it the most powerful tropical cyclone to make landfall there. Scientists believe the moisture left behind by the massive storm helped create the locust problem that exists today.









“At no other point in history have agri-food systems confronted such an array of new and unprecedented threats, including megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats like the COVID-19 pandemic,” FAO said.

“These hazards not only take lives but also devastate agricultural livelihoods and inflict cascading negative economic consequences… that can endure for generations,” it added.

press@usaid.gov

Today, the United States announced more than $95 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the people of South Sudan who are affected by ongoing political conflict and are facing extreme food insecurity, including likely famine. This funding includes more than $52 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and nearly $43 million from the U.S. Department of State. It brings the total U.S. humanitarian assistance to more than $482 million so far in Fiscal Year 2021.

With this new assistance, USAID will help provide emergency food and nutrition assistance, essential healthcare, shelter, safe drinking water, and sanitation and hygiene services to some of the nearly 4 million people impacted. When possible, the Agency procures food from South Sudanese farmers who were able to harvest their crops. This life-saving assistance will also support people who are internally displaced, as well as South Sudanese refugees in host communities in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

South Sudan is facing the highest levels of food insecurity and malnutrition since its independence in 2011. The upcoming May-to-July lean season is expected to be the most severe on record and has the potential to leave more than 7 million people, including more than a million children, in need of food assistance. Recent floods, political instability, and COVID-19 have further exacerbated a dire situation.

The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the South Sudan response efforts, and we remain committed to helping the people of South Sudan. Humanitarian assistance will not solve the conflict, but it is vital to keeping civilians alive. Ultimately, a political solution is the only way to end the suffering of the South Sudanese people.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['95', 'united', 'million', 'food', 'sudan', 'sudanese', 'usaid', 'announces', 'states', 'assistance', 'humanitarian', 'south', 'political']",

When Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted on 18 May 1980, the initial explosion blew sideways, creating a nearly 600-square-kilometer blast zone—and what has become a prized ecological research area. Dozens of groups have tracked life’s reemergence there, one lupine and ladybug at a time. Now, many of those research projects may be endangered. Last month, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), which manages the land, issued a decision to build a road stretching through the heart of the research area to the banks of Spirit Lake, 5 kilometers northeast of the crater. The agency says the road will service a tunnel that drains the lake to prevent a catastrophic flood, a threat to tens of thousands of people in the valley below.

The USFS decision has set off protests from scientists, including a lawsuit aimed at preventing the road’s construction and charges that the agency failed to consult with researchers. “We absolutely recognize the public safety issue,” says John Bishop, a botanist at Washington State University, Vancouver, who has been working for 31 years in the blast zone, designated a national monument in 1982 in part to encourage long-term ecological research. But, he says, “We think we can protect public safety and protect the heart of the monument. We’ve got to do both.”

When the eruption occurred, the north side of the mountain gave way, producing the largest landslide ever recorded. The avalanche of debris rushed into 890-hectare Spirit Lake, raising its water level by 60 meters and damming the lake’s natural outflow. The lake continued to rise, and officials worried it could cause the debris dam to give way, inundating downstream communities and an estimated $3.65 billion in property, including ports on the Columbia River. In 1985, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a 2.25-kilometer tunnel through the debris dam to allow the lake to drain into nearby Coldwater Creek. But seismic activity has repeatedly damaged the tunnel, requiring repairs.

On 16 March, Eric Veach, USFS supervisor for the region, released a “notice of decision” saying “the current risk situation at Spirit Lake is unacceptable and action is required.” The best option, Veach announced, is to build a 5.5-kilometer-long temporary road from an existing road across the blast zone, known as the Pumice Plain, to Spirit Lake. The road will allow the agency to bring in heavy equipment needed to repair the tunnel, replace a damaged gate that regulates the outgoing water flow, and carry out geological drilling studies of the long-term stability of the debris dam.

Carri LeRoy, an ecologist at Evergreen State University, Olympia, isn’t convinced about the urgency. “They argue it’s an emergency,” she says. But she and others say USFS could continue its practice of flying repair equipment in on helicopters to maintain the tunnel. “There is no imminent threat.”

However, the road’s impact on research would be immediate, says Susan Jane Brown, an attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center who filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court of Washington against USFS on behalf of three scientists and four conservation groups. Pumice Plain is home to 992 research plots, investigating how birds, amphibians, insects, and plants recolonized the shattered landscape. “It is a unique opportunity to look at long-term changes after a massive disturbance,” says James Gawel, an environmental chemist at the University of Washington, Tacoma, who has worked on the area since 2005.

The road would cut through 25 of the research plots, and USFS says it will directly affect about 4% of the total research area. But LeRoy calls that “a gross oversimplification.” The road would also cut across at least eight streams formed since the eruption, which drain into Spirit Lake. As a result, it would also impact everything downstream, including the lake, possibly introducing invasive species. “The impact would be massive,” Bishop says. “If you want to study the reestablishment of [native] life, that will be lost.” LeRoy, who studies the evolution of the newly formed streams, agrees: “There will be no point in studying there anymore.”

Veach acknowledges the road would have downsides for science, writing in his decision that the project “reflects a balance between public safety concerns and effects to ongoing research.” USFS considered other options, including a shorter road. But it would have required building a new parking lot for trucks and equipment on the lake, adding to the project’s ecological footprint. It would also have relied more heavily on helicopters and boats to access repair and drilling sites. The road now planned would extend to a staging site used decades ago for tunnel construction.

USFS’s road doesn’t represent a final plan for draining Spirit Lake. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine laid out options for a long-term fix, including adding a second tunnel and carving a large channel through the debris dam. The report emphasized the need to include voices of all stakeholders, such as scientists, government agencies, and downstream residents. With the intermediate USFS plan, scientists lament that they have largely been ignored. In April 2020, USFS had issued a finding that the road would have “no significant impact” on local ecology, prompting letters from scientists. Last month’s decision dismissed those complaints.

“There has been no public assessment of the different options,” Bishop says. He favors continuing to use helicopters to service the tunnel and gate. Gawel agrees: “People fly in drilling equipment to other remote locations all the time. They are building a road only to make it cheap and easy.” But Veach’s decision noted the helicopter option would pose delays for repairs, as well as risks for crews.

It also has a real impact on the health of populations. In Tunisia, for example, 23 beaches were closed in 2020 because their water was unsuitable for swimming. Most of the rubbish in the oceans is dumped by ships.

The GloLitter Partnerships (GLP) programme, launched by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), aims to support partner countries in their plastic waste management policies. This is the case for Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sudan, Tanzania, etc.

A project supported by Norway

In the first phase of the GLP, the IMO, the implementing agency, will review the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities. The organisation will raise awareness among stakeholders in the shipping and fishing sectors and encourage the marking of fishing gear so that it can be traced back to its owner in the event of discards or loss at sea. “Partner countries will also receive tools, such as guidance documents, training materials and strategies, to help them implement existing regulations and communicate with each other, as well as to support them in developing port waste management plans,” says Jose Matheickal, head of the IMO’s Partnerships and Projects Department. The GLP programme is funded by the Norwegian Development Agency (Norad) and is expected to end in 2023.

As part of the GLP, the IMO will also raise awareness of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol) among officials in partner countries. The text provides for a ban on the discharge of plastics (including fishing gear) from ships at sea. In addition, the Protocol to the London Convention, which regulates the dumping of waste from ships and only allows certain types of non-harmful waste, will also need to be respected by partner countries to break the vicious circle of plastic waste pollution in their oceans.

In addition, the GloLitter Partnerships programme will promote the development of a circular economy in the plastic value chain in Africa, notably through recycling.

This may be the result of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), marriage, pregnancy, the cost of school fees, or a combination of these factors. The Orchid Project reports similar findings, although its survey was published last September and the situation may well have worsened since then:

“The impact of COVID is huge,” says Charles Leshore, who formerly worked for a leading Kenyan health NGO that campaigns against FGM/C. He is also a board member at a school in Kajiado, and has seen the negative impacts there and across the county. “COVID and school closures have significantly erased a lot of good work [around FGM/C] and more girls have succumbed to teenage pregnancy, FGM/C, depression and mental health issues.”

The issue goes well beyond Kenya. Judy Gitau, Regional Coordinator for Africa for the NGO Equality Now (whose Africa office is in Nairobi) warns: “Schools are generally safe spaces for girls and those not in school are more vulnerable to human rights violations, including sexual and labor exploitation, human trafficking, female genital mutilation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Schools provide a channel via which violation or threats can be reported and action taken. This pandemic has shut down this key source of safeguarding . . . .”

With a couple of exceptions, this article will not name any other NGOs from this point on to avoid seeming to show favour or disfavour.

Our starting point is that this is an opportune moment to pause and ask whether anti-FGM/C strategies have been working. This will be our main focus, with particular reference to Alternative Rites of Passage (ARP, explained below). One of the authors (Hughes) has researched this subject academically, while Newell-Jones has empirical knowledge of it as a development practitioner. We shall also refer to FGM/C as “the cut”, which is the colloquial expression, at least in East Africa. Efforts to end the practice take many forms, of which ARP is only one.

FGM/C in Kenya: laws and incidence

FGM/C has been outlawed in Kenya since 2001, first under the Children Act 2001 and later under the Prohibition of FGM Act 2011. It was further proscribed (by implication, not by name) in the Constitution of Kenya 2010 (CoK), which banned harmful cultural practices without specifying what these are. Although the CoK upholds rights to culture, it also says that these cannot include harmful cultural practices. Under the 2011 Act, an Anti-FGM Board of Kenya was established, with a remit to spearhead anti-FGM/C efforts nationwide. Despite this legislation, and the efforts of the Board, the practice continues. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 21 per cent of all Kenyan women aged 15 to 49 years have been circumcised. This compares to 38 per cent in 1999; the rate is steadily falling. The incidence is, however, much higher in certain communities, e.g. 94 per cent among the Somali and 78 per cent among the Maasai. Worryingly for campaigners, FGM/C is increasingly becoming medicalised, meaning it is being performed in secret by medical practitioners in a child’s home or in government health facilities. Medicalisation was highlighted in the court case brought by medical doctor Tatu Kamau, which she recently lost. In 2018, UNFPA reported that 20 per cent of FGM/C in Kenya was performed by medical professionals, compared to 77 per cent in Sudan and 12 per cent in Nigeria.

What are Alternative Rites of Passage?

This relatively new approach to tackling FGM/C was developed by NGOs and some communities. It has become increasingly popular in Kenya and Tanzania, and with international donors that fund anti-FGM/C work. At least ten NGOs in Kenya run ARP programmes, or have done so in the past. ARP is only believed to be effective in communities where FGM/C traditionally involved initiation into womanhood, not those in which pre-pubescent girls, even babies, undergo it. This is because NGOs seek to use ARP to replicate girls’ initiation, but without the cut. As Christine Alfons, Founder of SAFE Engage Foundation, explained to us: “ARP is more effective in communities where the cut is done towards the marriage time. In Kuria, girls are cut way back before they are ready for marriage, so we don’t need ARP, it adds nothing and takes many resources.”

ARP is known colloquially as a “ritual without cutting” or “circumcision by words”. There is no standard model, but it usually consists of two parts: a training session or sessions, for girls and sometimes boys, followed by a public graduation ceremony where the participants declare that they have renounced FGM/C. The participants include not only girls and boys but also their parents (though not all parents attend, or even oppose FGM/C), elders, other members of the community, and VIPs who can include police chiefs, teachers, faith leaders, representatives of the county council and the Anti-FGM Board. ARP usually takes place during the school holidays, to coincide with the “cutting season”. Most cutting is carried out in the long school holidays in November-December, April, or July-August with local variations.

ARP was first developed in Kenya by Maendeleo ya Wanawake in collaboration with PATH (Programme for Alternative Technology in Health), in the Tharaka area of Meru in 1996. The few studies on ARP that exist all cite this pioneering work, but without being able to access the original data, and in the absence of follow-up studies, it is difficult to draw conclusive lessons from it. ARP remains highly under-researched, both by scholars and development practitioners, and research access is difficult to negotiate. The Anti-FGM Board acknowledges that more research is needed.

ARP training sessions

The training or educational element of an ARP is arguably much more important than the final ceremony, though media coverage, NGO reports and the Anti-FGM Board pay far less attention to this. For PR purposes, it’s not sexy or eye-catching and nor is it deemed newsworthy.

The training sessions, when combined with longer-term community sensitisation and other measures that form an integrated multi-pronged approach, are vital if attitudes and behaviour are to change. Evidence that they actually achieve those aims, however, is hard to find, largely because no long-term evaluations have been carried out on the educational element. We only know of two NGOs that hold quizzes some months later to test how much children remember about the anti-FGM/C messages. It is difficult to access the training, and requests to see curricula and teaching materials are often declined. The following observations are mostly based on Hughes’s experience of sitting in on training sessions run by two major NGOs that did allow access, where she took verbatim notes with the aid of local translators.

The training sessions usually take up to a week, sometimes two, and often take place in girls’ boarding schools where the girls stay for the duration of the ARP. (If boys are included, they usually stay in boys’ boarding schools nearby.) The curriculum can include: traditional culture (good and bad), harmful practices, the law and FGM/C, health and hygiene, food and nutrition, sexuality and reproductive health (including sexually transmitted diseases), drug abuse, human rights, violence against girls and women, self-esteem, the bible/Christian faith (if the community concerned is Christian), and “good morals”.

ARP graduation ceremonies

These are days of high excitement, celebration and expectation. For the children, it’s a chance to dress up, perform songs and dances, and laugh with their friends. It often starts with a parade to the venue, the girls and boys (if they are involved) striding along carrying NGO-branded banners, singing songs about stopping the cut. Journalists and camera crews are out in force, scrambling for visuals and soundbites. Some parents (not all attend) sit separately, looking slightly baffled as the ceremony unfolds. In some ARP ceremonies, parents publicly declare they will not cut their daughters. Hours of speeches from NGO staff, pastors, elders, health workers, teachers, law enforcers and VIPs have tested most onlookers’ patience by mid-afternoon. The graduates are presented with certificates towards the end of the day: the girls’ certificates confirm their personal commitment to remain “cut free”, the boys’ certificates confirm their commitment to keeping their sisters and future daughters “cut free”. Musical performances by the children, and cultural artistes, are highly entertaining and the poems and songs written and performed by children can be very moving.

What are the challenges and weaknesses of ARP?

Besides those already mentioned, these include:

On the training: There is, from observation, wide disparity in the quality of the teaching, with some trainers (rarely professional teachers, not that this would necessarily be appropriate) clearly unprepared and ill-equipped to teach. Many trainers are outsiders, rather than members of the community concerned, though some NGOs do take care to include “grassroots” people. The mode of delivery can resemble brainwashing, while some of the content jars with the avowed aim of empowering girls to make their own choices about their bodies and future lives. For example, the trainers repeatedly tell girls to “be obedient”, especially to men, parents and elders, yet these are often the very people who want to see the practice continue, and who force girls to undergo FGM/C and child marriage.

The emphasis on obedience, this time to God, is repeated in the lessons about faith, and features throughout the programmes run by faith-based NGOs. (We refer only to Christian NGOs here, and have not studied the approach taken by Muslim ones; there is less uptake of ARP in Muslim communities.) It is drummed into the children that FGM/C is a sinful act, it displeases God, is “the devil’s work”, and so on. Some Christian NGO staff defend this approach on the grounds that faith is a key vehicle for messaging, and that it’s important to point out, to a predominantly Christian audience, that the bible does not condone or even mention FGM/C (though it does endorse male circumcision). Some scholars also see the use of religious discourse as helpful in certain situations, noting how “many participants drew inspiration from the Bible in a way that enabled them to cope and deal with adversity”.

But how can biblical arguments convince non-believers? Furthermore, they encourage people to stop practising FGM/C for biblical rather than, say, health and human rights reasons. Fear of divine retribution for “sinfulness” hardly suggests a sincere change of heart. As a 45-year- old Maasai Pentecostal pastor’s wife who took part in a focus group discussion (mediated by Hughes in a Kajiado village in March 2015) said: “As a Christian I have to obey what the law says. As a good Christian, unless something is against the word of God I will do it. But if it’s clear in the Bible that it’s wrong, I can’t continue [to support FGM/C].” Earlier in the discussion, this woman had said she used to “love” FGM/C before she was “born again”.

Good work to tackle FGM/C is undoubtedly being done by some faith-based NGOs and individual churches but it tends to be undermined by what may be called “fire and brimstone” religiosity. This was very evident at some training sessions we observed. The emphasis was on fearing God, confessing sin, and families being excluded from church if they cut their daughters. Evangelical pastors also lead entire sessions that resemble religious services at some ARP ceremonies. However, both Christianity and Islam believe in the perfection of God’s creation of man and woman, which can lead to powerful anti-FGM/C messages. As one clergyman trainer put it: “What God created in human beings was complete, nothing to be added or subtracted . . . God made us perfectly. So those people who come and cut those parts are doing a wrong thing.”

NGOs say that the lessons on culture and tradition are meant to mimic the instruction that girls traditionally had before or after they were cut. But back in the day, girls were taught by older women to be good wives and mothers, to obey their husbands at all times (even if they beat them), to be sexually submissive, and so on. How does this type of message equip today’s girls to become empowered women, and to challenge gender stereotyping? Clearly, it does not. Hence there is a fundamental contradiction here, for example between lessons on traditional culture and those on children’s and human rights. Girls taking part in ARP told us that they were confused by contradictory messaging.

Good work to tackle FGM/C is undoubtedly being done by some faith-based NGOs and individual churches but it tends to be undermined by what may be called “fire and brimstone” religiosity.

Some scholars have previously noted that telling youngsters that education will bring wealth and high social status is not realistic. We concur. Many of the children we saw in these classes clearly come from very poor families and are highly unlikely to make it past primary school, never mind enter college. Yet a repeated refrain by several trainers was along the lines of, ”if you get educated, you can become a pilot, lawyer or doctor, become an important person like me, travel the world, the sky’s the limit!” This isn’t helpful, and may raise false expectations that will soon be dashed, or leave some girls thinking that the ARP training doesn’t apply to them.

Curiously, the Board’s Guideline for Conducting an Alternative Rite of Passage pays little attention to the education component of ARP, but focuses largely on the final ceremony. It gives no detail of what a recommended curriculum might look like, but simply says the training should centre on sexual reproductive health and rights, and subsumes under this “life skills, awareness of sexual and gender-based violence, children’s rights and essential hygiene”. It adds, “Boys and girls are also taken through traditional values, customs and beliefs that positively impact their response to ARP.” This begs the question: but what if the community’s “cultural stakeholders” (who tend to be older men) favour an entirely different set of values and customs that contradict those of ARP? Moreover, a top-down directive from a national body aligned to government is the very opposite of community ownership, and does not augur well for community buy-in – especially in historically marginalised communities such as the Maasai and Samburu, where fear of and antagonism towards government is entrenched.

Views are divided on the use by some NGOs of shockingly graphic videos showing children, even babies, being cut. We believe these are abusive in themselves, and doubly abuse the children shown undergoing the cut. Community members in Kuria in 2015 declared after watching a video of a girl undergoing a very severe type of cut, “but we do not cut like that, our girls are back playing within two days”. Instead of convincing them to abandon FGM/C, the video seemed to reinforce their belief that the way they themselves perform the cut is not harmful. Some NGO staff defend the use of such videos in order to show the grim reality to children who may otherwise disbelieve it. Says Charles Leshore: “The videos bring reality and deep reflections on what FGM/C is, and its negative impact.”

What parts of the training seem to work best? The use of culturally-specific African proverbs went down well. So did the use of humour. So did lessons in West Pokot given by someone calling herself “Mrs Culture”, who spoke passionately about the blight of FGM/C on her own life; the girls loved her honesty and warmth. Lessons on children’s rights were informative about the constitution and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but were contradicted by repetition of the exhortation to “obey your parents”. Interactive sessions on FGM/C facts and myths were also well received.

On the graduation ceremony: Many NGOs claim, amidst media fanfare, to have “saved” large numbers of girls from FGM/C, simply because they went through an ARP. The Anti-FGM Board itself claims, among its list of key achievements in 2011-14, to have “graduated 10,000 girls through ARP”, which implies that they were “saved”. But NGOs admit that some participating girls have already been cut, and that some girls also attend ARPs several times in succession. Why? Because they are fun events, where girls who may not have much freedom at home get the chance to hang out with their friends, dress up, sing and dance, and eat better food than they get at home. Some ARPs in Kuria have been dubbed “fattening camps” for that reason.

A top-down directive from a national body aligned to government is the very opposite of community ownership and does not augur well for community buy-in.

There are very odd elements in some ARP ceremonies, such as the cutting of a huge iced cake at one in Maasai country, and the presence of some Miss Tourisms in high heels and mini-skirts who were presented as role models for uncut girls. (With great respect to the people concerned, who were obviously sincere, what have scantily-clad beauty queens – which is what Miss Tourisms essentially are – got to do with ending FGM/C and offering realistic role models? Given the widely-held myth that uncut girls are more promiscuous than cut girls, beauty queens in minis and heavy make-up seem to be entirely inappropriate role models.) The day often ends with a free meal, but it was notable, at several ARP ceremonies, that VIPs et al. were served superior refreshments to everyone else in a separate venue.

What relationship does all this have to traditional initiation rites? Very little. The ceremonies include “pick-and-mix notions of pastness, culture, social transformation and tradition . . . incorporated into a hybridised ritual”. Some scholars have questioned whether these rites are not in fact better understood as alternatives to rites of passage, or rites of delayed passage, for “girls who underwent the alternative rites of passage did not feel themselves to be women, nor were they considered women by others”. Some may argue that all this is fine, that the means justify the ends. It would be fine if there was any evidence that they did, if these high-cost events were sustainable, and if there was proof that the whole community fully embraced and endorsed them. Thus far, robust evidence is lacking, and sadly, reports that some girls are still cut even after attending an ARP are common.

On ARP overall: ARP can be highly divisive. The selection processes for girls frequently lack transparency and fail to reach out-of-school girls who are most at risk, and most likely to benefit from engagement. Reports are common of priority being given to the daughters of community leaders. Moreover, the girls are often from one or two schools rather than from across the whole community. From an NGO’s point of view, it is far easier logistically to work with a few schools, and with families whose girls are in school, and who (in some cases) have already decided not to cut their daughters.

In its introduction to the 2018 Guideline, the Board recognises that “such alternative rites were neither accepted by the communities where they were conducted nor held for uncut girls only”. The intention of the Guideline is to ensure “community involvement in the planning and execution of alternative rites of passage, reduce undue costs, give more meaning to the alternative rituals and hold the communities together in the eradication of female genital mutilation”. These intentions highlight some of the significant shortcomings of ARP. Apart from those already mentioned, they also include the fact that ARP tends to be delivered to communities, rather than developed and implemented by them. The external funding often far exceeds what communities could raise themselves, once external funding ends. Such a model is therefore unsustainable. Furthermore, the alternative rituals – though they include traditional elements such as elders’ blessings – are usually newly created and unfamiliar to younger generations and community elders alike.

There are contradictions within the Guideline. In the Foreword, Board chair Agnes Pareiyo states that the aim of ARP is to maintain all traditional culture with the exception of the cut. However, culture is not static (as the March 2021 ruling in the Tatu Kamau legal case made clear), but is an evolving tapestry of beliefs and attitudes linking different aspects of community life. FGM/C is one aspect of culture, which is closely linked to the status, identity, role and life opportunities of girls and women. Abandoning FGM/C needs to be more than just replacing the act of cutting with another ritual. The community awareness and empowerment programme which precedes the ARP ceremony needs to reflect the aspirations of the community, with a strong emphasis on the role and life opportunities of girls and women.

Secondly, there is a contradiction between the attempt on the one hand to harmonise and standardise ARPs by suggesting a set of criteria to be met and steps to follow, while on the other hand encouraging communities to develop and own the process. The Guideline lists things which communities should lead on, but all within a prescriptive framework. This drive for consistency contradicts the guiding principle of being community-led, and is likely to increase the feeling that ARP is externally driven, rather than community owned.

They are fun events, where girls who may not have much freedom at home get the chance to hang out with their friends, dress up, sing and dance, and eat better food than they get at home.

The Guideline recognises ARP as “not a standalone approach but a product of community dialogue and school engagements”. This statement in itself highlights one of the key challenges, namely that the ARP ceremony is seen as the vehicle of change, that somehow the ceremony itself changes beliefs, attitudes and opinions in relation to FGM/C. In section 3.9 the Guideline talks about “a productive ARP that delivers the desired change not only to the girls but also to the community”. There is no evidence that the ARP ceremony itself actually brings about change. At best, the ceremony is a means of consolidating, celebrating and communicating change that has previously taken place as a result of education, awareness-raising and community dialogue. As Seleyian Partoip, Founder of Murua Girl Child Education Program, told us, “We see the ARP ceremony as a way of reducing the stigma against the girls who have not been cut. If we can reduce this stigma then maybe more families will make the move to not cutting their daughters.”

The Guideline describes how the community and its leadership needs to be “fully mobilised” and that this process “may take at least six months” prior to an ARP. It usefully lists community dialogue, capacity building, school outreach programmes and cultural learning and exchange as means of community mobilisation. However, it implies that this process is quite straightforward, whereas in reality this is where the real challenge lies, in encouraging dialogue about the harmful effects of FGM/C and supporting the community in taking the decision to abandon it.

When is ARP likely to be most effective?

The activities which appear to result in attitudinal change in relation to FGM/C are those which take place in communities, regardless of whether the community holds an ARP ceremony. They include awareness-raising and intergenerational dialogue on the direct and indirect impact of FGM/C, the associated sanction and benefits imposed by the community and the links to girls’ education, child marriage, etc. Equally important is the active engagement of the youth in discussing their own aspirations for their future. As Christine Alfons told us, “We are the youth, leading change in our community. The whole community needs to be empowered and mobilised on why to abandon the cutting, as girls alone can’t manage to say no to FGM. And one change needs to lead to others about the roles of men and women in our society.”

Some community organisations in Kenya have developed alternative models of ARP which are proving to be more effective than the model that we, and others, have critiqued. The new models have incorporated some of these features: a steering/planning committee that consists primarily of community members greater involvement of youth in the development, implementation and evaluation of the ARP model; community engagement throughout the year which is holistic, based on dialogue rather than instruction, and involves the whole community; the education/mobilisation programme has a consistent message of empowered decision-making, rather than obedience, and redefines the role, status and life opportunities of girls and women, irrespective of whether they are cut; the ARP ceremony is not introduced until there is sound evidence of change towards the abandonment of FGM/C within the community; resourcing for the ARP ceremony comes from within the community, using resources which would have been used for the traditional cut.

Given the lack of evidence that ARP actually works, more longer-term evaluation and research is needed. The Anti-FGM Board is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of ARPs in Kenya, and its Guideline includes a framework for this. Board representatives often attend ARP ceremonies. In the light of reports of girls still being cut after participating in an ARP, and priority given to girls from more privileged backgrounds, it would be useful if the Board collected and published data on these and other issues.

ARP is being overused in contexts where it is unlikely to succeed, but may be useful in specific contexts when it is community driven and where the community is already changing, and where plenty of mobilisation has already taken place. Most scholars and practitioners agree that community ownership of the process of ending FGM/C is vital to achieving this goal. It follows that ARP should be community owned too, if it is to be continued at all as an anti-FGM/C strategy. Ideally, ARP should be totally community-run without outside intervention; only then will it be sustainable.

Above all, young people themselves need to be more involved in this process. With donor funding being slashed as a result of COVID-19, and the cutting of overseas aid budgets such as that of the UK, the pressure for “magic bullet/quick fix” solutions increases. Reducing gender-based violence, including FGM/C, is likely to remain a priority in the current global climate; however, with reduced budgets it is even more important to ensure funds are spent wisely and approaches like ARP are robustly evaluated and applied only where there is evidence of effectiveness.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210416155651__ARTWORK.jpeg,"['representative', 'choice', 'community', 'kenya', 'arp', 'fgmc', 'ceremony', 'communities', 'ngos', 'female', 'jsc', 'cut', 'girls', 'training', 'lsk', 'crucial']",

In most discussions, the benefits of GERD for Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, and other Nile basin countries have not gotten sufficient attention and coverage. In this article, Belachew C Tesfa highlights the benefits of GERD for all Nile Basin countries and specifically for Egypt and Sudan.

In 2011, Ethiopia began building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project (GERD) on the Blue Nile River, 60 kilometres from the Sudan border.

The reservoir has a storage capacity of 74 billion cubic metres (BCM). The primary objective of GERD is to generate electric power of 5150MW, with an annual average energy production of 15130GWH/year. This will increase power supply in the country as well as for export in the East Africa region. Its power generation capacity made GERD the biggest hydro-dam in Africa.

GERD has become a serious topic of discussion between Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan over the filling of the dam and future water development in the Nile River.

Dozens of international countries including the United States, European Union, and African Union have tried to play the role of a “mediator” in such negotiations.

The world has witnessed many meetings, negotiations, and international bodies’ involvement. In most of the meetings, Egypt and recently Sudan are raising concern in the filling and operation of the dam.

The countries have agreed on most of the issues but few critical points still remain. In most of the articles, the disagreements points are sensationalised and circulated in the media. In all the discussion, the benefits of GERD for Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, and other Nile basin countries have not gotten sufficient attention and coverage. In this article, I am highlighting the benefits of GERD for all Nile Basin countries and specifically for Egypt and Sudan.

Firstly, GERD will be an electricity hub for Nile Basin countries. As per World Bank 2018 data, currently, Africa generates 4 per cent of global electricity from which three–quarters of that is used by South Africa, Egypt, and other countries along the North Africa littoral.

The World Bank also reported only 48 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity. Ten of 11 Nile basin countries are categorised under sub-Saharan Africa.

As it is shown in Fig 1, the electric access between Nile Basin Countries has a massive discrepancy. Egypt has 100 per cent electric access for its citizens followed by Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia with 75 per cent, 60 per cent, 50 per cent, and 45 per cent, respectively.

The power demand of the Nile basin countries has been growing at an average rate of 25 per cent per year during the last five years and the demand forecast for the next five years is estimated to be 32 per cent per annum.

To alleviate this challenge, GERD will play a vital role in providing electric access for Nile Basin countries. GERD will generate electric power with an installed capacity of 5,250MW, with an annual energy production of 15,130 GWH/year, and balance the demand/ supply difference that Ethiopia has been facing as a result of its expanding development.

The power will also be exported to other Nile Basin countries to improve the coverage of the electricity. The GERD will be the hub for clean and renewable energy supply for Ethiopia and other African countries at cheaper prices. In effect, it will be a catalyst for people-to-people relations as well as the trade between the regions.

The availability of electricity in Nile Basin countries will help to develop industries and create jobs for the younger population.

As International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reports, the East and Horn of Africa were the regions with the largest increase in the number of refugees to Europe and Middle East countries.

This is aggravated by climate change and environmental degradation, armed conflict, and political, economic, and food crises. The GERD project will have a major impact on the mitigation of drought and flood management.

It is very obvious that the GERD will allow for regulated and sustainable minimum flow of Nile Basin levels in the dry season. Once the GERD is working with full capacity, the water flow in the Blue Nile will be between 3600 - 3800m3/s throughout the year.

This sustainable and regulated flow will allow for increased agricultural production downstream, ensuring reliable all-season supply to downstream irrigation schemes, thus, reducing harvest losses caused by water shortages during critical growing periods.

Regarding energy and power production, GERD will allow underperforming downstream hydropower schemes to perform more effectively as there will be more reliable sediment-free and regular availability of water throughout the year. Indeed, GERD will benefit Sudan and Egypt immensely by delivering steady water flow throughout the year. GERD will also play a vital role in flood control mainly for Sudan. In 2020, summer recorded Nile Flow with significant damage to Sudan agricultural lands and households, 4.9 BCM stored in GERD helped lessen the catastrophic flooding to Sudan.

It is estimated between 157.2 and 207.2 Million Tonnes of sediment are transported annually from the Ethiopian highlands along the Sobat, Tekeze, and the Blue Nile, which are the main sub-basins of the Nile.

These sediments entail huge costs to Sudan and Egypt –due to reduction in efficiency of hydropower, infrastructure maintenance costs, dredging costs of clogged irrigation channels, etc. That has continued power failures due to the silt accumulation of the turbines at Er Rosaires Dam as announced by the government in official statements.

The sedimentation in the Blue Nile will be reduced by up to 86 per cent when the GERD is working with its full capacity. Reduction of costs for dredging of canals could save about $50 million /year only for Sudan, not to speak of saving in turbine maintenance and replacement costs, ease of gate operation, etc. Sediment management may cost Ethiopia by taking a range of mechanisms to minimise the impact on the dam.

The major techniques could be upstream land management such as planting trees, and avoiding deforestation. These need community mobilisation and awareness. Since Ethiopia reduces the sedimentation, Sudan and Egypt needs to support the mitigation methodology for avoiding sedimentation flooding in Ethiopian highlands.

Water conservation is the other benefit that will be yearning from GERD. The GERD will minimise the evaporation loss from dams located in less favourable downstream desert settings.

It is estimated that 14.3 billion cubic metres (BCM) and 4.7 BCM of water evaporator from the Aswan High Dam and other dams in Sudan annually respectively.

By contrast evaporation loss from the full development of the GERD is likely to be no more than 0.4 BCM. In fact, the development of GERD will encourage the decommissioning of wasteful dams such as Jebel Aulia and reduce the operating level of the Aswan High Dam, and other dams in Sudan.

The best way for ‘Egypt and Sudan is to ‘store’ Nile water in Ethiopian highlands by building more reservoirs, where evaporation rates would be far lower than they are in Lake Nasser behind the Aswan High Dam, in the middle of the desert, which loses two meters every year .

Even the water evaporates in Ethiopian highlands; it forms the cloud and feeds the Nile back in the normal water cycle. But the 14.3 billion cubic meters of water that evaporates at the Aswan dam disappears in the Sahara desert.

In summary, GERD will improve the electric availability for Nile Basin countries. It massively plays vital role in expanding industries in the region and reduce poverty. It will also compact climate change and loss of Nile water in Sahara desert. The benefits of GERD is not limited to power supply, it can benefit the downstream countries mainly Sudan and Egypt by removing up the silt and sedimentation. It will regulate the steady water flow throughout the year and it will also avoid unexpected flooding to Sudan.

Weighing the multi-fold benefits of GERD and considering the future water scarcity challenge, the Nile Basin countries need urgently reaching an agreement to reasonably and equitably share benefits on the Nile Basin. The Nile Basin cooperation would create a stabilising and more transparent atmosphere in the countries that depend on the Nile basin. It would widen the regional corporation, build political stability, and spread confidence in the most important, North and East Africa countries.

65,65,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Sailing the Seas on Reused Plastic - Earth Island Journal,https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/sailing-seas-reused-plastic/,"It is here that a boat called the FlipFlopi sails the crystal waters of the Indian Ocean. The FlipFlopi is a traditional Swahili dhow, a sailing vessel long associated with the Indian Ocean. But this particular boat is different than other dhows. The FlipFlopi is the first Swahili dhow made completely of plastic waste.

I first visited Lamu in 2016. The wild nature, warm sea, and alluring coastal culture caught my heart, but what called me to return many times was my now dear friend Ali Skanda — the master dhow builder who constructed the FlipFlopi, and a man I have come to admire for his effortless courage in creating a world of new possibilities.

Skanda is a ninth generation traditional Swahili dhow builder. He has inherited more than just skills. His ancestors have left him with the confidence to be able to imagine something that has never existed — and build it, bringing it to life. “When I see a piece of tree, I can imagine a chair, or bed …. and I think, I could do this and that. Some people see just firewood. Even with leaves and barks, I can imagine something.”

As waves brought mounds of plastic debris — sandals, water bottles, and other materials — to the beaches of Lamu, Skanda’s dhow building training kicked in. “Because of the problems of pollution taking place today, I feel it necessary to come up with solutions and solve this problem,” he says. Where others saw trash, he saw building materials. And then, he envisioned a dhow — and a way to build on a traditional skill to address Lamu’s present plastic problem. “I had a vision,” he says, that extends beyond what we inherit from our parents. “We need to move ahead, capture other parts from somewhere and add our skills. As the world is growing, we need to grow too.”

In September 2016, as part of this vision, Skanda organized a community beach clean-up and collected tons of discarded plastic. His team took the waste to a local facility to melt and repurpose it into synthesized plastic lumber, which he then used to construct the boat.

The dazzling rainbow dhow made its maiden voyage along the East African coast in 2019. “We started with the aim of awareness first,” says Skanda. The FlipFlopi team has welcomed many on board, with a particular interest in engaging youth. “One of our main goals is to drive this message to the younger generation, so they understand what the world is,” says Skanda. “We have caused problems for them, but they should stop [this problem] as leaders of tomorrow.”

Since 2019, Skanda’s efforts have been recognized by the UN Environment Programme, the World Economic Forum, and international media. While many entrepreneurs propose technological fixes to our ecological crises, Skanda’s dhow shows that the wisdom of yesterday can be part of our sustainable tomorrow, and that innovation can persist in tradition.

The recent successful expedition on Lake Victoria across three countries demonstrated that there is strong will to address the elimination of unnecessary single use plastics across the region as one unified voice. It is estimated that the FlipFlopi has directly engaged over 10,000 people, and 200 million through media campaigning. From fishermen to County Governors to the Queen of Buganda, the call to action was one: it is no longer business as usual! Time for change!

One day, the FlipFlopi aspires to sail the world, bringing beauty and hope to each of us. “The goodness of our life is measured by how we leave our legacy to be remembered after us,” says Skanda. “This is just the starting point, I have a lot vision… Nothing is impossible.”

66,66,FL-2021-000038-KEN,The ties that bind a nation: Unifying narratives to the rescue? - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2021/0415/The-ties-that-bind-a-nation-Unifying-narratives-to-the-rescue,"Political leaders around the world, pressed by a pandemic that demands people think of each other, not just of themselves, are seeing to shore up the old unifying bonds, or to forge new ones. President Joe Biden looks to America’s history to foster a unified national spirit. His challenge is to root that spirit in today’s world.

Those bonds have been fraying for several decades. They have grown thinner, faster, as the internet, smartphones, and social media have nibbled away at shared narratives and created a more atomized landscape where we can each create our individual narratives.

The traditional shared narratives and institutions that used to bind societies together are losing their luster. Prompted by the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to engender a new sense of common purpose.

But Britons switched off in droves. One hundred thousand of them even complained to the BBC. Not because they didn’t like Philip, but because he was just the sort of old-style symbol that used to bind people together, but which no longer play that role.

Once upon a time, it would have raised no eyebrows. When Prince Philip, the Queen of England’s husband, died last week, the airwaves were filled for 36 hours with news coverage and admiring tributes.

It must have seemed simply the right thing to do. When Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died last Friday shortly before his 100th birthday, Britain’s broadcasters tore up their usual schedules. For 36 hours, they filled the airwaves with tributes, special news coverage, and a train of admiring retrospectives.

Yet a huge number of Britons turned off or tuned out. More than a hundred thousand went so far as to contact the BBC to complain.

This wasn’t out of personal animus toward Philip. Something deeper was at work, a trend that’s been developing for decades, not just in Britain, but in America and other countries. It has accelerated in recent years, and has now, with the pandemic, assumed critical importance.

Why We Wrote This The traditional shared narratives and institutions that used to bind societies together are losing their luster. Prompted by the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to engender a new sense of common purpose.

It’s the weakening hold of many of the old institutions, symbols, and traditions – and the shared narratives – that have helped bind people and nations together.

With the pandemic magnifying the need for individuals to care not just for themselves and their families, but for their fellow countrymen and women, political leaders are seeking to shore up these unifying bonds or to forge new ones.

In Britain, Elizabeth still enjoys enormous popular affection. Last spring, when Britain was under lockdown, COVID-19 cases were surging, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson had the virus, it was the queen to whom he turned to bring the nation together. In a rare televised address, she praised frontline workers, comforted the isolated and bereaved, and said, “I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”

In the island nation of New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern drew on the pandemic challenge itself to forge a similar sense of unity, describing her country as a “team of 5 million.”

In the U.S., an early thrust of President Joe Biden’s has been to try to bridge the partisan divide with unifying themes: shared mourning for lives lost, for instance, and a message that harks back to an earlier era in American politics, that “there is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.”

Still, the old bonds have been fraying for a long time.

As news broke of Philip’s death, I was deep into a remarkable 750-page tome on America in the 1950s, the decade in which Elizabeth ascended to the throne.

The book is called “The Fifties.” Written by Pulitzer-winning journalist David Halberstam, it’s full of wonderful pen portraits of figures redolent of that era, from Richard Nixon and Joe McCarthy to Elvis Presley and Hugh Hefner. But the wider story is of a decade very different than it seemed.

Carolyn Kaster/AP/FILE A group of friends play music for passersby under cherry blossoms in Bethesda, Maryland. Shared values and narratives have been losing their influence over society, and in the face of the pandemic, world leaders are seeking to restore frayed bonds.

Yes, he writes, it was a time of growing affluence, a rising middle class, in which “few Americans doubted the essential goodness of their society.”

But not least because of the new impact of television – which initially reinforced a new, suburban vision of the American dream, but soon allowed more discordant narratives to emerge – there were the unmistakable rumblings of the wholesale challenge to accepted verities that would erupt in the ’60s. Also, the first stirrings of dissent and protest around a group then largely excluded from the national narrative: African Americans.

The centrifugal forces have only intensified since. If TV played a key role in the American ’50s, it was a minor tremor compared to the impact in our own century of the internet, smartphones, video streaming, and social media.

Like television, all these were initially expected to bring us closer together. They still can, and in some ways still do. But the shared narrative, the agreed story that we once told ourselves about one another as a community or country, has given way to a more atomized landscape in which we can each create individualized narratives of our own.

All that’s here to stay. But the pandemic has provided a powerful reminder of the importance of a shared story. Those countries that did best at containing the pandemic, such as New Zealand, galvanized a sense of common cause against a common challenge.

In those places that have done worst, like the U.S., appeals to citizens to protect one another as well as themselves by taking precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing have often fallen on deaf ears, with many individuals deciding to chart their own course instead.

Whether a new sense of common purpose will emerge – and if so, whether it lasts – is not yet clear. It’s telling, perhaps, that the most eloquent voices championing that cause have sought inspiration less in the future than the past. In her national TV address Elizabeth recalled how, as a young child, she had delivered a similar message to children separated from their parents by war in 1940.

President Biden, too, has looked to history for examples of a unified nationwide spirit. A few days ago, my old high-school friend David Ignatius wrote about Mr. Biden’s foreign policy in The Washington Post. His words could equally have applied to the president’s broader domestic message. He portrayed the president as “a genial, white-haired guy driving a Ferrari” whose ideas about the world were “rooted in the past.”

But he added, more hopefully, that this attitude was tempered by “a very modern view of the art of the possible.”","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2021/04/0415%20PATTERNS%20Britain_Prince_Philip.1.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['old', 'narratives', 'sense', 'world', 'unifying', 'ties', 'common', 'seeking', 'philip', 'rescue', 'nation', 'bind', 'pandemic', 'shared', 'leaders']",

LONDON, United Kingdom Apr 17 – Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday bid farewell to her late husband, Prince Philip, at a royal funeral like no other, restricted by coronavirus rules but reflecting his long life of military and public service.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who died on April 9 at age 99, was interred in the Royal Vault at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle after a 50-minute service attended by just 30 guests.

The Queen, 94, seen for the first time since his death, was dressed in mourning black, with a white-trimmed, black face mask. Close family, also masked, sat socially distanced in the historic 15th-century Gothic chapel.

Philip — described by royals as “the grandfather of the nation” — was Britain’s longest-serving royal consort and was married to the Queen for 73 years.

He was an almost constant presence at her side during her record-breaking reign that began in 1952 as Britain rebuilt from World War II, and as its global empire began to unravel.

His death, which the family said had left a “huge void” in the Queen’s life, has robbed of her of the man she called her “strength and stay” and closes a remarkable chapter for Britain’s most famous family, and in the country’s history.

The last high-profile funeral of a senior royal was for the Queen’s mother, who died in 2002, aged 101.

But unlike then, when more than one million people thronged outside Westminster Abbey in central London to watch the sombre pageant, the public was noticeably absent from Saturday’s ceremony.

The coronavirus pandemic forced hasty revisions to the well-rehearsed plans for the duke’s death, code-named “Operation Forth Bridge”, stripping back public elements to prevent large crowds from gathering.

Government guidelines limited the number of mourners and a quartet performed hymns the duke chose himself in a barren nave stripped of seating.

– Mark of respect –

The ceremonial funeral from behind the stately castle walls was broadcast live on television to millions across Britain and the world.

Beforehand, a military gun fired to signal a minute’s silence, when his coffin, draped in his standard and topped by a wreath of white roses and lilies from the Queen, his naval cap and ceremonial sword was borne by a bespoke Land Rover hearse he designed himself, arrived at the chapel.

Across Britain — on the streets, in shops, railway stations and at sporting events — people bowed their heads with respect.

Flights in an out of nearby Heathrow Airport were stopped for the duration of the ceremony.

Ieuan Jones, 37, travelled to Windsor from his home in the Welsh capital, Cardiff, and called Philip “a strong man, a true hero (who) did so much for this country and the royal family”.

“It’s really a shame that because of the pandemic we can’t pay a wider tribute to the exceptional man he was,” he told AFP.

Despite the restrictions, the stripped-down sendoff for the former Royal Navy commander still combined centuries of royal protocol with pomp, pageantry — and military precision.

Members of the British armed forces, in formal dress, lined the procession route, heads bowed, as the cortege passed, as a minute gun rang out across the grounds and a bell tolled. Queen Elizabeth II bid farewell to her late husband, Prince Philip, on April 17, 2021 at a royal funeral like no other, restricted by coronavirus rules but reflecting his long life of military and public service.

Philip’s grandsons William, 38, and Harry, 36, joined the procession, in their first public meeting since a reported falling out about Harry’s shock move to California, and his stinging criticism of royal life, including racism in the family.

Harry had to quarantine when he arrived back in Britain for the first time since his move to the United States with his wife, Meghan, last year.

The pair, who as young boys walked behind the coffin of their mother, princess Diana, in 1997, were separated by their cousin, Anne’s son Peter Phillips, 43.

– Last Post –

The religious service was a simple affair, reflecting the wishes of the straight-talking duke, who was known for his aversion to “fuss”.

In keeping with his wishes, there was no sermon, but the service reflected his love of the sea, and long association with the Royal Navy, including hymns and Bible readings.

The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, paid tribute to his “kindness, humour and humanity”, and devotion to the Queen, who turns 95 next week and is in the twilight of her reign.

“We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,” he said.

The Queen, who had been escorted to the chapel by a lady-in-waiting in the royal Bentley, watched from the chapel choir as her husband’s was lowered steadily into the Royal Vault by electric motor.

The Pipe Major of the Royal Regiment of Scotland played a lament, and buglers of the Royal Marines sounded The Last Post.

When the Queen dies, he will be transferred to lie alongside her in the King George VI memorial chapel, which houses the remains of her father, George VI, her mother, also called Elizabeth, and the ashes of her younger sister, Margaret.

– Lasting legacy –

The funeral comes after eight days of public mourning for the duke, which has seen the Union Jack flown at half-mast, and a virtual halt in official government business.

It has also brought renewed focus on the central place of the royals in British life and culture, with the ageing Queen and Prince Philip symbolic of another age.

At Buckingham Palace, the Queen’s central London home, Cardiff-born chef Santosh Singh laid purple tulips to mark the end of an era.

“I love the royals. I think they’re amazing… It’s sad because in time, all this will change,” the 57-year-old said

Pollsters YouGov in March found that while 63 percent of the public supported the monarchy, only 37 percent of those aged 18-24 wanted it to continue.

Of them, 42 percent said they would prefer an elected head of state.

Yet his death commanded a flood of tributes from across Britain and around the world, including from the remote Pacific island of Vanuatu, where he is revered as a god.

One of his lasting legacies will be the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE) scheme for young people, which was set up in 1956 and now operates in more than 140 countries worldwide.

Libor fell for a fourth day to a new record low, dropping almost 1.1 basis points to 0.17288%, the largest one-day decline since March 4. The spread of Libor over overnight index swaps shrank to the least since 2010.

Rates for repurchase agreements, Treasury bills and other short-term dollar borrowing instruments have been driven to zero and below, weighed down by Federal Reserve asset purchases, a shift from bank deposits to money-market funds, and an increase in bank reserves that’s being fueled by a drawdown of the U.S. Treasury’s mammoth cash pile. That in turn is helping weigh on Libor.

While there’s more cash in the system, demand to borrow from commercial-paper markets has also collapsed, which has facilitated the decline. March saw a puzzling surge in three-month AA financial commercial paper issuance, with one day seeing the largest sales since 2014. Libor held steady through March, but has steadily declined in April as supply has collapsed.

“This lack of commercial paper has certainly contributed to the decline in Libor/OIS,” Morgan Stanley strategists including Kelcie Gerson wrote in a client note. The spread fell to around 8.5 basis points on Wednesday.

Despite the Libor/OIS spread being at the tightest level since 2010, the move could still have further to go, according to NatWest Markets.

The spread between three-month Libor and T-bills is at 15.7 basis points, which is “relatively high” in the range of the past year, and can tighten to the November lows of around 12 basis points, NatWest’s head of U.S. rates strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a client note.

The drop in Libor prompted a flurry of activity across June 2021 eurodollar futures, with immediate buying of 20,000 contracts after the fix. The contract closed at 99.815, implying a three-month fix at 0.185% -- around one basis point higher than the current level.

The Cherifian kingdom produces 1.5 million tonnes of industrial waste each year, of which about 350,000 tonnes are identified as hazardous. According to the Moroccan authorities, only 23% of this waste is recycled in the kingdom, yet it is very harmful to humans and the environment.

The General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (TTA) and five associations representing investors in the Tangier Export Processing Zone, the industrial zones of Gzenaya, Mghogha and Al Majd, as well as the Tangier Automotive City free zone, want to improve industrial waste management in Morocco. On April 15th, 2021, these key players in the Moroccan economy launched studies for the recovery of industrial waste in the Kingdom.

Initially, the waste management project will be deployed in Tangier, the second largest economic hub in Morocco after the city of Casablanca. The initiative, implemented by a specialised international office, will make it possible to define the best model for managing this type of waste for the city of Tangier. This model can then be applied to other cities in Morocco. The studies, which will last four months, will also promote the development of a circular economy around industrial waste, thus creating employment opportunities for young Moroccans.

IFC funding

The studies on industrial waste management in Tangier are being financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group responsible for financing the private sector. The results of the investigations will also be used by waste management companies, such as Suez, that wish to invest or set up in Morocco. In this North African kingdom, the French group manages the waste produced in the factories of car manufacturers PSA and Renault.

In March 2021, the local subsidiary of the French environmental giant Suez Maroc also won the contract to manage the waste of the Moroccan Tobacco Company (SMT). This new contract will run for two years.

You either think reality TV shows on Bravo are absolute trash or you believe the cast of “Real Housewives of Potomac” deserve all the Emmy Awards.

If you fall into the latter group, then you know just how different each “Housewives” franchise can be.

Sure, each show follows the same premise -- a group of wealthy women who run in the same social circles, arguing and throwing shade for our entertainment; but as the years have gone on, some franchises remain top tier, while others have fizzled out completely.

And while the Bravo network has other fantastic TV shows, such as the “Below Deck” franchise, “Summer House,” “Top Chef” and “Vanderpump Rules,” nothing can beat “The Real Housewives.”

Plus, the shows are now being filmed during the pandemic, so that’s added a whole other layer to the show.

Just a few weeks go, the flagship “Housewives” show, “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” turned 15 years old.

Ad

So, in honor of 15 years of back-stabbing, wine-throwing and iconic one-liners (”who gon’ check me, boo?”) let’s rank the “Housewives” from worst to best, based from their most current season.

‘Real Housewives of Orange County’

After watching the latest season of the original franchise, this show is most in need of a cast shake-up.

That partially could be because the show has been on the air for the past 15 years. The last original cast member of the show, Vicki Gunvalson, left last year, and the rest of the cast has only been around for the past few seasons, so it’s not as if the cast is stale. It’s more or less that they are just boring.

It’s hard to relate to Shannon Beador’s constant whining and anxiety, Braunwyn Windham-Burke is a borderline narcissist and it’s not fun to watch anti-masker Kelly Dodd disregard COVID-19 protocols in the middle of a pandemic.

Andy Cohen, an executive producer of “Housewives” and the host of Bravo’s late-night show, “Watch What Happens Live,” said there would be a cast shake-up for next season, so let’s hope the production cleans house and starts with something fresh.

‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’

If this list was made five years ago, the ladies of “Beverly Hills” would be in the top three, without a doubt.

But lately? Not so much.

“Beverly Hills” was known for having top-tier drama and laughs, but over the past few seasons, the women have become a little too self-aware. They’re more concerned about serving a high-fashion look, complete with flawless makeup and hair, than rolling up their sleeves and throwing a glass of wine in someone’s face.

Part of the problem can be traced to Erika Girardi.

Girardi ushered in the concept of having a “glam squad.” She started bringing a team of makeup artists, hair stylists and creative directors to plan out her outfits for cast vacations. Now, all of the women have a glam squad, and it’s starting to take away from the “real” part of the show that so many of us tune in for. It seems like the cast is too concerned with looking glamorous -- and they’re afraid to let their hair down and be their fun selves (who we know they can be).

Ad

The addition of actress Denise Richards was a step in the right direction, but the cast tried to paint Richards as a villain this past season, and fans didn’t go along with it. Richards left the show and it was kind of a bummer.

The upcoming season has some new faces, including cast member Kyle Richards’ sister Kathy Hilton (aka Paris Hilton’s mom), and given the drama Richards has had with her other sister, Kim, who used to be on the show, we could be in for a strong season.

The trailer for the new season does look really good, but fans said the same thing about last season’s trailer and were immediately disappointed.

‘Real Housewives of Dallas’

The ladies from Dallas never really took off in the way that Bravo had probably hoped, and that’s a shame since it is the perfect kind of city to have a “Housewives” franchise.

The show has had a few iconic moments (former castmate LeeAnne Locken’s “they’re just hands” monologue comes to mind), but this past season, which is almost done, hasn’t had any memorable examples, and the fights have come off as petty and mean.

Ad

There is hope, though.

New cast member Tiffany Moon has been a breath of fresh air. She’s an accomplished doctor, and her parents are Chinese immigrants. Watching her share her story of being a first-generation immigrant has been incredible to watch, and something we rarely see on “Housewives” since the casts are so often white.

If “Dallas” does a shake-up of the cast next season and keeps Moon and some of the other women, the show has potential to move up in the ranks.

‘Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’

When Bravo announced at the end of 2019 that there would be a new “Housewives” franchise set in Salt Lake City, the general consensus was a big fat yawn.

Mormons? Really?

But after the show premiered in late 2020, the fandom quickly learned just how wrong that was.

Surprisingly, there is only one practicing Mormon in the entire cast. Instead, we got two ex-Mormons who shared their struggle of leaving the church, a Jewish woman going through a separation from her husband, a Togan woman who switched from being Mormon to Islam and the First Lady of a Pentecostal Church who is married to her step-grandfather.

Ad

And no, that last part is not made up.

With such a diverse cast, the ladies of “Salt Lake City” fully delivered for fans, and probably gave Bravo the best premiere season of a “Housewives” franchise, ever. The only reason it’s not higher on the list is that the middle of the season slowed down a bit, but it certainly ended on a high note.

And thanks to recent news, season two could launch it to the top of the list. Jen Shah, arguably the cast member who most of the drama stirs around, was recently arrested and charged for wire fraud and running a fraudulent telemarketing scheme. Shah was allegedly filming the show the day she was arrested, and apparently, will continue to film while out on bond.

The news exploded in the Bravo fandom, so expect “Salt Lake City” to be ratings gold next season as fans want to see Shah’s legal troubles unfold.

Get the popcorn ready, folks.

‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’

For being around for so long, the “Atlanta” cast has consistently been good, which is hard to do when it’s been on the air for more than a decade.

Ad

The show obviously is not as good as it once was in the early seasons, but considering that the core cast of Kandi Buress, Porsha Williams, Kenya Moore and Cynthia Bailey is still interesting to watch? That says a lot.

The current season is almost over, and we’ve gotten some pretty hilarious moments, including an episode that will forever go down in “Housewives” history, featuring a bachelorette party and a male stripper named Bolo.

This season also gets bonus points for featuring the cast’s participation in the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, especially with Williams, who was arrested for protesting the death of Breonna Taylor.

“Atlanta” is probably due for a cast shake-up pretty soon, but if anything, we’ve learned that it’s still fun watching these cast members who have been established on the show for so long.

‘Real Housewives of New Jersey’

The best part of the “New Jersey” cast is that it is a true family ensemble, resembling a real-life soap opera in the best way possible. That’s what made the first few seasons of the show so good -- is that the entire cast felt like family, and that was partially due to the fact that it’s true.

Ad

The seasons before and after Teresa Giudice went to prison were lagging, but the show has had the same six cast members for the past three seasons alone, something that is practically unheard of in “Housewives” casts.

The women love and fight each other like sisters (emphasis on the “fight” this season) and their husbands are equally close.

Depending on the franchise, the husbands are involved at times, but mostly just for the wives to chat with.

But on “Jersey,” the husbands are fully involved in the drama, especially Joe Gorga, the husband of cast member Melissa Gorga, and Giudice’s brother.

The drama this season has been next-level, and the only critique there has been is that Giudice may need to go soon. She’s been the main character since the show premiered -- and easily put the “Housewives” on the map with her infamous table flip in the first season.

However, her antics have gotten pretty old.

Ad

Regardless, “New Jersey” feels like the show that it used to be when it first premiered more than a decade ago.

‘Real Housewives of New York City’

When we talk about the different franchises being different styles of shows, the “New York City” series could be described as a comedy.

Make no mistake, there are certainly some epic fights on “New York City” that have gone down in “Housewives” history, but these New Yorkers are genuinely hilarious, whether they know it or not.

You’re got Sonja Morgan, probably the most sexually liberated Housewife of all the franchises, who is a gas to watch; the totally oblivious former-Countess-turned-Cabaret-star Luann de Lesseps; the willfully delusional yet still hilarious Ramona Singer, and Dorinda Medley, who is known for her zingy one-liners.

Newcomer Leah McSweeney was added to last year’s season, and she was a breath of fresh air too, giving these women of a certain age something to talk about.

Ad

Like the “Atlanta” cast, the “New York City” ladies have had the same core cast for years now, and the show has been reliably good, season over season. Fans were nervous when Bethenny Frankel, arguably the most famous “Housewife” of them all, left “New York” a few seasons back, but the show still remains top-tier.

Sadly, Medley won’t be back for the new season (she was let go, but could return later) when it premieres, but the show is adding its first-ever Black cast member, something that has been long overdue.

‘The Real Housewives of Potomac’

There is a new supreme in the Bravo world, and it’s the ladies of a small town outside of Washington D.C. called Potomac.

The “Potomac” franchise has only been around for five seasons, but it’s gone on to show that the idea of a “Housewives” franchise can still be fresh and entertaining, even after being around for more than a decade.

The key to “Potomac’s” success is having a reliable and relatable cast, epic drama and hilarious antics. Their latest season was truly one for the books, with most of the drama circling around a fight between cast members Monique Samuels and Candiace Bassett that turned physical.

Ad

“Housewives” arguments normally never turn physical, but this one did, and it opened up a larger conversation about how we treat others, how to deal with anger and it taught each of the cast members a lesson.

Fans often slept on the ladies of “Potomac” during their first few seasons, but when word got around that an epic fight was going to go down, many (including this writer) jumped on the bandwagon to see if the hype was real, and reader, it certainly was.

It will be interesting to see if the cast can keep the momentum going, especially since Samuels has said she won’t return for a new season, but given just how close this cast is, it won’t be surprising to see that they bring it again.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ksat.com/resizer/ZT5FU1Of2Chx3Gqch7oCcspp1dk=/800x532/smart/filters:format(jpeg):strip_exif(true):strip_icc(true):no_upscale(true):quality(65):fill(FFF)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/O5QDNTP33VHB3GUP4UABIBN2RY.jpg,"['city', 'season', 'real', 'franchise', 'ranking', 'drama', 'seasons', 'worst', 'franchises', 'cast', 'york', 'bravo', 'best', 'housewives']",

The start-up plans to enter new markets by June 2021, including the United States, Canada and Great Britain.

Uganda is one of the largest banana producers in the world. “After harvesting, banana stems are usually thrown away as waste. We have developed technologies for extracting the banana fibre and applying it to the production of high-quality banana fibre textiles and handicrafts,” says TexFad.

An asset for environmental preservation

In addition to mats for the home, the young Ugandan company also offers eco-friendly hair extensions, especially for women. “These beauty accessories are 100% natural. Once used, the extensions can be safely disposed of in nature. They will later become manure, thus helping to heal the soil,” explains Kimani Muturi, the founder of TexFad. He believes that in the coming years, banana fibres could, to some extent, be used to make paper products such as banknotes.

To date, the Ugandan start-up has 23 employees. Green Bio Energy, a French company based in the Ugandan capital Kampala, developed a technique in 2011 to replace charcoal with environmentally friendly charcoal made from banana tree waste . This fuel comes in the form of small cylinders stored in large boxes like pallets bretons. The innovation has given Uganda a breakthrough in the fight against deforestation and air pollution. Green Bio Energy has a factory in the capital Kampala, capable of producing two tonnes of green charcoal per day.

By Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, Emelie Chace-Donahue and Colin P. Clarke*

(FPRI) — When Islamist insurgents laid siege to the coastal town of Palma in gas-rich northeastern Mozambique on March 24, leaving dozens dead, including several foreigners, the story received international attention. The insurgency in Mozambique is being waged by a group that calls itself al-Shabaab—not to be confused with the Somali group of the same name—and is affiliated with the Islamic State’s (ISIS) Central Africa Province. Despite the recent flood of attention al-Shabaab in Mozambique has received, the insurgency is not new.

A local religious group called Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa (ASWJ) turned toward militancy around 2015, eventually renaming itself (in whole or in part) al-Shabaab. The militant group has engaged in insurgent fighting against Mozambique’s government since late 2017. Al-Shabaab has not been particularly outspoken about the goals of its insurgency, but it has articulated a desire to establish rule by a hardline version of Islamic law in Cabo Delgado. The group’s aims appear to center on undermining and degrading the Mozambican government’s military and political authority, gaining local support, and combating foreign interests in Cabo Delgado.

Religious and ethnic tensions, alongside poor regional economic conditions, are also reportedly prominent factors motivating the violence. The militants are believed by local leaders and community members to be primarily “disaffected youth motivated by complex political, economic, and social factors including feelings of marginalization and disagreements with religious authorities in Cabo Delgado,” according to the most recent U.S. Department of State Report on International Religious Freedom.

Mozambique is a Christian-majority country, but around 18% of citizens are Muslim, primarily residing in the north, including in Cabo Delgado province, where most of the violence has occurred. Fundamentalist forms of Islam have spread in the country over the past several decades and have largely been at odds with local political and religious authorities. Additionally, the Mwani ethnic group—a Muslim-majority ethnic group that has a large presence in Cabo Delgado—has long viewed itself as politically and economically marginalized by the Christian-majority Makonde ethnic group in the region. These religious and ethnic tensions have converged with low levels of economic opportunity in Cabo Delgado, which is considered one of the poorest regions in Mozambique.

Origins of Militant Activity in Mozambique

Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa was founded by Mozambican and Tanzanian religious leaders with links to Salafist circles in Tanzania, Kenya, and Somalia. Various local sources say the group’s early leadership included locals who studied religious doctrine and received military training in Tanzania, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia.

Early Influences and Recruitment. Accounts from locals note that one of ASWJ’s early influences was the teaching of Aboud Rogo Mohammed, an extremist cleric from Kenya designated by the United Nations for providing support to Somalia’s al-Shabaab. Rogo was killed in Kenya in 2012, but his influence lives on. ASWJ’s leaders reportedly gave lectures inspired by Rogo and distributed videos of his speeches, along with other militant propaganda. Some members of Mozambique’s al-Shabaab were followers of Rogo in Kenya who resettled in Mozambique after his death.

ASWJ’s leaders appear to have originally recruited poor or unemployed youth by offering them small loans. Recruits could invest their loans in any sector, including the illicit economy, to help them build wealth through business opportunities. ASWJ leaders were likely able to lure recruits into these business ventures by capitalizing on both “long-standing feelings of marginalization” and “issues of youth unemployment and poverty.”

Transition to Militancy. ASWJ began its transition toward militancy by mobilizing in mosques against established religious leaders, a pattern that can be discerned elsewhere in militant Salafist social mobilizations. ASWJ members reportedly began causing disruptions at mosques, criticizing local Muslims for not adequately abiding by Islamic law. Some members reportedly threatened to kill local religious leaders.

After these confrontations with local religious leaders, the group began to shift from a religious organization to a militant group. Around 2015, ASWJ leaders began setting up training camps in northern districts of Cabo Delgado and created a decision-making council that was reportedly responsible for crafting military strategy. Locals interviewed by the Mozambique-based Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Económicos say that the group began recruiting youth from Tanzania and the Great Lakes region. These foreign recruits trained locals in military techniques.

October 2017 marked ASWJ’s transition to being an overtly militant group. It launched a series of attacks against police posts, killing two officers and briefly overrunning the strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia. In the following months, the militants carried out arson attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado that killed and wounded several civilians. Locals reported that some members of the group sold off their stock and businesses around this time (much of which had been built using loans from ASWJ leaders) and left their homes to travel to Mocimboa da Praia. The group likely began referring to itself as al-Shabaab at this point. There are no indications that Mozambique’s al-Shabaab is affiliated with Somali militant group of the same name, but there have been some suggestions of a connection between militants in Mozambique and Somalia. For example, some locals reported that children who were members of the Mozambican group disappeared for several months leading up to the October 2017 attacks, traveling to Somalia during this period to “participate in jihad” and study the Islamic faith.

Escalation of the al-Shabaab Insurgency in Mozambique

Since its turn to overt militancy in 2017, al-Shabaab has grown into an established insurgency, in some places openly controlling territory.

Nascent Insurgency. The group operated as a nascent insurgency in Cabo Delgado through 2018. It carried out intermittent small-scale operations, an estimated 120 incidents that killed 38 people between January and November 2018. This initial phase of insurgency represented a building period.

The following year, al-Shabaab intensified the scale and scope of its operations, carrying out more than 150 attacks that killed over 450 people during the same reporting period. The reasons for the escalation in 2019 are not clear, but there are indications that the group began organizing with ISIS-linked militants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) around this time.

At the beginning of 2019, news reports began to suggest that al-Shabaab was organizing training and operations with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant group that has been waging a decades-long insurgency in eastern DRC and Uganda. Mozambican authorities arrested several Ugandan militants (likely associated with ADF) who were suspected of involvement in attacks in Cabo Delgado. A few months later, in March 2019, regional news outlets reported that an ADF offshoot, Madinat Tawhid-wa-l-Muwahidin (MTM), had opened a cell in northern Mozambique.

Affiliation with ISIS. Clear indications of al-Shabaab and ADF’s affiliation with ISIS emerged around this time, though murkier indications of a connection between the two groups and ISIS had already surfaced in 2017-18, primarily in online forums and jihadist propaganda. In April 2019, ISIS announced the formation of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) after claiming responsibility for an attack launched by ADF militants in the DRC. Not long after, in June 2019, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack perpetrated by al-Shabaab in Mozambique, thus formally incorporating al-Shabaab into ISCAP.

There remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the role being played by foreign ISIS actors in Mozambique and the DRC. However, it is clear that since becoming integrated into ISCAP, al-Shabaab has significantly stepped up its operations and has begun to overtake and control territory. In August 2020, it captured Mocimboa da Praia, where it has continued to exert control. Al-Shabaab’s attacks have also become increasingly frequent and brutal, often displaying trademark ISIS tactics like beheadings. Between January and November 2020, the group was responsible for over 400 violent incidents that left more than 1,300 people dead. This is a substantial increase compared to the same reporting period in previous years. Al-Shabaab’s assault against the city of Palma in March/April 2021 shows that the militant threat is enduring, and it seems, growing more dire by the week.

Al-Shabaab also has likely grown in size since becoming affiliated with ISIS. Though many members are local Mozambicans and Tanzanians, the group also includes foreign elements, which likely include foreigners who traveled to fight with the group, as well as those who resettled in Mozambique looking for work. For the most part, the group’s foreign members come from Somalia and the Great Lakes region. Some reports have claimed that individuals from the Middle East and South Asia are present as well, but local sources have mainly reported that the fighters speak local languages.

Factors Hospitable to Insurgency

Whether al-Shabaab in Mozambique will sustain its operational tempo remains to be seen, but several factors suggest that the conditions in Mozambique are favorable to a prolonged insurgency, including geography and terrain and weak security forces.

Geography & Terrain. Mozambique is located on the southeastern coast of Africa, and Cabo Delgado is its northernmost province, bordering Tanzania. Forests and islands in Cabo Delgado offer valuable opportunities to an insurgency. The region is covered by dense forests and shrublands, which have provided the militants cover from counterterrorism operations and air raids. One media outlet reported that local residents who had been abducted by militants and later escaped described the base where they had been held as “located amid vegetation so dense that the place is always dark, necessitating the permanent use of lamps and lanterns, even during the day.” Cabo Delgado’s islands, many of which are thinly inhabited or even uninhabited, have reportedly served as training bases and points from which the militants can strategically position themselves against security forces.

Counterterrorism & Security Forces. The Mozambique Defense and Security Forces are largely incapable of countering the insurgency, lacking both adequate resources and the capabilities to contain militant activity or protect civilians. Given these deficiencies, the government of Mozambique has contracted private military companies—Wagner Group (Russia) and Dyck Advisory Group (South Africa)—to provide paramilitary assistance, including aerial support. Self-defense militias have also reportedly tried to protect civilians. After the Palma siege, the African Union called for “urgent action” to quell the fighting.

Conclusion

Though much foreign interest in Mozambique is centered around Cabo Delgado’s natural resources, outside interest also focuses on regional stability and spillover violence. The South Africa Development Community, an inter-governmental organization of countries in the Southern Africa region (including Mozambique), called for regional action on Mozambique last year since the insurgency poses “a serious threat to regional peace and stability.” In September 2020, Mozambique asked the European Union for military training and other assistance.

At various points, the insurgents have targeted contractors associated with liquefied natural gas projects, and have moved in recent months to close in on areas where these companies operate. There is the potential for foreign involvement, especially after recent attacks, and the United States has roughly a dozen Green Berets in country to train the Mozambican security forces. There is the possibility for a prolonged insurgency that could draw foreign fighters to the region, with the potential to spread into neighboring countries.

The fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man named Daunte Wright by a White police officer outside Minneapolis has prompted protests and clashes with law enforcement.

Wright was killed by Officer Kim Potter during a routine traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, according to police.

Potter has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, according to a news release from Washington County Attorney Pete Orput’s office.

The shooting and the demonstrations occurred about 10 miles from the Minneapolis courtroom where former officer Derek Chauvin is on trial in the death of George Floyd last year.

The killing Sunday was at least the third high-profile death of a Black man during a police encounter in the Minneapolis area in the past five years, after the shooting of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights in 2016 and the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.

Here is what we know about Potter:

Former chief: Shooting was accidental

Former Police Chief Tim Gannon, who submitted his resignation Tuesday, said the portion of body-worn camera footage released Monday led him to believe the shooting was accidental and that the officer’s actions before the shooting were consistent with the department’s training on Tasers.

Gannon said “the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser, but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet.” The fatal shooting appeared to be “an accidental discharge,” he said.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension examined Potter’s duty belt and found her handgun is holstered on the right side of her belt, while the Taser is on the left side, according to a news release from Orput’s office.

Citing a criminal complaint, the release said the Taser is yellow with a black grip and is set in a straight-draw position, “meaning Potter would have to use her left hand to pull the Taser out of its holster.”

She is a 26-year police veteran

Potter, 48, was with the Brooklyn Center Police Department for 26 years, according to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. She joined the department in 1995, according to the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis.

She served as the police union’s president in 2019, had been on the department’s negotiation team and worked as field training officer, the Tribune reported.

She was placed on administrative leave after Sunday’s shooting.

The BCA said additional personnel information is not public under state law during the investigation of the shooting.

A county attorney’s report states this was not Potter’s first time dealing with the aftermath of a police officer shooting someone. In 2019, police fatally shot a man who was threatening his grandfather with a knife and hammer. The use of deadly force by police in that incident was ruled lawful, the report states.

In accordance with Brooklyn Center Police Department policies, Potter — who not present at the time of the shooting — gave instructions to the two officers involved in the shooting to get into different police cars, turn off their body cameras and not speak to each other.

Potter was not accused of any wrongdoing in this instance.

She submitted a resignation letter

Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told CNN on Tuesday that Potter submitted a letter of resignation.

In a letter to Elliott, acting City Manager Reggie Edwards and then Gannon, Potter wrote that she “loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability.”

Elliott said Potter decided on her own to resign. “We did not ask her to resign. That was a decision she made,” he said.

At a news conference by Elliott, people in the room voiced concerns that Potter resigned and was not fired. The mayor said he has “not accepted her resignation” and that his office is continuing to review the matter.

“We’re doing our internal process to make sure that we are being accountable to the steps that we need to take,” Elliott told reporters.

Potter is still entitled to benefits following her resignation, though it is not clear what those benefits are, Edwards said Wednesday.

Potter attorney also represents officer in Floyd case

Earl Gray, a St. Paul-based attorney, told CNN he is representing Potter.

Gray is also the attorney for Thomas Lane, one of the four officers involved in Floyd’s death who faces criminal charges. He was also a defense attorney for Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer who was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Castile.

Gray on Monday said he had no further comment on the shooting.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2021/04/9EN95T2U-210413155606-02-officer-kim-potter-file-live-video.jpg,"['according', 'resignation', 'minnesota', 'fatally', 'kim', 'daunte', 'elliott', 'attorney', 'wright', 'minneapolis', 'know', 'heres', 'shooting', 'officer', 'potter', 'shot', 'taser']",

MINNEAPOLIS, April 19 (Reuters) - Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill began instructing jurors on Monday before they heard closing arguments and begin deliberating on whether the way former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of a dying George Floyd in last year's arrest was murder.

Prosecutors have told the jury they are weighing the guilt of only one man, but their verdict will nonetheless be widely seen as a reckoning in the way the United States polices Black people.

Chauvin, who is white, pushed his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, outside the grocery store that had accused Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.

A bystander's video of Floyd begging for his life before falling limp scandalized people around the world. An image of Floyd's face has since been elevated to an icon for the largest protest movement in the United States in decades.

The Hennepin County chief medical examiner ruled Floyd's death a homicide at the hands of the police.

Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office say Chauvin used unreasonable, and therefore illegal, force in compressing Floyd's neck and torso against the road in a way that starved him of oxygen.

Chauvin's lawyers argued that he correctly followed the training he received over 19 years with the Minneapolis Police Department, which fired him the day after Floyd's arrest, and sought to raise doubts about the cause of Floyd's death.

The judge defined some important terms for the jurors in the charges before them, such as ""great bodily harm"" and ""cause of death.""

""The fact that other causes contributed to the death does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability,"" Cahill said, reading from written jury instructions, copies of which were also provided to jurors.

National news networks carried live broadcasts of much of the testimony after the first of more than 40 witnesses took the stand three weeks ago, though the coverage was sometimes interrupted by fresh episodes of police violence caught on camera.

The closest instance occurred just a few miles from the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis when a white police officer fatally shot a Black motorist, Daunte Wright, on April 11 in the suburb of Brooklyn Center after trying to arrest him on the belief he had missed a court appearance. The officer, Kimberly Potter, had meant to use her Taser to stop him driving away but pulled out the wrong weapon, police say. She has been charged with manslaughter.

As angry protests swelled, Minneapolis and state officials have ramped up security precautions in the city. The tower in which the courtroom sits is ringed by barbed wire, high barriers and armed soldiers from the National Guard, and nearby businesses have boarded up their windows. Giant drab-colored military vehicles have become a common sight in city streets.

Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree ""depraved mind"" murder and second-degree manslaughter. He waived his right to testify before the jurors.

For the second-degree murder charge, 12 jurors will have to agree that prosecutors proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin committed a felony, in this case assault, that was a substantial cause in Floyd's death. They do not have to find that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd.

That crime carries a punishment of up to 40 years in prison, although Minnesota sentencing guidelines call for a shorter sentence of up to 15 years for someone such as Chauvin with no prior convictions.

Prosecutors have asked Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill to depart from those guidelines and give Chauvin more time if convicted.

If the jury delivers a guilty verdict, they will then be asked whether they agree with prosecutors that there were so-called aggravating factors in the crime, including the fact that it unfolded in view of several children on the sidewalk, including a 9-year-old girl who was the youngest witness to testify.

The jury, along with two alternates, is comprised of six white women, two white men, three Black men, one Black woman and two multiracial women, according to court records. Once they receive the case, they will be sequestered in a hotel outside of deliberation hours.

The Grammy-nominated boy band's meal will launch starting next month in nearly 50 countries, including South Korea, McDonald's said in a statement on Monday, and will include chicken McNuggets, fries, and two dips.

The burger chain has seen its revenue outside the United States drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company is tapping on promotional campaigns through celebrity endorsements and limited-time menu items to get customers back into restaurants as economies reopen with the roll-out of vaccines.

The BTS meal follows similar U.S.-only deals with singers J Balvin and Travis Scott, which McDonald's says boosted sales in the later half of last year.

The spike in demand during the Travis Scott promotion caused the company to temporarily run short of ingredients to assemble its signature Quarter Pounder burgers at some restaurants.

In a much-hyped boxing bout, ‘The Problem Child’ improved to 3-0 as a professional and sent out an emphatic statement as he stopped his vastly experienced opponent inside two minutes of the first round.

Askren saw his defences opened up by a left jab and was then hit flush with a crunching overhand right that sent him sprawling to the canvas.

‘Funky’ took the eight count and wanted to continue, but the referee deemed him in no fit state to do so.

On the undercard, Regis Prograis beat Ivan Redkach on a technical decision after a bizarre end to their fight in which the Ukrainian was stretchered out of the ring.

Steve Cunningham also defeated former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir and there were wins for billionaire London businessman Joe Fournier as well as undefeated prospects Quinton Randall and Junior Younan.

She was recently listed as the 21st oldest person in the UK.

Dottie, as she was known, was born on October 5, 1911, in London, but her family later moved to Yorkshire where she met her husband John.

After the end of World War 2 the couple went to East Africa as missionaries, spending ten years in Tanzania and 16 years in Kenya. They spent their retirement years in Seaford.

Home-maker

Daughter Glenys Dean said that her mother was a home-maker, loved having visitors, was a needlewoman, wonderful cook and gardener. She had many stories to tell about life in Africa.

Dottie was 106 when she went into Temple Grove care home at Herons Ghyll, near Uckfield.

Glenys said: “She received care second to none from wonderful nurses/carers. We could not have chosen a better place for her to spend the last years of her very long life.”

Dottie was totally unaware of the pandemic and she was able to receive occasional visits from her family outside periods of lockdown.

Cards from the Queen

Glenys was with her as she celebrated her 109th birthday when she received her sixth card from the Queen. Dottie had received them previously when she was 100, 105, 106, 107 and 108.

Glenys said that she and her brother Stephen grew up in Africa. She remembered the excitement of food being delivered in boxes once a month.

There was no running water, no electricity – and there was always the possibility of arriving home to find a leopard sitting on the veranda.

Trips to the outside loo were terrifying because you never knew whether a snake was going to drop in.

‘Mrs Practical’

Glenys said Dottie was ‘Mrs Practical’. She needed to be resourceful because John spent a lot of time away travelling. She made the children’s clothes while John made some of their toys.

“We didn’t think anything of it then, of course,” said Glenys. “That was just what life was like, but I do remember when we came home Stephen was amazed to turn a light on at the flick of a switch.”

One of the things John did while in Kenya was set up a training college for the Church Army. It is now called Carlile College and, from very small beginnings has grown exponentially over the years.

Dottie died peacefully at Temple Grove on March 31, and a service of celebration and thanksgiving for her life is to be held on Thursday, April 22, at All Saints Church, Crowborough.

“Every now and then someone comes into your life and they turn it upside down in a good way, and you are that someone for me! You are my Jaber and I wish you a very happy birthday. To my beautiful 1st lady, I hope this year brings you as much joy and happiness that you have brought and continue to bring into my life”, read the caption.

Mrs Mfalme responded by describing him as her pillar of strength. ""What a wonderful message to wake up to ???? thank you babe????, you are my pillar of strength. I love you????.

Netizens were quick to flood his timeline with birthday messages to his lady upon this.

Dj Joe Mfalme was among those whose jobs were terminated for victim shaming on-air with regards to the case of Wangari Wakimbi on their morning show, Lift Off.

Trouble ensued for the trio when a video recording of them making insensitive sentiments on the plight of Eunice Wangari Wakimbi, who was pushed off the 12th floor of a building by a man she met on Facebook surfaced online stirring anger among Kenyan netizens and activists.

In a statement dated March 27, Radio Africa stated that the decision was reached after a comprehensive review of the comments made on the station’s Thursday morning show, adding that the topic in discussion was neither approved nor authorized by the management.

It was August 30, 1970. The Blue Angels were performing at the 4th Annual Cedar Rapids Jaycees Air Show at the Cedar Rapids Airport, now the Eastern Iowa Airport.

There were four Blue Angels jets in the air that day, with 35,000 people in attendance, according to the Iowa City Press-Citizen. One of those pilots was 27-year-old Ernie Christensen.

The Des Moines Register reported the Blue Angels performed for only about 40 minutes due to visibility problems. Christensen said a crosswind made it even worse. As the Blue Angels began to land, Christensen heard their challenges on his radio.

When it was Christensen's turn to come down, he made a huge mistake. In his concern for the other Angels, Christensen had forgotten to put down his landing gear.

When Christensen hit the runaway, he immediately knew something was terribly wrong. In a new video he says he thought, ""'Oh my god. What happened?""... He goes on to describe the scene: ""I'm on fire. The whole bottom half of the aircraft is on fire and I'm in full burner and I am screaming down the runway... I'm looking ahead of me. On this side, I got crowd. On this side, I've got bleachers and crowd... By that time, (I) went off the runway on fire and probably still doing 80 knots (92 miles-per-hour)... and I ejected."" What's important to note is that, even though his plane was on fire, Christensen didn't eject until he knew those in the crowd, and his fellow Blue Angels pilots, were out of harm's way.

After ejecting, Christensen would come down, parachute and all, on his back on the airport runaway. His #4 Blue Angels U.S. Navy Phantom jet finally stopped in a cornfield, where it was extinguished by firefighters.

You can watch Ernie Christensen explain his harrowing ordeal in the video below. His description of that day in Cedar Rapids begins at the 14-minute mark. It also includes video footage and photographs of the accident.

91,91,FL-2021-000038-KEN,C&I Project (Rooftop) of the Year: Orb Energy's Rooftop Solar Project in Karnataka - Mercom India,https://mercomindia.com/ci-project-orb-energy-karnataka/,"Orb Energy, a solar energy solutions company, won the award for the ‘Best C&I Project (Rooftop)’ at the recently-held Mercom India Solar Summit 2021.

There were seven award categories in the Mercom India Solar Awards 2021, and winners were chosen based on project innovation, challenges overcome, uniqueness, and impact on the community, economy, and the environment.

The Mercom India team sifted through a flood of nominations over weeks. Companies from across the world with projects developed solely in India were allowed to send in applications. Nominations were also accepted from participant and third-party vendors and suppliers. A panel of Mercom experts selected the winners.

Orb Energy’s 3 MW project installed on a single roof is one of the biggest single rooftop solar projects. It was installed for a client, Klene Paks Limited, engaged in the manufacture of woven bags in Karnataka.

K.Thyagaraju, Vice-President, Technical & PV Projects, received the award.

The project incorporated all safety measures to undertake quality maintenance needed to enable the client to derive optimum output from the plant. Its remote monitoring system helps the client keep a tab on the system’s performance remotely, leading to a substantial reduction in electricity bills.

The grid-connected photovoltaic system was completely designed, installed, and commissioned by Orb Energy within six months.

The project’s main challenge was the roof’s stability, which had to bear the weight of over 9,000 solar panels and structures weighing around 200 tons. After a detailed study of the roof’s design and its load-bearing beams, Orb’s installation team started installing the solar panels using the purlins effectively. Purlins are the key load bearers of the roof.

Since the client opted for captive consumption, the large amount of electricity generated from solar had to be regulated, especially during holidays when there was less load. The system was designed to take care of 80% of the load consumption. The special controlling unit installed near the inverters reduced the output of energy generated from solar through the inverter, thereby avoiding excess power being fed to the grid.

Catwalks or pathways were built for each array of solar modules for easy maintenance of solar modules. Plumbing points were designed and installed to run the water so that the service team can clean all the modules effectively to get maximum output.

Trina Solar supplied the modules for the project. The inverters were supplied by Delta.

BR Gururaj, Vice-President, IT & Communications, said that the award was a ‘ringing endorsement’ of the project. “The recognition encourages companies to get more innovative and competitive,” he said, hoping that the Mercom awards would be a recurring event.

Orb Energy provides a range of solar energy solutions to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. It focuses particularly on the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as they are a largely under-served market segment.

In January 2018, FMO, the Netherlands Development Finance Company, provided $4 million (~₹254 million) in equity funding to Orb Energy to expand its in-house finance facility of rooftop solar projects for SMEs in India and Kenya.

92,92,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Shelter and Sustainability - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/shelter-and-sustainability,"Shelter cannot be looked at in isolation; any response must consider the settlement and the context in which the households are sheltered. Preferred shelter solutions must be designed and engineered on the basis of context-specific structural and performance requirements. The shelter should provide a secure and healthy living environment with privacy and dignity to persons of concern (PoCs) and protect them from a range of risks, including eviction, exploitation and abuse, overcrowding, poor access to services, and unhygienic living conditions. The development of an appropriate shelter response is a process and not simply the delivery of a product and it is important to ensure the social aspects and needs become also design drivers, alongside all the other characteristics and specifications assessed in this study.

This document is a comparative overview of different shelter typologies, which were recently implemented in various field locations and in different stages of a humanitarian response to forced displacement. Using established criteria to determine the technical performance, habitability, affordability as well as the environmental impact of each shelter design, this study outlines the real costs of shelter interventions taking into consideration the specificities of each context and material used.

The scope of the Shelter and sustainability overview is not to review or update the technical specifications of shelters presented in the UNHCR shelter design catalogue, which was developed as a quick reference tool presenting a diverse range of applied examples of shelter designs. Rather, it seeks to examine shelter designs, the life-cycle of the materials used and analyze possible strategies to increase the sustainability of humanitarian responses and reduce their carbon footprint, while at the same time ensuring shelter adequacy and suitability. Ultimately, this overview aims to assist humanitarian practitioners and host governments in evaluating the performance of shelter solutions, technically, culturally and environmentally, in a given context and response.","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1563837-shelter%20and%20sustainability%20overview-UNHCR.png?itok=yCU_Dhuv,"['shelter', 'world', 'sustainability', 'specifications', 'overview', 'design', 'context', 'technical', 'performance', 'humanitarian', 'response']",

Some want a new society - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/archaeology-society-hosted-talk-against-returning-indigenous-remains-some-want-new,"An archaeology society hosted a talk against returning Indigenous remains. Some want a new society

The Society for American Archaeology’s (SAA’s) virtual annual meeting erupted in controversy last week after members realized the organization had allowed a talk arguing against a key U.S. law giving Native Americans rights to the human remains and cultural artifacts of their ancestors. Although the presentation was made by an SAA member and anthropologist, many archaeologists say they were shocked their professional organization gave a platform to what they consider anti-Indigenous views; they say SAA has not adequately addressed the harm caused by the talk. Some archaeologists are considering leaving and starting a new society.

“There’s a sense [that SAA] is protecting the organization over the people who are involved,” says Kisha Supernant, an archaeologist at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, and a member of Canada’s historic Indigenous Métis. A number of archaeologists note that this incident comes after a sexual harassment scandal at the organization’s 2019 conference, which left many SAA members feeling unsupported. (The 2020 conference was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.)

In 1990, the United States passed a law requiring universities, museums, and other institutions to inform Native American tribes of any Indigenous human remains and artifacts in their collections—and return them when requested. At first, many archaeologists worried the law, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), would compromise their research. But today NAGPRA is widely accepted by archaeologists, as most agree that Indigenous people should have the right to determine the treatment of their ancestors’ remains, which were often looted from tribal lands. Since NAGPRA became law, many tribes have collaborated with archaeologists to study their history and ancestors.

On 15 April, Elizabeth Weiss, a physical anthropologist at San Jose State University and an SAA member, gave a presentation at SAA’s virtual annual meeting titled “Has Creationism Crept Back into Archaeology?” co-written with retired attorney James Springer. During the talk, she said archaeologists “have let creationism into the heart of our discipline” because NAGPRA gives “control of research over to contemporary American Indian communities,” who may request repatriation or refuse to participate in certain research partly because of religious beliefs. Last year, Weiss and Springer published a book making similar arguments, which drew criticism from many archaeologists.

“Not only was [Weiss’s and Springer’s paper] not founded on good scholarship, but there’s also an inherent assumption that repatriation is antiscience. That’s a red herring,” says Supernant, who studies Métis sites. “[Repatriation] is about power. It’s about who gets to make decisions about what happens to the ancestors.”

Members of the program committee, comprised of several dozen volunteers, last year reviewed the title and abstract of Weiss’s and Springer’s talk, as they do for all SAA presentations, says Deborah Nichols, president of SAA and an archaeologist at Dartmouth College. “There is a review process, but it is not the equivalent of a peer review for a juried journal,” she says. Few abstracts are rejected. But submissions might be flagged if they analyze looted artifacts, report doing work without the appropriate permits, or promote pseudoarchaeology, such as a belief that aliens built ancient monuments, she says. No one flagged Weiss’s and Springer’s abstract, Nichols says, though she called their argument “dated.”

The program committee then grouped Weiss’s and Springer’s talk into a session titled “Curation, Repatriation, and Accessibility: Vital Ethical Considerations.” April Beisaw, an archaeologist at Vassar College, presented her talk on the importance of NAGPRA compliance in that session. “I was one of the very many people on the program committee. And I was not asked to review that abstract, even though NAGPRA is an expertise of mine,” she says. “I would have flagged it.” She called Weiss’s and Springer’s argument “nonsensical. … NAGPRA is a human rights law, it’s Indian law, and it’s a property rights law. It is not a religious law.”

After SAA members began to speak out against Weiss’s presentation on social media, the society issued a statement on 15 April. “SAA recognizes that some will find certain positions in presentations objectionable or even offensive, and we do not want to minimize those feelings. The conversation reflects the broader discussions happening in our field. Scholarship requires the opportunity for rigorous interrogation of diverse views.”

But Supernant was shocked to hear such arguments presented at an important archaeology conference. “There are Indigenous members of the SAA, myself included, and there’s so little care given to how a paper like that might have harmed us,” she says. “It was a very difficult experience to sit through that paper … when your very humanity and human rights are being questioned.” She adds: “People are entitled to hold these views. But whether or not they’re given a platform is up [to SAA].”

Supernant started the Twitter hashtag #IAmNotTheSAA, and many other members have expressed outrage on social media and called on the organization to apologize.

Weiss defends her presentation, saying: “Calls to cancel our talk, shout us down, or rewrite the guidelines for abstract acceptance so that similar talks are not accepted next year are a distressing movement to silence voices with minority or unpopular perspectives.” She adds: “Our position is not racist or anti-Indigenous. … [T]o us there are no Indigenous archaeologists and no non-Indigenous archaeologists—there are only archaeologists. … We think that the validity of any argument does not depend on a person’s race.”

Three days after SAA’s statement, Nichols took a somewhat stronger stance in an interview with Science Insider.

“The SAA Board refutes the viewpoint of the Weiss/Springer presentation [and] reiterates its support for NAGPRA,” Nichols says. “I understand, sincerely, why [Indigenous archaeologists] were upset and offended. … I personally regret the pain and harm that some have felt. At the same time, I also wrestle with [the fact that] silencing different points of view doesn’t make them go away. … To me, this controversy gets at what are some of the very, very hardest issues that universities, colleges, scholarly societies, and our society at large in the United States have had to wrestle with in recent years.”

Nichols says SAA will address the incident further. “I am quite certain we’re going to see changes take place” in the society as a result, she says.

For Supernant, it is too little, too late. She’s leaving SAA and hopes to build a new professional organization, tentatively called the Society for Engaged Archaeology. When she tweeted about her idea last week, she received a flood of interest and support. “This was the last straw that galvanized a number of us to seriously start doing that planning,” she says. “I understand that institutions are slow to change. But I don’t feel confident that the SAA actually wants to.”","Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/News_Insider_1280x720_0.png?itok=bEY-REg7,"['hosted', 'nagpra', 'law', 'returning', 'weisss', 'repatriation', 'talk', 'remains', 'springers', 'society', 'saa', 'archaeologists', 'indigenous', 'archaeology']", 
96,96,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Why some climate scientists are joining the finance industry - Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2021/0415/Why-some-climate-scientists-are-joining-the-finance-industry,"Environmental scientist Laura Garcia Velez cut her teeth on projects to help Ethiopian farmers insure crops for drought and connect remote Colombian communities to the electricity grid before working for conservation campaigners World Wildlife Fund.

Now she’s an analyst for Lombard Odier, charged with improving the $350 billion Swiss bank’s green credentials.

“It’s really important that finance recruits from science,” said Ms. Velez, one of a growing number of campaigners and scientists who have switched to banking, which she hopes can play a role in “greening the polluting industries.”

Activism and finance may seem an unlikely pairing of two implacable foes.

Yet banks, asset managers, and private equity firms, faced with tough regulations to decarbonize portfolios and loan books, are competing to grab the people with the right green expertise, according to jobs data and Reuters interviews with finance firms, recruiters, and universities.

“Working in sustainability, it used to feel like you were trying to knock down walls,” said NatWest’s head of climate change James Close, a former director of climate change at the World Bank.

“Now they are pulling us in from the streets through the front door.”

Many environmentalists, for their part, say the only way to save the planet is to force big businesses to radically reduce their carbon emissions, and they see the finance world that funds them as one of the best levers.

Some charities and campaigners argue, though, that “greenwashing” is rife in the finance industry. Many new recruits, they say, are used as a marketing tool and often lack the power to drive real change.

Doubling pay packets

Nonetheless, the green rush is on.

The number of job ads for “sustainability” roles nearly doubled to more than 1,000 during the year to February, versus the previous 12 months, according to global finance recruitment specialist eFinancialCareers. Positions range from junior-level analysts to new director-level roles such as head of sustainability or climate change.

Green recruitment specialist Acre said its hires in finance had increased by more than a quarter year-on-year every year since 2017. The most senior posts now offer pay packages of well over 750,000 pounds ($1 million), up around three-fold over the period.

LinkedIn data shared with Reuters shows a steady increase in the number of finance jobs listed as requiring at least one “green skill,” such as pollution prevention or ecosystem management, particularly in the United States.

“There is a race for talent right now, there’s no doubt about it,” said Elree Winnett Seelig, Citi’s global head of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) for markets, adding that demand was particularly strong in fixed income.

Indeed banks, asset managers, and private equity firms have been ramping up their climate teams in the past year, pushing salaries up by 30-50%, said Jon Williams, partner in sustainability and climate change at PwC UK.

One of his team recently doubled their salary by jumping ship to an asset management firm, he added.

Environmental advocacy group workers who move to a bank are typically able to at least double their pay packets once bonuses are factored in, recruiters say.

‘A different breed’

Leading universities with specialist centers that combine climate science and finance say they have seen companies beat a path to their door to recruit graduates.

Charles Donovan, executive director of Imperial College London’s Centre for Climate Finance and Investment, which is jointly run by climate science hub the Grantham Institute, said there had been an “unbelievable” rise in interest in its students from finance sector employers in the past 18 months.

Banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered are seeking prospective hires through climate-research partnerships, while some firms are offering scholarships, he added.

While the London financial district may be pulling some talent away from government and advocacy roles, Mr. Donovan was unconcerned, saying many who targeted the financial sector were “a different breed of students” who recognized the value of expertise in areas like climate change to differentiate themselves from other graduates looking for jobs in finance.

Chasing hurricanes

Some of the more established environmental experts who have moved across to finance say the rewards are not just financial.

Rob Bailey, director of climate resilience at consulting firm Marsh & McLennan’s research unit, previously worked for Oxfam and international affairs think-tank Chatham House.

“I can deploy the knowledge in a different way and working with different stakeholders is quite invigorating,” he said.

Some specialists are also drawn by the challenging and often highly technical nature of the work.

For example, quantitative analyst Ms. Velez, who moved to Lombard Odier last year, is building a tool that links assets to near real-time environmental and geospatial data tracking hurricane risk and pollution.

Swiss bank UBS, meanwhile, has recruited people for its Evidence Lab analyst team with experience across a range of disciplines including geomodeling and hydromodeling in recent years.

“We had to adopt new recruitment strategies and methods to find people with these skills who weren’t looking for a job in financial services,” said Barry Hurewitz, global head of UBS Evidence Lab Innovations.

Finance firms across the board told Reuters they were expanding scientific and sustainability teams.

Asset manager Schroders said it has more than 10 staff with scientific backgrounds in its insurance-linked securities team, including people with PhDs in climatology. Its sustainable investing team has grown by four people to 22 in the last year and is planning further expansion.

Britain’s biggest domestic bank Lloyds has more than doubled the number of staff with core sustainability roles in a year, to over 40, while Zurich Insurance said it had expanded its team researching the modeling of wind, flood, cyber, and climate risks, to seven from one in five years.

‘Part of the machine’

The demand for green expertise is partly being driven by tightening climate regulation on financial services firms in Britain, Europe, and beyond.

Eurozone banks will be expected to take climate change into account when making loans or investing, for instance. Funds in the European Union will have to disclose how sustainable their products are, while U.K. lenders could face tougher capital requirements for polluting assets held on their books.

Yet while companies say they are making progress, some charities say they are still playing catch-up.

“In my experience finance firms don’t have a great depth of knowledge across the piste. Their skill sets are massively tilted towards the past,” said Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace UK.

Better hiring must be matched by strategy changes at the top, according to the charities. While many large financial services firms have pledged to decarbonize their lending and portfolios in the coming years, most remain exposed to fossil fuels in some way, they say.

“If you just have a bunch of sustainability officers who are kind of shoved off to the side and are effectively there to help with greenwashing, that’s not going to really change the results very much,” said Ben Cushing, campaign manager for financial advocacy at U.S.-based environmental group Sierra Club.

And not everyone with an environmental background finds high finance fulfilling.

Ian Povey-Hall, a director at green recruiter Acre, said that while most had no regrets, some had become disillusioned.

“ESG becoming more of a commercial focus has changed things for some people who say their work has become productized as it’s become more part of the machine,” he said.

Lombard Odier’s Ms. Velez says she’s happy with her decision and satisfied she’s not part of a greenwashing problem.

“We are working a lot on how companies will decrease their emissions,” she adds. “Of course I want these changes to happen faster – I am a bit more realistic than optimistic.”

The United States has disbursed more than $95 million to support the response to the South Sudan humanitarian emergency.

US Humanitarian Assistance for the South Sudan Crisis spokesperson Ned Price said the funding will provide critical protection, economic opportunity, shelter, essential healthcare, emergency food assistance, safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services to some of the nearly four million South Sudanese refugees and internally displaced people in South Sudan.

The funds will also support refugees and host communities in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.

“This announcement includes nearly $53 million through the US Agency for International Development and nearly $43 million from the US Department of State,” Mr Price said in a statement.

“The fund brings the total US humanitarian assistance to more than $482 million in Fiscal Year 2021.”

Flooding, political violence, and lack of effective governance in recent years have ruined livelihoods, displaced additional South Sudanese, and heightened food insecurity, raising the likelihood of famine conditions in parts of the country. Covid-19 and ongoing subnational conflict have further compounded the situation.

The urgent humanitarian need calls for sustained and coordinated donor support to the underfunded UN 2021 South Sudan Regional Refugee Response Plan.

In the statement, the US called on donors and the South Sudanese government to work with the UN and international community to support the humanitarian response in South Sudan.

“Humanitarian assistance will not solve the conflict, but it is vital to keeping civilians alive. Ultimately, political will and political solutions are the only way to end the suffering of the South Sudanese people,” said Mr Price.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/3364944/d61f6690b5df5b2ae0a403f5cd62726a/ss-data.jpg,"['alleviate', 'support', 'million', 'crisis', 'sudan', '95m', 'gives', 'sudanese', 'price', 'assistance', 'humanitarian', 'south', 'response', 'political']",
