Most of the workers were asleep early Sunday when the landslide began near the Chitan hydroelectric station, the New China News Agency reported. The area suffered heavy rains on Saturday and Sunday, totaling more than 7 1/2 inches in 24 hours, local officials said.

“We were asleep at 5 a.m. before the dawn, when the mountain suddenly began to jolt. Before we could respond, sand and mud flooded into our room and pushed the room 10 meters,” or about 33 feet, 36-year-old survivor Deng Chunwu told the news agency.

“It’s been raining all the time over the past couple of days, and I didn’t think it was a big deal,” Deng said. “But the rain last night was more fierce than ever.”

The hydroelectric station was put into service in 1980. The missing laborers were building an extension that was planned to begin operation in August 2017, according to the news agency. Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered all-out efforts to find the missing workers.

Some Chinese questioned whether officials had made mistakes in choosing the location for the power station. But Li Lixin, general manager of Huadian Fuxin Energy Corp. said at a news conference that an accident had not occurred in 30 years. “We chose the location strictly in accordance with the relevant requirements,” Lixin said. “The disaster was caused by the continuous heavy rains.”

Much of eastern and southern China was hit by torrential rain over the weekend, triggering floods and landslides. Among the hardest hit areas was Yangshuo, in Guangxi province. Surrounded by soaring karst peaks and bordered by the Li River, the small city has been a popular tourist spot among backpackers since 1980s. But it was inundated almost overnight, with numerous vehicles and their passengers stuck on the roads. No injuries or deaths were reported.

China’s state flood control authority warned last week that the country is poised to suffer massive spring floods due to the strongest El Niño since 1998. That year, flooding lasted for two months and killed more than 3,000 people.

The Three Gorges Dam, on the Yangtze River, recorded an inflow of 17,800 cubic meters per second on Sunday, the highest since 1992, authorities said.","Mon, 09 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/146eced/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+141/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2F82%2F20ecfbb408f1c0f5b5b6633852e7%2Fla-fg-image-china-landslide-20160509,"['room', 'hydroelectric', 'hit', 'officials', 'heavy', 'landslide', 'workers', 'station', 'missing', 'china', 'rains', 'caused', '31', 'kills', 'river']",

Road Accidents, Suicide, Floods

Enlarge this image toggle caption ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images

The leading cause of death among teenagers in the U.S. is road accidents — killing nearly 5,000 American kids between the ages of 10 and 19 in 2013.

Suicide also emerges as a risk when puberty hits — affecting more than 5,000 teens and early 20-somethings in the United States alone in 2013.

In Latin America and Mexico, homicide kills the most young adults between the ages of 20 and 24, while in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS kills the largest number.

And in China, drowning tops the list of causes of teenage death.

These grim statistics come from a new interest in the health concerns of young people, which have long been overlooked and understudied, says George Patton, an adolescent health researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia. He and colleagues looked at a massive amount of data — from the Global Burden of Disease project led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, Seattle. Their aim was to document the biggest risks young people face between the ages of 10 and 24, an age group that includes 1.8 billion people and makes up a quarter of the world's population.

The report, published this week in the Lancet, broke down results by country, offering an illuminating look at how risks differ for adolescents in different parts of the world and what kind of steps are needed to help kids reach adulthood safely.

Patton spoke with Goats and Soda about the challenges young people face around the world and how investing in adolescents is investing in the future.

Why study adolescents?

We've seen tremendous improvements in the health of younger children — huge declines in mortality in children under 5, declines of 80 percent in the last 15 years. For the adolescent age group, declines have been minimal and where they have occurred, they have been modest. This was an attempt to put together a more complete picture of what we know and also come up with some recommendations for how we should be responding to the health and well-being of the world's 10- to 24-year-olds.

Why do young people in the years around teenage-dom need their own health category?

In terms of health and well-being, it's a time of tremendous change. Puberty initiates a cascade of hormonal changes, which trigger a new round of growth and brain development. Essentially, what we see is the younger adolescent beginning to engage with his or her external world beyond the family and immediate community in a very different way. The peer group becomes important, and problems of health become related to emotions and emotional control. Mental health problems, injury problems and substance abuse problems increase.

It sounds as if adolescence is completely unlike the ages before or after from a medical standpoint.

This is so totally true. It's true of the health problems. It's true of the health risks. We also examine during these years changing patterns of obesity, which has become a global pandemic. Looking at this age group in all countries, there are rising rates of overweight and obesity. And this age group is critical because if you develop a problem with obesity in these years, you're likely to have it for the rest of your life.

So the choices teenagers make can end up having health consequences into adulthood?

Obesity is an example of that. It's a risk for metabolic disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and arthritis. It's also a risk to maternal health. Obese mothers are more likely to have complications. You could also put into that category: tobacco use, alcohol use and infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. Problems of under-nutrition also often accelerate during these years when there's tremendous growth, and adolescents may need greater food resources than adults. [Risks for iron deficiency, in particular, rise during adolescence, especially among girls. But, according to the report, few studies have considered how best to intervene to boost energy, protein and vitamin intake in undernourished teens.]

What kind of big picture messages do you see in this data?

One is that we need to take a broader lens to adolescent health. We've tended to think mostly about sexual and reproductive health, and that's where we've made investments in services, but it's much, much more than that. Second, patterns in adolescent health vary hugely across the planet, and two-thirds of the world's adolescents are facing preventable health problems, like injuries, violence, infectious disease and problems of poverty on a daily basis.

How can we help the world's adolescents live healthier lives?

One of the best investments we can make is secondary education. It's hugely protective. We've taken analyses of adolescent birth rates, and it's very clear: If you keep a girl in school until lower secondary, you reduce adolescent birth rates by 48 per 1,000 girls per year. If you keep girls in school through upper secondary, or 12 years of education, you reduce adolescent birth rates by 68 per 1,000 girls per year. These are huge reductions.

Why are such a large proportion of adolescents dying from drowning in China?

China has a significant problem with flooding. China and India together account for probably 40 percent of the world's 372,000 deaths due to drowning, more for younger kids and more for males than for females. [According to WHO, riskier behavior among males and lapses in supervision help explain those patterns.] The solution is about flood control and protection. That's an example of the power of doing [analyses like these]. This report is bringing visibility to the health problems of an age group we've really overlooked.

Can adolescents be part of the solution?

One of the things we really emphasize in the report is the importance of engaging young people. As we have a generation spending a longer time in education, who are more articulate, we have a strong message about making sure they are active participants — partners if you like — in the solutions we are proposing.

What does the future hold for the next generation of youth?

Globalization, migration on a mass scale, climate change, digital media: these are the kinds of things shaping the social world of this generation. Now is the time to be putting policies, practices and investments in place around the health and well-being of this generation.","Fri, 13 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/05/13/gettyimages-477166088-50_wide-85cbeb8141c7d6c4d79c44850db3551f6b22cfe9.jpg?s=1400,"['health', 'young', 'road', 'world', 'teenagers', 'whats', 'accidents', 'suicide', 'killing', 'weve', 'worlds', 'floods', 'problems', 'adolescents', 'age', 'group', 'adolescent']", 
7,7,FL-2016-000044-CHN,China Will Probably Implode - The National Interest Online,https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-will-probably-implode-16088,"In July of 2001, Gordon Chang predicted an inevitable meltdown of the Chinese Communist Party in his best-selling book The Coming Collapse of China. Since then, China’s economy has increased by more than eightfold, to surpass even the United States on a purchasing parity power basis. Oops?

In Chang’s defense, he could not have anticipated the colossal blunder of President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress in paving China’s ruthlessly mercantilist way into the World Trade Organization just five months after his book was published. That mother of all unfair trade deals—a well-deserved target of both the Sanders and Trump presidential campaigns—kept China’s Great Walls of Protectionism largely intact. However, it also opened U.S. markets to a flood of illegally subsidized Chinese imports, and catalyzed the offshoring of millions of American manufacturing jobs.

Since China’s entry into the WTO in 2001, the center of the world’s manufacturing base has seismically shifted as the People’s Republic of Unfair Trade Practices has used a dizzying array of illegal export subsidies, currency manipulation, intellectual-property theft, sweatshop labor and pollution havens to seize market share from both Europe and North America. To date, more than seventy thousand American factories have closed, over twenty million Americans have been put out of work and Chinese Communist Party leaders have laughed at Gordon Chang—all the way to their Swiss, Panamanian and Caymanian bank accounts.

China’s mercantilist WTO windfall notwithstanding, there are nonetheless growing signs that the collapse of China as Gordon Chang once predicted, and David Shambaugh is now intimating, may soon be at hand. As Exhibit A of the signs of China’s troubles I offer, in the remainder of this missive, an email correspondence directly from the Chinese mainland. It’s from an American citizen living and working with his Chinese wife and son in the PRC.

I will let you decide whether the views of this observer (name withheld to keep him out of a Chinese prison or shallow grave) is an accurate one or overly pessimistic. If it’s the former, it could well be the harbinger of Gordon’s Chang’s crystal-ball revenge.

“From what I can see, and my Chinese wife can see, China will probably soon implode. Just what the catalyst will be is uncertain. Just before that time, or as a result of that implosion, the [Communist Party] will probably try to get the population to focus outside the country, probably through conflicts in the South China Sea or Taiwan.

For more than two decades, I have been telling people that the first thing China would do before trying to take Taiwan would be to take the Spratly Islands. If the world simply ignored that, then Taiwan would be next.

Hong Kong is a bitter, poison pill left by Britain for China. There will be no peaceful resolution of that problem.

The biggest problems in China right now are poisoned food, water, and air. Nobody trusts anybody, which is the reason why there is huge capital flight out of the country.

China has a national debt in excess of $28 trillion. But anybody knowing anything about Chinese accounting practices knows that number is probably just a very conservative number. Add some of the data and stuff Caixin [an online newspaper] is telling us about in terms of city and provincial accounting practices, and the numbers are horrible.

China wants its currency to become an international currency, but nobody knows its value. The only effective taxation going on here in China is [protectionist] for imports. The taxation system of businesses and income tax is completely broken and non-functional. There is no transparency in the financial system here. That is quite different from that of the Euro or the dollar. The fact is, the government is printing money like crazy here.

People are buying houses around here, but nobody is living in them. They don't trust potential renters. Homes are unaffordable for most people unless they use corruption to get the money needed. People have been investing in houses only because that is the only relatively secure form of asset management. Yet home purchases are at best leases since the government can come in at any time and requisition the land for other purposes.

Construction quality of housing here is horrible. If [province name withheld] had a big quake, the dead would be in the millions. China would almost immediately collapse.

The education system wherein I work is horrible. People in the West look at high math and science scores, but they don't realize that most of the students, like my son, cannot apply what they learn to similar math or science problems.

Students are completely unable and unwilling to ask questions. Professors and instructors don't have offices, let alone office hours, so questions on content the students don't understand are never answered. Of course, if a student fails a course, the teacher loses face, so every student passes.

If the university has a graduation rate at the end of four years of less than 97%, the university president loses face. Add on top of that the fact that around 2000, there were about 1 million college graduates. Compared to now, with over 7 million graduates, one has to ask: Where did they get all the qualified teachers?

My wife teaches in a public elementary school. The CPC is putting pressure on everybody to conform. Fun, considering the fact that the school would collapse overnight if its corruption were rooted out.

Real inflation in China is considerably higher than what the government figures reveal. For example, my wife reports that nearly all the food here in this Tier 2 city has doubled in price over the past three years.

While food prices typically go up about two weeks before Chinese New Year, they also normally go back down to pre-holiday prices. This year, food prices went up about 20% and have not gone back down.

My wife reports that middlemen in the food chain are mostly responsible for the food price increases. The farmers have not increased their prices because many prices are set by local government. However, because the middlemen have increased prices, demand for certain types of fresh foods has gone down. That means that while people in the cities are not buying because of increased food prices, the farmers have food rotting, unable to sell it.

I went to a farm not too long ago. What struck me was that in the apple orchards, as well as in the surrounding fields, even though the food was at that time being harvested, there were no bugs. I never saw that problem in the States, since there are mandated pesticide non-application times before harvest.

In most American markets, there will still be some food sold with insect marks on it. Most Americans don't realize what that really means. It means the pesticides are nearly, if not completely, gone from that food [because, unlike in China, they can’t be used during harvest time].

I have about 300 papers from my composition students about their lives to grade, many of which confirm some of the things I said above.

8,8,FL-2016-000044-CHN,China debt-fueled stimulus may lead to recession - People's Daily - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-trend-idUSKCN0Y003W,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China may suffer from a financial crisis and economic recession if the government relies too much on debt-fueled stimulus, the official People’s Daily quoted an “authoritative person” on Monday as saying.

The People’s Daily, official paper of the ruling Communist party, in a question and answer interview quoted the person as saying excessive credit growth could heighten risks and trigger a financial crisis if not controlled properly.

“Trees cannot grow to the sky. High leverage will inevitably bring about high risks, which could lead to a systemic financial crisis, negative economic growth and even wipe out ordinary people’s savings,” the person, who was not named, said in response to a question on whether stimulus should be used in future economic policy.

“We should completely abandon the illusion of reducing leverage by loosing monetary conditions to help accelerate economic growth.”

The People’s Daily has in the past used reports quoting an “authoritative person” to communicate thinking on key points of economic policy.

The government must rein in risks in stock, currency, debt and property markets as well as banking sector, the person said in the report.

China’s economic trend in the coming years will be “L-shaped”, rather than “U-shaped”, and definitely not “V-shaped”, due to weak demand and overcapacity, the paper said.

China’s economic growth will not drop abruptly even without stimulus, given its potentials and resilience, it added.

The warning came after data showed the world’s second-largest economy rebounded in March as the government quickened investment in infrastructure backed by a flood of bank credit.

China’s economic growth slowed to 6.7 percent in the first quarter - the weakest since the global financial crisis, but activity picked up in March after a series of policy steps.

Chinese officials and state media have since sought to talk up the economy in a bid to shore up investor confidence following recent stock and currency market turmoil.

But the People’s Daily report said while much of the growth was investment-driven, structural problems persist, suggesting it could take many years before new engines of growth begin to lead growth.","Sun, 08 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160509&t=2&i=1136337180&r=LYNXNPEC4801M&w=800,"['crisis', 'used', 'growth', 'debtfueled', 'daily', 'lead', 'financial', 'stimulus', 'person', 'china', 'peoples', 'recession', 'risks', 'economic']",

A series of massive infrastructure projects are under way to merge transport, energy, water and telecoms networks across the nine cities. Development has been relentless, and the World Bank recently named the Pearl River Delta as the biggest urban area in the world in terms of population and geographical size.

A 30-mile-long bridge and tunnel is under construction to join the Pearl River Delta metropolis of Zhuhai to the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong.

According to reports, the city had seen heavy rain over the last couple of days, which caused flooding in the area.

Two of the manhole covers had been lifted onto the road by the flood water, becoming potential hazards to passing vehicles.

Xiao Shi, who works at a pharmacy nearby, ventured out in the pouring rain to stick an orange umbrella into one of the manhole covers.

The second cover didn't have any holes where she could put a second umbrella so Xiao Shi had to borrow a warning placard from a nearby cleaner.

In the process of putting up the placard, she almost slipped into the manhole and was only saved thanks to the safety netting placed inside.

13,13,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Chinese tech giant Kuang-Chi harnesses Israeli tech to build smart cities in China - TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/chinese-tech-giant-kuang-chi-harnesses-israeli-tech-to-build-smart-cities-in-china/,"Kuang-Chi, a Shenzhen-based technology conglomerate, recently launched a $300 million Israel fund in Tel Aviv to tap the country’s smart-city know-how, according to the company’s founder Ruopeng Liu.

“Kuang-Chi is the first Chinese corporate VC and incubator that leverages the capabilities of the Israeli market together with the distribution, sales and marketing and technology development in China,” said Dorian Barak, managing partner of Indigo Global, Kuang-Chi’s partner in Israel.

With a valuation of over $10 billion Kuang-Chi is no stranger to early-stage investments, with a portfolio that already includes Solar Ship Inc., Martin Aircraft Company (ASX:MJP), biometrics pioneer Zwipe and communications group HyalRoute

In Israel, the company’s Kuang-Chi GCI Fund & Incubator has already made its first investment: A $20 million commitment to eyesight Technologies, a machine vision company.

“Israeli entrepreneurs tend to have very big ideas, but there are limitations in the local market; we can help these companies to take big leaps,” said Liu.

Like many of his peers in China, Liu is looking to take Israeli tech to a global audience. And the first stop will be China.

The country’s smog-choked, populous metropolises are a perfect testing ground for Israeli technologies aimed at “smart cities,” which is a main area of focus for Liu’s fund.

With the rapid expansion of its urban population, Chinese cities suffer from environmental pollution and a shortage of resources, like potable water. Considering the difficulty of sustaining the country’s megacities, it makes sense for China to cozy up to Israel to adapt to the changing landscape. For example, Israeli water tech should be a shoo-in for China’s growing needs.

“With the future city, we emphasize two points: environment and safety. We know the severity of the problem in China and desperately need technology to monitor and track the real data of environmental change,” Liu says. “And the other part is safety, for example against natural disaster and disaster relief… 3.5% of Chinese GDP is lost because of disasters. Chinese cities are crowded and if something happens, many people will die.”

The launch of the fund is the fruit of nearly a year of negotiations with local Israeli players, and is potentially the first step of a multi-pronged approach to Kuang-Chi’s involvement in the technology scene.

The company’s new fund also is indicative of the flood of technology investments coming from China into Israel. Chinese investment into the country is growing by 50 percent annually and is expected to increase.

Despite China’s reputation as a copycat nation, the country’s economy is evolving as it gains more exposure to technology startups internationally while investing heavily in research and development efforts at home.

According to Liu, Kuang-Chi works with municipalities who have a keen interest to see their cities avoid natural disasters and overcrowding, operating with the support of the Chinese government.

And in terms of investment, the firm intends to be stage-agnostic. “We are not financial investors. We don’t care about the stage, we only care about what they are doing. It could be a one person company or a 100 person company,” said Liu.

Based on Liu’s vision, there are a number of Israeli companies that might fit the bill.

“We are looking at robotics, aviation and at anything that makes machines behave and understand human behavior, “ Liu says. Kuang-Chi is also on the lookout for virtual reality investment opportunities.","Mon, 09 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/israelflag.jpg?w=600,"['chinese', 'techcrunch', 'liu', 'smart', 'kuangchi', 'giant', 'investment', 'israeli', 'harnesses', 'israel', 'fund', 'technology', 'china', 'tech', 'cities', 'countrys']",

THE two giant furnaces at Port Talbot steelworks, Britain’s biggest, were still hard at work this week, pouring out vast quantities of molten iron. But production of steel from iron ore here may soon come to an end. At the end of March, the plant's owner, Tata Steel, said that the operation was losing more than £1m ($1.45m) a day due to the low price of steel on global markets, and that it planned to sell off or close down its British operations as it could no longer shoulder the losses; bidders were given until May 3rd to state whether they were interested in buying it. (So far two bidders have gone public, one a management buy-out and a second by Liberty House, an international metals group.) Britain’s steel industry is not the only one in the West feeling the pinch from low steel prices. Both Belgium and Italy are spending public money to keep their steel mills open and the American industry there has been announcing a steady flow of job losses. Too much supply and not enough demand has been blamed for the falling prices. So what is causing the world’s glut of steel?

The collapse in the price of steel is mainly the result of falling demand and, until recently, rising production in China, says Edwin Basson of the World Steel Association, an industry group. Between 2000 and 2014, global production doubled from around 800m tonnes to around 1.6 billion tonnes a year, mainly driven by rising output in China. Until 2014, Chinese demand rose at approximately the same rate as its steel mills could produce, meaning that the impact on the rest of the world was limited. But as its construction boom came to an end, demand sagged, prompting the country’s state-owned steelmakers to sell their growing surpluses on foreign markets. Exports of steel from China increased from 45m tonnes in 2014 to 97m tonnes last year—marking a bigger rise than Germany’s entire output of the past year: 43m tonnes. This has triggered demands from rival firms for protection, from what they see as dumping.

Many economists argue that government subsidies are responsible for the overcapacity in the industry lasting so long. The flood of Chinese steel around the world should have caused high-cost producers elsewhere to extinguish their blast furnaces, eventually allowing supply and demand to reach a new equilibirum. But because steel is often seen as a strategic industry, providing lots of jobs in areas where there are few other employers, governments are usually keen on propping them up, either through subsidies or nationalisation. China has overproduced steel for so long because regional Communist Party officials, who control local steel plants, prefer to subsidise their local plants to keep them open rather than risk the unemployment and unrest that may follow shuttering them. In Europe, Italy has spent €2 billion to support the Ilva steel mill in Taranto. And even in Britain, where nationalisation has long been out of favour, the Conservative government has expressed a willingness to take a 25% stake in the Port Talbot steelworks.

Rising steel prices in America and Europe since January have raised hopes that plants such as Port Talbot may soon be able to break even without any government assistance. But many commodities and metals analysts predict this will simply encourage Chinese plants to increase production again, causing more overcapacity and lowering prices again later this year. Last month the OECD, a club of rich countries, convened a bunch of ministers in Belgium to discuss measures to deal with the crisis. But until countries stop subsidising their plants, or imposing tariffs to artificially raise prices, progress towards ending the steel glut will be slow.","Thu, 05 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['industry', 'world', 'plants', 'talbot', 'production', 'china', 'steel', 'prices', 'demand', 'tonnes']",

The residents of the upscale King's Grant neighborhood said the Army knew the first dam to fail was deficient after a 2013 inspection and made no repairs, according to the lawsuit filed Monday.

The lawsuit also said the federal government did not reduce the level of the lake behind the dam even as forecasts called for at least a foot of rain in the days before the deluge started.

Fort Jackson spokesman Patrick Jones said Tuesday that officials don't comment on pending lawsuits. Four dams failed at Fort Jackson during the massive flood, and authorities have said little about the inspection histories of the dams or repairs they might have done before the flood.

The lawsuit focuses on an earthen dam built in 1940 to create Semmes Lake. Inspectors looked at the dam in 2013 and sent an email telling the federal government it was a serious hazard, which is the second worst rating for a structure.

The detailed inspection report from the dam has not been released, according to court papers.

The Semmes Lake dam failed about 3 a.m., on Oct. 3 not long after rainfall rates of 2 inches an hour started to fall. Meteorologists said the area received 2 feet of rain in about 12 hours.

Some 200 million gallons of water rushed through a hole in the earthen dam down Wildcat Creek into the King's Grant neighborhood. The water rushed through for about five hours before receding, according to court papers.

19,19,FL-2016-000044-CHN,World’s most extreme speculative mania is unraveling in China - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Money/Ef5y6psFQhWBXp4NHbg8QI/Worlds-most-extreme-speculative-mania-is-unraveling-in-Chin.html,"Shanghai/Beijing: From the Dutch tulip craze of 1637 to America’s dot-com bubble at the turn of the century, history is littered with speculative frenzies that ended badly for investors.

But rarely has a mania escalated so rapidly, and spurred such fevered trading, as the great China commodities boom of 2016. Over the span of just two wild months, daily turnover on the nation’s futures markets has jumped by the equivalent of $183 billion, outpacing the headiest days of last year’s Chinese stock bubble and making volumes on the Nasdaq exchange in 2000 look tame.

What started as a logical bet—that China’s economic stimulus and industrial reforms would lead to shortages of construction materials—quickly morphed into a full-blown commodities frenzy with little bearing on reality. As the nation’s army of individual investors piled in, they traded enough cotton in a single day last month to make one pair of jeans for everyone on Earth and shuffled around enough soybeans for 56 billion servings of tofu.

Now, as Chinese authorities introduce trading curbs to prevent surging commodities from fueling inflation and undermining plans to shut down inefficient producers, speculators are retreating as fast as they poured in. It’s the latest in a series of boom-bust market cycles that critics say are becoming more extreme as China’s policy makers flood the financial system with cash to stave off an economic hard landing.

“You have far too much credit, money sloshing about, money looking for higher returns,"" said Fraser Howie, the co-author of “Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise."" “Even in commodities where you could have argued there is some reason for prices to rise, that gets quickly swamped by a nascent bull market and becomes an uncontrollable bubble.""

Night trading

In many ways, China’s financial landscape was ripe for another round of mania. New credit soared to a record in the first quarter, giving individuals and businesses plenty of cash to invest at a time when several of the country’s traditional sources of return looked unattractive.

Government debt yields were hovering near record lows, while wealth-management products and company bonds had been rattled by a growing number of corporate defaults. Stocks were still too risky for many investors burned by last year’s crash, and moving money offshore had become harder as the government clamped down on capital outflows.

Jeremy He started pouring his savings into commodities last month after losing money in China’s stock rout and deciding that returns from his WMPs were too low. The 25-year-old employee at a multinational trade company in Shanghai set up a joint account with his friend to trade futures on rebar, coal and cotton, making as much as 150% before prices started falling at the end of last month.

Retail punters

“I’m pretty bored at work, so I trade commodities futures for some excitement,’’ said He, whose account swelled to as much as 700,000 yuan ($107,596) before sliding back to 400,000 yuan at the end of April. “Because I’m making investments with my friend, we can comfort each other when we are making a loss.’’

Nobody knows for sure how much of the trading surge has been driven by individuals, but the evidence suggests retail punters are playing a big role. More than 40% of the volume in rebar futures last month came during the night session, when it’s more convenient for people with day jobs to trade. The average holding period for contracts including rebar and iron ore was less than 3 hours in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Individuals with a bank account and official identity card can open a futures trading account at a brokerage within 40 minutes, with no initial balance required, Morgan Stanley said in a report on 4 May.

While at least five commodities in China gained more than 50% from their recent lows during the trading surge, the rally in prices is still a far cry from the Shanghai Composite Index’s 159% advance to its peak last year, or the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 256% advance at the height of the dot-com boom 16 years ago.

What makes the frenzy in China stand out is the sheer volume of trading. Market turnover on bourses in Dalian, Zhengzhou and Shanghai jumped from a daily average of about $78 billion in February to a peak of $261 billion on 22 April—exceeding the gross domestic product of Ireland. Turnover on Nasdaq’s exchange in early 2000, by contrast, peaked at about $150 billion.

China’s frenzy has begun to cool after the three main futures bourses took steps to curb speculation by raising margin requirements, lifting trading fees and, for rebar, cutting trading hours in the evening session. Total turnover on 6 May was $125 billion, down about $135 billion from the peak, while prices for rebar and iron ore have dropped almost 20% from their highs in April.

Steel demand

Some individuals are staying invested despite official attempts to rein in the market. Peter Sun, a 30-year-old professional in the financial industry in Shanghai, opened a futures account last month to trade steel, bitumen and glass after work. He devotes about half his income to investment, using technical patterns to make his buy and sell decisions because he doesn’t have time for more in depth analysis of supply and demand.

“I’m not concerned about measures aimed at cooling down the market,’’ Sun said.

For some commodities, there were fundamental reasons for prices to rise. Steel demand has increased amid fresh spending on infrastructure and a pickup in the property sector. New floor space under construction in China rose by 19% in the first quarter, boosting usage at a time when supplies of steel from warehouses and mills was running low. Physical prices surged, with rebar still up as much as 48% from its December low on the spot market, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., a state-owned consultancy.

Market froth

Yet China’s response to the boom suggest authorities are worried there’s froth in the market. Officials at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) have pledged to prevent excessive speculation, while the Dalian Commodity Exchange said in a statement that “some sectors of the society still have limited understanding of the futures market.’’ Regulators including the CSRC have prepared further measures to limit price fluctuations if abnormal volatility persists, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.

“They don’t want this to turn into a speculative market in commodities,’’ said Tiger Shi, managing partner at Bands Financial Ltd. in Hong Kong, who’s been trading commodities for two decades.

If China’s equity bubble is any guide, regulators may find it difficult to cool excessive speculation without triggering a collapse in prices. Domestic shares lost $5 trillion of value last summer as authorities moved to curb leveraged bets and restrain trading in the stock-index futures market, where volumes tumbled by 99% from their peak.

“The worry is that as soon as the bubble bursts, it’s everyone out of the door at the same time,’’ said Paul Adkins, managing director of AZ China Ltd., a Beijing-based aluminum consultancy. “It’s the last guys out the door that have the most pain."" Bloomberg

Catholics fear China has begun strictly enforcing a long-standing ban on religious activity in schools and universities after authorities in Gansu province issued a rare public reminder of the ban in response to an online video featuring a kindergarten student reciting the Quran.

The public warning by the Education Department of Gansu last week said the incident ""harms the mental health of the youth"" and follows a top-level meeting of the Communist Party elite in April in which President Xi Jinping called for stricter management of China's religious groups.

""In the past, when such a school case was found, authorities would issue an internal notice among the different levels of the education department rather than posting it publicly on the internet,"" said Matthias, a Catholic in Gansu Province.

When officials of Shaanxi Normal University in Xian discovered nine female students wearing Islamic veils and a male student reading the Quran on campus in April last year, those involved received a private warning later leaked and reported online.

Beijing's policy on education and faith groups in different areas remains inconsistent.

Military and police have closed ""illegal"" madrassas or Islamic religious school in Xinjiang following a wave of attacks blamed on minority Muslim Uighurs in recent years, and minors remain banned from entering mosques in Xinjiang.

However, young Muslims in other areas of the country can enter mosques freely, and Christians have been able to infuse education with religion with tacit approval of authorities in some areas of China.

An outcry by ordinary Chinese in response to the recent video of the kindergarten student reciting the Quran appeared to put provincial authorities under pressure. Thousands of critical comments flooded Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.

""Cute? This is a violation of human rights. It is against the principle of freedom of religious belief,"" wrote one Weibo user in response to the video.

The Education Department of Gansu stressed the ""rule of law"" in its warning to education centers to respect Chinese legislation, noted Matthias, another key difference with previous warnings — and a major theme of Xi's leadership.

The Chinese president made frequent use of the word ""law"" in a speech to faith leaders and fellow members of the all-powerful Politburo last month, the first high-level Chinese government meeting on management of religions since 2001.

A priest in Tianjin who declined to give his name for security reasons noted that China maintains a long-standing ban on mixing faith with education.

Passed in 1995, the Education Law remains vague, however: ""The state shall separate education from religion. Any organization or individual may not employ religion to obstruct activities of the state education system.""

Stricter interpretation of the law in the recent case in Gansu could be a sign of tighter control on growth of religious activity, warned a priest in Hebei province, home to 1 million Catholics.

However, a priest in Shandong province who also asked to remain anonymous said it was unrealistic of the party to think it could separate faith from education in schools and universities China.

""It is impossible to ban religious activities on campus,"" he told ucanews.com.

28,28,FL-2016-000044-CHN,China is buying Canada: Inside the new real estate frenzy - Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/chinese-real-estate-investors-are-reshaping-the-market/,"Paul Shen can tick off the reasons Mainland Chinese people buy property in Canada as surely as any fast-talking B.C. realtor. Some long to escape the fouled earth and soupy air of their country’s teeming cities, he explains, while others are following relatives to enclaves so well-populated by other Chinese expats they hardly feel like foreigners.

The richest, of course, regard homes in the West as stable vessels for disposable cash, but Shen lays no claim to such affluence. Last spring, the 39-year-old left behind his middle-management advertising job in Shanghai to seek the dream of home ownership he and his wife couldn’t afford in their home city. “We just followed our hearts to begin a totally different life,” he tells Maclean’s, adding: “We can make the house dream come true in Canada.”

The starting point was one-half of a modest duplex near downtown Victoria, close to the university where his wife is seeking a master’s degree, and priced about right for their limited means. Selling points ranged from the quiet of the street—perfect for their six-year-old son—to the stunning Vancouver Island vistas all around. High on his list, though, was Victoria’s comfortable distance from the bustling Chinese communities of B.C.’s Lower Mainland. As Shen—betraying his limited knowledge of pre-settlement Canadian history—puts it: “We wanted a place that would allow us to live with the natives.”

It’s hard not to smile at his idealism. Substitute any one of two dozen nationalities, after all, and you have a chapter in Canada’s cherished narrative of migration, settlement and shared prosperity.

But as a Chinese newcomer with a buy-at-all-costs resolve, Shen also personifies a phenomenon dividing those “natives” he’d like to call his neighbours. In the past five years, the flow of money from mainland China into Canadian real estate has reached what many consider dangerous levels, contributing to a gold-rush atmosphere in the nation’s leading cities, while stirring anger among young, middle-class Canadians who feel shut out of their hometown markets.

Its impact on Vancouver’s gravity-defying boom is the best known—and most hotly debated—example, as eye-popping price gains leave behind such quaint indicators as average household income, or regional economic activity. “We’re bringing in people who just want to park their money here,” says Justin Fung, a software engineer and second-generation Chinese-Canadian who counts himself among those frustrated by Vancouver’s surreal housing market. “They’re driving up housing prices and simply treat this city as a resort.”

Yet the amphetamine rush of Chinese cash has been felt far beyond the disappearing pastures of the Fraser Valley—especially in the last couple of years. Fully 10 per cent of new condominiums being built in central Toronto are now going to foreign buyers, according to a survey released in April by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC); veterans of the city’s rough-and-tumble real estate market believe the vast majority are mainland Chinese. On Juwai.com, an online listing service where Chinese buyers can look for international real estate, inquiries about specific properties in Ontario rose 143 per cent in 2015, with the total value of those homes hitting $11.2 billion. Quebec saw its numbers more than triple, while Alberta’s numbers rose 70 per cent.

Meanwhile, Chinese developers have made buys in locations that have left analysts scratching their heads, including Nova Scotia’s remote Eastern Shore and an abandoned mining town in the B.C. Interior. The stated reasons for such purchases don’t entirely compute (neither seems the likely site, as owners and local officials suggest, for a full-service, self-contained vacation community).

But the broader incentives are easy to see. Next to China’s own volatile real estate markets, property almost anywhere in the Western world can seem an island of financial sanity, says Matthew Moore, president of Juwai’s North American operations. “The year-on-year property increase in Shenzhen, one of China’s tier-one cities, was close to 60 per cent,” he observes. “This is about wealth preservation.” Adding to that sense of urgency: even the most privileged Chinese mainlanders have for decades been shut out of buying property, which Moore describes as the “favourite asset class” of Chinese dating back to its pre-Revolution days. This is on top of profound worries many Chinese have about their country’s overbearing political system, the lack of transparent rule of law and rampant corruption.

All of which has landed Canada in an economic paradox. In Vancouver, and increasingly Toronto, fear abounds that Chinese money has helped inflate a property balloon of Hindenburg proportions, driving house values out of reach for even well-off professionals, while raising the risk of a crash at the first sign of adverse conditions. Yet the self-same conditions are adding handsomely to the net worth of millions of homeowners, and supporting a constellation of housing-related industries, from real estate sales to interior decoration. They could be considered the main engine of Canada’s stop-and-go economy, and for those along for the ride—builders, property lawyers, revenue-hungry local politicians—the question isn’t so much what Chinese buyers are doing to the Canadian property market. It’s what might happen without them.

How far we’ve travelled down this bejewelled highway is only starting to come clear. The CMHC’s latest condo numbers tracking the ownership of condos were part of a concerted effort on the part of the Crown corporation to measure the phenomenon, based on its mandate to gather data on housing, and to foster market stability. (The agency has been roundly criticized in the past for Canada’s dearth of dependable real estate statistics.) By breaking down the numbers according to the age of the building in question, it provided the first reliable indicator of accelerated foreign buying. In Vancouver, for instance, foreign ownership of condos built before 1990 stands at just two per cent. For structures completed since 2010, that number climbs to six per cent.

CMHC’s plan now is to produce a more comprehensive report by the fourth quarter of this year, says chief economist Bob Dugan, capturing not just condominiums but all forms of residential property. But that won’t be easy. Gathering the data requires co-operation on the part of everyone from provincial property registries to local realtors—not all of whom are eager to shed light on their lucrative sources of new-found income.

It might also require a better understanding of who constitutes a “foreign owner.” The CMHC’s current definition—an owner who does not reside in Canada—excludes all kinds of domestic arrangements under which foreigners purchase homes abroad, suggesting the recent condo numbers understate the influx of outside buyers. It’s common for foreign-based buyers to send their children and spouses here while remaining in their home country. Should such buyers be lumped in with overseas owners of income properties? Or with Chinese Canadians who spend part of the year outside the country?

Yet even the crudest measurements suggest a breathtaking upsurge in interest that would rate Canada’s big cities on par with London and New York in the eyes of Chinese buyers. National Bank of Canada economist Peter Routledge has “hypothesized” that Chinese buyers last year shelled out nearly $12 billion on real estate in Vancouver, accounting for 33 per cent of the city’s sales. For Toronto, he pegged the number at $8.4 billion, representing 14 per cent of sales.

Other analysts have dismissed the estimate, which Routledge produced by combining U.S. foreign investment figures with a survey of property ownership among 77 affluent Chinese people. But the numbers seemed to support an earlier, more controversial, study of home sales in three of Vancouver’s most expensive neighbourhoods, showing that 66 per cent of houses sold during a six-month period starting in September 2014 went to Chinese people with non-anglicized names. The author of that report, an urban planning professor named Andy Yan, interpreted that to mean the buyers were new arrivals. That assumption was enough to draw accusations of racism, but Yan was undaunted, telling CBC, “It’s about the message, not one messenger.”

At least part of the message is beyond dispute: the cash flowing out of China into assets around the world has hit tsunami proportions, driven by fears of a slowing economy and a declining currency. Estimates peg the amount Chinese investors and companies moved out of the country last year at nearly $1 trillion, up more than sevenfold from 2014. Much of that money is being spent by Chinese companies looking to snap up Western assets, such as ChemChina’s US$43-billion bid to take over Swiss seed company Syngenta, or to pay down U.S. dollar-denominated debts. But a sizable portion was directed into overseas real estate.

With diversification as the new mantra, China’s newly rich—as of 2014 there were 3.6 million millionaires in the country—are desperately seeking safer places to park their money. Most put foreign real estate at the top of their list. That’s partly due to its stability, says Jim Zhang, an RBC private banker in Toronto, whose client list includes many so-called “high-net worth” Chinese investors; it’s also born of instinctive suspicion toward their own government. “In Canada, everything in my bank account is mine, as long as I pay tax,” a client recently told him. “In China, even if the government’s name is not on my account, whenever they want my money, they’ll have my money.”

Fortunately for those millionaires, a thriving industry has formed to facilitate their wishes to move their money abroad—and they need not even board a plane. In mid-April, more than 40,000 people crammed into the Beijing International Property & Investment Expo, a four-day mixer of buyers eager to snag deals and sellers eager to snag deep-pocketed investors. Representatives from 31 countries attended, but many of the land-shoppers veered toward the booths covered in Maple Leaf flags. The three Canadian exhibitors barely had time to sit.

Alex Majdpour, president of Sans Souci Executive Realty, hired two additional translators to keep up with the flood of potential buyers, and came away with 100 leads. “We thought, why not take the real estate to them?” says Majdpour, whose Toronto-based company sells properties across Canada. “Why not go straight to the source?” Prospective buyers talked to the Canadian exhibitors about making purchases in cash, and expressed the greatest interest in properties located around Vancouver and Toronto. The sellers fielded repeat questions about immigration and payments, particularly how to get money out of the country. (China limits foreign purchases of currency to $50,000 per year, and has been tightening controls to keep money from flowing elsewhere. This has left lingering questions about how so many mainland Chinese have been able to afford expensive houses abroad.)

There was another factor surely lurking in the minds of prospective buyers at the expo: Canada, with its weakened currency, is on sale. The yuan is fixed to the U.S. dollar, and as the loonie fell against the greenback over the last two years, it raised the buying power of Chinese real estate buyers. “If they’re thinking of buying property in Canada now,” says Zhang, the RBC banker, “they’re getting a 25 or 30 per cent discount.”

While experts try to determine how much money is flowing out of China, there’s no question a good deal of it has come to rest in leafy Vancouver neighbourhoods, sparking anxiety and deep divides in the community. So decoupled have local house prices become from economic fundamentals that it now requires a mind-boggling 109 per cent of the average household’s disposable income to service the costs—like mortgage payments and insurance—needed to own the average home in the city, according to research by the Royal Bank of Canada. There’s no sign things are about to slow down. A recent report by real estate firm Re/Max found prices surged by 24 per cent in the city during the first quarter compared to the same time last year, and pegged the average price of a single family home at $2 million. The real estate firm noted the emergence of a vicious cycle, as intense competition for houses caused would-be sellers to hold off on listing their homes (for fear they won’t be able to afford a new one) thereby limiting the available inventory and driving prices even further into the stratosphere.

The frenzy has taken a visible toll on one of the world’s “most livable cities,” resulting in hollowed-out neighbourhoods, absentee investors, and vacant, decrepit homes as huge numbers of investment properties simply sit unoccupied. What statisticians have been slow to chart has been ruefully documented in popular blogs like Vancouver Vanishes and Beautiful Empty Homes of Vancouver, which tracks empty, multi-million-dollar character and heritage houses.

Frustration has hit a boil, and it’s been on full display at a series of “emergency” housing town halls, headlined by the front bench of the Opposition NDP. Hundreds have turned out to sit in church basements to voice their concerns, and their anger. At one held last week at St. Paul’s Church in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, a new advocacy group with a darkly intimidating acronym HALT—Housing Action for Local Taxpayers—turned up with picket signs.

Among the day’s speakers was David Eby. The Vancouver MLA, a lawyer touted as a future NDP leader, is among those priced out of the local market. Eby and his wife, a nurse currently in medical school, recently sold their 530-sq.-ft., one-bedroom condo in Kitsilano, which was too cramped for the two of them and their 19-month-old toddler. “A two-bedroom condo in my constituency starts at $600,000—a non-starter for us,” he says. So they’re renting a $2,700-a-month two-bedroom condo at UBC. It is, to put it mildly, a sobering thought: the man many believe could one day lead B.C. might soon be priced out of the province’s foremost city.

Eby bristles at the Boomer notion this is all just a bunch of Millennial whining. “The expectation that young people have is not as advertised—it’s not a detached home they’re after. It’s: ‘Can I have a separate bedroom for my kids?’ If you spend 10 minutes talking to any of the Millennials who are just holding on in this city by their fingernails, you’ll realize very quickly these people are anything but entitled,” he says. “They’re living in substandard rental accommodation just for the privilege of being in Vancouver, and contributing to the economy here—and they won’t do that forever. They’re going to vote with their feet.”

Last November, the 38-year-old lawyer and former head of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association helped Andy Yan, acting director of SFU’s City Program, with his headline-grabbing study on home buying in Eby’s West Side riding. In addition to the incendiary data involving Chinese names, the study revealed that 36 per cent of owners on homes worth an average of $3.05 million listed their occupations as housewives or students with little or no income. Fully 18 per cent of the 172 homes purchased were not mortgaged by banks. That means on Vancouver’s West Side alone over a six-month period last year, roughly $100 million in cash came pouring into Canada, almost all of it from China. Yet the homeowners would in all likelihood pay little or no income tax. The total value of all homes sold in the study period topped a half-billion dollars.

Predictably, when Yan’s study was published, a chorus of voices, including former developer Bob Ransford, jumped to criticize Yan: “The danger is intolerance, racism, singling out certain groups of people saying they’re to blame for this,” said Ransford. But such labels have failed to muffle the debate, particularly as more and more Chinese-Canadian voices have begun calling out white developers and academics for making the claim. Fung, the software engineer, says he’s among those “deeply pissed off” by what he considers a slur: “The only people claiming racism are white Anglo-Saxon males—that’s it. These are the same guys trying to label Andy Yan—whose grandparents paid the head tax—a racist? It’s absurd.”

That sentiment is shared by Ian Young, the South China Morning Post’s Vancouver correspondent and author of the popular Hongcouver blog. Young, who is ethnically Chinese and was raised in Australia and Hong Kong, says the issue is one of money, not of race. “What defines those people in terms of their behaviour here in Vancouver, and in terms of their impact on affordability, is not their ‘Chineseness,’ it’s their ‘millionaireness,’ ” he says. “The idea that there is commonality to be found in the Chineseness—I find that kind of insulting. Why would you think that someone was better defined by the colour of their skin than the colour of their money?”

This is why Fung believes it is so vitally important for Chinese-Canadian voices to encourage a debate over the impact of foreign investment on the local market. “Chinese people have a tendency to be a little quiet, we tend to want to not create ripples—culturally it’s something we’re not comfortable with.”

One oft-cited culprit for the barrage of offshore money are government programs aimed at bringing wealthy foreigners to this country—namely Canada’s now-infamous Immigrant Investor Program. Created in 1986 by the Mulroney government, it granted permanent residency to any foreign citizen willing to fork over $800,000, repayable without interest after five years. In effect, Canada had a nearly two-decade run of selling passports—on the cheap. (The U.S. demanded its investor-class immigrants create at least 10 jobs each, and Australia charged twice what Canada did.)

In recent years, it became increasingly common for investor-class immigrants to set their children up in Canada to study, while the family’s main breadwinner continued to work and pay income taxes elsewhere. One federal study unearthed by Young showed that even after five years in Canada more than 60 per cent of investor-class immigrants reported no annual income earnings at all. And those who did reported earnings of just $21,000—less than that of refugees.

When the program was finally suspended in 2012, and subsequently cancelled altogether two years later, there was a backlog of some 65,000 applicants. Quebec, meanwhile, is still running its own, identical version. But very few of its investor-class immigrants actually remain in the province. Data collected by Vancouver lawyer Richard Kurland shows that 94 per cent of those who arrived in Quebec in 2008 left shortly thereafter—most bound for metro Vancouver.

David Duff, a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Peter A. Allard School of Law, calls such schemes “bizarre” since they do nothing to prevent wealthy newcomers from dodging Canadian income taxes, providing they spend less than 183 days per year in the country and maintain a residence and business overseas. “Others wonder why these folks get to be treated that way while the rest of us get taxed on our worldwide income,” says Duff, “And the consequence, as we’ve all seen, is the bidding up of house prices in Vancouver.” He’s seen it first-hand: Duff recently sold his own tony West Side home to an offshore buyer.

There’s another side to the story, however. Yuen Pau Woo, the former president of the Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, doesn’t dispute the impact of so-called “millionaire migrants” on Vancouver’s affordability crisis. But he takes issue with the notion Canada isn’t receiving anything in return. Eventually, Woo says, many wealthy Chinese who used the program to gain access to Canada seek to “align” their personal lives in Canada with their business interests overseas—if for no other reason than to minimize the stress of living apart from their families for six months of the year. As evidence, he points to the half-dozen Chinese firms, including Poly Culture Group, a division of a massive Chinese conglomerate, that he’s helped convince to set up shop in the Lower Mainland through a venture called HQ Vancouver. “Every single one has a Vancouver connection,” he says—usually a CEO or chairman who already owns a house in the city or sends his children to school there. “How many more of these kinds of opportunities are out there waiting for us to activate them?”

The silent, happy majority in all this, of course, is the thousands of Canadian homeowners who have sold their homes for an enormous profit, and the millions more watching their home values climb into the stratosphere—more than 70 per cent of Canadian households own their own home, and many are watching their property values soar with an eye to their retirement. In Richmond Hill, Ont., a Toronto suburb favoured by many Chinese investors, standard four-bedroom homes are now typically priced around $1.3 million, and routinely sell for $300,000 over asking. For now, this is a distinctly uptown economic problem.

With so much cash sloshing about, people outside Canada’s urban hot zones are understandably keen to join the merriment. Last spring, politicians and economic development officials in Nova Scotia welcomed with fanfare the purchase of a series of properties by DongDu International Group, a Shanghai-based development company touting plans for two full-service vacation resorts catering to wealthy, young Chinese professionals. It was hoped the developments would bring much-needed economic activity to the stagnant region of Guysborough County, northeast of Halifax. An additional pair of properties DongDu bought in the capital were supposed to be the beachhead for a centre of excellence for the film industry.

Draped in a souvenir tartan scarf, and accompanied by local dignitaries, the company’s founder, Li Hailin, traipsed through the grass in Guysborough last May for a groundbreaking. Since then, however, nary a shovel has touched the 1,300 hectares of land on the Eastern Shore, leaving many to wonder whether the development plans are for real. Michael Mosher, warden of the district of St. Mary’s, says his council has not yet seen a formal proposal, or a definite timeline. “Because of the state of the global economy,” he said, “they want to make sure when they launch the project, they’ve got the right timing.” A spokeswoman for the Halifax Partnership says the city’s economic development agency is no longer working directly with DongDu, noting that a memorandum of co-operation it signed with the firm expires next month. A request for an interview left with DongDu’s offices in Halifax went unanswered.

Still, even if Chinese investors are disproportionately focused on Toronto and Vancouver, there can be little doubt they’re playing a role in keeping the country’s decade-long housing boom from collapsing under its own weight. It’s difficult to overstate just how important real estate has been for the Canadian economy in recent years. A report a few years ago by Altus Group, a Toronto-based property consulting firm, estimated that home renovations alone contributed as much as four per cent of Canada’s GDP in 2014, or about $64 billion. Add in new home construction, realtors, lawyers and other associated industries and the residential housing industry is responsible for as much as 20 per cent of Canada’s economy. That’s to say nothing of the cottage industry in reality TV the country has spawned over the past decade—everything from Love It or List It and Property Brothers to the ubiquitous Mike Holmes.

With Canadians already owing $1.65 on average for every dollar of disposable income they earn, there were ready signs that domestic buyers were tapped out. The sudden influx of Chinese money over the past couple of years was akin to throwing gasoline onto a slowly dying fire. Which is why no politician in their right mind is likely to take a hard stance against foreign buyers. Says Duff, the UBC law professor, “Nobody wants to shut it down, because it’s like a drug. We always need another fix.”

The multi-trillion-dollar question for Canada’s vulnerable housing market, and the economy that increasingly depends on it, is whether China’s interest in buying Canada is a simply a passing fancy or a stabilizing long-term play. It’s one of the concerns the CMHC hopes to address by charting the behaviour of foreign buyers over time. “If investors are primarily in the market to make a quick buck—to buy a unit, make a capital gain over six months to a year, flip the unit and get out—that can be problematic behaviour,” says Dugan, the chief economist. “We would want to be able to measure to what extent that’s going on.”

Those who have studied the Chinese appetite for buying foreign properties sketch a less dramatic picture, albeit one that’s still less than reassuring. A survey of 150 agents in China by Investorist, an Australian company that markets international properties online, found the vast majority of would-be Chinese purchasers, nearly 90 per cent, have a budget between $500,000 and $1 million—not unlike many Canadians who are seeking to buy a home in Vancouver or Toronto these days. “The majority of Chinese buyers are families that can afford an investment property and possibly a second one,” says Jon Ellis, the company’s founder. “These are mom-and-pop investors who might own a car dealership or a bakery.” Moreover, the report found that most Chinese seeking to buy overseas “wish to use leverage where possible,” which may also have something to do with the need to circumvent Beijing’s $50,000-per-year limit on foreign transactions.

It all points to a group of foreign buyers that, while large and motivated, remain financially mortal, and can therefore be expected to panic alongside everyone else if Canada’s housing market begins to falter. And, as foreign money continues to flood both Toronto and Vancouver, there’s plenty of evidence of ultra-sketchy, speculative behavior that’s not limited to offshore buyers: bidding wars, properties purchased unseen and without conditions, so-called “shadow flipping” by realtors, the creation of shell corporations allowing buyers to avoid being named in transaction documents, accusations of money laundering, and unfair tax avoidance. The list goes on.

The risks for Canada don’t end there. While the turbulent Chinese economy has so far prompted China’s elite to move their money to locales perceived as safer, a full-blown crisis in the Middle Kingdom could well have the opposite effect. If offshore investors suddenly believe their livelihoods are at risk, they may have no choice but to quickly offload overseas houses and other assets in order to pay back creditors. In other words, instead of simply fretting about overzealous Canadians sparking a major housing crash, now we need to worry about a made-in-China crisis, too.

Can anything be done? In B.C., a group of economists is proposing a two per cent anti-speculation tax, which would penalize buyers who let homes sit empty. The idea is to generate a little revenue ($90 million is anticipated in the first year), but more important, to track activity: How many units are owned by people who don’t pay any tax in British Columbia? How many condo units are owned by people who don’t rent them out, and leave them vacant? How is this money entering Canada? At this point, the government doesn’t have a clue.

“If the flow starts in a clandestine way there is no way to regulate it at the other end,” says David Mulroney, former Canadian ambassador to China, adding that every time he spoke to university students in China he was asked whether it was true Canada is a haven for Chinese fraudsters. “We have no idea where the money is coming from, how it was sourced—all of it contributes to an alarming lack of awareness in the local real estate markets,” says Mulroney, current president of St. Michael’s College at the University of Toronto.

Others point to countries like Australia, which requires foreign purchases to be vetted by its foreign investment review board and approved only if they contribute to the creation of new housing stock. A similar approach has been proposed for the U.K. Ellis, however, says the policy hasn’t done much to rein in house prices Down Under, since there are many ways for determined offshore investors to circumvent the rules.

In any case, it’s not exactly Canada as the country imagines itself—cowering from foreigners willing to pay for a taste of our order and civility; wondering if the next big purchase will nudge us into social dislocation, or corruption requiring aggressive government intervention. If for no one else, you’d hope we might get ahead of the problem for the sake of Paul Shen, who’s settling into his new home in Victoria.

The flooring company also is facing a national class-action lawsuit over concerns about the quality of some bamboo flooring.

A local family shared their story as a warning to customers in metro Detroit.

""It was just demoralizing because we spent all this money and ... we're left with a house that has problems all over the flooring,"" said James Rose, who has been working on this battle with his parents.

First, a look back at a rocky time for Lumber Liquidators. In March of 2015, CBS ""60 Minutes"" reported the retailer's laminates from China contained excessive level of formaldehyde. Months later, the company stopped the sale of all Chinese-made flooring and the CEO resigned. Lumber Liquidators offered free independent air quality tests to give customers objective, scientific information about the flooring it has sold.

Bamboo flooring battle

As that problem was making national headlines, the Rose family of Lake Orion was fighting it's own battle with Lumber Liquidators over the Morning Star bamboo flooring they purchased in late 2014. The family paid about $11,000 for the flooring and installation started in February of 2015.

The contractor hired by the family, Tom Perry, says he saw problems with the flooring immediately. He says the bamboo started to separate just days after he started to lay it down.

""I've never had issue like this with any kind of flooring I've put in,"" said Perry, who has been in the home renovation business for 40 years. ""I've worked with wood for a long time. I know it expands and retracts ... but this wood started doing it two to three days after we installed it.""

The family was frustrated and started to appeal to Lumber Liquidators, looking for solutions. The contractor, Tom Perry, says he's guided several clients to Lumber Liquidators for flooring and never had an issue until now. He says a salesman told the family they wouldn't have any issues with the bamboo for 30 years.

Class-action lawsuit

That claim is reflected in a class-action lawsuit filed in California in December of 2014. Although it's received less publicity than the safety concerns, the suit raises some questions about Lumber Liquidators Morning Star bamboo flooring.

The suit alleges Lumber Liquidators has created expectations that its bamboo flooring will last for 30 years, but claims ""the product is subject to premature cracking, splitting, warping, and shrinking all well before the warranted useful life.""

The Rose family has reached out to the law firm behind the class-action suit and is considering whether they might join the suit or file their own legal action.

""It's very upsetting because we're just a small family and we're going up against a multi-billion dollar corporation,"" said James Rose.

Lumber Liquidators response

In a letter to the Rose family, Lumber Liquidators blames the issues in their home on problems with installation and complaints there may have been too much humidity in the family's Lake Orion home.

Ad

The contractor, Tom Perry, says he followed all the manufacturer specifications for installation. Perry and the Rose family are surprised humidity is getting the blame especially in Michigan.

""Their humidity level, I think, as far as any house in Michigan is regulated as good as you can get it,"" said Perry.

The Rose family would still like a full refund but Lumber Liquidators is not budging.

The family says they never thought to ask the salesperson about humidity levels in their home before buying the bamboo flooring, and they want other customers in Michigan to know that's apparently something you should be asking when you're at the store.

""I don't understand why they would sell a product in an area that has humidity that would impact all the homes,"" asks James Rose.

Help Me Hank contacted Lumber Liquidators on behalf of the Rose family. The company said it could not discuss the lawsuit as it does not comment on pending litigation.

A spokesperson released this statement:

""Lumber Liquidators' bamboo products are popular and beautiful flooring options that, like all flooring products, require proper installation and a suitable home environment for peak performance. Lumber Liquidators clearly communicates these processes and requirements to customers at the time of purchase. Nonetheless, we regret Mr. Rose's experience and sent an inspector to his home. The inspector found that the contractor did not test for moisture as required and failed to install transition strips that allow floating floors to move as intended. These issues were compounded by humidity levels in the home above 55 percent, a level that's not only not ideal for flooring, but breeds mold and other health issues. Lumber Liquidators recommends ensuring a thorough understanding of the product instructions before purchase and installation.""

Maersk Line said Friday that the Safmarine Meru safely arrived alongside at the Meishan container terminal in the Port of Ningbo at approximately 17:10 local time after being towed 78 nautical miles from the site of Sunday’s accident.

“We are pleased for the Safmarine Meru to be safely berthed and that all crew remain safe, sound and accounted for. I would like to thank the local Chinese authorities for their cooperation and assistance rendered in the response to this incident. Our current priorities are to safely discharge the cargo and conduct inspections to further survey the damages to the vessel,” said Palle Laursen, Head of Ship Management.

The Safmarine Meru collided with the Northern Jasper, a German-owned containership, early on May 8 while approximately 120 nautical miles east of Ningbo. The collision caused severe damage and a fire onboard to break out the Safmarine Meru, forcing its crew of 22 abandoned ship. No injuries were reported on board either vessel.

The 4,650 TEU Safmarine Meru was sailing from Qingdao to Ningbo, China with less than 400 full containers on board when the incident occurred.

(Photo courtesy of Myanmar Army's commander-in-chief office)

Activists and politicians from Myanmar's Christian-stronghold Kachin State have blamed environmental degradation from a US$500 million a year logging industry for the destruction of hundreds of houses destroyed by floods and landslides in late April.

About 110 houses were destroyed and more than 700 people from seven villages of the Chipwi township near the Chinese border were hit by floods and landslides April 24.

Those affected remain in dire need of food as aid groups struggle to reach the isolated area.

The villagers are from the ethnic and mostly Christian Lisu minority, who also practice slash and burn agriculture.

The flood-affected region is under the control of the military and the local military group, the New Democratic Army-Kachin (NDA-K).

The area has been at peace since 1990, when the militia signed a cease-fire with the Myanmar government. Since then, the NDA-K has generated most of its income from logging, according to the Irrawaddy report.

Steven Tsa Ji, general secretary of Kachin Development Networking Group, said the recent disaster is the result of intensive logging and mining conducted by Chinese companies.

""This is a man-made disaster, which brings trouble for civilians. It is a very dangerous area for people to live. The situation may worsen if more flooding occurs,"" Tsa Ji told ucanews.com.

Kachin State is predominately 90 percent Christian, and has been beset by sporadic fighting for several decades. More than 100,000 people remain displaced since fighting restarted in 2011.

Lar Mar Lay, a Christian and Lower House lawmaker, said he expects to arrive there next week to assess the situation and will report back to the national parliament.

Lama Lay, who is from landslide-affected area, told ucanews.com that the region's underdeveloped infrastructure has been severely damaged by the affects of logging and mining by Chinese companies.

The main road can't be used, while humanitarian aid has been flown in military via helicopters twice, he said.

""Transportation challenges are hindering aid groups,"" added Lar Mar Lay.

A London-based Environmental Investigation Agency estimated that the illegal timber trade between Kachin and China's Yunnan province exceeded 900,000 cubic meters of logs in 2014 and was worth around US$500 million.

Myanmar has the third-worst deforestation rate in the world and the country had lost an estimated 546,000 hectares of forest cover each year since 2010, according to a 2015 report by the U.N.

The pair, a child and a woman, were washed away while trying to cross a bridge in Crossmoor, Chatsworth.

A third day of searching for them proved futile for police who also had to contend with illegal electricity connections and weakened banks, which left some informal dwellings in precarious positions.

The search resumed on Tuesday.

Chatsworth councillor, Jayraj Singh, said it was in situations like these where more people’s lives were endangered because of illegal electricity connections.

“This area has a serious problem with illegal connections and we have been appealing to people to desist from doing so. We are still working towards locating the families of the missing people,” he said.

Almost 70 families in 129 homes were affected by the torrent and needed shelter, clothes and meals.

Areas where homes and roads were damaged are Reservoir Hills, Sea Cow Lake, Amaoti, St Wendolins, Siyanda in KwaMashu and Lamontville.

Those displaced are being accommodated at community halls in their respective areas.

At least six people were killed in separate incidents at the weekend as a result of the rain. KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, said there could be more rains coming to Durban.

“We will continue with our early warning support whenever we foresee danger. We ask our communities to co-operate with the instructions of our disaster management personnel. It is, however, important to indicate that we are in full control of the situation and so far we are swiftly and successfully responding to all the reported incidents,” she said.

eThekwini mayor, James Nxumalo, said emergency and disaster teams were concluding assessments and would release a report this week.

“We will then allow mop-up operations to start and our medium- to long-term measures will be implemented.”

Their excess-related behaviour has been frowned upon since 2012 when Ling Gu, son of high-ranking government official Ling Jihua, crashed his Ferrari 458 Spider in Beijing.

Ling Gu, aged 23, was killed in the crash and three female passengers, two of whom were found naked with the other in a partial state of undress, were seriously injured.

BACKLASH AGAINST THE FEURADI In April 2013 a series of scandals shone a light on the generation's shocking and excessive behaviour. Shanghai Daily reported on rumours of a fuerdai sex and drug party in Sanya, Hainan province. Officials investigated a yacht show bash there after hearing reports of a model selling sex at the party for 600,000 Yuan (£62,000). A woman named Guo Meimei, who is now 23 and was considered to be the queen of the fuerdais, was accused by a male rival, Chen Junyu, of selling sex in Sanya. She responded by posting a picture of 5 million Yuan's-worth (£516,000) of casino chips online along with the caption: 'Too rich to need to sell sex.' Chen replied by posting a screenshot of a bank account showing a balance of 3.7billion Yuan (£382million). The duo's exchange prompted outrage from Chinese netizens. Miss Guo fell from grace when, after being arrested for gambling crimes, she admitted she had accepted money for sex in the past. Advertisement

Mentions of the crash were censored on Chinese social media as the government was accused of trying to cover up the incident, fuelling the public's hatred of this protected generation.

This year another Beijing supercar smash-up helped ignite a further backlash.

On April 11 a 21 year-old man surnamed Tang driving a Lamborghini and a 20-year-old man surnamed Yu driving a Ferrari wrote off their cars in a tunnel.

“The European Parliament will discuss the report that will open Europe visa-free for Turkish citizens. If the wrong decision is taken, we will send the refugees,” Burhan Kuzu, an adviser to Erdoğan, wrote on Twitter.

The threat is not new, but this time it’s addressed to the European Parliament which made it clear that Turkey should not expect a visa waiver if it has not fulfilled all the requirements for the visa liberalisation deal.

Erdogan threatens to send refugees to the EU by plane and bus Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an today (11 February) slammed EU and UN pressure to open Turkey’s borders to more refugees, threatening to send the millions already in the country to other states.

The visa deal depends on the ratification by the European Parliament, and of some national parliaments, who would also like to have their say.

Commission admits visa-free travel for Turks depends on national parliaments The European Commission today (4 May) proposed that Turkish nationals would enjoy visa-free travel to the EU’s Schengen zone by the end of June, praising Ankara for its fast delivery on meeting the necessary conditions. But Commission experts admit that national parliaments could upturn the deal.

‘Dangerous moment’

The refugee deal is facing “a very dangerous moment” as the two sides wrangle over Ankara’s fulfilment of its terms, a Turkish minister warned yesterday (11 May).

“All the agreements we have achieved until now, built on confidence, goodwill, taking responsibilities, and also taking political risks, is facing a very dangerous moment,” Turkey’s EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkır said at a news conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz.

Bozkır said Turkey had basically fulfilled the terms of the deal, even though Brussels is insisting Ankara meet five more benchmarks before Turkish nationals can enjoy visa-free travel to Europe.

“This not a mathematics problem. This is a political problem,” Bozkır said of the five benchmarks during a visit to the European parliament in the French city of Strasbourg.

The five benchmarks still to be met by Turkey concern passing measures to prevent corruption, aligning its legislation by the EU on data protection, concluding an agreement with Europol, agreeing to work with all EU members on criminal matters, and bringing the country’s definition of terrorism in line with EU standards.

“Our interpretation is that we have fulfilled our expectations sufficiently enough,” he added.

Bozkır reiterated Erdoğan’s opposition to changing Turkey’s anti-terror legislation, which the EU says is one of the five outstanding benchmarks left from a list of 72.

Erdogan says Turkey will not change its anti-terrorism law Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Saturday (7 May) accused European nations of hypocrisy in pressing his country on terror laws while “sidelining democracy” at home in their own fight against terrorism.

It would be “completely impossible” for Turkey to change the anti-terrorism law which is “relevant to European standards”, he said.

Must do more

With Turkey in the throes of a major campaign against Kurdish militants, Ankara has said it does not have the luxury of being able to change its anti-terror laws, but analysts have warned that the problem risks blocking the deal with the EU.

Speaking to the European Parliament, European Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos said that Turkey had “made really substantial progress in fulfilling the visa liberalisation roadmap” but must take further steps.

Turkey, he said, must do more to fight corruption, align personal data protection laws with EU standards and conclude an operational cooperation agreement with Europol, the EU law enforcement agency.

He also said it must offer “effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters to all member states” and “better align” its counter-terror laws and practices with EU standards.

Avramopoulos said that the overall migrant deal had already led to a “clear reduction” of irregular migrant arrivals to Greece from 6,000 a day in October last year to a daily figure of around 140 in April.

According to executive vp international Guy Henderson, the film/TV licensing business in China -- where Sony/ATV operates two offices, the other in Shanghai -- has doubled since 2011 to ""a few dozen synchs"" every year. A key reason for the expansion? China's exploding middle class, which a fall 2015 report by Credit Suisse named the biggest in the world. That population boom has spurred increases in advertising, including for such high-ticket items as ­luxury cars. To wit: Sony/ATV has licensed nine songs for Chinese car commercials, including Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" The Who's ""My Generation"" and Queen's ""I Was Born to Love You."" Says Henderson: ""The most [common] requests are for pop music or iconic songs, such as 'Happy Together,' 'Over the Rainbow,' 'We Are the Champions' and 'We Will Rock You.'""

With licensing for both film and TV on the upswing -- as well as exposure to Anglo repertoire through legitimate ­streaming services -- Henderson expects China to be a significant revenue producer for Sony/ATV in the future. Currently, China is well behind the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, but Henderson predicts that ""in time, it will become our biggest territory behind the U.K. and the U.S.""

Central, Thailand’s biggest retailer led by tycoon Tos Chirathivat, is expected to gain at least 50 billion baht ($1.4 billion) from the sale of its 25 percent holding, said one person close to the sale process.

The deal will allow TCC to cement its control of Big C Supercenter without worrying about interference from Central which founded the Thai retail firm in 1993 before selling a majority stake to France's Casino CASP.PA six years later.

The latest spate of deals stem from Casino’s decision to sell its Thai and Vietnam units this year in an effort to cut debt. Both businesses encompass hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores.

Central lost out to TCC's flagship retail unit Berli Jucker BJC.BK in the battle to gain control of the Thai unit. But it emerged the winner for the Vietnam unit, called Big C Vietnam, agreeing to pay 920 million euros ($1.1 billion).

The people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. Central and Berli did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Berli made a mandatory offer for the all the shares it does not own after buying Casino’s 58.6 percent stake. Berli is expected to own more than 85 percent of Big C Supercenter once the tender offer closes on May 11, the sources said.

Central’s purchase of Big C Vietnam is part of rush of deals in the country by Thai firms. They have been attracted by a quadrupling in average incomes during 15 years of economic growth at over 5 percent, and are keen to hedge against political and economic uncertainty back home after a military coup two years ago.

Vietnam’s swelling middle-class also sees Thai products as better and more affordable than Japanese and Korean imports, and vastly preferable to the cheap but unpopular goods that flood across the border from China.

50,50,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Who rules the world? America is no longer the obvious answer - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/noam-chomsky-who-rules-the-world-us-foregin-policy,"When we ask “who rules the world?” we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states, primarily the great powers, and we consider their decisions and the relations among them. That is not wrong. But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleading.

States, of course, have complex internal structures, and the choices and decisions of the political leadership are heavily influenced by internal concentrations of power, while the general population is often marginalized. That is true even for the more democratic societies, and obviously for others. We cannot gain a realistic understanding of who rules the world while ignoring the “masters of mankind”, as Adam Smith called them: in his day, the merchants and manufacturers of England; in ours, multinational conglomerates, huge financial institutions, retail empires and the like.

Still following Smith, it is also wise to attend to the “vile maxim” to which the “masters of mankind” are dedicated: “All for ourselves and nothing for other people” – a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war, often one-sided, much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the world.

In the contemporary global order, the institutions of the masters hold enormous power, not only in the international arena but also within their home states, on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of means.

When we consider the role of the masters of mankind, we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the investor-rights agreements mislabeled “free-trade agreements” in propaganda and commentary. They are negotiated in secret, apart from the hundreds of corporate lawyers and lobbyists writing the crucial details. The intention is to have them adopted in good Stalinist style with “fast track” procedures designed to block discussion and allow only the choice of yes or no (hence yes).

The designers regularly do quite well, not surprisingly. People are incidental, with the consequences one might anticipate.

The second superpower

The neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy, but they have aroused opposition as well, most prominently in Latin America but also in the centers of global power.

The European Union (EU), one of the more promising developments of the post-world war II period, has been tottering because of the harsh effect of the policies of austerity during recession, condemned even by the economists of the International Monetary Fund (if not the IMF’s political actors).

Democracy has been undermined as decision-making shifted to the Brussels bureaucracy, with the northern banks casting their shadow over their proceedings.

Mainstream parties have been rapidly losing members to left and to right. The executive director of the Paris-based research group EuropaNova attributes the general disenchantment to “a mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders [who, in principle at least, are subject to democratic politics] to the market, the institutions of the European Union and corporations”, quite in accord with neoliberal doctrine.

Very similar processes are under way in the United States, for somewhat similar reasons, a matter of significance and concern not just for the country but, because of US power, for the world.

The rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention: it sets aside the public, which often fails to accept the approved role of “spectators” (rather than “participants”) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory. Such disobedience has always been of concern to the dominant classes. Just keeping to American history, George Washington regarded the common people who formed the militias that he was to command as “an exceedingly dirty and nasty people [evincing] an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people”.

In Violent Politics, his masterful review of insurgencies from “the American insurgency” to contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq, William Polk concludes that General Washington “was so anxious to sideline [the fighters he despised] that he came close to losing the Revolution”. Indeed, he “might have actually done so” had France not massively intervened and “saved the Revolution”, which until then had been won by guerrillas – whom we would now call “terrorists” – while Washington’s British-style army “was defeated time after time and almost lost the war”.

It is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me

A common feature of successful insurgencies, Polk records, is that once popular support dissolves after victory, the leadership suppresses the “dirty and nasty people” who actually won the war with guerrilla tactics and terror, for fear that they might challenge class privilege. The elites’ contempt for “the lower class of these people” has taken various forms throughout the years.

In recent times one expression of this contempt is the call for passivity and obedience (“moderation in democracy”) by liberal internationalists reacting to the dangerous democratizing effects of the popular movements of the 1960s.

Sometimes states do choose to follow public opinion, eliciting much fury in centers of power. One dramatic case was in 2003, when the Bush administration called on Turkey to join its invasion of Iraq.

Ninety-five percent of Turks opposed that course of action and, to the amazement and horror of Washington, the Turkish government adhered to their views. Turkey was bitterly condemned for this departure from responsible behavior. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, designated by the press as the “idealist-in-chief” of the administration, berated the Turkish military for permitting the malfeasance of the government and demanded an apology. Unperturbed by these and innumerable other illustrations of our fabled “yearning for democracy”, respectable commentary continued to laud President George W Bush for his dedication to “democracy promotion”, or sometimes criticized him for his naivete in thinking that an outside power could impose its democratic yearnings on others.

The Turkish public was not alone. Global opposition to US-UK aggression was overwhelming. Support for Washington’s war plans scarcely reached 10% almost anywhere, according to international polls. Opposition sparked huge worldwide protests, in the United States as well, probably the first time in history that imperial aggression was strongly protested even before it was officially launched.

On the front page of the New York Times, journalist Patrick Tyler reported that “there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion”.

Unprecedented protest in the US was a manifestation of the opposition to aggression that began decades earlier in the condemnation of the US wars in Indochina, reaching a scale that was substantial and influential, even if far too late.

By 1967, when the antiwar movement was becoming a significant force, military historian and Vietnam specialist Bernard Fall warned that “Vietnam as a cultural and historic entity … is threatened with extinction … [as] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size”.

But the antiwar movement did become a force that could not be ignored. Nor could it be ignored when Ronald Reagan came into office determined to launch an assault on Central America. His administration mimicked closely the steps John F Kennedy had taken 20 years earlier in launching the war against South Vietnam, but had to back off because of the kind of vigorous public protest that had been lacking in the early 1960s.

The assault was awful enough. The victims have yet to recover. But what happened to South Vietnam and later all of Indochina, where “the second superpower” imposed its impediments only much later in the conflict, was incomparably worse.

It is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me.

Again, the invasion was horrifying enough, and its aftermath is utterly grotesque. Nevertheless, it could have been far worse.

Vice-President Dick Cheney, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, and the rest of Bush’s top officials could never even contemplate the sort of measures that President Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson adopted 40 years earlier largely without protest.

Western power under pressure

There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China’s rise to power and its challenge to the US and “world order”, the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe, the global war on terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations.

The challenges faced by western power at the outset of 2016 are usefully summarized within the conventional framework by Gideon Rachman, chief foreign-affairs columnist for the London Financial Times. He begins by reviewing the western picture of world order: “Ever since the end of the cold war, the overwhelming power of the US military has been the central fact of international politics.”

This is particularly crucial in three regions: east Asia, where “the US navy has become used to treating the Pacific as an ‘American lake’”; Europe, where Nato – meaning the United States, which “accounts for a staggering three-quarters of Nato’s military spending” – “guarantees the territorial integrity of its member states”; and the Middle East, where giant US naval and air bases “exist to reassure friends and to intimidate rivals”.

The problem of world order today, Rachman continues, is that “these security orders are now under challenge in all three regions” because of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Syria, and because of China turning its nearby seas from an American lake to “clearly contested water”.

The fundamental question of international relations, then, is whether the US should “accept that other major powers should have some kind of zone of influence in their neighborhoods”. Rachman thinks it should, for reasons of “diffusion of economic power around the world – combined with simple common sense”.

There are, to be sure, ways of looking at the world from different standpoints. But let us keep to these three regions, surely critically important ones.

The challenges today: east Asia

Beginning with the “American lake”, some eyebrows might be raised over the report in mid-December 2015 that “an American B-52 bomber on a routine mission over the South China Sea unintentionally flew within two nautical miles of an artificial island built by China, senior defense officials said, exacerbating a hotly divisive issue for Washington and Beijing”.

Those familiar with the grim record of the 70 years of the nuclear weapons era will be all too aware that this is the kind of incident that has often come perilously close to igniting terminal nuclear war. One need not be a supporter of China’s provocative and aggressive actions in the South China Sea to notice that the incident did not involve a Chinese nuclear-capable bomber in the Caribbean, or off the coast of California, where China has no pretensions of establishing a “Chinese lake”. Luckily for the world.

Chinese leaders understand very well that their country’s maritime trade routes are ringed with hostile powers from Japan through the Malacca Straits and beyond, backed by overwhelming US military force. Accordingly, China is proceeding to expand westward with extensive investments and careful moves toward integration.

In part, these developments are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes the central Asian states and Russia, and soon India and Pakistan with Iran as one of the observers – a status that was denied to the US, which was also called on to close all military bases in the region. China is constructing a modernized version of the old silk roads, with the intent not only of integrating the region under Chinese influence, but also of reaching Europe and the Middle Eastern oil-producing regions. It is pouring huge sums into creating an integrated Asian energy and commercial system, with extensive high-speed rail lines and pipelines.

One element of the program is a highway through some of the world’s tallest mountains to the new Chinese-developed port of Gwadar in Pakistan, which will protect oil shipments from potential US interference.

The program may also, China and Pakistan hope, spur industrial development in Pakistan, which the United States has not undertaken despite massive military aid, and might also provide an incentive for Pakistan to clamp down on domestic terrorism, a serious issue for China in western Xinjiang province. Gwadar will be part of China’s “string of pearls”, bases being constructed in the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes but potentially also for military use, with the expectation that China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf for the first time in the modern era.

All of these moves remain immune to Washington’s overwhelming military power, short of annihilation by nuclear war, which would destroy the US as well.

In 2015, China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), with itself as the main shareholder. Fifty-six nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June, including US allies Australia, Britain and others which joined in defiance of Washington’s wishes. The US and Japan were absent.

Some analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions (the IMF and the World Bank), in which the United States holds veto power. There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to Nato.

The challenges today: eastern Europe

Turning to the second region, eastern Europe, there is a crisis brewing at the Nato-Russian border. It is no small matter.

In his illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region, Frontline Ukraine: Crisis in the Borderlands, Richard Sakwa writes – all too plausibly – that the “Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 was in effect the first of the ‘wars to stop Nato enlargement’; the Ukraine crisis of 2014 is the second. It is not clear whether humanity would survive a third.”

The west sees Nato enlargement as benign. Not surprisingly, Russia, along with much of the Global South, has a different opinion, as do some prominent western voices. George Kennan warned early on that Nato enlargement is a “tragic mistake”, and he was joined by senior American statesmen in an open letter to the White House describing it as a “policy error of historic proportions”.

The present crisis has its origins in 1991, with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. There were then two contrasting visions of a new security system and political economy in Eurasia. In Sakwa’s words, one vision was of a “‘Wider Europe’, with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the Euro-Atlantic security and political community; and on the other side there [was] the idea of ‘Greater Europe’, a vision of a continental Europe, stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok, that has multiple centers, including Brussels, Moscow and Ankara, but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continent”.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was the major proponent of Greater Europe, a concept that also had European roots in Gaullism and other initiatives. However, as Russia collapsed under the devastating market reforms of the 1990s, the vision faded, only to be renewed as Russia began to recover and seek a place on the world stage under Vladimir Putin who, along with his associate Dmitry Medvedev, has repeatedly “called for the geopolitical unification of all of ‘Greater Europe’ from Lisbon to Vladivostok, to create a genuine ‘strategic partnership’”.

These initiatives were “greeted with polite contempt”, Sakwa writes, regarded as “little more than a cover for the establishment of a ‘Greater Russia’ by stealth” and an effort to “drive a wedge” between North America and western Europe. Such concerns trace back to earlier cold war fears that Europe might become a “third force” independent of both the great and minor superpowers and moving toward closer links to the latter (as can be seen in Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik and other initiatives).

The western response to Russia’s collapse was triumphalist. It was hailed as signaling “the end of history”, the final victory of western capitalist democracy, almost as if Russia were being instructed to revert to its pre-world war I status as a virtual economic colony of the west.

Nato enlargement began at once, in violation of verbal assurances to Gorbachev that Nato forces would not move “one inch to the east” after he agreed that a unified Germany could become a Nato member – a remarkable concession, in the light of history. That discussion kept to East Germany. The possibility that Nato might expand beyond Germany was not discussed with Gorbachev, even if privately considered.

Soon, Nato did begin to move beyond, right to the borders of Russia. The general mission of Nato was officially changed to a mandate to protect “crucial infrastructure” of the global energy system, sea lanes and pipelines, giving it a global area of operations. Furthermore, under a crucial western revision of the now widely heralded doctrine of “responsibility to protect”, sharply different from the official UN version, Nato may now also serve as an intervention force under US command.

Of particular concern to Russia are plans to expand Nato to Ukraine. These plans were articulated explicitly at the Bucharest Nato summit of April 2008, when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership in Nato. The wording was unambiguous: “Nato welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in Nato. We agreed today that these countries will become members of Nato.”

With the “Orange Revolution” victory of pro-western candidates in Ukraine in 2004, State Department representative Daniel Fried rushed there and “emphasized US support for Ukraine’s Nato and Euro-Atlantic aspirations”, as a WikiLeaks report revealed.

As in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin’s moves favorably to understand the logic behind them

Russia’s concerns are easily understandable. They are outlined by international relations scholar John Mearsheimer in the leading US establishment journal, Foreign Affairs. He writes that “the taproot of the current crisis [over Ukraine] is Nato expansion and Washington’s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow’s orbit and integrate it into the west”, which Putin viewed as “a direct threat to Russia’s core interests”.

“Who can blame him?” Mearsheimer asks, pointing out that “Washington may not like Moscow’s position, but it should understand the logic behind it”. That should not be too difficult. After all, as everyone knows, “The United States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the western hemisphere, much less on its borders.”

In fact, the US stand is far stronger. It does not tolerate what is officially called “successful defiance” of the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which declared (but could not yet implement) US control of the hemisphere. And a small country that carries out such successful defiance may be subjected to “the terrors of the earth” and a crushing embargo – as happened to Cuba.

We need not ask how the United States would have reacted had the countries of Latin America joined the Warsaw Pact, with plans for Mexico and Canada to join as well. The merest hint of the first tentative steps in that direction would have been “terminated with extreme prejudice”, to adopt CIA lingo.

As in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin’s moves and motives favorably to understand the logic behind them, nor to grasp the importance of understanding that logic instead of issuing imprecations against it. As in the case of China, a great deal is at stake, reaching as far – literally – as questions of survival.

The challenges today: the Islamic world

Let us turn to the third region of major concern, the (largely) Islamic world, also the scene of the global war on terror (GWOT) that George W Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared.

The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a “plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself” (as Reagan put it) and a “return to barbarism in the modern age” (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state).

The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.

The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality – which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused “to turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25m”.

There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence – not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear US contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden.

How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the US was just intent on “trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don’t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose”.

That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as “a big setback” for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach.

His judgment is confirmed by Richard A Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, “the president yelled in the narrow conference room, ‘I don’t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.’” The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.

The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.

The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq.

The US-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the 21st century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as “genocidal” by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, “the liberation of Iraq”.

Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the US security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that “coalition” (US-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.

The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France and the US) procured security council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels.

The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond.

Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from west Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the Nato attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.

Yet another triumph of “humanitarian intervention”, and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago.

Malaysia’s weather is mad la. Just 2 weeks ago some of us were sweating through our eyelids. But a few days back? Well, many of you would have heard of the crazy flash flood that happened in KL.

It was reported that last Thursday evening, rain started to pour so heavily that several roads like Jalan Duta and Jalan Semantan were so heavily flooded that about 100 cars were left stranded because of it.

When we heard of this, the first thing that actually came to mind was to find out what to do if you’re caught in flash flood. But NST beat us to it hahaha.

So the next big question on our minds was why is KL prone to this destructive mud-bath every now and then?

Well….

KL gets hit by flash floods because it’s a developing city

There are many possible reasons why a flash flood can happen. From poor drainage systems, to deforestation, to construction debris clogging up drains, to unprecedented bouts of anger from the rain gods themselves. For Malaysia, The Star reports it to be a combination of “localised heavy rains, and inadequate drainage and water storage systems to cater for rapid urbanisation.“

“The occurrence of floods is increasing due to land use changes and progress. Whatever we do on land will affect the hydrology of an area. The transformation from previous surfaces to artificial non-pervious surfaces will increase the runoff rates and volume.” – Abu Mutalib Mat Hassan, flood management division deputy director at the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), as quoted by The Star

In other words, we’ve developed our roads and buildings without considering whether our drains can handle it or not, because roads can’t absorb water as quickly as soil can and urban development constricts rivers.

So the correct reason may not be because KL is a developed city, but a not-so-well-developed city. But now that we’ve determined the problem, we can begin to fix it right?

Actually we’ve been trying to solve the KL flood problem for decades

While flash flooding in KL doesn’t happen all the time, we’ve found at least one report of flash floods a year for the past 5 years (2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011), with some of them looking just as bad as the one we saw on a few days back. But flash floods in KL are definitely not new. One of biggest reports we could find was the 1971 flash flood which killed 32 people and affected another 180 thousand! This blog even has some pictures of the floods in the years after that.

But it was also reported that it was this flood that moved our then-PM, Tun Abdul Razak, to set up the Kuala Lumpur Flood Mitigation Programme.

Ever since then, the government has been constantly implementing new measures to counteract the flash floods. One of the biggest, if not the biggest of these measures was actually the building of the SMART tunnel in 2007, where SMART actually stands for Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel, where it’s main purpose is to actually divert large volumes of flood water but doubles as a roadway.

But why are flash floods still out-SMARTing us after all these measures?

If some of us are already itching to ask why hasn’t our SMART solved our flash flood problems, here’s a possible reason why. Back in 2014 DID director-general Datuk Ahmad Husaini Sulaiman, said to not blame every flash flood on SMART not working because there are 2 types of floods in KL – river flooding and flash floods. SMART was designed to deal with river flooding from the Klang River.

On the other hand, flash floods can be localised and caused by an area’s drainage. And it’s interesting to note that one of the areas hit recently hasn’t had a flood in the last 5 years.

“It was a surprise, there were no signs like dirty water or minor flooding, suddenly we had a flash flood.” – Old Klang Road Market Traders Association chairman Koh Yoke Kook, as quoted by The Star

Many of the articles we read actually mention that it’s not that we don’t have measures to combat flash floods, but rather other issues like not just poor planning BUT maintenance as well.

“When a flash flood hits Kuala Lumpur and submerges parked cars, some people blame climate change. I think we should ask about the state of the city’s drainage, its maintenance and whether it was originally designed to handle the volume of development that exists today.” – Centre for Environment, Technology and Development Malaysia (Cetdem) executive director Anthony Tan, as quoted by The Star

But it may not be purely the fault of our gomen but the people as well, because our drainage system could also be clogged with rubbish or construction debris. As this letter elaborates…

“The public must be informed that the water drainage system is not a rubbish disposal system. Ongoing construction works had been the culprit in causing many flash floods. Contractors often wrongly take shortcuts in temporary diversion works, thereby taking risks and reducing costs.” – Ir Prof Dr Jeffrey Chiang Choong Luin, honorary secretary of the Institution of Engineers Malaysia, in a letter on MalaysiaKini

So the blame actually cannot be placed on just any one party.

But what can an average Malaysian do to improve the situation?

There are many suggestions online as to how the gomen can improve the way it’s currently handling flash floods (really technical articles here and here).

But at the very least, we as people can start by not littering, and disposing of our rubbish correctly.","Sat, 14 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cilisos.my/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cilisos-featured-image-kl-flash-flood.jpg,"['hit', 'flash', 'smart', 'heres', 'weve', 'getting', 'actually', 'flood', 'happens', 'floods', 'water', 'kl', 'flooding', 'drainage']",

The SOLAS Safe Return to Port (SRTP) regulations place significant responsibilities on seafarers manning new medium and large passenger vessels and highly occupied Special Purpose Ships. Dr Luis Guarin, partner and naval architect at Brookes Bell Safety at Sea, explains the implications of SRTP requirements on crew, and the measures shipowners and operators can take to prepare their teams for flood or fire emergencies:

The SRTP regulations represent a step change in crew responsibilities during flood and fire emergencies. Under the regulations, crew are required to contain emergency fire or flooding incidents defined in SRTP regulations and recover the operability of affected essential systems and the ship. Working under the philosophy that a ship is its own best lifeboat, a vessel’s essential systems must be demonstrated to remain operational following fire and flooding damages that do not exceed a certain pre-defined casualty threshold.

While a simple concept in essence, SRTP regulations present significant and multi-faceted challenges. Although the regulations came into force almost six years ago on July 1, 2010, it is only recently that many affected shipowners and operators have realized the full scale of the challenges SRTP poses during vessel operation. This is because adherence to SRTP regulations is the responsibility of the ship builder up to the point of vessel delivery, at which point the ship owner or operator becomes responsible for compliance.

This trend for shipowners and operators to typically engage with SRTP regulations at the point of vessel delivery was foreseen by Brookes Bell in 2010, at which time we identified the need to introduce processes that made SRTP compliance more integrated between ship design and operation. By introducing measures to improve the flow of this transition, the aim is to make SRTP easier to implement for seafarers and more efficient and cost effective for owners and operators.

Thousands of manual tasks

The scale of the SRTP compliance challenge is considerable, but not insurmountable. To achieve compliance, shipbuilders typically carry out Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) for each essential system, culminating in an extensive FMEA report for each system approved by a class society on behalf of a vessel’s flag state.

When a vessel is delivered, the crew must interpret the outcome of the systems documentation and results of FMEA studies for each essential system and use the information to develop procedures that ensure compliance in an emergency.

For a single flood or fire scenario, the number of manual tasks the crew must complete to contain damage and recover essential systems varies significantly. It could involve a few individual actions, or hundreds, depending on the nature of the incident.

To compound the issue, the crew must be able to contain damage and recover essential systems when impacted by all flood or fire scenarios defined in the SRTP regulations. The total number of individual damage scenarios varies depending on the size of the ship, but could include 100 or more.

In one industry example, all this meant that 100 different manual actions were required to contain damage and recover the operability of an essential ship system in a single scenario. For this vessel, a total of 200 possible scenarios required SRTP compliance. Therefore, the crew required training to implement a total of 20,000 manual steps to ensure compliance in emergency situations.

This may sounds like an overwhelming task to prepare for and instigate when necessary. However with the right preparation, compliance processes between shipbuilders and shipowners, operators and crew can become more integrated and the flow from vessel design to operation more fluent.

Route to compliance

Upon delivery of a new vessel, design assumptions made in the FMEA studies need to be validated to ensure any discrepancies between compliance during vessel design and operation can be addressed. To do this, shipowners and operators need access and sufficient resources to review the information, which is extensive and at times difficult to interpret. These steps are all necessary to ensure results of FMEA studies can be effectively applied to ensure SRTP compliance during vessel operation.

Once crew procedures to recover the operability of essential ship systems are defined, continuous and systematic drills must be conducted. This will ensure that the crewmembers tasked with carrying out manual actions are familiar and competent with the emergency control procedures in line with the correct design intentions and for all SRTP scenarios.

While effective, this strategy has its own associated challenges. For example, planning and conducting SRTP drills is likely to require extensive efforts due to the large number of scenarios and associated manual actions. Manual actions may involve sequential steps carried out at different locations throughout the ship, requiring, for example, specific access arrangements. This logistical information (not necessarily provided in the FMEA studies) needs to be defined and recorded in a systematic manner and made available to crew throughout the life of the ship, including all possible maintenance work and modifications.

Furthermore, SRTP compliance is made more difficult by the high crew turnover inherent within the passenger and cruise industry. Steps need to be taken to ensure acquired SRTP knowledge is not lost when people move on and that the process of increasing competence for new crew members becomes faster, more efficient and controlled.

A unique regulation requires a new approach

Ultimately, SRTP is a unique safety regulation that requires an innovative approach, excellent teamwork, modern tools and application of best practices. It is a life-long process, which needs to be well planned and organized throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. It should include new crew training so that seafarers can confidently contain fire and flooding damage, and recover affected essential systems and the ship in an emergency. Furthermore, measures should be taken to ensure SRTP compliance can be maintained throughout all upgrades and possible conversions, and support the crew during maintenance work.

If clear and well-demonstrated processes such as Brookes Bell’s Systems Analysis Modeller can be introduced to achieve this, SRTP compliant vessels will become easier and more cost effective to operate and maintain.

The Chinese internet is in a bit of tizzy over a few viral selfies that have cost one policewoman her job.

Earlier this week, Weibo user “@小天屎和老天翔的故事” uploaded a couple of pictures of herself posing in uniform. Somehow or another, the pics spread online, with netizens criticizing the woman for her lack of proper pants and stately demeanor that is normally associated with China’s finest.

“You can’t wear a police uniform and put these kind of pictures online,” raged one netizen.



Well, it appears that the netizen was at least right about that. The Paper reports that the Public Security Bureau of Dandong city in Liaoning province has confirmed that the duck-faced, short shorts-wearing woman was in fact one of their auxiliary officers. Was being the key word. She has already been fired for disgracing the department with her “vulgar” selfies.

The woman attended the Dandong Police Academy and it too has taken to Weibo to apologize for its student supervision not being up to standard. “We will draw a lesson from this incident and strengthen our student management going forward to maintain strict discipline, so that something like this will never occur again to besmirch the good image of our school,” the post read.

Following the incident, the woman took down all her posts on Weibo, but of course that hasn’t stopped the pics from spreading all around Chinese social media. However, after taking a look at the pictures many netizens fail to see what the big deal is.

“Where is the vulgarity?” one netizen wondered.

“This is completely normal nowadays, if you are going to start firing young people for taking these kinds of selfies, then there won’t be any workers left,” another netizen responded.

In the end, this is just another good reason not to take selfies.

56,56,FL-2016-000044-CHN,"The Not-So-Abandoned Town of Zaña – Zaña, Peru - Atlas Obscura",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zana,"Just inland and to the south of bustling Chiclayo lies the reputed “ghost town” of Zaña. Tucked in a fertile agricultural valley, the tiny town teems with ruins dating back to Peru’s colonial era and – to the astonishment of the few travelers drawn there for these ghostly shells of convents and cloisters – a whole host of current residents whose roots trace back hundreds of years, to a generation of Zaña’s whose spirit couldn’t be dominated by marauding pirates, conquistadors, or raging floods.

Settled for millennia by indigenous inhabitants, the Zaña Valley became a powerhouse for Spain’s conquistador’s thanks to the vast gold and silver deposits hidden in its surrounding hills. In the centuries to come, the city of Zaña (officially “founded” in 1534) would rise in economic import, as its political heads established it as the most important city on the northern coast, surpassing even Trujillo.

The reputation for wealth was so well known that the pirate Edward Davies would go so far as to launch a series of attacks on Zaña in 1686, lured there by the promise of treasure beyond compare. Part of maintaining Zaña’s economic status involved the use of slaves, hailing from both indigenous Andean communities and African slaves imported to the continent expressly to work in the mines and protect the city’s wealth from being sacked.

Though business was bustling for the Spanish in spite of random pirate attacks and increased instability in the region, it was Mother Nature’s intervention that dealt the fateful blow to Zaña’s overlords. In 1720, records show that El Niño caused the Zaña River to overflow its banks in an incredible way, destroying the city in a flood of biblical proportions. Nearly everything the masters had built was destroyed. What little remained, rose from the decimated remains of Zaña, husks of an imported faith. The most impressive of these ruins include the San Augustine Convent, built in 1586, whose bombed-out center is a favorite spot for modern visitors to the town, who pause to gape beneath the open-air nave and frescoes still readily visible on its walls.

Sun-bleached cloisters dot the horizon, and arches from the colonial period rise from Zaña’s fields and central plazas to this day, contributing to the idea that the city is as abandoned as when the Spanish left it in 1720. Yet a crucial piece is missing from this picture: only the Spanish left, convinced that the slaves’ devotion to their old traditions had called down hellfire on their fair city.

The fact that the Zaña’s surviving black population, now free from their enslavers, remained in the city is a story history has mostly forgotten. What resulted from this lack of storytelling is the present widespread misconception of Zaña as a “ghost town,” rather than a city full of remarkable ruins, the country’s only Afro-Peruvian museum, its own unique kind of candy, no vehicular traffic, and a heterogeneous population that’s 1,000 strong.

Indeed, Zaña’s history and traditions have survived anything thrown their way better than most places in the world… it’s just that most outsiders don’t know it.","Fri, 20 May 2016 12:37:34 GMT",https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzk0MGZlM2E5ODM3Yzg3ODc0M19QMTA1MDc3My5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/940fe3a9837c878743_P1050773.JPG,"['valley', 'slaves', 'zaña', 'spanish', 'town', 'way', 'city', 'zañas', 'wealth', 'notsoabandoned', 'ruins']",

Naval command ship USS Blue Mountain has docked in Shanghai a week after a carrier group led by USS John C Stennis was refused access to the port of Hong Kong.

After arriving in the Chinese financial capital Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, tried to downplay recent tensions between the U.S. and the Communist country over disputed waters in the South China Sea.

Describing the Hong Kong incident as a 'minor hurdle', Aucoin said: 'The relationship between our two countries is much too important for a port visit to get in the way of that.'

The USS Blue Ridge, the command vessel of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, has docked in Shanghai today as part of efforts to foster relations with China and the People's Liberation Army Navy

The Blue Ridge (pictured), which has been on patrol in the Pacific for most of 2016, arrived in China's financial hub a week after the USS Stennis was denied entry to the port of Hong Kong

Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, commander of the U.S. Navy's Seventh fleet (center), attempted to downplay tensions with China after disembarking, calling the Hong Kong snub a 'minor hurdle'

Aucoin was joined on the dock in Shanghai by Rear Admiral Zhi Tianlong (left), who was charged with welcoming him to the city

Aucoin refused to be drawn on the reason behind China snubbing the Stennis, which was due to call in Hong Kong on Friday last week, saying that would probably be a good question for the government of China.'

Chinese officials have yet to explain the move, but many have speculated that it came after Defense Secretary Ash Carter paid a visit to the Stennis while it was carrying out operations in the South China Sea two weeks before.

Captain Matt Paradise, Blue Ridge's commanding officer, said the overall mission for the port visit is to get to know and develop relationships with the People's Republic of China, and the People's Liberation Army Navy.

Paradise said: 'The more Blue Ridge works with the PLA(N), the better we will get to know each other and that will increase mutual understandings and decrease tensions. In turn we can become better partners.'

Sailors and Marines will play basketball with their Chinese counterparts in an inter-navy basketball game, will take part in various tours of the city, and will visit a school for the blind.

American relations with China have been strained in recent months over the disputed South China Sea as the Communist nation attempts to lay claim to the waters which potentially contain valuable mineral deposits (pictured, the Blue Ridge is watched into port)

China has constructed several military bases and artificial islands in the sea and is now attempting to enforce exclusion zones which the U.S. Navy has deliberately violated in the past, citing international freedom of navigation law (pictured, the Blue Ridge arrives in Shanghai)

While China has not given an official explanation for why the Stennis was denied a port call at Hong Kong, it came after Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited the ship while it was in the South China Sea (pictured, Chinese sailors haul in a rope from the USS Blue Ridge)

The Blue Ridge visited Shanghai as part of its 2016 tour season which has also seen it dock in India and the Philippines, a rival of China's in its fight over the contested South China Sea (pictured, Chinese sailors unravel a welcome banner)

Beijing is attempting to lay claim to the potentially mineral-rich South China Sea, which also includes fertile fishing ground and is used to transport $5trillion worth of goods each year, and has constructed artificial islands and runways in the region in an attempt to enforce its claim.

Other Pacific nations, including the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, also claim sovereignty over part of the waterway, and are fighting for the issue to be decided by an international arbitration panel, rather than by military force.

The U.S. has made it clear that it also favors arbitration, and in October last year deliberately breached a 12 nautical mile exclusion zone China attempted to place around its artificial island by sailing the USS Lassen on a patrol through it.

At the time Chinese officials lashed out at the U.S. operation, calling it a 'coercive action that seeks to militarize the South China Sea region' and an 'abuse' of freedom of navigation laws.

Despite the recent tensions, Aucoin said the Chinese Navy still plans to take part in two joint military exercises in the region along with other nations.

At a news conference after disembarking, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin refused to be drawn on why the Stennis was not allowed to dock in Hong Kong, saying that is 'a question for the Chinese government'

Despite the recent tensions with China, Aucoin confirmed that the Communist nation will participate in two joint military exercises with the U.S. Navy in the coming months (pictured, Chinese sailors wait for the arrival of the Blue Ridge)

It’s billed as a “startup with a head start,” since it relies on the resources of both CNN and Turner.

“We have one of the greatest brands in the world, CNN. That means so much, those red and white letters,” Great Big Story co-founder and CNN EVP Andrew Morse told TheWrap.

And while they respect their legacy, Morse went on to explain what makes the Great Big Story stand out. “There are stories to be told outside of the news space. CNN has this great storytelling legacy but we felt, to do it authentically, the way to reach this audience was to do something entirely different.”

The company is going after “urban-dwelling, globally curious” millennials who “live on their phone,” according to CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker. That description might sound an awful lot like the target audience for sites such as BuzzFeed and Vice, but Morse doesn’t like the comparison.

“What we do is fundamentally different from BuzzFeed. And it’s fundamentally different from Vice,” Morse said. “We thought there was a white space between the silly and the cynical, but this is neither silly or cynical.”

He continued, “BuzzFeed isn’t even the best example. GBS isn’t an app and it isn’t a website. It’s a network.”

Great Big Story launched six months ago and is racking up roughly 40 million multiplatform video views per month, with 6.2 million fans across social media.

“Great Big Story is a new network, not a news network,” Zucker said at Thursday’s Newfront event. “A new network with a new distribution model, a new audience and new opportunities.”

Zucker called Great Big Story a “global storytelling network dedicated to the awesome, the untold and the flat-out amazing” and said its success is one of Turner’s top priorities.

Great Big Story is partnering with The Weather Channel for an hour-long, eight-part weekly primetime TV program titled “That’s Amazing.” The network is also launching “The Great Big Show,” a long-form weekly TV program that will present the very best of Great Big Story’s global storytelling. The Turner-owned network that “The Great Big Show” airs on remains a mystery, but CNN and HLN are clearly the frontrunners given Zucker’s involvement.

Great Big story also announced two new series during the Newfront event. Willie Nelson will join Great Big Story for a collection of “life advice” shorts and Chris Funk of The Decemberists will take cameras on tour to spotlight incredible treasures from travels around the globe.

In a gently paddled canoe, three employees of the Asian Turtle Program and a lone reporter glided forward. After a few silent minutes, the men aimed cameras and began speaking in soft but excited tones.

“You brought luck!” Pham Van Thong said, displaying on his digital camera the distant image of something disrupting the lake’s surface. (The reporter had missed it and felt unlucky.)

But they had no doubt: It was him, the only giant Yangtze soft-shell turtle known to remain in the wild — and one of only three Rafetus swinhoei known to exist anywhere. The others, an aged female and her apparently impotent male companion, reside in China’s Suzhou Zoo.

The rare species received a flurry of international attention in January as Vietnam mourned the death of Hanoi’s beloved 360-pound Cu Rua, or Great-Grandfather Turtle, about 30 miles from this village. For as long as anyone could remember, the reptile, well over 100 years old, had resided in small Hoan Kiem Lake and was revered as a link to Vietnam’s heroic mythology.

The course ahead for the species is unclear, given the centuries-old tension between Vietnam and China, now focused on disputed islands in the South China Sea.

“Twenty-odd years of searching have produced no others,” said naturalist Peter Pritchard, a leading turtle expert whose latest book was titled “Rafetus: The Curve of Extinction.” He professes optimism, however, that the Dong Mo turtle and the Chinese female have a chance to rebuild the population, much as a Galapagos species was brought back from the brink.

For the Vietnamese, the Dong Mo turtle is a reminder of the tale of 15th century emperor Le Loi: of how the heavens provided him with a magical sword to drive invaders back to China and how he then returned the weapon to a turtle in the lake. The place was renamed Hoan Kiem, or Lake of the Restored Sword.

Until the 1990s, the largest of Asia’s turtle species was not uncommon in the wetlands of major river systems of southern China and northern Vietnam. It’s possible, conservationists say, that the turtles thrived in Hoan Kiem long ago.

In the 1880s, the postcard-ready Turtle Tower shrine rose on a small island in the lake, offering a sunbathing spot for the turtles. Today, Vietnamese and tourists alike frequent a popular temple on the lake that exhibits the preserved remains of Cu Rua’s former companion — 6 feet long, 3 feet wide — which died in 1978. (Plans call for Cu Rua to be preserved and displayed at a national museum.)

Over the last generation, hunting and urbanization have all but wiped out the species, though hope endures that a few of the stealthy creatures may yet lurk in the marshes, mud and water.

Pham Xuan Tu, 60, is a one-armed farmer and fisherman who for decades has managed the Dong Mo fishery. He remembers when scores of the turtles destroyed nets and “ate my fish.” Decades ago, he explained, nobody cared that these “pests” were the same species as the Hoan Kiem turtles. Tu and a trapper caught as many of the big turtles as they could to sell as food and folk medicine, with many winding up in China.

Tu, who fought against the Chinese in the 1979 border clash, laughed when asked whether he lost his left forearm to warfare. It was a fishing accident, he explained, with faulty Russian explosives.

The Dong Mo reservoir is about 1,000 times the size of Hoan Kiem, which has raised hope that the reptile may not be as lonely as is commonly assumed. Nghia Son native Nguyen Van Trong, a former fisherman who works for the internationally funded turtle project, bases his optimism on his observations from a distance and sightings reported by others. His colleague Thong says that anecdotes, but no photographic evidence, have raised hope at two other locations in northern Vietnam.

Thong and colleague Hoang Van Ha, graduates of Vietnam’s forestry university, learned the legend as children. They became more familiar with Cu Rua in early 2011, when sightings of the turtle, once rare, became common as the aging, ailing reptile struggled for oxygen. Authorities worked to clean the polluted lake and nursed Cu Rua back to health.

Vietnamese culture is rich in superstition, and many citizens tried to divine meaning from the fact that Cu Rua succumbed on the eve of a vital Communist Party conference.

A close examination cleared up one mystery. A previous examination of the ailing Cu Rua in 2011 prompted one biologist to declare that Great-Grandfather was actually female. Determining the sex of a turtle is difficult, according to project director Tim McCormack, but now biologists agree that Cu Rua was male after all.

McCormack and Ha came into close contact with the leathery beast at Dong Mo on a memorable day in 2008 when a flood had damaged the dam and the turtle wound up in a rice paddy a few miles downstream.

The rice farmer who found the turtle, Ha recalled, turned down an offer of about $2,000 rather than run afoul of the law protecting endangered species. He accepted the turtle project’s modest compensation for the damage caused by the turtle. The priority, Ha recalled, was to return the specimen to its habitat as quickly and safely as possible.

Cu Rua’s demise inspired speculation that Vietnam’s leaders might attempt to move the Dong Mo turtle to Hoan Kiem for sentimental reasons. The much better course, conservationists say, would be to capture and transport him to China, but the politics are complicated. Hostility between Vietnam and China has intensified after Beijing initiated mineral exploration and construction of islands that both countries claim as sovereign territory.

Vietnamese conservationists express doubts that authorities would be willing to send Vietnam’s only known Rafetus to China. A better possibility, Ha suggests, would be to deliver his sperm to the Chinese zoo.

Tu, the one-armed fisherman, is now cooperating with efforts to save the species he once hunted. Between shots of home-brewed rice wine, Tu gave an unsentimental assessment of the Vietnamese legend and said that species’ peril is just a matter of nature taking its course.

The good news, Ha says, is that fishing with explosives is now illegal.

Vietnam flights to broaden coastal tourism

Sihanoukville's tourism industry has welcomed news that the country’s flagship airline will commence scheduled service between Sihanoukville and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam next month, but said the coastal city could benefit greatly from more international flights.

Douglass McColl, vice president of Sihanoukville Tourism Association, said Cambodia Angkor Air’s new route, due to launch on June 17, should increase hotel occupancy in Sihanoukville, but more flights were needed to match the level of development.

“It’s a little bit of chicken and egg, because you need the hotels in order to justify the flights, but you need the flights in order to justify the hotels,” he said. “Hopefully the very fact that there are now flights starting in Kunming, [China,] and now Ho Chi Minh City, signals that there is enough development within Sihanoukville to be able to support that.”

Although he said that direct flights from Bangkok would be the next logical step, additional flights from China were even more important.

“I think that there will first be more direct flights to China, because if you look at the number of tourists, a lot of them are from China,” he said.

Aharon Gini, general manager of the Queenco Hotel and Casino, said it made sense that a direct flight from Ho Chi Minh City was given precedence over one from Bangkok because Vietnamese tourists – and Chinese tourists who stop-over in Ho Chi Minh City – come to Sihanoukville for the beach, casinos and leisure activities.

However, Thailand has its own famous beaches, so tourists have less incentive to visit Cambodia.

Nou Sophal, director of Preah Sihanouk’s provincial tourism department, said that although tourist visits to Sihanoukville increased by 13.7 per cent year-on-year during the first three months of the year, the number of visitors from Vietnam declined.

“The number of Vietnamese visitors is slightly down for the first quarter of this year,” he said, expressing hope that the new flight would reverse this trend.

According to the department’s figures, the top three tourists to Sihanoukville by nationality during the first quarter were Chinese, Russians and Germans. Vietnamese were fourth, with some 11,200 visiting the coastal city between January and March.

Sophal said the new flight to Ho Chi Minh City would not only bring in more Vietnamese, it would also provide more route options for international travellers, increasing their visits.","Tue, 10 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/sihanouk_international_airport_2014_maximovich_nikolay_0.jpg,"['vietnam', 'flights', 'tourism', 'sihanoukville', 'minh', 'ho', 'coastal', 'tourists', 'vietnamese', 'chi', 'city', 'china', 'broaden']",

Its islands and its people are enduring increasingly unpredictable rains, intensifying cycles of flood and drought, and strengthening storms forming in the Pacific. These changing weather patterns have not only derailed livelihoods and agricultural productivity in rural areas, they have also worsened water insecurity in cities, where 45 percent of the population live.

In response, USAID launched its $21.6 million Water Security for Resilient Economic Growth and Stability (Be Secure) project in 2012 to improve urban resilience to climate change. Partnering with communities throughout the country, the project builds local adaptation capacity, upgrades water supply infrastructure, and promotes more efficient water use. The project’s impact has been especially notable in Zamboanga City, which recently became the first city in the nation’s history to create an urban water demand management (WDM) plan.

Zamboanga on the Front Lines

Situated at the southern tip of the island of Mindanao, on a peninsula, Zamboanga City is exposed to coastal storm surges and flooding from heavy rains draining off nearby mountains.

Despite this seeming abundance of water, the city has been struggling recently with water scarcity. “Zamboanga has been in a three-year drought, and has been rationing its water to a few hours per day,” says Mona Grieser, chief of party for USAID’s Be Secure project. The situation became so serious that the city declared a state of calamity in January 2016.

ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) – A new strategy by drug dealers to evade the law is catching up to them. A mother and son duo recently pleaded guilty to distributing about $6 million worth of drugs. Yet dealers continue playing a shell game in hopes of making new users out of people who might not normally try drugs.

These are substances you can buy in stores. They’re synthetic copies of things like marijuana and cocaine. You can purchase them at some gas stations, t-shirt shops and novelty stores. It’s creating a unique challenge for police and parents.

Max Harris was in a bait and tackle shop in St. Charles County when she remembers meeting the nicest woman. Harris said the woman “gave me a sample, basically a free pack, and was like, ‘Hey try this.’ And then it was off to the races.”

It was in a colorful package with a logo. The powder inside was called a Cathinone. Think cocaine, but possibly stronger.

“I could go to a store and get it rather than call up Pookie or Ray Ray and say, ‘Hey, can I get a sack?’ It was just like, hey, I can go to the store, get some M&M’s while I’m there and call it a day. It was just very easy to access.”

She said the saleswoman couldn’t have been more helpful.

“She did ‘nice’ things,” Harris said. “Like if I didn’t have enough to pay for the drug she would offer, ‘Oh come back when you can or write me a post-dated check’ which, when you’re a user, that’s music to your ears. (I thought to myself) yeah! I can get my fix and I don’t have to give you money? Cool!”

She was dealing with Pam Tabatt. Just before she pleaded guilty in federal court recently, Tabatt told the judge she struggles with PTSD. She didn’t say why. Harris would like to know since she contributed so much to Tabatt’s reported millions.

“I lost my car. I didn’t have electricity for six months,” Harris said. “I literally ran an extension cord from my neighbor’s house to my house so I could charge my phone and my computer. But I didn’t care. I mean, as long as I could get my fix and you know I could smoke, I didn’t care. And it was…$30 to $60 a day, so I mean, you multiple that out by 30 days and you’re looking at $900 – $1500 a month. And I wondered why I couldn’t pay my bills.”

Our Fox Files investigations had reported on Tabatt since October of 2010, testing product after product sold from her stores. We ordered tests on everything from the synthetic Cathinones, which were sometimes hidden in packages labeled “bath salts” — to synthetic Cannabinoids, often called K-2 and labeled as “incense.”

DEA Special Agent in Charge James Shroba told us, “Opioids is the next front.”

Shroba says agents are tracking the beginnings of drug traffickers tweaking the chemical compounds of Fentanyl. He added that it’s “Hundreds, if not thousands of times more potent than heroin, or other opioids and this will, there will certainly be tragic consequences with these.”

Many deaths are never reported, because the substances often sneak past drug screens.

Shroba described the user saying, “They spin that chamber on the gun just as in Russian roulette, only there`s more than one chamber that’s got a bullet in it.”

The DEA has traced much of it to China. Take a look at the power of the China connection in an illustration – this shows the rising number of the synthetic cathinone called Methylone, flooding our neighborhoods. The USA banned it here in 2013. It still climbed until China banned it in 2014, then it took a nosedive.

Meanwhile, a similar cathinone called Ethylone remained legal in China and quickly took over.

Shroba said, “18 months goes by and you’ve got a whole new user base that never paid attention to the other enforcement actions or the community outreach or the stories that you`ve done yourself on your network. They don`t know anything about that.”

DEA evidence photos show 20 liter drums of acetone used in manufacturing and cement mixers used to stir experimental chemicals. The substances are broken down into smaller and smaller batches until it’s finally sifted into 30 dollar pouches labeled things like ‘Dr. Feelgood Potpourri.’

Harris says the best feeling was completing detox. She said, “I shouldn’t be alive. So every time I wake up in the morning I`m like ‘Woo! I get to do it again!’ It’s just, I love life. I love being alive.”

Her reported dealer meanwhile, looks nothing like the happy helpful person she used to see behind the sales counter. As Pam Tabatt walked out of Federal Court I asked her, “What`s your post-traumatic stress?” She didn’t answer as the person who drove her away flipped me his middle finger.

Police and medical workers meanwhile, sometimes equate a spike in drug use to an outbreak. They often don`t know what`s wrong or what the person ingested. A paramedic firefighter Tweeted in February “We (with the St. Louis Fire Department) see it first … and a lot lately. (It’s) reminiscent of the walking dead,” he added.

The coffin is believed to have belonged to Liu He, also known as Marquis of Haihun, an ill-fated monarch from West Han Dynasty (202 BC-8 AD) who ruled just 27 days before being overthrown by his ambitious general.

Archaeologists say findings from the coffin could help demystify the dethroned ruler, who had been described by some as a 'useless emperor who drank and had fun all day long'.

Painstaking: Chinese experts are cleaning up the coffin, believed to belong to Liu He, in a lab in Nanchang

Extraordinary finding: Liu's tomb has been studied since 2011 and has produced over 10,000 pieces of relics

Resting place: The precious cemetery was discovered five years ago at the village of Da Tangping in Jiangxi

Expert also said that results of the digging would help clarify the relationship between Liu and other remains found in the burial chambers, according to Huanqiu, an affiliation to People's Daily.

Cleaning up of the coffin, which takes place inside a laboratory in Nanchang city, is at its last stage.

The team have obtained the royal seal and some of the jade ornaments and will clean up Liu He's teeth, the accessories on his remains and a mat made of crystal glass, said the same report.

A large number of teeth have been found from Liu He's remains, which the researchers have used for a DNA test.

Researchers hope the DNA test could explain the cause of Liu He's death.

By comparing Liu's DNA results with those of the other remains, researchers also hope to clarify more details of the tomb. For example, whether the number five tomb belonged to Liu's mistress or his son.

Major discovery: Experts hope a DNA test could help explain the death of Liu, who had rule for just 27 days

Well preserved: Liu's burial chamber is billed the best-preserved royal tomb from the West Han Dynasty

Rare relics: Other items found at the site include gold coins, hoof-shaped ingots, jade pendants, a distiller

The cemetery, which contains eight tombs and a chariot burial site, was first discovered in 2011 at the village of Da Tangping around 30 miles north of Nanchang.

It has been regarded as the best-preserved royal tomb from the West Han Dynasty.

The site has been studied for five years and has produced over 10,000 pieces of cultural relics, including Wuzhu bronze coins, jade and thousands of other gold, bronze and iron items.

The coffin was hoisted out in January, 2016, and has been undergoing examination.

Archaeologists were able to identify the owner the coffin and the tomb by a seal found inside the coffin, which says the name 'Liu He'.

Other items found at the site include gold coins, hoof-shaped ingots, jade pendants, a distiller, horse-drawn vehicles, a board game and 2,000-year-old bronze lamps.

The goose-shaped lamps, which would have been filled with water, were designed to dispose of the smoke inside the tomb.

Since 2011, more than 10,000 pieces have been discovered at the tombs and 110 of these have gone on display at Jiangxi Provincial Museum in Nanchang.

THE USELESS EMPEROR OF CHINA: WHO WAS LIU HE? Born in 92 BC, Liu He was the grandson of Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty, whose tenure was one of the most prosperous periods on the Chinese history. Liu stepped to the throne in 74 BC after his uncle died without an heir. However after just 27 days in the office in Beijing, he was dethroned by an imperial decree issued by the Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan. The deposition was initiated by his ambitious general, named Huo Guang, who claimed in a report that Liu had lived a debauchery, extravagance and wanton way as a ruler. Huo Guang also claimed that Liu had done 1,127 'ridiculous things' in his short reign. Though some historians think this was Huo's political trick. He was also stripped of nobility and sent back to his home province, Jiangxi, to live. Liu was given the title of Marquis and land in Jiangxi by the Emperor Xuan of Han around ten years later. He was the shortest-reigning monarch on the Chinese history. The controversial ruler died from an unidentified illness in Jiangxi aged just 33. Source: Jiangxi News, China Daily Advertisement

Except, maybe, pizza. And tacos, Korean BBQ, meatball subs, chocolate cake, and milkshakes.

When I choose to indulge, though, I try to plan extra time for the meal. Not because I eat slowly to savor the meal, but because I know I’ll need a nap afterward.

Food comas, the sleepy feeling you get after eating a big meal, are so common that the term was added to the Oxford dictionary in 2014. Among the scientific community, it’s called postprandial somnolence (pull that one out at your next Thanksgiving dinner). It seems that researchers, like the rest of us, have also been intrigued as to why our lids become so heavy after a meal.

At its core, a food coma probably comes down to the composition of what we eat, and not necessarily the quantity. Our bodies are really good at breaking down simple carbohydrates—like white bread, bagels, or pasta—into sugars our cells use for energy. These foods have a high glycemic index, which means that they quickly increase the amount of sugar in our blood. When we eat a lot of these foods, we get us a boost of energy but it takes our pancreas some time, around an hour or so, to catch up and produce insulin. Insulin shuttles the sugar out of our bloodstreams into our cells, but it also allows a chemical called tryptophan to reach our brains, which causes us to produce another chemical serotonin—both of which tend to make us sleepy.

Tryptophan occurs naturally in a number of different foods, including Thanksgiving turkey, but probably not in high enough concentrations to make us sleepy, Lisa Young, a nutritionist, told Motherboard. The reason you feel so sleepy after a holiday meal, she said, is more likely to do with the spike in blood sugar and insulin rush.

The best way to avoid a food coma is to not flood your bloodstream with extra sugar by eating more moderately sized portions or foods with a lower glycemic index. Try eating more complex carbohydrates with fiber like whole wheats, fruits, and vegetables. Proteins can also help keep your blood sugar at a stable level. And if you’re worried you may quickly become sleepy after a meal, exercise can help transport excess blood sugar to our muscles, as Cornelia Weyand, a rheumatologist and immunologist at Stanford University, told Quartz earlier this year.","Wed, 11 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/foodcoma_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['coma', 'insulin', 'blood', 'eat', 'told', 'actually', 'try', 'happens', 'sugar', 'eating', 'meal', 'enter', 'sleepy', 'foods', 'food']", 
66,66,FL-2016-000044-CHN,An Ancient Rice Field and a Lost Palace: Archaeologists Get a Double Dose of Luck in China - Ancient Origins,https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/ancient-rice-field-and-lost-palace-archaeologists-get-double-dose-luck-020836,"Archaeologists working in China have been pretty lucky recently. One of the discoveries they have made may be the oldest wet rice field in the world. Another is the possible location of the imperial palace of the Yuan dynasty - a mystery which has stumped archaeologists for years.

The rice field was found by the Neolithic ruins of Hanjing in Sihong county of East China's Jiangsu province in November 2015. China Daily said that when a group of scholars met in late April they declared the find as the oldest of its kind in the world. Lin Liugen, head of the archaeology institute, said that Chinese people began rice cultivation about 10,000 years ago and carbonized rice from those early days has been found, but paddy remnants are “quite rare.”

The field covers less than 100 square meters (1076.39 sq. ft.) and was divided into parts with different shapes, each of which covering less than 10 square meters (107.64 sq. ft.) The researchers also found “carbonized rice that was confirmed to have grown more than 8,000 years ago based on carbon dating, as well as evidence that the soil was repeatedly planted with rice.” [Via China Daily]

Lin told China daily that the findings are significant for research into the origins of rice farming in China.

The second interesting discovery comes in the form of 600-year-old relics from the time of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The artifacts were found buried in the heart of the Forbidden City. Heritage Daily reports that the finds were made during maintenance work at the historic site. Apparently the broken tiles and pieces of porcelain were unearthed last year but notice only comes now that the researchers have had time to appraise and date the artifacts.

Li Ji, head of the Archaeology Department at the museum’s affiliated academic research institute, said “These three layers [Qing, Ming, and Yuan] of relics indicate how layouts for buildings changed through time.”

But he also told the press that the large amount of urban construction in the Ming Dynasty explains much of why no Yuan relics were found before. He explained, “Our fieldwork shows that almost all previous construction foundations were cleared out when the Forbidden City was built, to provide impeccable detail for the new palaces.”

The head of the Archaeology Department stressed that no “large-scale archaeological work” will be completed on the relics to increase the chances of survival for other ancient architectural elements. “It’s like playing puzzles,” he said. “We begin small-area excavations in different spots, and can obtain a panoramic view through comparative studies.”

According to The Straits Times , this discovery “is believed to have solved one of the great mysteries of antiquity in Beijing - the site of the imperial palace of the Yuan Dynasty established by Kublai Khan in the 13th century.”

Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, was the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. He differed from many of the previous rulers “by ruling through an administrative apparatus that respected and embraced the local customs of conquered peoples, rather than by might alone.” His ability to suppress the Song Dynasty of southern China also made him “the first Mongol to rule over the entire country and led to a long period of prosperity for the empire.” [Via Biography.com]

69,69,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Rafting Monkeys “Fill a Gap” in Evolutionary Theory? - Discovery Institute,https://evolutionnews.org/2016/05/more_rafting_mo/,"Of all the creatures you could call evolutionary icons — peppered moth, Darwin’s finches, Haeckel’s embryos — arguably the most risible is the rafting monkey. Even Darwinists seem to understand this.

A Washington Post article includes an interview with an author of a new Science paper, “Oligocene primates from China reveal divergence between African and Asian primate evolution,” that once again renews the demand for belief in seafaring monkeys. We’ve covered this paradox before — monkeys can’t swim much less sail. Just last month evolutionary theorizing dodged a bullet by avoiding the spectacle of rafting foxes on the world’s oceans.

The researcher, Christopher Beard, explained to reporter Sarah Kaplan how it must be the case that tarsier-like monkeys, evidenced by fossil teeth found in China, sailed on clumps of earth and felled trees, 30-40 million years ago, across an aquatic void separating Asia from Africa, which was then an island:

“It’s a little complicated,” Beard said, almost sheepishly. You don’t say. This more convoluted version of our history begins in the Eocene, some 40 million years ago. At this time, Earth’s climate was hot and humid, and the continents were just beginning to move into the positions they hold today. India was zooming headlong toward the bottom of Asia (the inevitable collision would one day give rise to the Himalayas). An inland sea flooded the center of the Eurasian land mass. And Africa was an island continent, separated from Asia and Europe by a narrow stretch of ocean. Early anthropoid (humanlike) monkeys were flourishing in Asia at that time. But they also, somehow, found a way to migrate across the watery barrier to Africa. And since monkeys don’t really swim, scientists’ best theory about their migration is — I kid you not — that they sailed across on rafts made of trees. “You’re laughing,” Beard said, “but it’s now known that this happened repeatedly. Because of the greenhouse conditions, a lot of monsoons were hitting Asia at the time. When that happens, rivers would flood, riverbanks erode. A half an acre of land with a bunch of trees growing out of it falls into a river and floats out to sea.” “And if there are a bunch of monkeys hanging out in the trees when that happens,” he continued, “suddenly those monkeys become sailors.”

“I kid you not.” “You’re laughing, but it’s now known that this happened repeatedly.” It is “known” not because anyone can picture the scenario without cracking up or feeling “sheepish” but because the theory demands it. See here for Casey Luskin’s earlier comments on the “biogeographical conundrum” posed by these Chinese monkeys.

And look here for pictures of how the drifting continents were disposed in the relevant time period between the Oligocene and the Eocene. From Asia to Africa by sea was a considerable distance, and monkeys are supposed to have accomplished this feat while clinging for dear life to bits of earth and tree debris? On Lake Washington near our home, I beg my wife and kids not to row out even close to shore on a store-bought inflatable raft!

Science Daily has additional thoughts from Dr. Beard on the “‘mother lode’ of a half-dozen fossil primate species.” A half-dozen is a “mother lode”? More:

These primates eked out an existence just after the Eocene-Oligocene transition, some 34 million years ago. It was a time when drastic cooling made much of Asia inhospitable to primates, slashing their populations and rendering discoveries of such fossils especially rare. “At the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, because of the rearrangement of Earth’s major tectonic plates, you had a rapid drop in temperature and humidity,” said K. Christopher Beard, senior curator at the University of Kansas’ Biodiversity Institute and co-author of the report. “Primates like it warm and wet, so they faced hard times around the world — to the extent that they went extinct in North America and Europe. Of course, primates somehow survived in Africa and Southern Asia, because we’re still around to talk about it.” Because anthropoid primates — the forerunners of living monkeys, apes and humans — first appeared in Asia, understanding their fate on that continent is key to grasping the arc of early primate and human evolution.

Sarah Kaplan’s article in the Post speaks more than once of the fossils as “fill[ing] in the gaps”:

The fossils “fill a gap,” in our understanding of our evolutionary history, Stony Brook University primatologist John Fleagle, who was not involved in the study, told the Christian Science Monitor. They illustrate “a whole aspect of primate evolution that wasn’t clearly documented before.”

But the value of “filling a gap” lies in reducing the distance you have to leap in order to believe something seemingly far-fetched. More about rafting animals surely makes the challenge for evolution tougher, not easier. I would have said reducing, not increasing, the number of such unlikely sailors would “fill a gap.”

70,70,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Earth's ancient atmosphere was half as thick as it is today - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/earth-s-ancient-atmosphere-was-half-thick-it-today,"Air pressure is crucial for life. Not only does it help the atmosphere retain water vapor and trap heat from the sun, but it also affects the very chemical reactions on which life depends. Yet very little is known about how thick Earth’s ancient atmosphere once was. Now, a new study suggests that Earth’s atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago was between a quarter to half as thick as it is today. The finding could force scientists to re-examine nearly everything they know about Earth’s early atmosphere, from nitrogen-fixing cycles to how the young planet trapped enough heat to give rise life as we know it.

Scientists have long assumed that Earth’s ancient atmosphere had a stronger greenhouse than today’s. That’s because the sun put out 20% less heat than it does today, and even with elevated levels of greenhouse gases, Earth would have struggled to keep global temperatures above freezing. A thicker atmosphere would have helped to compensate. But in recent research, this expected thickness hasn’t been found: A 2012 study of fossilized raindrops, for example, found that Earth’s early atmosphere was as little as half as thick as it is today.

Now, the same team of scientists has come up with a more precise way of measuring early pressure: gas bubbles trapped in ancient lava. In what is now the Australian outback, basalt lavas poured out over thousands of square kilometers billions of years ago, hardening when they hit seawater. The lavas contained dissolved gases that fizzed as they emerged onto Earth’s surface, “like when you take the top off a cola bottle,” says Roger Buick, a geologist from the University of Washington (UW), Seattle, and an author on the new study, which is published today in Nature Geoscience. Unlike the drink though, the hot lava quickly cools and freezes, trapping the bubbles. By measuring the size of the bubbles at the top—which were pushing against the weight of the atmosphere—and comparing them with the smaller bubbles at the bottom—which were pushing against both the atmosphere and the weight of the rock itself—the team came up with a proxy for ancient air pressure.

“It’s really bold, really ambitious, and fraught with difficulties,” says Dork Sahagian, a geologist at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who invented the lava bubbling technique in the 1980s. “But you’ve got to try it. It’s as good a proxy of the pressure as you can hope to find.”

The difficulty was finding lava that was both old enough and pristine enough to have retained a true record of the deep past. The team needed to find samples that hadn’t been eroded away at the top, for example, or that hadn’t had fresh lava injected into their middles.

Buick and colleagues started their scouting 10 years ago, on 2.7-billion-year-old flood basalts from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Importantly, some of the lavas there had clearly reacted with ancient seawater, proving they had erupted at sea level. After years of hunting, only three slabs from all this extent were adequate for the task. When they first eyeballed the bubbles, sitting around a campfire, the implications were immediately obvious, and disturbing.

They quickly saw from the size of bubbles exposed at the surface that the ancient atmosphere must have been much lower than previously assumed. “[At first] we thought the results would be really boring, that atmospheric pressure has always been much the same, just as everyone expects,” says David Catling, an atmospheric scientist at UW. “So the question was, why was the pressure so low?”

The key was nitrogen. Today nitrogen dominates the atmosphere, making up four-fifths of our atmosphere; oxygen makes up the other fifth. At the time of the basalt eruptions, there was no free oxygen in the atmosphere—that didn’t happen until cyanobacteria flooded the atmosphere with the gas hundreds of millions of years later. So that absence would explain some of the difference between now and then, but not the 50% or more the bubbles reveal. The explanation for that has to involve a lack of nitrogen as well.

Although nitrogen appears to be extraordinarily inert, life today works hard to catch this biologically essential element using fixation. Bacteria and phytoplankton draw tens of millions of tons from the atmosphere every year. And each year, an equal amount is returned to the skies by a mixture of other biological and geological processes. Because the cycle is balanced, the net nitrogen in the atmosphere remains unchanged. Catling argues that the balance of these cycles must have been quite different in the past.

A high rate of removal, implying substantial biological fixation, without the balancing return would do. Last year, Buick published evidence that biological nitrogen fixation was already well established half a billion years before these Pilbara basalts erupted. He and Catling say that in the absence of oxygen, the return mechanism was weakened, so that for hundreds of millions of years, life steadily transformed the atmosphere by removing nitrogen. That impact was reversed only when life’s better known transformation, the Great Oxygenation Event, arrived about 2.4 billion years ago.

The low nitrogen levels, however, close off a nitrogen-boosted greenhouse effect as one favored solution to the problem of keeping Earth warm when the young sun was faint. Evidence has accumulated that levels of the known greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, were inadequate to compensate for the low warmth of the early sun. Yet evidence of ancient liquid water makes it clear the planet had not chilled below freezing. In 2009, Colin Goldblatt, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Victoria in Canada, proposed a way out. His calculations showed that in an atmosphere with double the nitrogen pressure, the effect of greenhouse gases could be amplified, producing enough warming to stop the planet freezing over. Goldblatt concedes that the new findings, if confirmed, kill that solution. “With such little pressure, it’s going to be very hard to account for the warm temperatures,” he says. But he still wants more evidence: A series of measures from other basalts of different ages would be ideal.

Buick and his team are already getting started. Right now, they are eyeing lavas even older than the Pilbara samples, in South Africa. But for now, they are keeping quiet about their exact location.","Mon, 09 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/earth_0.jpg?itok=8h3pPG7F,"['ancient', 'life', 'atmosphere', 'lava', 'thick', 'bubbles', 'nitrogen', 'today', 'half', 'greenhouse', 'pressure', 'earths']", 
71,71,FL-2016-000044-CHN,How Enterprise Products suddenly became the nation's largest crude exporter - Houston Chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/How-Enterprise-Products-suddenly-became-the-7468174.php,"Enterprise Products Partners has loaded more oil onto ships headed abroad than any other U.S. company, just five months after Congress lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports.

The Houston-based pipeline company has spent billions over the past decade to become the pre-eminent waterborne exporter of propane and butane, two fuels derived from natural gas, and it soon will be the largest exporter of ethane, a chemical that is key to making plastics.

Shale drilling operations have flooded the U.S. with propane, butane and light oil, and this surplus can be shipped to faraway consumers such as the giant petrochemical plants of China. The push into foreign markets with these products has placed Enterprise in the lead among North American oil and gas companies that are pushing to export crude now that the ban has been lifted.

""Once we recognized that this country was going to produce more than it could consume, it became obvious to us that you needed to be positioned to export,"" said Jim Teague, chief executive of Enterprise Products Partners.

The company's large stake in exporting fuel has helped turn the business from the two-truck shop founded locally by energy entrepreneur Dan Duncan into a truly global transporter of oil and gas. Today, Enterprise Products is one of Houston's largest companies, racking up more than $5 billion in revenue last quarter.

Its rapid expansion and the company's reputation as a tough competitor, though, have at times left it at odds with Federal Trade Commission regulators - and some of its own customers - who have worried that the company's large holdings have given it too much influence over the business of shipping crude oil abroad.

The rebirth of exports

The oil tanker BW Zambesi rewrote the rules of the oil business when it set sail for Asia from Enterprise Products' Galveston dock in July 2014.

This ship carried the first Texas oil sent overseas in four decades, and its departure meant that the shale drillers who had transformed the U.S. energy markets now had access to global buyers.

When the ship sailed, the export ban on U.S. crude oil was still in effect. Lawyers and executives at Enterprise Products had spent weeks working with the U.S. Department of Commerce to open a loophole in the 1975 ban that allowed them to slip through shipments of lightly processed condensate, a type of thin and very flammable oil that was common in the U.S. but a poor fit for refineries on the Gulf Coast.

The discovery of the loophole was somewhat of an accident, Enterprise executive Bill Ordemann said. His colleagues and lawyers had pitched to regulators the idea that lightly processed condensate oil could be exported under existing laws.

""I left that meeting frankly flabbergasted, because at the end of the presentation they said, 'Well, that's very good,' "" Ordermann said. ""When I got out of there, I looked at the lawyer and said, 'What just happened?' ""

Once discovered, the oil began to flow through the loophole.

The U.S. exported an average of 40,000 barrels per day of processed condensate from July 2014 to April 2015, according to figures from consulting group McKinsey & Co. Other companies, such as driller Pioneer Natural Resources and natural gas pipeline giant Kinder Morgan, rushed into the condensate export business as well.

By the end of 2015, Enterprise estimated it was shipping 134,000 barrels per day of processed condensate and crude oil abroad. A portion of that oil was crude that was re-exported from the Gulf Coast.

That's a small amount of the roughly 9 million barrels per day American drillers produced during that period, but a significant increase for a country that had locked itself out of international exports for more than 40 years.

It also formed a small, but growing part of Enterprise's business. In the first quarter 2016, the company reported that its pipelines moved 5.2 million barrels per day of oil, fuels and chemicals. It moved 1.3 million barrels of those fuels through its marine terminals.

In December, U.S. lawmakers repealed the ban on exports entirely, clearing companies to begin shipping oil abroad without even the light processing condensate exports had previously required. The first cargoes of wholly unprocessed oil left U.S. shores shortly after. Enterprise was the second company to send a cargo abroad.

For the first quarter of 2016, Enterprise said it expects to load about 165,000 barrels per day of oil onto ships headed abroad.

""They've worked their way into the enviable position of being the largest oil exporter,"" said Darren Horrowitz, an analyst who tracks the company for Raymond James. Enterprise ""is doing things that other folks aren't doing right now.""

Export volumes and the business of loading oil onto tankers have been hurt somewhat by low oil prices. U.S. oil production has fallen from 9.6 million barrels per day in early 2015 to 9.1 million barrels today as drillers have cut back, meaning there's less U.S. oil to send abroad.

Most of the oil currently exported is crude that isn't a good fit for the refineries in the U.S., said Kurt Barrow, an oil market expert at consulting group IHS. But volumes should grow when prices recover.

""We're seeing exports that used to go only to Canada are now going to Japan, China, the Netherlands and Italy,"" he said. Light crude oils such as condensate ""really have a better market in Asia, where they're needed for petrochemical feedstock.""

Dominant ingredients

While Enterprise's leading position in the crude oil and condensate export markets is new, it has long been dominant in exporting propane and butane overseas.

Its control of the market dates back to 2010, when propane and butane were fuels in search of a burner.

Neither fuel is pumped out of the ground, but instead is pulled out of natural gas and crude oil as the two raw fuels are processed. A shale boom had production of oil and gas surging, and propane and butanes had been caught up in the rush.

But while the U.S. had plenty of pent-up demand for oil and some for gas, there was little need for the flood of propane and butane. Propane is best known as a blue flame that grills meats or heats homes, and butane is an even lighter fuel that's used to light cigarettes or is blended into gasoline. Both are key ingredients for the chemicals that make plastics.

By 2008, supply for the light gases had far outpaced demand in some parts of the U.S. While petrochemical plants in Asia were clamoring for propane and butane, drillers in some parts of the U.S. were essentially paying customers to take the fuel off their hands.

Enterprise decided it would be the one to link the two markets.

The company already owned a propane terminal it had set up on the Houston Ship Channel to import the fuel before the shale boom. In 1998, founder and then-CEO Duncan had decided to add a small hookup that would cool propane and butane into a gas, then load it onto tankers, where it could then be shipped across the globe. The terminal sat mostly unused until the shale boom.

""In 2009, all the sudden we got a lot of people wanting to export,"" said Teague, the current CEO of Enterprise. The company went on a full building spree: ""We just kept having people wanting capacity.""

By 2013, the company had most of the waterborne-export market for propane in the U.S. Enterprise had enough dock capacity to load 6.81 million tons of the liquefied fuel onto tankers each year, while the entire U.S. capacity totaled 9.32 million tons per year, according to IHS figures. Enterprise owned almost 75 percent of the exporting capacity.

And business was good. Even though a cold winter had led to higher propane prices and cut into exports, Enterprise's chief financial officer, Randy Fowler, told analysts during a 2013 conference call that new customers were calling ""every day.""

""The U.S. has gone from being not a player in the export market to being the largest player in the world in 10 years,"" IHS' Debnil Chowdhury said of propane and butane.

About the same time, Enterprise began eyeing the company it had long partnered with in its export business. Oiltanking Holdings Americas, an affiliate of German company Oiltanking, had for some time offered additional ship loading and dock space for the fuel that Enterprise was shipping abroad, and the latest expansion by Enterprise had brought the two to sign a 50-year contract to work together.

But Enterprise wanted more than partnerships, and Enterprise began negotiating an outright purchase of Oiltanking's Houston Ship Channel assets in the summer of 2014.

Oiltanking Partners owned 12 docks on the Houston Ship Channel and in Beaumont, and controlled another 24 million barrels of storage for oil and refined products. The assets didn't come cheap: Enterprise paid about $5.8 billion for the deal, which was fully consummated in early 2015.

""We've been lusting after those assets for years,"" Michael Creel, Enterprise's chief executive officer at the time, said during a conference call with analysts.

In 2016, with the merger for Oiltanking completed and the final expansion of its Ship Channel assets finished, Enterprise will have the capacity to load about 16 million tons per annum of LPG onto tankers - just under half of the capacity in the U.S.

Enterprise has also pioneered exporting American ethane, a fuel that's pulled out of natural gas and used as an ingredient in plastics manufacturing.

So much ethane has been pulled from shale recently that prices for the fuel have at times collapsed low enough that processors don't even bother to pull it from natural gas. But in Asia, it's a key part of the manufacturing chain that has plenty of value.

Enterprise Products is building the world's largest ethane export facility at Morgan's Point on the Houston Ship Channel. When it begins ramping up in the third quarter of 2016, the Morgan's Point facility will have two trains and two docks capable of loading about 200,000 barrels per day onto ships.

Stepping on toes

Enterprise hasn't come to dominate the export markets for several fuels without ruffling feathers.

In February 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began asking questions about Enterprise's acquisition of Oiltanking and business practices. The Texas attorney general followed in April, according to Enterprise's ilings.

The Federal Trade Commission doesn't acknowledge its investigations, and a spokeswoman declined to comment. Enterprise declined to comment past what it has already said. An inquiry is a non-public investigation that can, but doesn't always, lead to an official action by the commission.

The questions came after Enterprise's customers reportedly complained that the company had raised the fees it charged customers to load oil onto ships. The higher fees raised the costs of their logistics services and made Enterprise's own logistics business more competitive.

When asked about the complaints at an analyst meeting in early 2015, Teague said Enterprise itself was paying an 85-cent fee to load oil onto ships, a lower rate secured by offering a long-term 50-year contract. If other companies wanted to sign long-term contracts, Enterprise would be happy to give them deals, he said.

77,77,FL-2016-000044-CHN,High April insured catastrophe losses led by $2bn+ Japan quakes: Aon - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/high-april-insured-catastrophe-losses-led-by-2bn-japan-quakes-aon/,"April 2016 saw the highest level of global natural catastrophe and severe weather losses for that month in five years, according to insurance and reinsurance broker Aon, with over $2 billion of insurance industry losses from the Japan earthquakes and $3 billion from a spate U.S. severe convective weather outbreaks.



April’s toll takes the all important U.S. insurance industry losses from natural catastrophe and severe weather events to $7.4 billion for the first four months of the year, with $6.17 billion from severe convective storms (so thunderstorm, tornadoes, damaging winds and hail) alone, as we wrote recently here.

April’s insured catastrophe loss experience around the globe was led by the Japan earthquakes, which caused massive devastation, resulting in physical damage to residential and commercial structures, vehicles and infrastructure, and business interruption losses.

The April monthly catastrophe recap report from reinsurance broker Aon Benfield’s risk analytics unit Impact Forecasting provides an estimate for the insured losses from the Japanese earthquakes that struck the Kumamoto region, Kysuhu Island of the country in early April.

Impact Forecasting said that the economic losses from the Japanese quakes are expected to pass $10 billion, while the insurance industry loss is expected to exceed $2 billion. That estimate of insurance and likely some reinsurance industry losses is aligned with other estimates which have suggested somewhere around $2 billion to be the right range.

Meanwhile the severe convective weather in the United States, including severe hail events in Texas, is estimated to have caused economic damages of over $4 billion and an insurance industry loss of over $4 billion.

The magnitude-7.8 Ecuador earthquake April, is estimated to have caused an economic loss of above $3 billion, but insurance industry impact is expected to be minimal given the much lower insurance penetration rate in the country.

Steve Bowen, Director at Impact Forecasting, commented on April’s catastrophe loads; “The global footprint of natural disaster losses in April was significant. Between major events such as the Kumamoto earthquake, the severe convective storms and flooding in the United States, and flooded agriculture in Argentina, economic and insured losses are poised to make this the costliest April since 2011.

“The large differential between the economic and insured losses is yet another reminder of how much opportunity exists for the insurance industry to help engage with governments, communities and businesses around the world to provide the risk expertise that can help mitigate the effects of natural disasters.”

Year-to-date globally we Impact Forecasting’s numbers show $45.68 billion of economic losses from natural disasters and weather catastrophes, with $11.25 billion of the losses covered by insurance.

So despite the particularly active April, the year as a whole remains within expectations, as far as insured losses go. But given the uptick in recent weeks and with other events such as the Fort McMurray wildfire in Canada suggesting further billion dollar plus insured events, it will be interesting to see how the reinsurance and ILS markets react if that uptick in event frequency continues.

PCS also noted yesterday that first-quarter 2016 catastrophe frequency and insured loss severity in the U.S. has been the highest seen in a decade.

Other events of note during the month of April 2016 include:

Excessive rains led to considerable flooding across Argentina, with the provinces of Entre Rios, Corrientes, Santa Fe, Chaco, Formosa, and Santiago del Estero and Uruguay sustaining the worst damage. Total economic losses to agriculture alone were estimated at ARS18.6 billion (USD1.3 billion).

A prodigious U.S. rainfall event caused major flash flooding in the greater Houston metro region, resulting in total economic losses expected to exceed USD1.0 billion.

Major flood events were recorded in Chile, China, Ecuador, Uruguay, Haiti, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Uganda, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, India, and Afghanistan.

The combination of heavy rainfall from two tropical disturbances and Tropical Cyclone Zena led to flooding across several islands of the Fiji archipelago, killing two people.

An unseasonably intense heatwave killed at least 300 people in India, with the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh noting temperatures above 44°C (111°F).

78,78,FL-2016-000044-CHN,"1996 Olympic games put Athens, Sanford Stadium in front of global audience - Online Athens",https://www.onlineathens.com/article/20160507/SPORTS/305079954,"Vince Dooley sat with Billy Payne's family in Tokyo in 1990 as they, and the world, awaited the announcement for the site of the 1996 Olympics.

Payne's wife, Martha, and his daughter, Elizabeth, gripped Dooley's hands as then-International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch prepared to speak.

When Samaranch announced Atlanta as the host, ""There was an incredible burst of excitement among the Georgia people,"" Dooley said.

""It was just a thrill, even to the point where I got a little emotional. I don't cry easy, but some tears came to my eyes.""

Those tears got the legendary Georgia football coach into trouble. His wife, Barbara, was in Athens when she saw the television broadcast of the announcement. She scolded him for crying at the announcement but not crying at their wedding or the birth of their children.

""Well, that's how meaningful it was to me and how special it was for it to happen,"" Dooley said.

Payne said he was relieved when the Olympic site was finally announced on Sept. 18, 1990.

""I remember the final day of our presentation, the thought that I really had was, 'Just get it over. Just vote. Somebody wins, and if we win or lose, I'm gonna be fine because it's gonna be over,'"" Payne said.

The day after the IOC voted for Atlanta as the host, Athens' role in the 1996 Games began with a conversation between Dooley and Payne, who played under Dooley and is now the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club.

That conversation, between two of Athens' most well-known sports leaders, put Athens in front of a global audience, particularly when the U.S. women's soccer team won its first Olympic gold in Sanford Stadium. Athens also hosted volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics events.

""We were very much aware of the tradition of playing at the University of Georgia,"" said Briana Scurry, the goalkeeper for the U.S. women, who defeated China 2-1 in the Olympic final. ""My dad and I used to watch football games, college and pro, all the time when I was as old as I can remember, so I knew who Herschel Walker was.""

The women's gold-medal game was held the night of Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1996. It was the first time any sport but American football was played in Sanford Stadium.

To accommodate the dimensions of a soccer field, the field at Sanford Stadium was flattened and its signature hedges were removed. Many football purists decried the actions.

Dooley said he and his team were able to temper the backlash by highlighting the hedges' health. The original hedges had stood since the stadium was built in 1929, but they were infested with nematodes, which are parasites that can cause damage to the roots and other parts of plants.

""We took cuttings of the hedges and grew them in Thomson, Georgia, and also down in Florida,"" Dooley said. ""We replaced them with 'Hedges II.' They were the sons and daughters of the original hedge, so everybody bought off on it after they saw it was a blessing in disguise and the hedges are gonna come back.""

FIFA, the international governing body of soccer, was less resistant than Georgia's football fans when it came to holding the soccer games in Sanford Stadium. Former Terry College professor Dick Hudson, who was brought on board by Payne to help coordinate events, remembers touring Sanford with then-FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter, Dooley, Payne and and then-UGA president Charles Knapp.

After a side conversation, Blatter shook their hands. Hudson asked Payne what it meant, and he replied, ""You've got soccer.""

When the U.S. women's soccer team advanced to play China in the gold-medal round, it attracted quite a bit of attention.

""I remember helicoptering in,"" Payne said. ""I landed on the football practice fields because, as crazy as my schedule was, there was no way I was gonna miss one of the soccer games in the stadium where I played college football. There was just no way.""

Scurry said China had a contingent of fans, but they were vastly outnumbered by the U.S. fans. That made for an electric atmosphere, with Scurry describing the noise as ""rolling thunder"" whenever the U.S. crossed midfield and tried to score. Scurry said the team wanted to soak it in after winning the gold medal.

""We didn't want to leave the field to go get our presentation outfit on to get our medals, because it was so exciting being out there and running around with the flag and everything,"" Scurry said. ""It was a magical night.""

Lisa Dillman was in the press box that night, working for The Los Angeles Times. She said the frenzy powered by the 76,481 fans was every bit as enthralling as Scurry described.

""Until the (1999) Women's World Cup in the United States, I can't remember a better atmosphere for a women's 'team' sporting event,"" Dillman said. ""Athens embraced futbol that night and didn't let it go.""

Scurry went on to win the 1999 World Cup. She also medaled in a couple more Olympic Games, including another gold medal during the 2004 Games held in Athens, Greece. Scurry says she still considers the 1996 gold medal her favorite.

Winning that medal marked the completion of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

""I had dreamt of that Olympic games since I was 8 years old,"" she said. ""I actually made a poster when I was in my teens that said '1996 Atlanta: I Have a Dream.' And I put it on my wall when I was 12 or 13 years old, and then I was there when I was 24. It's pretty crazy, if you ask me.""

Scurry was so excited that, later that night, she fulfilled a promise she made in a preview story published by Sports Illustrated a month before the Olympics. She ran naked about 20 yards down a road near some UGA sororities, wearing only her gold medal, and she said she would've shown it to anyone who might have arrived and questioned her antics.

Claude Felton, who has worked for UGA's athletic association since 1979, served as the venue press chief for the Olympic soccer games. He can't recall anything bigger that happened in Athens than the Olympics.

""From a campus standpoint, I think it's one of the great points of pride in the history of the university,"" said Felton, UGA's senior associate athletic director. ""How many universities can say that they hosted Olympic events? Hardly any in this country.""

The buzz generated by the soccer games drew international attention. Hudson said he remembers seeing newspapers from London, Jerusalem and a couple other places that featured stories centered on UGA because of the soccer matches. Soccer's international reach put Athens on display like never before.

""I was over in London a couple months after the Olympics,"" Hudson said, ""and just happened to be talking to someone. I said, 'I'm from the States,' and he asked where and I said, 'Down in Georgia, and really, the University of Georgia.' And this guy said immediately, 'Oh, that's where the soccer games were.'""

Athens native Ted Baker worked under Dooley, who was UGA's athletic director at the time, as a student assistant. He helped organize IOC accommodations, including hotel stays and transportation.

""People loved that small-town Georgia feel of Athens, that small-town college feel,"" said Baker, who now works at the Lake Oconee Land & Home real estate brokerage company. ""I would say it's hard to measure, but (hosting the Olympics) definitely had a huge impact.""

The events certainly had a lasting effect on Payne. He carried the Olympic torch into Sanford Stadium during the torch relay prior to the events. Payne was flanked by Elizabeth and his son, William. He handed the torch off to Dooley, who ran it out of the stadium.

Dooley has a picture of the moment hanging on his wall. He can vividly recall the reactions of the crowd, and the momentary pause Payne took to honor his late father, Porter, who died 14 years earlier. Payne wouldn't have done it any other way.

""I did it for a reason, because if there's any point in the world where my life intersects, it's on the field at Sanford Stadium,"" Payne said. ""My father played there, Coach Dooley taught me the game there. We are great fans. I was born in Athens. Sanford Stadium is precious ground zero to me, and to be able to do this great, symbolic gesture of running the torch and do it with my children in Sanford Stadium, that's right up there.""

Dooley looks at the torch relay photo with fondness, and just like those tears filled his eyes in 1990, memories flood the forefront of his thoughts.

Though his home is filled with memorabilia from his coaching days - murals, plaques commemorating his accomplishments and the 1980 Coaches Trophy for winning the national championship - the picture of him and Payne reminds him of the years of hard work put in by them, Hudson and countless others.

It reminds him that his national title and major football victories have a certain limited scope. It reminds him that the 1996 Olympics put the town he's called home for 52 years on the international map.

""All these other things that have taken place was statewide or nationally, but we're talking about an international flavor to bring that to Athens, to Georgia and to Atlanta,"" he said. ""And it gave the university such an international exposure that we'd never had. To be a part of that was very, very special.""","Sat, 07 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.onlineathens.com/storyimage/GA/20160507/SPORTS/305079954/AR/0/AR-305079954.jpg,"['stadium', 'audience', 'dooley', 'payne', 'olympic', 'soccer', 'global', 'sanford', 'football', 'georgia', 'games', '1996', 'athens']",

Indeed, criticizing Trump for inconsistency when it comes to foreign policy is a bit rich when you consider that both Democrats and Republicans have treated Pakistan as an ally, knowing full well that its secret service has trucked with terrorists and coddled the Taliban — the people killing U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan; they’ve both treated Saudi Arabia as an ally because we needed its oil, knowing full well that its export of Salafist Islam has fueled jihadists; they both supported decapitating Libya and then not staying around to support a new security order, thus opening a gaping hole on the African coast for migrants to flow into Europe; they’ve both supported NATO expansion into Russia’s face and then wondered aloud why the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is so truculent.

No, if I were critiquing Trump’s foreign policy views it would not be on inconsistency, hypocrisy or lying. It would be that he shows no sign of having asked the most important question: What are the real foreign policy challenges the next president will face? I don’t think he has a clue, because if he did, he wouldn’t want the job. This is one of the worst times to be conducting U.S. foreign policy.

Consider some of the questions that will greet the Oval Office’s next occupant. For starters, what does the new president do when the necessary is impossible but the impossible is necessary? Yes, we’ve proved in Iraq and Afghanistan that we don’t know how to do nation-building in other people’s countries. But just leaving Libya, Syria and parts of Iraq and Yemen ungoverned, and spewing out refugees, has led to a flood of migrants hitting Europe and stressing the cohesion of the European Union; that refugee flood could very well lead to Britain’s exit from the E.U.

President Obama has been patting himself on the back a lot lately for not intervening in Syria. I truly sympathized with how hard that call was — until I heard the president and his aides boasting about how smart their decision was and how stupid all their critics are. The human and geopolitical spillover from Syria is not over. It’s destabilizing the E.U., Lebanon, Iraq, Kurdistan and Jordan. The choices are hellish. I would not want the responsibility for making them. But nobody has a monopoly on genius here, and neither Obama’s victory lap around this smoldering ruin nor Trump’s bombastic and simplistic solutions are pretty to watch.","Wed, 11 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2016,"['universe', 'policy', 'treated', 'theyve', 'necessary', 'miss', 'iraq', 'supported', 'foreign', 'times', 'president', 'syria', 'york', 'trumps']",

Marijuana-lovers took to the streets in Bogota and Medellin in the South American country, where their impressive efforts were put on display.

Some smoked the drug through fruit like apples, others crafted bongs from larger tropical fruits such as watermelons and pineapples.

Attendees at Colombia's Global Marijuana Marches in Bogota and Medellin put lots of effort into they cannabis smoking at the event

Saturday's march saw protestors take a stand over the legalisation of marijuana by smoking the drug out of intricate fruit devices

Others, like this man in Medellin, took turns on giant joints which they made for the event

The march, which took place in more than 100 cities across the world on Saturday, was to call for a relaxation of drugs laws.

Proponents believe that the use of marijuana should be allowed for both medical and recreational use.

Thousands of people turned out to both marches, with many wearing cannabis-leaf themed clothing.

Others committed to the cause by shaving marijuana imagery into their hair, while some smoked three-foot long hand-rolled spliffs made especially for the marches.

Colombians are allowed to grow marijuana, but this is limited to a maximum of 20 plants at once

Colombia has much more lenient cannabis laws than other countries where marches were happening.

There is no limit on how much a person can be of possession of if it is for medicinal or scientific purposes and licensed by the country's National Anti-Narcotics Council.

A person can be in possession of up to 22 grams for personal use without facing persecution.

Selling and transporting the plant-based drugs, however, is only legal for scientific and medical purposes.

Colombians are allowed to grow marijuana, but this is limited to a maximum of 20 plants at once.

This man, who chose a marijuana leaf-print hat for the day, made a smoking device out of a watermelon and two apples

Some protesters went the extra mile for the cause, this woman shaved a cannabis leaf into the side of her head

Over 100 separate protests took place on Saturday. Pictured is a woman in a flower crown lighting a roll-up in the Rio de Janeiro event

Protesters hit the street not just in Colombia but all over the world in the annual event.

In South Africa, thousands took to the streets of Cape Town on Saturday demanding a relaxation of drugs laws.

Possessing any marijuana is illegal in South Africa and punishable by prosecution - it is, however, widely available.

Around 3,000 protesters took part in the march, some smoking cannabis and others carrying placards or cannabis plants growing in portable containers.

Possession of marijuana is legal up to 22 grams in Colombia, and in both cities demonstrators were smoking the drug on the streets

'We were marching for the legalisation and regulation of cannabis in South Africa,' lead organiser Johannes Berkhout said.

'There is more than enough evidence around the world about the medicinal benefits of cannabis,' he said, adding that legalisation would create a 'safer and much more controllable' use of the drug.

Use of cannabis and medicinal marijuana is gaining popularity in some parts of the world to ease suffering from cancer, glaucoma, HIV and AIDS, and other serious conditions.

“Most of the people I’ve talked to that have gone through this, that have had loved ones overdose, even if they’ve survived, almost none of them saw it coming,” he says. “They were totally blindsided and had no idea their loved one was an abuser of opiates.”

“When everyone is paying attention to something because of what’s happening in the news, it’s a really opportunity to provide knowledge. People are hungry for this knowledge,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure we’re filling that gap.”

While the majority of America only thinks about this issue when tragedy strikes, Gupta has been covering it for several years. He produced a successful documentary on the topic and recently spoke with President Obama about the issue.

The human body naturally produces opiates, but it stop producing them when opiate pills enter the system, according to Gupta. If someone suddenly stops taking the pills, the body crashes.

Gupta said that Prince’s emergency landing a week before his death did not appear to simply be a case of withdrawal.

“All we know, and this is from some of the recordings from the plane to the FAA, was that he was not arousable. He was essentially unconscious. That would seem more consistent with someone who may have overdosed more so than withdraw.”

If Prince’s plane made the now-infamous emergency landing because of a drug overdose, Gupta says he found it “a little surprising” that the music icon was left alone at his Paisley Park estate, instead of under the care of a doctor.

“They can’t mandate that a person be observed, but I think common sense for someone who has gone through that sort of an event, if that’s what happened, probably having friends or someone to keep an eye on him makes a lot of sense,” Gupta said. “I did find it a little surprising that he was all alone, considering how sick it sounds like he had been over the previous couple of weeks.”","Wed, 11 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gupta-Prince-2.jpg,"['know', 'hopes', 'emergency', 'gupta', 'death', 'catalyst', 'sanjay', 'read', 'overdose', 'america', 'dr', 'prince', 'landing', 'opiate', 'princes', 'fight', 'abuse']",

Concussion Payouts Have Lenders Circling - New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/sports/football/nfl-football-concussion-settlement-payouts-have-lenders-circling.html,"Most players are expected to get far less than millions. A sliding scale reduces the payouts for players who were in the league fewer than five years and players who are older than 45, and the players could spend months trying to get approved, all while the interest on their loans is piling up.

Players who fail to qualify for cash settlements, however, do not have to repay what they borrow, a substantial risk for the lenders.

“If the case doesn’t get won, the money doesn’t get paid back,” said Kelly Gilroy, the executive director of the American Legal Finance Association, which represents about 40 lenders. She estimated that about 25 percent of presettlement loans result in a loss to the lender because the settlement did not come through.

Lenders take the chance that some loans will not be repaid because they make sizable profits from their other clients. Most presettlement loans are for small amounts, like when a person in a car accident needs $5,000 to pay hospital bills while awaiting an insurance payout. As a rule of thumb, companies lend about 10 percent of what they expect the plaintiff to be awarded.

Lenders are raising that threshold to 25 percent or higher for N.F.L. players, not just because they could receive six- and seven-figure settlements, but because the N.F.L. has published a grid detailing the range of potential awards, something normally unavailable or confidential in other cases.

Ron Sinai, who works for Nova Legal Funding, a company in Los Angeles that finds clients for presettlement lenders, said this information gives companies more assurance when lending to players. “The N.F.L. is very careful about its image and wants to get this headache over with and pay out as soon as possible,” he said.

Sinai said lenders charged higher interest rates than banks because making nonrecourse loans, as they are known, was riskier. Unlike a traditional loan, the collateral is the settlement itself.","Mon, 09 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/07/sports/09LOANS1/09LOANS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7e68aa82e7bc5c0273c65ddcf2bf37ed066fe2fced64e3c5ac54dc498ae6f0fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['pay', 'nfl', 'circling', 'concussion', 'loans', 'players', 'legal', 'interest', 'presettlement', 'settlement', 'settlements', 'lenders', 'payouts']", 
90,90,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Shell outlines ‘below 2C’ climate change scenario - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/shell-outlines-below-2c-climate-change-scenario,"Oil major Shell has for the first time sketched out what it thinks it would take for the world to avoid 2C of global warming.

In a supplement to its well-known New Lens scenarios, titled, “A better life with a healthy planet“, and released online this week, it sets out its vision for how to meet the ambition of the Paris climate deal, agreed last December.

Shell has previously studied – but refused to publish – a 2C-compatible scenario, telling Carbon Brief last year it might not be “helpful” to do so.

Carbon Brief runs through the highlights of Shell’s new work, and what it means for the company and beyond.

Change of heart

In the past, Shell has been criticised for failing to publish scenarios compatible with the global goal of avoiding 2C of warming. Instead, it has maintained that the world is not on course to avoid 2C.

Shell says its New Lens scenarios correspond to around 2.5C of warming this century, with global emissions reaching net-zero around 2100. In a 30-page letter to investors sent in mid-2014, Shell wrote:

“Our New Lens scenarios show that the world can tackle and resolve the climate issue over the course of this century, but not in less time than that…We also do not see governments taking the steps now that are consistent with [avoiding 2C].”

What’s more, Shell has dismissed those, such as Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who have warned that fossil fuel assets could become stranded and worthless in the face of climate action.

December’s Paris Agreement upped the ante by aiming to limiting warming since the pre-industrial period to “well below 2C” and to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5C. Under shareholder pressure, Shell recently agreed to be more transparent about its exposure to climate risks, and to release other climate-related information.

Paris-compatible?

It’s in that context that Shell has published this week’s supplement to the New Lens scenarios. Whereas those scenarios contained detailed, quantitative outlooks for the future global energy mix in particular years, the supplement only provides a broad narrative sweep.

The new report expands on a 2014 essay by Jeremy Bentham, vice president global business environment for Shell and the head of the company’s scenarios team.

Glossary Net-zero emissions: When greenhouse gas emissions are balanced by removals, so the sum total is zero or less. Scientists say the world must reach net-zero later this century to limit warming to below 2C. Close When greenhouse gas emissions are balanced by removals, so the sum total is zero or less.

It sketches out what would need to happen under an “accelerated net-zero emissions scenario”, which would come closer to being compatible with the aims of the Paris agreement. Having previously argued that net-zero could not be reached before 2100, Shell concedes that it might be possible under a “Goldilocks” pathway with a “combination of all the most optimistic outcomes”.

In a foreword to the report, Bentham writes:

[This is the] story of one possible pathway involving a patchwork of solutions that could result in a better life with a healthy planet on a timescale consistent with global aspirations.”

Shell still contends that some sources of greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to eliminate. It says carbon capture and storage (CCS) plus negative emissions technologies will be needed to offset these residual emissions. (Not everyone agrees. Check out Carbon Brief’s archive to learn more about the political, technical and environmental constraints at play).

Like its New Lens predecessors, therefore, the accelerated scenario involves reaching net-zero emissions. The difference is in how quickly the world gets there.

Shell says getting to net-zero by 2100 would equate to 2.5C of warming, with a 2070 deadline for 2C and 2050 for 1.5C. These dates are broadly in line with the latest science, which Shell cites in its report.

Shell does not explicitly give a date for net-zero emissions in its accelerated scenario, but it does say it would result in warming of no more than 2C, meaning net-zero would have to be reached around 2070.

Similarly, Shell does not say whether its new scenario would meet the Paris goal of staying “well below” 2C, let alone the aspiration to avoid 1.5C. The supplement includes the chart, below. Its accelerated scenario would lie somewhere in the orange shaded range.

How to avoid 2C

As noted above, Shell says it would take a “Goldilocks” combination of factors to reach its 2C scenario, but what would that actually mean? In its report, Shell sketches out what sort of things would need to change.

To support the transition, it says economic growth ought to be “neither too fast, so that there is time for adjustment, nor too slow, choking funds for investment”. The most important near-term change, it says, would be a shift away from coal-fired power generation towards natural gas.

It repeats its long-standing support for carbon pricing, preferably at global scale. It adds that state or national schemes might need to add border tax adjustments to avoid carbon leakage.

Shell also calls for technology investment – in particular, for CCS – and for energy efficiency measures that can overcome non-financial barriers to deployment.

At country level, the report says China’s coal use would need to peak by 2020 (it’s worth adding that some believe it may have peaked already). In India, low-cost solar and gas grids would moderate coal expansion and emissions would plateau in the 2030s.

In the US, the 2C scenario would see “more people become aware of the costs of adaptation to climate change because of increased turbulent weather patterns and the impacts of ecological events on international (and hence national) security, trade and investment”.

The Clean Power Plan would overcome the legal challenges it faces, while “investors who face the prospect of holding ‘stranded’ capital in power generation…[would] instigate market reform” and wind and solar would thrive as “normal business[es]”.

In Europe, countries would progressively manage the intermittency of wind and solar energy through interconnected electricity networks, and surplus offshore wind would be used to generate hydrogen. Fossil fuels’ share of the EU energy mix would fall to around a fifth, from today’s 70%, though it does not say by when.

What it means for Shell

The report talks of major changes in the shape of the global economy. However, it lacks the information needed to assess in detail what it would mean for Shell and the wider world. Even so, it does contain some intriguing indications on Shell’s thinking.

For instance, it notes that some businesses may face “diminished returns as some investments – particularly unabated hydrocarbon infrastructure – become redundant”.

Elsewhere it says:

“We believe our portfolio is resilient under a wide range of outlooks, including the IEA’s 450 scenario [compatible with avoiding 2C of warming]…[However,] we have no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10–20 years.

In other words, despite publishing a 2C scenario, Shell’s position has not shifted significantly. It effectively argues not only that a well-below 2C or 1.5C scenario is stretching credulity, but that its “investment horizon” is too short to be materially affected, even if emissions are brought down to reach net-zero by 2070. Only time will tell if it is correct.

He also expressed concern that the incident would prompt a flood of falsified research data, as no one was held responsible.

Last week, Apple Daily reported that Professor Yang Dan and two PhD students at the University of Hong Kong allegedly published false data in the Journal of the American Chemistry Society in July 2014. The complaints were initially made by Dr. Roger Wong Hoi-fung, a former research assistant professor of HKU’s chemistry faculty.

After nearly two years of investigation, the university announced that the data was invalid, but the complaint against Yang was dismissed as it was accepted that she was not aware of how the data had been falsified. A separate disciplinary hearing against the students, which did not include any chemistry experts, dismissed the charges without any explanation.

‘Retaliation’

Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Monday, Wong slammed the university for its handling of the matter, saying that although the school has a whistleblowing policy in place, it was practically nonexistent in reality. Wong said that he and several other whistleblowers faced acts of retaliation, including being issued a letter of termination, being barred from the laboratories, and being accused of stealing computers and data. He resigned last July, Ming Pao reported.

“I was very disappointed by the handling of [the incident] by the university’s management. In order to maintain my stance, I quit [my job],” Wong said.

Yang said in a statement released by HKU that Wong’s accusations were based on one-sided, incomplete and selective data. She also said that Wong had never made any complaints about the paper until he was issued a notice of termination in 2014. However, Wong said that he did not receive the termination notice until after lodging the complaint, and that the letter was backdated to 2014.

Lawmaker Albert Ho Chun-yan, who is assisting Wong, said that Yang’s claims about Wong’s firing could be defamatory, Apple Daily reported. He also said that falsifying data may constitute dishonest use of computer.

Wong said that he has sent a letter to the school’s governing council chairman Arthur Li Kwok-cheung, as well as The University Grants Committee, asking them to follow up on the matter and for the investigation’s report to be publicised.

Wong also said that he, along with the unions of the University of Hong Kong and the Baptist University of Hong Kong, are establishing an “academic research honesty concern group” to offer help to other whistleblowers.","Wed, 11 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/10la7p3.jpg?fit=640%2C402&ssl=1,"['research', 'school', 'hong', 'professor', 'termination', 'apple', 'letter', 'policies', 'teacher', 'wong', 'university', 'kong', 'scandal', 'data', 'whistleblowing', 'revealed', 'poor', 'slams', 'exhku']",

This gathering gives the president and Nordic nations an opportunity to launch new initiatives to curb climate change while supporting sustainable development, to avoid dangerous Arctic warming tipping points, and to reduce the pressures that cause climate change-induced migration.

The stakes for President Obama and the Nordic leaders are high. More intense and frequent extreme droughts, heat waves, storms, sea level rise, and floods—all symptoms of a warming world—have triggered humanitarian crises and mass migrations and are driving food and water shortages; exacerbating poverty; accelerating conflict; and wreaking havoc from Europe to the Middle East, from Africa to Asia and from the Amazon to the Arctic.

President Obama is making the most of his remaining months in office to combat climate change, as evidenced by the new and ambitious bilateral climate change commitments with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, and President Xi Jinping of China. When Nordic leaders and President Obama meet, they should embrace key aspects of these recent bilateral climate commitments. For example, the U.S.-Nordic joint statement should draw from the U.S.-Canada joint statement pledges to achieve the following goals, among many others:

Implement the Paris Agreement.

Set a world-class standard for approving Arctic commercial activity—including shipping, fishing, and oil and gas exploration and development—that supports national and global climate change goals.

Create low-impact Arctic shipping corridors to safeguard important ecological and cultural areas and to reduce the risks of heavy fuel oil, or HFO, use and black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping.

Reduce methane emissions, including those from the oil and gas sector.

Accelerate renewable energy development and innovation through initiatives such as Mission Innovation and the Clean Energy Ministerial.

Negotiate a Montreal Protocol hydrofluorocarbon phase-down amendment in 2016, and increase financial support to developing countries to help them implement a phasedown.

By adopting the commitments above—and launching new actions in the three areas below—President Obama and the five Nordic leaders can cut their nations’ greenhouse gas emissions, protect the Arctic, and help secure more ambitious climate change action globally.

Combat climate change while supporting sustainable development

To curb global climate change under the Paris climate agreement, world leaders are deepening existing partnerships and launching new ones with developing countries to support a shift toward resilient, low-carbon economic growth. To accelerate this shift, country leaders will need to continue to ramp up public and private climate finance. By the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s count, the climate finance gap is about $40 billion per year short of the 2009 goal set by world leaders in Copenhagen, Denmark, to raise $100 billion per year by 2020. To close this gap, the Nordic leaders and President Obama should commit to expanding their use of public financing to leverage private-sector investment in low-carbon and resilient development. For example, U.S. and Nordic leaders should build on innovative approaches already employed by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Danish Climate Investment Fund, and government and business members of The Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance. These groups leverage pension fund investments and other private-sector financing to support low-carbon development through insurance, loans, and loan guarantees, as well as by reducing risk—by, for example, allowing initial investment returns to flow directly to investors.

President Obama and the Nordic leaders should also jointly commit to expanding offshore wind energy development by investing in the research and infrastructure needed to improve offshore wind power generation and transmission. The abundance of offshore wind resources in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and along the Atlantic Coast of the United States creates significant opportunity for economic development and shifting the electric power sector away from fossil fuels to zero-emissions energy sources. According to a 2015 Center for American Progress issue brief, U.S. Atlantic Coast states have yet to tap “a secret weapon … at their disposal” for curbing carbon pollution and creating jobs via their vast offshore wind resources. As much as 143 gigawatts of offshore wind resources are available for development in federal offshore areas with relatively low conflict with existing ocean uses. For comparison, the record for electric power consumption across the entire New England electric power grid is 28.13 gigawatts, set in 2006.

Avoid dangerous Arctic warming tipping points

Nowhere on Earth are the consequences of climate change more evident than in the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. This could cause dire outcomes for much of the globe. Arctic warming is speeding up global sea level rise and increasing flood risks for 40 percent of the world’s population living near coasts. In April, scientists were stunned to see signs that the gigantic Greenland ice sheet is melting at least a month earlier than it has during the past three decades.

President Obama and the Nordic leaders can work together to avoid unstoppable Greenland ice sheet melt and other dangerous Arctic “tipping points” by launching an initiative to determine the amount of Arctic permafrost, sea ice, glaciers, and the Greenland ice sheet that must be preserved to avoid crossing dire climate change thresholds. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme—a working group of the Arctic Council—or a newly created body could lead this work, including advising Arctic nations to set national policies and emission reduction goals that will prevent Arctic warming from reaching dangerous tipping points. The U.S. and Nordic nations should also commit to joint investments in early warning systems that use observations and models to predict the health trajectory of the Greenland ice sheet, permafrost, and sea ice extent in the Arctic. Quality early warning systems also would help Arctic nations design policies to avoid catastrophic Arctic and global warming.

President Obama and the Nordic leaders also should announce new initiatives to cut black carbon pollution in the Arctic; black carbon warms the Arctic by trapping heat in the atmosphere and by darkening and melting snow and ice, reducing their ability to reflect the sun’s heat away from the Earth’s surface. In March, for example, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, released a new proposed rule to update its decades-old regulations for offshore air pollution from oil and gas drilling. BOEM has set the stage to require black carbon pollution controls on oil and gas development. In its proposed rule, it requested public comments and data on black carbon emissions from offshore oil and gas operations and options to reduce such emissions. At the U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit, President Obama should announce that BOEM will move to set a new standard that will both improve onshore air quality and limit harmful black carbon pollution in the Arctic. Royal Dutch Shell set aside its U.S. Arctic oil extraction ambitions in October 2015, and Shell, ConocoPhillips, and other companies abandoned all but one oil and gas lease in the Chukchi Sea, as well as some of their claims in the Beaufort Sea. Nonetheless, if the oil market eventually rebounds, these and other companies could refocus on Alaskan offshore oil exploration. While oil prices are low, now is the time for BOEM to get its air quality regulations right to protect public health and prevent new sources of black carbon pollution from any future oil and gas operations in the Arctic. As BOEM finalizes its proposed oil and gas leasing plan for 2017 to 2022, it also should take all new Arctic lease sales off the table, since the United States lacks the infrastructure and capacity to respond sufficiently to an Arctic oil spill.

Nordic countries also should commit to taking new steps to curb black carbon pollution. For example, they could provide more incentives for households to retire old and inefficient wood-burning stoves—a substantial source of black carbon emissions from Nordic nations—and purchase the most efficient replacements.

The U.S. and Nordic countries can also commit to reducing the environmental and climate change risks of Arctic shipping by urging the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, to phase out the use and transport of heavy fuel oil in vessels traveling in the Arctic and invite other Arctic nations to join them in calling for the phaseout. The IMO already prohibits ships from using and carrying HFO in the waters surrounding Antarctica. In February 2015, 15 leaders of nongovernmental organizations urged the United States to lead Arctic Council nations in seeking an HFO phaseout in the region to reduce the risk of catastrophic oil spills and black carbon pollution.

By taking these actions—while also agreeing to smart Arctic Ocean management to protect the health and safety of indigenous people, marine life, and ecosystems—President Obama and the Nordic leaders can make strides toward avoiding catastrophic changes in the Arctic that threaten people and places around the planet.

Reduce climate change-induced migration

A 2015 Norwegian Refugee Council report reveals that since 2008, natural disasters have displaced an average of 26.4 million people per year from their homes around the world. This is equivalent to one person being displaced every second, and this trend is on the upsurge. Many experts believe that the refugee crisis in Europe will only worsen, fueled by climate change-driven food and water scarcity and increasing conflict in Africa and the Middle East.

The U.S. and Nordic leaders must work together to curb the devastating effects of climate change-induced migration and food insecurity. By committing to jointly study and address extreme weather and other climate change-related drivers of migration—including drought, food shortages, sea level rise and flooding—and by firmly embedding climate change security risk management into foreign, defense, and development policies—President Obama and the Nordic leaders will reduce the risk of more conflict, migration, and misery in a warming world.

The three proposed actions above are necessary steps to ensure a safe and healthy planet, today and for future generations. President Obama and the Nordic leaders should commit to take these steps when they meet on May 13 in order to inspire similar actions from other nations and to move a critical step closer to climate protection around the globe.

97,97,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Two men arrested for slaughtering whale shark after outraged netizens call for justice - Shanghaiist,http://shanghaiist.com/2016/05/13/whale_shark_killers_arrested/,"

Police in Beihai have arrested two men for the sad slaughter of a whale shark last week that ignited considerable outrage online.

The pair, surnamed Liao and Huang, will be charged with hunting an endangered animal. According to Sina, after killing the whale shark and hanging it up at an offshore oilfield in the South China Sea, they then proceeded to slaughter the poor creature and sell off its meat for around 5 yuan per kilogram.





The two men defended themselves by telling police that the animal was already “dead and decaying” anyway when they pulled it up. However, this claim appears questionable, considering the fact that only a few days before images went viral on Chinese social media of the slaughtered whale shark, pictures were published showing a healthy whale shark swimming happily in the waters around the oil rig.





After the twin set of pictures went viral, Chinese netizens voiced their disgust and called for harsh punishment for whoever had killed this beautiful, harmless and nationally-protected animal. “I would like to string up whoever did this,” one netizen wrote.

We’ll have to wait and see how that goes. Back in 2014, a Fujian fisherman caught a whale shark. Claiming to not know what it was, he brought the carcass back into town hoping for a big pay day. Unfortunately for him, the local government noticed and told him that it couldn’t be sold off for profit, so they auctioned off the meal at charity prices instead. That’ll show ’em!



When not caught by careless fishermen, whale sharks can live as long as 70 years to 100 years. Based on biologists’ records, the largest whale shark ever discovered was 12.65 meters long and 21.5 tons.

98,98,FL-2016-000044-CHN,Gaping SF sinkhole expected to take 2 days to fix - SFGate,https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Gaping-SF-sinkhole-expected-to-take-2-days-to-fix-7462039.php,"A good-size sinkhole in downtown San Francisco wowed onlookers Wednesday as city crews got to work fixing the gaping crater that opened up during the evening commute the day before.

The 12-foot-by-5-foot pit on Mission Street between New Montgomery and Second streets was caused by a broken and aging sewer line — the third large San Francisco sinkhole to bust open in a little over a year.

Officials said it could take up to two days to fix the hole and get the streets reopened.

“Holy moly — this is insane,” Cupertino resident Ryan Lee said Wednesday while on his way to meet a friend for breakfast in the city. “It’s kind of scary, actually.”

Lee was one of scores of onlookers taking cell phone pictures of the growing spectacle that was first reported around 5 p.m. Tuesday when a sport utility vehicle got partially caught in the 9-foot-deep hole.

No one in the SUV was injured, and the motorist was able to drive away after getting a quick tow out of the pit.

As repairs are being made, 14-Mission buses are being rerouted to Market Street and drivers are being blocked from passing through the short section of street.

“This is one of the oldest pipes in the city,” said Jean Walsh, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. “But the bottom is still intact and the sewer is still flowing.”

The sewer main — 5 feet high and 3 feet wide — is one of the largest in the city and was built out of bricks in 1875. In recent days, some of those old bricks crumbled, and the earth and silt above funneled into the line and washed toward the city’s main treatment plant in the Bayview.

It took one unlucky driver to hit the flimsy asphalt and punch open the cavity.

That’s what happened last month when an even bigger sinkhole opened up in San Francisco’s Pacific Heights neighborhood. That one measured 22 feet by 17 feet and formed when an 18-inch sewer main broke under Sacramento Street between Lyon and Baker streets.

There are roughly 1,000 miles of such sewer pipes crisscrossing under San Francisco, and many of them are more than a century old, Walsh said. The city replaces about 15 miles of pipe a year.

One of the city’s more memorable recent sinkholes opened up in the intersection of Sixth Avenue and Lake Street in the Richmond District during a torrential storm in December 2014. Like the others, that hole was caused by an old, broken pipe, but was accelerated by the massive flow of water surging through the at-capacity main.

Tuesday and Wednesday were dry in San Francisco, so the only stuff moving through the pipe along Mission is what people were flushing, Walsh said.
