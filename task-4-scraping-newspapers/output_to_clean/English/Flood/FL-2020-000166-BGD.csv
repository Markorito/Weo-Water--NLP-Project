A third of Bangladesh is underwater after some of the heaviest rains in a decade, officials said.

Almost four million people have also been hit by monsoon floods in South Asia.

The monsoon – which usually falls from June to September – is crucial to the economy of the Indian sub-continent, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region every year.

“This is going to be the worst flood in a decade,” Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre chief Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan told the AFP news agency.

The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions.

The heavy rains have swollen two main Himalayan river systems – the Brahmaputra and the Ganges – that flow through India and Bangladesh.

Bhuiyan said about a third of flood-prone Bangladesh – a delta-nation crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers – was underwater, and at least 1.5 million people were affected, with village homes and roads flooded.

“The floodwater is constantly rising. Neither we nor our cattle can go out. So, I’m using a boat to go out. We’re having issues regarding food also. The cooking ovens have been flooded. Even our beds are also underwater,” Samsud Doha, farmer, said.

In north-central Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra river was almost 40cm (15.7 inches) higher than normal and threatening to burst its banks, district administrator Farook Ahmed told AFP.

Most villagers were trying to stay near their flood-damaged homes, but some 15,000 had fled severely affected areas, officials said.

Another farmer, Rabiul Islam, said: “Our homesteads have been flooded. We had a little road left which got destroyed last night. So, we’re taking away all our crops like rice and corn and other goods.”

With a 10-day forecast pointing to rising waters, Bhuiyan said if more rivers burst their banks, some 40 percent of the nation could be flooded “in a worst-case scenario”.

In Assam, northeast India, more than 2.1 million people have been affected since mid-May.

At least 50 people have died so far – 12 in the past week as floodwaters surged – with tens of thousands of mostly rural residents evacuated to relief camps, officials said.

“We have two challenges here: one is COVID-19 and another is flood,” the head of a local rescue team, Abhijeet Kumar Verma, told AFP.

In Nepal, at least 50 people have died in landslides and floods triggered by the monsoon rains, with homes swept away and roads and bridges damaged.","Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/01d1780c5c8c4e00b7f167ed78a6c8a4_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C561,"['flooded', 'million', 'rivers', 'underwater', 'rains', 'heavy', 'monsoon', 'affected', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'officials', 'homes', 'told']",

Water levels at major rivers were rising on Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts.

Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over the last 24 hours, said an executive engineer with the Water Development Board.

The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions.

The Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, or FFWC, reports there is no relief in sight for northwest and central Bangladesh. One forecaster at the FFWC told the French news agency, AFP, this could be the worst flooding in a decade.

Extremely heavy rain across the border in upstream India and Bangladesh triggered the second wave of flooding while the first wave has not yet receded.

The U.N.'s Relief Web reports the Bangladesh government allocating food and cash for immediate response in the affected areas with 975 flood shelters opened, and 175 medical teams mobilized.

Heavy monsoon rains are expected throughout the country in coming days that could further worsen the situation.

The monsoon season in the region runs from June through September, swelling Bangladesh's 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India.

Huge onrush of water from the upstream and monsoon rain freshly flooded northern and north-eastern districts of Bangladesh. Earlier, during the last week of June 2020, BDRCS based on the forecast, has activated its Early Action Protocol (EAP) to support 3,800 households in three districts which have more than 25 per cent of household assets damaged. After showing a slight improvement last week, the flood situation has deteriorated again as major rivers in the country are flowing above the danger level. According to the current forecast, this flood has 50 per cent chances to cross 1 in 10 years on 21 July. Thousands of people in low-lying areas are witnessing the second phase of floods this season due to rise of water levels of major rivers in the country.

Flood situation may further worsen in north-eastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj and Netrokona; northern districts of Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Kurigram, and Gaibandha; north-western district of Natore and north central districts of Bogura and Jamalpur by 13 July 2020. Many of these districts were affected when the first monsoon flood hit on 26 June and the situation there improved after several days. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) mentioned in a briefing that the northern Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Nilphamari and Gaibandha, northwestern Natore, Naogaon, Bogura, Sirajganj and Rajshahi, northcentral Jamalpur and Tangail and central Manikganj districts in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna basin, central districts of Rajbari, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Munshiganj and southeastern Chandpur in the Ganges-Padma basin and northeastern Netrokona, Sylhet and Sunamganj and central district of Kishoreganj in the Meghna basin may witness a fresh wave of flood.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) bulletin on 12 July 2020, water levels of all major rivers in upper Meghna basin, Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Gages basins are in rising trend till 12 July morning and it may continue in the next 72 hours due to onrush of upstream water coupled with heavy to very heavy rainfall.

Major rivers in the Meghna basin such as Surma River, Jamuna River and Gur River are all reportedly experiencing rising water levels above their danger marks.

The FFWC is predicting that heavy rainfall is likely to occur in the country’s south-eastern hill regions and it may cause rapid rise of water levels in Sangu, Halda Muhuri and Matamuhuri rivers in that region on 13 July 2020.

Of the 101 river gauging stations, the FFWC observed swelling at 66 points within the 24 hours on 11 July 2020.

The FFWC reported that the precipitation level was at 523 millimeters at Cherapunji during the same time and Assam and Meghalaya and West Bengal also received heavy rain. For Bangladesh, the country’s highest rainfall of 252 millimeters in the 24 hours until 9:00 am local time on 11 July 2020 was recorded at Lourergarh in Sunamganj. Extremely heavy rains were observed at many places at Sylhet, Sunamganj, Netrokona and Mymensingh.

Bangladesh Meteorological Department predicted light to moderate rains in most places in Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chattoram and Sylhet divisions and in many places in Barishal, Dhaka and Khulna divisions until Sunday morning. Indian Meteorological Department predicted extremely heavy rainfall to continue in places upstream through 12 July. According to Water Development Board, a lot of water was flowing from upstream until 12 July night. The water level at Teesta barrage point in Lalmonirhat rose to 55 centimeters above the danger mark while water at Dharla River at Kulaghat point was flowing above the danger level of 60 centimeters. The Water Development Board mentioned that the water is increasing gradually and issued a red alert in the Teesta basin as the flood situation continued to deteriorate.

Over a million people were marooned in dozens of villages from 10 to 11 July 2020 as roaring rivers swept away embankments in the districts where some of the embankments were already under water since 26 June.

Thousands of people are expected to leave their homes throughout the beginning of this week to seek shelter in higher grounds as the Water Development Board warned that the onrush of water from upstream would further intensify.

As low-lying areas in 23 districts are predicted to experience a month-long fresh flooding in the next week with the rise of water levels in major rivers, the Government of Bangladesh is on standby with all-out measures to face the flood situation. The State Minister of MoDMR said in a briefing that the government has taken all-out preparations to protect the lives and livelihoods of people from the approaching flood as the deluge may continue for prolonged period. Directives have been given to ensure preparedness of shelter centers in 23 districts. The Government of Bangladesh has allocated total 8,210 metric tons of rice, BDT 22,250,000 (approximately CHF 242,235) of cash, 48,000 packets of dry foods, BDT 4,800,000 (approximately CHF 52,258) worth of fodders (animal foods) and BDT 4,800,000 (approximately CHF 52,258) worth of child foods to 23 districts from 28 June to 9 July.

Each district will receive 200 metric tons of rice, BDT 500,000 cash (approximately CHF 5,443), BDT 200,000 (approximately CHF 2,177) worth of child food, BDT 200,000 (approximately CHF 2,177) worth of fodder and 2,000 packets of dry foods to ensure timely distribution and local administrations are available to immediately support the affected people. The State Minister of MoDMR said, more allocation will be provided based on the evolving needs of the affected people. The District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) and Bangladesh Water Development Board offices are continuously coordinating and constantly monitoring the flood situation since June to ensure efficient response during monsoon season.","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1526493-IBBDfl130720.png?itok=dFsLQfZi,"['chf', 'situation', 'approximately', 'water', 'rivers', 'districts', 'heavy', 'basin', 'bulletin', 'monsoon', 'bdt', 'flood', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'information']",

A. Situation analysis

Description of the disaster

With the rise of water levels in all major three river basins and the south-eastern hill regions coupled with the heavy to very heavy rainfall in the upstream Indian states and inside Bangladesh, the country is likely to witness a prolonged flood inundating low-lying areas in nearly 25 districts. The country has already witnessed a very heavy rainfall for five to six days this month and it may experience another round of very heavy downpour with a break of a week and it will cause the rise of water levels in the major rivers.

According to the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), this second phase flood this season may continue at a stretch till the end of July and it could prolong in the next month too on the basis of rainfall with water levels of major rivers remaining above danger marks. Bangladesh witnessed the first phase of flood from 26 June to 7 July 2020 affecting around 15 districts due to onrush of upstream water and heavy downpours. Yet, water levels in Brahmaputra and upper Meghna basins started rising again from 9 – 10 July and later in Padma basin causing inundating of low-lying areas in north-eastern districts of Sunamganj, Sylhet and Netrokona and northern districts of Kurigram, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur and Gaibandha, northwest Natore and Noagaon, north-central Bogura, Sirajganj, Jamalpur and Tangail.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) forecast, the current flood has 50 per cent chance to cross the one in 10 years return period by 21 July 2020. Thousands of people in low-lying areas are witnessing the second phase of floods this season due to rise of water levels of major rivers in the country. According to the special flood report dated on 16 July by Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), so far, a total of 2,246,472 people in 18 districts are affected by this fresh flood, it also reported six people have died. Total 1,086 flood shelters are opened in 18 districts and 55,930 people have taken refuge there.

New flooding areas in Nilphamari, Jamalpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Natore, Gaibandha, Bogra, Netrokona, Feni, Habiganj, and Sirajganj were inundated further due to overflow of major rivers on 13 July. As the flood inundated many low-lying areas in northern and north-eastern regions over the past few days, marooned people have set up basic shelter on embankments, roads, highland and flood centres with their domestic animal and valuables.

According to FFWC on 14 July 2020, due to heavy rainfall and upstream water from bordering areas, the water flow Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma river basin have been increasing rapidly and it will continue over the next 72 hours. The Padma was flowing nearly seven centimeters above the danger level at Bhagyakul, Munshiganj and is likely to keep flowing above the danger level over the next week. River water was rising at 78 of the 101 points observed by the warning center the morning.

Fourteen major rivers are flowing above their danger marks (DM) at 22 stations on Monday, according to FFWC. In Kurigram, floodwater inundated vast areas more than one hundred people in nine upazilas of the district have been marooned. Flood water snapped road communication in some areas. Some 438 shelters, including schools and madrasas, have been prepared and police have taken necessary steps to maintain law and order there. Most of the unions of Fulbari, Chilmari and Roumari upazilas remained out of reach by road. In Rangpur, people in three upazilas have been marooned as flash flood hit the area after the water level of Teesta basin rose. All the 653 chars, occupying 42 per cent of Rangpur division, remained stranded. In Sunamganj, people of all the 11 upazilas are in peril as the flash flood hit the region for the second time amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Bogura, water of the Jamuna was flowing 94 centimeters above of the danger level at the Mathurapara point in the Sariakandi Upazila on 14 July. Many families have lost their homesteads in the remote areas of Chaluabari union in Sariakandi Upazila due to the flood.

In Gaibandha’s Sundarganj, three of its eight unions are completely under water, with all their roads damaged and eroded. In Nilphamari, flood situation in the Teesta basin area is still unchanged though water level in the river slightly dropped. Four of the right unions of Dimla Upazila could not be reached without boats. People have been living for around one week under open sky and facing huge crisis of food. Many fish and poultry farms were washed away while seedbeds were damaged by the floods.

In Lalmonirhat district, many people, who had moved to shelters after the flood in June and recently returned to repair their homes, found their houses and properties submerged again. The BWDB had also issued a red alert in the Teesta basin on 13 July. The Roads and Highways Department estimated that 35 km of roads got damaged in the first flood spell which would require BDT 545 million (approx. CHF 5.9 mil) to get repaired.

Earlier, during the last week of June 2020, BDRCS based on the forecast, with the support of IFRC has activated its Early Action Protocol (EAP) worth CHF 234,803 and provided cash grant assistance and evacuation to 3,789 households in three districts of Jamalpur, Kurigram and Gaibandha which had more than 25 per cent of household assets damaged forecasted during the first phase of the floods. The objective of the early action was to reduce the impact of the floods on vulnerable households in selected unions, but as the floods continue to worsen the need was identified to move into a response operation to complement the actions already taken.

The axis of monsoon runs through Rajasthan, Hariyana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal to Assam across central part of Bangladesh. One of its associated troughs extends up to North Bay. The monsoon is active over Bangladesh and moderate over North Bay. This is likely to bring light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind at many places over Rangpur, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Khulna, Barishal and Chattogram divisions and over Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions, which will worsen the floods situations in the country.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many poor people are facing shortages of food, pure drinking water and other essentials and their sufferings have mounted. Flood preparation specialists have discovered that losses of income caused by the COVID-19 pandemic make it harder for vulnerable communities to face the floods in this monsoon season. The flood and landslides from this year’s monsoon season will impact communities more severely because of economic stagnation and COVID-19-related health risks. There are concerns that a lot of people will be pushed further into poverty because of this and if the communities are battered by floods that destroy or damage homes, agricultural land, schools and hospitals, it will only make things worse.","Sat, 18 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/MDRBD026do-001.jpg?itok=A6PzWwbW,"['operation', 'n', 'floods', 'levels', 'plan', 'monsoon', 'level', 'danger', 'areas', 'heavy', 'emergency', 'major', 'flood', 'bangladesh', 'mdrbd025', 'water', 'districts', 'epoa', 'dref']",

Bangladesh State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman said that at least 23 districts were predicted to experience a second wave of floods with the rise of water levels in major rivers due to heavy rains.

He said on Sunday they have rushed teams of disaster response forces to carry out rescue operation, distribute relief materials and supervise centers where flood affected families have taken shelter, reports Xinhua news agency.

According to the Minister, Bangladesh had earlier witnessed a short-term floods between June 26 and July 7.

During this period, ""13,09,150 people were affected due to the floods in 15 districts (out of the country's total 64 districts)"", a daily disaster situation report prepared by the country's National Disaster Response Coordination Centre (NDRCC) revealed on Sunday.

Officials said floods triggered by heavy seasonal rains and onrush of water from hills across the Indian borders have worsened again last week.

Meanwhile, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) executive engineer, said the second wave of floods may sustain for over 15-20 days as water levels of all three major river basins are set to rise this week.

Advertisement According to the country's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), water levels of two major rivers -- Brahmaputra-Jamuna - may cross their danger marks at major points after Sunday and the water levels may reach at their peak on July 17.

Apart from this, it said water levels of the other major Padma river is likely to reach its peak on July 19.

Millions of people in Bangladesh suffer from flooding as the low-lying country experiences seasonal floods almost every year this month.

TV reports showed Sunday that floods have caused widespread damage to habitation, crops, roads and highways across vast swathes of the country.

Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked officials to remain alert to tackle floods which comes amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the worst-affected countries in South Asia, Bangladesh has so far registered 183,795 coronavirus cases, with 2,352 deaths.","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/in-bangladesh_floods.jpg,"['countrys', 'minister', 'predicted', 'levels', 'water', 'districts', 'second', 'experience', '23', 'major', 'wave', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'disaster']",

Bangladesh Meteorological Department predicts heavy rains

The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that half of Bangladesh will be affected by worsening floods in the coming days.

The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Flood Forecast and Warning Center (FFWC) have echoed the concerns voiced in OCHA’s situation report on Asia Pacific humanitarian efforts on July 17. Both BMD and the FFWC predict heavy rains in the next few days.

Some areas of Dhaka, near Badda, have already become flooded. FFWC says the flood waters came through canals and sewerage lines of the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka WASA) that are connected to surrounding rivers.

In some districts, such as Netrokona and Naogaon, people have started leaving shelter centers as the water level of various rivers was decreasing. However, BMD and FFWC warn that more rainfall in the next few days may cause the floods to worsen again.

Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of FFWC, said: “From Monday, the water level will start rising again, which may continue till July 25-26. This rise of water levels will inundate different parts of the country and then start decreasing again. No heavy rainfall is expected after July 25-26.”

BMD Meteorologist Abdul Mannan said: “Rainfall upstream and in northern districts of the country has increased compared to the last three days. The increased rainfall may continue for the next three days.

“Rangpur, Rajshahi , Mymensingh, Sylhet and Chittagong will face heavy rainfall in the next three days,” he added.

Mannan continued: “As the rainfall has been increasing, the rivers will get more water. The water from rainfall in Assam does not flow down Bangladesh’s rivers the same day. Some time is needed for the water to flow down the rivers. As a result, the water level may rise even after it stops raining.”

At 9am yesterday, BMD said in a weather forecast that light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur at most places over Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chattogram & Sylhet divisions, at many places over Rajshahi and Barishal divisions, and at a few places over Dhaka and Khulna divisions.

Six districts still reeling from previous floods

In Tangail, around 150,000 people are still marooned as the Dhaleshwari, and Jhenai Rivers are still flowing above danger level.

The Dhaleshwari River is flowing 152cm above the danger level while the Jhenai River is flowing 90cm above its danger level, according to the Water Development Board (WDB).

In Madaripur, 15,000 residents of char areas in Sibchar upazila are stranded by floodwaters, as the water level of the Jamuna River continues to swell.

Hundreds of houses, roads, schools and colleges have been submerged and people affected by the floods are suffering a shortage of drinking water, food and sanitation facilities.

Shibchar upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Asaduzzaman said the authorities were trying to help flood victims by providing dry food and safe drinking water.

The WDB has been dumping geo-bags to prevent river erosion, he added.

In Jamalpur, although the Jamuna River has been receding over the past couple of days, the overall situation has worsened and at least 900,000 people remain marooned.

The Jamuna was flowing 105cm over the danger line at Bahdurabad Ghat point in Jamalpur at 6pm on Saturday, declining 24cm from the day before, according to Md Abu Sayeed, executive engineer of WDB.

People of at least 50 villages in Dewangonj, Islampur, Bokshiganj and Jamalpur Sadar have fallen victim to flooding.

In Naogaon, 4194 hectares of cropland went underwater as flood protection embankments collapsed due to the strong currents of the Atarai and Jumuna Rivers, said the Agricultural Extension Department (DAE).

Movement of heavy vehicles through Atrai-Naogaon, Atrai-Bandhaikhara, Atrai-Kaliganj, and Atrai-Singra has been suspended temporarily by the authorities.

In Kurigram, river erosion coupled with incessant rainfall has millions of people in the district suffering.

Many villagers have already left their homes and are living in temporary shelters or wrapped in polythene on government roads, dykes and in other safe places with their livestock and essentials.

Kurigram Water Development (WDB) Executive Engineer Md Ariful Islam said the floods may worsen further in the next three or four days.

In Pabna, the Jamuna River rose at various points while shortages of food and drinking water hit thousands of people hard.

The District WDB is working on tackling river erosion, as many houses on the river banks have been devoured by the floods.

Ministry of Disaster management : No crisis of relief and humanitarian aid

The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief did not open any shelters in Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Tangail and Rajbari, although all these districts have been affected by the floods.

Shah Muhammad Nasim, additional secretary (NDRCC and media), Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said: “In some districts, the flooding is not severe and people in those districts do not want to go to shelters as they have cattle and other valuables at their homes. The government will arrange shelters, if needed.

“There is no lack of effort on the part of the ministry in terms of relief and other help for people affected (by the floods),” he added.

Bangladesh is going through a tough situation as it has witnessed a short-term flood amidst the coronavirus pandemic, says the state minister

As low-lying areas in 23 districts are predicted to experience a month-long fresh flooding in the next week with the rise of water levels in major rivers due to onrush of upstream waters coupled with heavy to very heavy downpours, the government remains ready with all-out measures to face the flood situation.

“Over 12 districts witnessed a flood from June 24 to July 7. As per flood forecast, water levels may again rise in all major rivers from July 12 to cause a month-long flood in around 23 districts,” State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman told BSS on Saturday.

He said the northern Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Nilphamari and Gaibandha, northwestern Natore, Naogaon, Bogra, Sirajganj and Rajshahi, northcentral Jamalpur and Tangail and central Manikganj districts in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna basin, central districts of Rajbari, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Munshiganj and southeastern Chandpur in the Ganges-Padma basin and northeastern Netrokona, Sylhet and Sunamganj and central district of Kishoreganj in the Meghna basin may witness the fresh wave of flood.

The state minister said the government has taken all-out preparations to protect the lives and livelihoods of people from the approaching flood as the deluge may continue for a prolonged period. Required directives have been given to keep shelter centers readied in the 23 districts, he added.

Talking to BSS, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Executive Engineer Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said the approaching flood may sustain for more than 15-20 days till last week of this month in some areas as water levels of all three major river basins are likely to rise in this week.

Asked whether the flood situation of this year could be similar that of 1988 or 1998, he said it is difficult to comment on that right now and it will be easier to predict few days later after evaluating the rise of water levels but the flood this year may not sustain for long time at a stretch like the years when the country witnessed severe spikes of flooding.

Sarder Udoy Raihan, sub-divisional engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC), told BSS on Thursday that water levels of major rivers in Brahmaputra-Jamuna basins may cross their danger marks (DMs) at major points after July 12 and the water levels may reach at its peak on July 17 while water levels of the Padma basin rivers is likely to reach its peak on July 19.

He said people living in low-lying areas in Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Natore, Nilphamari, Jamalpur and Rangpur districts in the northern and northwestern region and Sylhet, Sunamganj and Netrokona districts in northeastern region may face fresh spikes of medium range floods in next 72 hours.

Mentioning the prime minister’s constant supervision, State Minister Dr Enamur said total 8,210 metric tons of rice, Tk2 crore 22 lakh 50 thousand cash money, 48,000 packets of dry foods, Tk48 lakh for fodders (animal foods) and Tk48 lakh for child foods have already been allocated to 23 districts from June 28 to July 9 last.

Each district gets 200 metric tons of rice, Tk5 lakh cash, Tk2 lakh for child food, Tk2 lakh for fodder (animal food) and 2000 packets of dry foods so that local administrations can stand beside the victims by reaching the relief goods in due time, he added.

He said more allocation will be provided on the basis of requirements as the government has all-out preparedness with sufficient relief goods and other necessaries to face the calamity.

The state minister said Bangladesh is going through a tough situation as it has witnessed a short-term flood between June 26 and July 7 amidst the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The flood situation became normal in 12 districts from July 7, he added.

He said directives have been given to keep readied maximum number of shelter centers in the flood-prone districts and to maintain social distancing and health guidelines, using face masks by those who will take refuge in the flood shelter centers amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

School and college buildings and establishments will be made flood shelter centers and the concerned local administrations have been asked to send information about the number of shelter centers and people who take refuge, he added.

The state minister called upon the people of the flood-prone areas not to worry as the government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina remains beside them in their weal and woes.

“There is no crisis of food as sufficient foods have been kept preserved. We have capability to face any disaster. Insha Allah, we will be able to tackle the situation; it won’t be problematic how big the flood is,” he said.

In line with the Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD), all concerned ministries, divisions and others generally face the flood situation as it is an annual deluge and they have the efficiency to tackle the situation, he said.

Dr Enamur said concerned deputy commissioners and District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) and BWDB offices have been constantly monitoring the flood situation since June and holding meetings, follow ups to gear up preparedness to face it during monsoon.

The state minister said medical teams led by civil surgeons will work in flood-prone areas and shelter centers to ensure healthcare while public health engineering offices will provide drinking water and mobile sanitary toilets, public security division will ensure safety of the people and all stakeholders will work in unison to cope with the situation.

The disaster management ministry has provided 500 pieces of tents each with a capacity of facilitating 20 people to every flood-prone district and directives have been given to provide the tent services if any shelter center crisis prevails as volunteers will also work, public representatives and party [Awami League] leaders will extend cooperation to this end.

Besides, the ministry issued cautionary alerts to the people to refrain from having joyous boat rides during the flood and keeping children at safe distance from flood waters as incidents of boat capsize and drowning of children take place every year during that period.

Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem also echoed with Dr Enamur saying the government remains ready to stand by the people in the flood-prone areas with sufficient relief goods and other necessaries.

He said his ministry has kept monitoring the flood situation round the clock to step in immediately if any flood protection embankment gets damaged or destroyed anywhere in the country.

Talking to BSS, Water Resources Senior Secretary Kabir Bin Anwar said his ministry and other concerned ministries including disaster management ministry have been making their all-out strides to stand beside the people during the flood.

He said the government has all-out preparations with sufficient relief goods and shelter center facilities and embankment repairing equipment including geobags.","Sat, 11 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/335508/1594481913275flood-1594363895550.jpg,"['state', 'govt', 'minister', 'situation', 'face', 'levels', 'water', 'districts', 'flood', 'shelter', 'lakh', 'allout', 'prepared', 'measures']",

People at risk of being marooned by floods amidst the pandemic require immediate attention

This year, flood-vulnerable communities have started facing multi-dimensional risks during the monsoon season. They’re already suffering socio-economic impacts from Covid-19, like loss of income and inability to shop for and access essential items. The impacts of floods on livelihoods will further accelerate such vulnerabilities and surely push numerous families into poverty.

The Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS) has issued a flood forecast with an over 50% probability of a severe 1-in-10-year flood submerging some areas of Bangladesh for a minimum of three days. Torrential rains in Bangladesh and therefore the upstream basins are causing rivers to overflow. According to disaster management authorities, over 1 million people across 13 districts have been suffering from flooding in Bangladesh since late June.

Multi-faceted danger

Flooding and cyclone season has begun in Bangladesh. At the end of May, Amphan swept through the country, killing 26. Over 2.4 million people were evacuated to permanent and temporary shelters before the cyclone hit, and over 200,000 houses were fully or partially damaged. Yet, the monsoon rains will prevail for at least a month. This year, flooding will magnify the socio-economic and health impacts of Covid-19.

The rapid increase of cases is already straining the limited health resources of the country. Bangladesh ranks 113th within the Global Health Index and has only 8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. Crowded living conditions in densely populated areas pose a high risk for transmission.

Two major sources of income for the economy, export of ready-made garments and remittance inflow, are projected to significantly decline. The national lockdown has also disrupted domestic economic activities in a country where 85 % of the workforce is employed within the informal sector, and one in three survive off of daily wages.

Increased unemployment and income loss caused by the coronavirus will make it harder for vulnerable communities in Bangladesh to prepare for floods and landslides this monsoon season. A new research has found that 72% of the population surveyed in Bangladesh were unemployed because of movement restrictions and workplace closures. The report, commissioned by the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance, and titled “Monsoon, floods and Covid-19: Building community resilience in Bangladesh” surveyed 15 Union Disaster Management Committees (UMDC) across three districts, home to 380,000 people.

All the surveyed UDMCs reported challenges in access to basic needs such as food, in a population where one in every three lives is in poverty, and half of the population is identified as being food insecure. UDMCs also observe competition to access essential services, with political affiliations influencing access in some cases.

Daily wage workers, such as rickshaw and transport drivers, masons, garment workers, small scale traders, and farmers have been especially impacted. These groups accounted for nearly half of the surveyed population. The report warns that floods and landslides from this year’s monsoon season will impact communities more severely because of economic stagnation and Covid-19 health risks.

Nearly 90% of the surveyed UDMCs perceive that individuals don’t seem to be aware of proper hygiene and sanitation practices to forestall Covid-19 transmission, including during flood events, although awareness activities are being conducted. Dissemination of information through leaflets and microphone announcements is critical for flood-vulnerable areas which lack electricity and internet connection. User-friendly messaging that guides the risks and specific prevention steps is critical for all people to practice necessary action.

All UDMCs have designated or pre-identified evacuation sites for flooding and landslides in coordination with the local government. These sites vary from schools, mosques, and embankments. This year, evacuation during flooding will be a major challenge as thousands of flood-hit people will gather in shelters with very limited space, and physical distancing won’t be possible.

Distancing in boats to reach the sites, as well as distancing in the embankments themselves, is a major challenge. Maintaining good hygiene is also difficult as none of the evacuation sites have handwashing facilities. UDMCs note their role in adapting the sites to consider Covid-19 but they need specific guidance on a way to do so.

A lack of guidance and support

Although UDMCs are tasked with considering Covid-19 in disaster management planning, only 13% have started to do so due to lack of specific guidance and knowledge. Members lack information on how to identify possible cases, refer such individuals to necessary health care services, and take preventive actions to mitigate transmission risk. UDMCs expressed discomfort and worry in taking the initiative of Covid-19 response during a disaster context due to lack of appropriate knowledge and protective equipment.

Lack of access to clean water and items for sanitation and hygiene, such as hand soap, is also apparent at the household level. 40% of UDMCs report lack of access to hand soap due to income loss, price increases by 10-15%, and limited supply due to supply chain disruptions and market closures. The monsoon rains and floods result in increased risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases.

UDMCs note limitations to accessing health care facilities during floods and landslides. Health services such as vaccination programs have already been halted due to Covid-19. Vulnerable groups, such as people with chronic illnesses, may face further difficulties in addressing medical concerns during the monsoon season.

Coordination with local governments and health facilities is critical for communities to seek advice on how to enable access to health services. All surveyed unions do not have quarantine facilities, and isolation at home is the only available option. UDMCs expressed concern over community transmission without such facilities.

All these exhortations come as Bangladesh braces itself for extremely heavy rain, amid fears that the rising trend in water levels of major rivers might continue.

Flooding hit several northern districts in late June after heavy rain in the country and river catchments in India. Jamalpur, Kurigram, and Gaibandha districts were the worst affected, with some flash flooding also reported in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts.

Since then, flooding has been reported in several other districts. In line with a report by Network for Information, Response And Preparedness Activities on Disaster (NIRAPAD), a total of 1,012,775 people have been affected and 221,158 households marooned. The affected districts include Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Rangpur, Sunamganj, Sirajganj, Bogura, Jamalpur, Sylhet, Tangail, Rajbari, and Madaripur.

The first wave between June 26-July 7 inundated 12 districts. According to the forecast, the country will witness a second wave of floods from July 11, which will submerge 23 districts of the country. Districts expected to witness flooding are Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Nilphamari, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Bogra, Sirajganj, Jamalpur, Tangail, Rajbari, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Chandpur, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Manikganj, Rajshahi, Natore, and Naogaon.

The flood situation may again worsen in the two northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, with a break of just several days when the region witnessed short-term flood since last week of June, as the water levels of all major rivers in the upper Meghna basin started rising again because of the onrush of upstream water, together with heavy rainfall.

“Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre has alerted that the people of low-lying areas in 23 districts are going to witness fresh floods in the coming weeks as water levels of the rivers Brahmaputra-Jamuna, the Padma, and the Meghna are likely to rise from July 11,” stated Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman during an online press conference on July 9 after an inter-ministerial meeting on the flood.

In Bangladesh, UDMCs function as the local governance structure for disaster management, mandated by the standing order on disasters (SOD). Following the outbreak of Covid-19, the prime minister designated UDMCs to coordinate with deputy commissioners and upazila nirbahi officers, and conduct activities such as food distribution for vulnerable groups along with public hygiene and sanitation promotion initiatives at the community levels.

Over the last decades, UDMCs have played a vital role in helping to mitigate risks, especially during flooding. But unfortunately, 75% of UDMCs report they are not fully functional, mainly due to a lack of resources in personnel and budget. Many UDMC members also serve as members on other committees and do not have the time and resources to completely conduct the mandated activities for disaster management planning.

Although a majority of the UDMCs have supported Covid-19 awareness-raising campaigns led by the union parishads so far, UDMCs will need to work closely with local governments and related committees to be able to respond to both Covid-19 and disasters caused by the monsoon rains.

Without urgent action by the government and donors, the impact of monsoon hazards will compound the risks of Covid-19, and increase the possibilities of transmission in already highly vulnerable populations. Floods and their resulting impacts, like loss of housing, inundation of agricultural lands, damage to critical infrastructure including health facilities, congregated sheltering, and exposure to contaminated water, can further exacerbate the socio-economic and health conditions of communities already under considerable strain.

National governments and donors should provide existing information, education, and communication (IEC) materials on Covid-19 awareness and prevention to UDMCs to ensure that all people, especially vulnerable populations, have timely access to user-friendly communication materials, and understand the necessary steps for prevention.

Moreover, UDMCs urgently need support from upazila/district/national level disaster management committees to consider Covid-19 in their disaster management plans. Support and guidance is especially necessary on how to prevent crowding in transportation for evacuation and at evacuation sites, how to adapt evacuation sites to consider Covid-19, how to ensure proper hygiene and sanitation practices for transmission prevention in evacuation sites, and how to identify and provide health care to people with suspected Covid-19 symptoms during flooding.

Concern Worldwide, Mercy Corps, and Practical Action, members of the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance in Bangladesh, assessed 15 UDMCs across three districts to assess the state of flood-vulnerable populations during the pandemic and provided recommendations for governments, donors, and communities to brace for the compounded risks of Covid-19 during the monsoon season.

Specifically, the government and donors must better prepare communities for the compounded risks of Covid-19 and also the monsoon season through activities such as building additional evacuation centres, informing communities about the way to prevent Covid transmission, and providing essential items like hand soap, water, and hygiene kits in evacuation sites.

They should strengthen the capacity of UDMCs, including personnel and funding support, and provide detailed guidance on how to consider Covid-19 in disaster management planning. Providing support to the most vulnerable populations and planning for livelihood programs that integrate disaster and climate resilience to strengthen communities’ abilities to withstand additional shocks and stresses must be in their priority list.

The Covid-19 crisis highlights the importance of existing governance structures, especially at the community levels, to prepare and respond in an emergency. Coordination mechanisms, networks, and operating procedures need to be prepared before a crisis to be effective.

The national/sub-national governments need to further support UDMCs so that they are properly staffed, budgeted, and functional to be able to respond to disasters and additional shocks like Covid-19. Surge support for UDMCs should be considered, especially for the monsoon season.

The flood situation may deteriorate further in the coming week

Flooding in different parts of the country will remain throughout July due to the increase in water-levels and another wave of rain is forecast in the coming week.

The Padma, Jamuna, Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers may continue to rise in the next several days, making the country’s overall flood situation worse.

According to the Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC), flooding in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Dinajpur, Bogra, Jamalpur, Sirajganj, Tangail, Natore, Naogaon, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Rajbari and Dhaka will worsen in the next 24 hours.

On the other hand, the flood situation may improve in Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Netrokona and Rangpur due to receding water levels of the Teesta and Dharla rivers and other rivers of the upper Meghna basin.

FFWC Executive Engineer Arifuzzaman Bhuyan said: “Flood conditions in Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Netrokona and Rangpur are improving because the rainfall in these places is decreasing.”

“Water levels of the Padma, Jamuna, Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers will continue to rise in the next four to five days due to a possible rise in rainfall.

After that, the water level of all major rivers will start decreasing but there is a possibility of another bout of rainfall next week which may cause the flood situation to deteriorate once again,” he said.

“Our unofficial prediction shows that the flood situation may exist until the end of July. If there is more rain next week, it may be longer than we predicted,” Arifuzzaman added.

According to the FFWC flood forecast till 9am on Tuesday, water levels of the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Ganges, Padma rivers were on a rising trend and this may continue for the next 72 hours. The Jamuna may cross the danger level in the next 24 hours at Aricha Ghat point.

On the other hand, the water levels of the Teesta and Dharla are on a downward trend. Water levels of all the rivers of the upper Meghna basin in the northeast, except the Kushiara, are also on the decline. This trend may continue for 48 hours to come.

Of the 101 water level monitoring stations of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), across Bangladesh, 64 stations observed an increase in water levels, while 34 saw a decrease. The water level remained unchanged at three stations.

Water levels at 23 points in rivers across the country are currently flowing above the danger mark, including on the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Dharla, Surma, Teesta, Gur, Ghagot, Atrai, Dhaleshwari and Someshwari rivers.

The Padma river is flowing above the danger level at Goalanda and Bhagyakul point, increasing the risk of flooding in Rajbari and Munshiganj districts.

20,000 people take shelter at 1,035 centres

State minister for the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, Dr Enamur Rahman, said: “About 20,000 people took shelter in 1,035 shelter centers in 12 flood affected districts.”

“Deputy Commissioners (DC) of each affected district have received Tk500,000 from the ministry to provide cooked food in shelters. In all, 17 districts have been inundated by the floods, which have affected 1,457,827 people. 294,274 families are marooned in the floodwaters,” he said during a press briefing.

“About 8,210MT of rice, over Tk2.82 crore, 74,000 packets of dry food, Tk48 lakh for cattle food and another Tk48 lakh for baby food have been given so far. 300 bundles of tin and Tk9 lakh have bee given to repair damaged houses,” the state minister said.

“The second wave of rise in water level will continue till July 17 which may stay one or two weeks. 23 districts will be affected by the floods,” he added.

“Water coming from China, Nepal and some Indian states are causing floods in the country,” he added.

The state minister said the government is with the people and together will overcome the situation.

Weather forecast

Due to the monsoons, there will be rain in many places over Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) forecast moderately heavy to heavy rainfall in the next 24 hours.

According to BMD, the axis of the monsoon trough runs through Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal to Assam across central parts of Bangladesh. One of its associated troughs extends up to the North Bay. Monsoon is fairly active over Bangladesh, and moderate over North Bay.

The weather forecast also said light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur at many places over Rangpur, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong divisions and at a few places over Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions, with moderately heavy to heavy rainfall in various places across the country.

Adverse impact of the floods

Erosion has again started causing more damage to several areas in Sirajganj, Dinajpur, and Pabna as the flood conditions deteriorate.

However, the flood situation showed significant improvement alongside the Teesta in Nilphamari during the same period, with deterioration in three upazilas of Rangpur and adjoining Lalmonirhat districts.

In Jamalpur, the Jamuna has been flowing 99cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad point, confirmed Executive Engineer Md Abu Sayeed of the district's WDB office.

Incessant rain and hill waters have triggered floods that left around 300,000 people in 30 unions and four municipalities, marooned.

Floodwaters began to recede after the first phase of the flood when it had marooned around 400,000 people in 49 unions and eight municipalities in Jamalpur.

However, the flood situation has again intensified in the past few days.

In Kurigram, around 200,000 people were marooned and fresh char and low lying areas in the basin of four main rivers in the district were flooded.

Dharla has been flowing 100cm above the danger mark at Bridge Point until 6am Tuesday. The Brahmaputra and Teesta were flowing 85cm and 13cm, respectively, above the danger mark at two different points.

According to the district's relief and rehabilitation officer (DRRO), people of 56 unions in Rajarhat, Chilmari, Rowmari, Nageshwari and some other upazilas were marooned.

The district's Deputy Commissioner Md Rezaul Karim said: ""Measures are being taken to distribute rice, drinking water, baby food, dried food, and fodder, among locals.""

In Gaibandha, the Brahmaputra crossed its danger mark on Monday night inundating the river basin areas including the chars.

The Teesta and the Ghagot were also flowing just below their respective danger marks on Tuesday morning, reports BSS, quoting Executive Engineer Mokhlasur Rahman of BWDB.

The water levels in the Brahmaputra rose by 17cm, the Ghagot 11cm, and the Karatoa 15cm.

With the rise of water levels in the Brahmaputra river, the river basin areas of Sundarganj, Sadar, Fulchhari and Saghata upazilas were flooded.

Gaibandha DRRO Mokhlesur Rahman said 87,776 people of 21,974 families were marooned till date in 26 unions of the district's four upazilas.

“The district administration has allocated 100 tons of rice, Tk4 lakh and 1,800 packets of dry foods being distributed among flood affected people,” he said.

In Sirajganj, the Jamuna was flowing 39cm and 69cm above the danger mark at the Sirajganj and Kazipur upazila points respectively, on Tuesday morning.

The rising waters have rise triggered sporadic erosion of riverbanks in Khudbandi and Singrabari unions of Kazipur upazila, and Koizuri union of Shahjadpur upazila, said Engineer AKM Rafiqul Islam of Sirajganj WDB.

In Dinajpur, Sadar, Birol, and Kaharol upazilas sustained the most damage due to the erosion of the Punarbhaba riverbank. The WDB estimates that the locality could be hit by floods soon.

The Punarbhaba and Ichhamati were flowing about a centimetre below the danger mark at two different points, and the Atrai River was flowing 38cm above the danger mark.

In Pabna, the Jamuna was flowing 0.16cm below the danger mark in Mathura Point while the Padma was flowing 1.66cm below the danger mark at Hardinge Bridge point in Pakshi, according to Abdul Hamid, executive engineer of the district WDB.

Locals in these riverbank areas are living in fear as erosion has already claimed their farmland and homes during the first phase of floods this season.

Relief from the ministry

The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief allotted TK2 lakh for cattle fodder and the same amount for baby food to each district so far, along with 2,000 packets of dry food for each affected district. On Tuesday the ministry allocated Tk5 lakh for each of 12 affected districts.

NEW DELHI -- Floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have killed at least 213 people across South Asia over the past month, officials said Thursday.

More than 1 million people have been marooned in Nepal, Bangladesh and India and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes for higher ground.

Indian officials said floods and mudslides killed 16 more people in the country's northeast, raising the death toll in the country to 93. Nepal reported at least 117 deaths over the past month and Bangladesh reported three.

Rains caused the Brahmaputra River, which flows through Tibet, India and Bangladesh, to burst its banks in India's Assam state late last month, inundating large swathes of the state, triggering mudslides and displacing about 3.6 million people, officials said. Vast tracts are still underwater, with 26 of the state’s 33 districts badly affected.

Authorities rescued about 4,000 people trapped by the surging flood waters in various parts of Assam, said M.S. Mannivanan, chief of the state Disaster Management Authority. About 36,000 people whose homes were destroyed or submerged have taken shelter in nearly 300 government-run relief camps, he said.

The floods also inundated most of India’s Kaziranga National Park, home to an estimated 2,500 rare one-horned rhinos, authorities said.

In the eastern state of Bihar, at least nine rivers swollen by heavy downpours in Nepal rose beyond their danger levels and inundated many villages. One of them, the Gandak River, swept away the connecting roads of a newly built multimillion dollar bridge in Bihar’s Gopalganj district, disrupting transportation in the area.

The Meteorological Center in the state capital, Patna, forecast heavy rain over the next 48 hours.

Nepal’s Home Ministry said 117 people have died in the Himalayan nation in monsoon-related incidents. It said the rains triggered landslides in mountainous areas and flooding in the southern plains. At least 47 people were reported missing and 126 have been injured in the past month, it said.

In Bangladesh, the Ministry of Disaster and Relief said at least three people have died and more than 1 million people have been marooned since floods hit the country late last month. Officials said heavy rainfall and the onrush of river waters from upstream India were creating havoc in Bangladesh, a delta nation of 160 million people that is crisscrossed by 230 rivers.

Bangladesh's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Thursday that flooding could worsen at the beginning of next week because of growing devastation in the vast region along the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers. It said the situation would remain unstable over the next two weeks, causing further suffering for affected people.

Annual monsoon rains hit the region in June-September. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season but often cause extensive damage.

The Teesta crossed the danger level (52.6cm) and was flowing 28cm above it at Dalia points in Nilphamari at 6pm Friday, confirmed Bangladesh Water Development Board Guage Reader Nurul Islam

Water levels of all major rivers started rising again following onrush of huge amounts of water amid heavy monsoon rains from the upper catchment in India in the Brahmaputra basin during the last 24 hours till 9am Friday.

The Teesta crossed the danger level (52.6cm) and was flowing 28cm above it at Dalia points in Nilphamari at 6pm Friday, confirmed Bangladesh Water Development Board Guage Reader Nurul Islam.

He said that this is the fourth phase of flooding there.

Almost 10,000 are fearing inundation as they expect their villages and unions to go under water.

Officials of BWDB said water levels of major rivers might continue rising during the next 72 hours.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), heavy rains might continue in northern Bangladesh and adjoining northeastern Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Bihar, and West Bengal during the next 72 hours.

Besides, 103mm rainfall was recorded at Chilmari in Kurigram, 58mm at Kawnia in Rangpur and 53mm at Gaibandha monitoring points of BWDB during the same period.

Due to huge onrush of water from the upstream, water levels of the Dharla rose by 18cm at Kurigram (24cm below danger level), Brahmaputra by 15cm at Noonkhawa point (43cm below danger) and 10cm at Chilmari (31cm below danger) respectively, in the last 24 hours.

Besides, water levels of the Jamuna river rose by 11cm at Fulchhari point (only 11cm below danger level) in Gaibandha, 6cm at Bahadurabad (21cm below danger) in Jamalpur, 4cm at Sariakandi (27cm below danger) in in Gaibandha, 2cm at Kazipur (35cm below danger) and 4cm at Sirajganj points (39cm below danger) in Sirajganj during the period.

Meghna River eroding houses, croplands, schools

In Barisal, Meghna River is causing erosion in Hizla upazila of Barisal in recent days and washed away many establishments including educational institutions, houses, croplands, and parts of upazila administrative complex.

Water Development Board sources said Meghna River is flowing 7cm above danger level at Chandpur point of Hizla engulfing different areas of six unions.

Local people said they do not want relief, but only steps to construct embankments to prevent erosion for saving the upazila.

“Since the beginning of the rainy season, the erosion has turned serious. The affected area is now under severe threat,” a local resident, Abdur Rashid Munshi, said.

Fresh floods inundate Sunamganj

Already flooded this year, people in the lowlands and haor areas of Sunamganj are seeing fresh flooding again due to heavy rainfall and water from upstream.

The Surma river was flowing 17cm above the danger mark at Shologhar point, and the Jadukata River was flowing 23cm above the danger mark in Bishwamvarpur upazila at 9am Friday.

The district water development board recorded 183mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours.

300-year-old school on the verge of being devoured by Chhoto Jamuna

In Naogaon, locals are demanding the conservation of a 300-year-old primary school. Erosion by the Chhoto Jamuna River has slowly been advancing on the school building and may soon devour it whole.

The Atgram Primary School was founded in 1757 by a landlord of those times, which was later made a government school after the country became independent.

Around 200 children of five villages are currently students of the school located in Atgram village of Naogaon's Atrai upazila. The school has six rooms in two single floor buildings.

On a visit to the school, Dhaka Tribune found that boats are the only means of reaching the school during the monsoon. The Chhoto Jamuna flows on the east side of Atrai village while the Atrai River flows on the southern side. Then there is a large beel (large waterbody) on the west side of the village.

At this time almost every year, South Asia grapples with rainfall and consequent floods over large parts of Eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh. This year is particularly challenging as a pandemic is also underway. Their unique geography, of fertile plains well-drained by river channels in the middle and lower stretches of the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) system, turns into a curse with the onset of the monsoons. Then again, the same periodic movement of moisture-laden winds has contributed to the region’s prosperity for centuries.

What then has changed over the years to transform these life-giving rains into a wrath that needs to be ‘dealt with’?

A regional phenomenon

The GBM Basin is a major transboundary river basin over 1.7 million sq. km of land, distributed among five countries: India (64%), China (18%), Nepal (9%), Bangladesh (7%) and Bhutan (3%). The river systems are located in the monsoon belt, so the rivers’ flow regimes are heavily influenced by the South Asian monsoons. About 84% of the rainfall occurs from June to September, and 80% of the annual river flow takes place in the four months from July to October.

Distribution of annual rainfall is also non-uniform, ranging from less than 500 mm in Tibet and below 1,000 mm in parts of the western and south-western fringes of the Ganga basin to 4000 mm in the northern extent of the Meghna basin. As a result, the basin has had a flood-drought syndrome: the rivers flood during the monsoons but for the rest of the year, parts of the basin are dry, and the people there depend on groundwater.

The Government of India has often used this as a reason to pitch for and build large water storage and diversion projects, in ostensible attempts to even out the availability of water.

Flood-tolerance to flood-resistance

Indeed, historically, the institutional response to the uneven rainfall distribution has been to construct large infrastructure to store and divert water available during the monsoons. The floodplains have always favoured settled agriculture because of the level topography and the availability of fine-grained, nutrient-rich and moist overbank deposits. Subsequently, with the advent of the means and tools to control inundation, transport water and practice modern agriculture, the floodplains in this part of the world have become sites of dense human settlements and intensive agriculture.

In 2001, Dinesh Kumar Mishra penned an elaborate account of people living in harmony with floods in the flood-affected regions of India and Bangladesh, using the floodwaters in the best possible way while ensuring the least damage. Flood-tolerance as a design principle was everywhere. However, colonial imperatives required altering the floodplains in the subcontinent at a scale and magnitude like never before.

A 2008 study observed that the colonial dispensation had embarked on building embankments as they served two purposes: to save standing crops, which are not flood-resistant, and second, to expand agriculture to hitherto uncultivated areas. The British cultivated a conviction that continues to this day that embankments were crucial to maximise profits and reduce flooding losses.

As a result, small irrigation works like bandh and pyne were replaced by larger projects involving networks of canals. Together with an explosion in the length of railways and roads, they obstructed the free flow of rivers.

A paradigm change

This paradigm of reductionist ‘flood-control’ continued in the postcolonial period. Large-scale water interventions in the form of extensive embankments, high dams and water diversion projects became the dominant institutional response to prevent floods. But the haphazard and unscientific construction of embankments also meant that the silt that would get distributed within adjacent plains during floods now began accumulating in the river channel. As a result, the river bed became raised over time.

The government also commissioned several multipurpose projects to control floods while meeting the demands for energy generation and irrigation water-supply. Simultaneously, from the late 1950s, the inevitability of flooding despite the adoption of the best flood-control strategies started to feature in India’s policy circles.

In 1980, the National Flood Commission signalled a paradigm change in mitigating damage caused by floods with a mix of structural and non-structural measures. Since then, a new phase in flood governance has firmly assumed the centerstage – one that seeks to reduce the risk of floods while building the resilience of communities living in India’s flood-prone areas.

This paradigm change has resulted in a breakaway from the older approach, and the adoption of multi-pronged strategies to govern floods in the GBM basin. However, the losses incurred due to floods and the risks posed by extreme rainfall (table 1 and figure 2) have remained significant challenges. This is primarily because, by the 1980s, the floodplains had undergone large-scale changes, including hosting a greater density of humans.

Need for greater regional cooperation

Although the monsoonal rains are a regional – and not national – phenomenon and the floodwaters are not confined to national boundaries, the approach to flood governance has largely been confined to territorial jurisdictions. While data-sharing agreements do exist between nations to facilitate early warning systems, an institutional arrangement with a long-term vision and the overarching mandate of integrated river basin governance is missing. Such an institutional arrangement could help manage the rivers’ flows – both when they’re lean and in spate.

For far too long South Asia has had to live with the impression that the rivers’ high flows pose a risk that needs to be ‘contained’ – diverging from the idea of flood-tolerance intrinsic to this region. The subcontinent’s rivers are most active during the summer monsoons, when they carry out a host of geomorphic functions including the erosion, transportation and deposition of sediments. Therefore, large-scale modifications of the floodplains by building dams and embankments and diverting flows could further impede these functions, and overall affecting river-floodplain connectivity.

Experts know today that when floodwaters of the large rivers, including the GBM system, are caught behind dams during peak flood discharge, a large amount of sediment is trapped as well. According to one 2018 study, the sediment load in the combined flow of the Ganga and Brahmaputra is decreasing at a rate of 4-10 million tonnes a year. From a previous estimate of mean annual sediment load of 1-2.4 billion tonnes per year, the sediment load in the GBM system had fallen by 2015 to 500 million tonnes per year.

As of today, this is still sufficient to offset the combined effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise. But unsustainable practices upstream and midstream of the river system could soon push the balance past a point of no return.

All these facts together only reinforce the case for a strong collaboration between South Asia’s riparian nations, especially with climate change in the picture. Regional cooperation with a holistic vision may be the only way to resolve any disputes that may arise in the future, from the novel water, energy, biodiversity and sediments (a.k.a. WEBS) perspective on river governance.

District flood situation

In Tangail, water of all rivers is increasing, as heavy flow upstream from the district continues.

The Jamuna river was flowing 88 cm above the danger mark on Thursday. On Friday, the river rose by another 11 cm, said sources in the Water Development Board (WDB).

Water in the tributaries of the Jamuna, Dhaleswari and Jhenai rivers also increased, flooding fresh areas, especially the chars.

The district's WDB Executive Engineer Sirajul Islam said, based on their forecast, after decreasing for a couple of days, floodwaters may start to rise again from July 21 and may peak between July 25 and July 26.

Sirajul said leakages have appeared at 26 places of the Bhuapur-Tarakandi road, which is also an embankment along the Jamuna, due to pressure from floodwater.

If the embankment collapses, four more upazilas of Tangail will be flooded.

Currently, about 1.3 lakh people in 151 villages in six upazilas of the district have been affected by the flood.

In Munshiganj, the Padma river was flowing 68 cm above the danger mark, yesterday.

Some 13 shelters have been prepared at Srinagar, Louhajang and Tongibari upazila.

However, locals expressed reluctance to go to the shelters before floodwaters reach their homes.

According to sources at the district administration, 65 metric tons of rice, dry food for 700 people and Tk 4 lakh for children's food have been allocated along with livestock feed.

In Brahmanbaria, the Titas river continues to rise due to incessant rain. It was flowing 6 cm above the danger level yesterday.

""Flooding started in the low-lying areas of the upazila but the town protection dam is yet to be submerged,"" said Ranjan Kumar Das, executive engineer of the local WDB.

In Jamalpur, the overall flood situation turned worse as the Jamuna was flowing 123 cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad Ghat point in Dewanganj upazila yesterday noon.

Over eight lakh people of 625 villages under seven upazilas and seven municipalities have been affected by the flood.

Many along with their livestock have taken shelter on high grounds of villages and on concrete bridges.

There is a scarcity of drinking water, cooked food and hygiene facilities. People are in dire need of water purifying tablets and dry food.

In Kurigram, yesterday afternoon, the Brahmaputra was flowing 91 cm above the danger mark, Dharla 62 cm and Dudhkumar 81 cm above, said Ariful Islam, executive engineer of local WDB.

Jahela Bewa, a resident of Char Shankar Madhabpur under Rajibpur upazila, said she has been living on an embankment for the last one week as her home was under four to five feet water.

During the June flood, she had to stay on the embankment for 12 days.

In Lalmonirhat, though floodwaters have started to recede from houses, in many areas, roads are still submerged. There is an acute crisis of food and drinking water in the flood-hit areas.

Flood victim Narendra Nath, of Jagatber village in Sadar upazila, said floodwaters have receded from their houses, but they cannot travel for work as roads are still under water. He is now jobless.

In Tangail, flooding worsened as the water level ofthe Dhaleshwari and Jhenai Rivers have increased, inundating many chars

The flooding in several districts remained unchanged till on Friday as the water level in many rivers rose while the shortage of food and drinking water hit millions of people hard.

In Naogaon, the Jamuna and Atrai Rivers are still above danger level. Several flood protection embankments have collapsed, flooding at least hundreds of villages in the district.

Movement of heavy vehicles through Atrai-Naogaon, Atrai-Bandhaikhara, Atrai-Kaliganj, and Atrai-Singra has been suspended temporarily by the authorities.

Kaosar Hossain, agriculture officer of Atrai upazila, said crops on more than 2,000 hectares of land were inundated by the floodwaters caused by the erosion of embankments in the upazila.

Atrai Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Sanaul Islam said 1,800 people affected by the floods have already been given 10 kilograms of relief rice each.

In Tangail, flooding worsened as the water level ofthe Dhaleshwari and Jhenai Rivers have increased, inundating many chars.

Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB, said the Dhaleshwari river was flowing 151 centimetres above its danger level while the Jhenai was still flowing 99 centimetres above its danger level.

About 1.3 lakh people in 151 villages of the district have been affected by the floods. Hundreds of houses have been washed away, while several roads and embankments collapsed and crops were damaged in the affected areas.

In Rajshahi, homes and croplands were inundated when a 200-feet stretch of flood protection embankment from Peergonj Bazar to Meerpur in Bagmara upazila was breached in the early hours of Friday.

Around 50,000 people of Kalikapur, Ahsanganj, Panchupur and Bisha unions, are stranded as different parts of the flood control embankment gave way, said Abdul Latif, a local of Parmohanghosh village in Bagmara.

In Bogra, around 2500 people are stranded in flood waters as the Jamuna River kept swelling in Sonatola upazila. Many houses were damaged and people took shelter on high ground.

Crops on around 340 hectares of land of 2,180 farmers have, so far, been affected by the floodwaters as the Jamuna continues to be 126cm above the danger mark at Sariakandi point.

In Pabna, around 4000 families are stranded in flood waters in Sujanagar upazila with the Jamuna river flowing 66 centimetres above danger level at Nargarbari-Mothura point.

In Sirajganj, The Jamuna was flowing 96cm above danger level at Sirajganj Sadar and 103cm above danger level in Kazipur upazila.

AKM Rafikul Islam, BWDB sub-divisional engineer in Sirajganj, on Saturday said the waters of the Jamuna are likely to recede in the coming days, but there is a chance it will rise again for a third time before Eid.

Tk2 crore cyclone shelter on the verge of collapse

This information was provided in a report published by the board.

According to reports, heavy rain is likely to occur in Assam, West Bengal and northeast India for four days from July 20-21. Due to the onrush of upstream water and heavy downpours, the north, northeast and central parts of the country, may witness another flood.

Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of the government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, said that according to the forecast data, about 800mm of rain is likely in four days from July 20, which will increase the water level in the country's rivers.

However, even if the water level rises, the water level in the Padma River may start to recede continuously from July 26-27. The overall flood situation may become normal in the last of July or the first week of August.

Meanwhile, expressing hope for improvement in the overall flood situation, State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk said, “The water level of Padma has already started receding. We expect the flood situation to improve in the central districts in the next 2-3 days.”

There was no major breach of the flood control dam during the current floods, he said.

The Ministry and the Water Development Board, in collaboration with the local district administration, are ready at the field level with necessary materials and manpower to deal with any emergency situation, said the state minister.

In the second week of July, Assam, West Bengal and North-East India recorded about 900mm rainfall in four days, resulting in floods in the northern and north-western parts of the country, which also deteriorated flood situation in low-lying areas in Rajbari, Dhaka, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Chandpur.

Jamalpur district has been hit by flood for the second time within the last four days as water levels in the Jamuna river continued to rise.

According to the Water Development Board, Jamuna rose by 38 cm and was flowing 64 cm over the red mark (19.50 metres) at Bahadurabad ghat point during the last 24 hours, ending at around 12pm on Monday.

A total of 13 unions in Islampur and Dewanganj upazilas of the district were affected in the new flood.

25,25,FL-2020-000166-BGD,No end to Sylhet city’s flash flooding problem - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/no-end-sylhet-citys-flash-flooding-problem-1933005,"Sylhet city, situated on the bank of Surma river, has been facing severe instances of waterlogging and flash floods for a long time, although such incidents in the hilly region were alien even some two decades ago.

Authorities keep pointing to the river's swelling as the reason, while citizens blame the city corporation for unplanned drainage systems and Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) for not keeping the river navigable.

Experts, however, say the issue is multifaceted, and resolving these problems is only part of the solution.

Prof Zarina Hossain -- president of Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB), Sylhet chapter -- said, ""The situation the city is facing is not just common waterlogging but something called urban flash flood or urban storm flood.""

During this rainy season, around 50 areas of the city experienced flash floods on July 1 and 12, which continued till Tuesday.

To improve the situation, Sylhet City Corporation (SCC) spent more than Tk 300 crore since 2013; it even got special allocation.

Tk 1,228 crore was allocated last December by the executive committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) for the project ""Eradication of Waterlogging, Freshwater Supply and Infrastructure Construction"".

Another nationwide project for restoring navigability of 53 riverways is being implemented by Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), which includes the whole of Surma.

Meanwhile, BWDB dredged only 600 metres of Surma beside the city's Kanishal area, at an expenditure of Tk 9.27 crore last year.

But despite all the development projects, citizens continue to suffer.

Jafor Siddik Chowdhury, a resident of the city's Lamapara area, said, ""We see the city corporation working on projects to eradicate waterlogging, but we face the same situation every rainy season.""

Abdul Karim Kim -- general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (Bapa), Sylhet chapter -- said, ""Authorities must admit their faults in managing waterways. What's the point of spending that much money for this issue if citizens don't see any benefit?""

""Surma lost its navigability and needs dredging. Otherwise, the city will keep being flooded every year,"" said Kim, also Surma's waterkeeper.

Prof Zarina said other factors must also be taken care of, if authorities want to stop these annual flash floods. ""Water retention areas like ponds, haor and swamplands are integral in managing massive rainfall the region experiences. But unfortunately, the city and its surroundings lost many of such areas over the decades.""

""We must protect water retention and vegetation areas, and take measures centring over-siltation of the river. We need a long-term plan that would consider these issues while developing the city and surroundings,"" said the architect, who is also an urban planner.

Md Shahiduzzaman Sarkar, executive engineer of BWDB in Sylhet, said after a couple of hours of rain, Surma starts overflowing beside the city. Consequently, many areas become inundated and the canal water does not go down.

""Surma needs to be dredged to regain its navigability. As BIWTA is working on a massive project centring this issue, we cannot make immediate plans to dredge part of the river beside the city,"" he said.

SCC Chief Executive Officer Bidhayak Roy Chowdhury said, ""When Surma overflows, we really have nothing to do. The river needs to be dredged properly soon.""

When asked about protecting water retention and vegetation areas, he said, ""We are protecting all water retention areas inside the city limit, but most of such lands are outside the perimeter.""

The city corporation covers only 26.5 square kilometres. A proposal to include another 160.62 square kilometres of surroundings had been placed and is awaiting approval from local government and rural development ministry, he further said.

Notable, the proposal was placed in 2014.

""Once approved, we will protect all water retaining areas in accordance to a comprehensive plan,"" he added.

It seems all hope is now placed on the mega projects, but sadly, citizens must keep suffering, as these are nowhere near completion.

Contacted, BIWTA authorities said while they have made considerable progress, dredging part of the river beside the city will take substantial time to commence.

As for the Ecnec mega project, authorities concerned are yet to go fully operational with it, since they recently received allocation, informed CEO Bidhayak.","Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/sylhet-citys-flash-flooding.jpg?itok=LUhYzRGl,"['city', 'waterlogging', 'flash', 'citys', 'flooding', 'water', 'river', 'surma', 'problem', 'areas', 'retention', 'project', 'sylhet', 'end']",

Atul Sarkar, deputy commissioner of Faridpur, said residents of 150 villages under 30 unions are suffering a lot due to the second phase of this year’s flood.

Sultan Mahmud, executive engineer of Faridpur Water Development Board, said many new areas were inundated due to the increase of river water while erosion took a serious turn in Alfadanga and Madhukhali upazilas.

Jesmine Sultana, Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Charbhadrason upazila, said most of the upazila went under water, rendering at least 4,000 people marooned.

In Sylhet, the water of Surma River reduced but Kushiara continued to rage crossing the danger level at 57 cm, 15 cm and 52 cm at Amalshid, Shewla and Fenchuganj points respectively.

Water Development Board said Surma was flowing 32 cm above the danger level at Kanaighat point while 33 cm below in Sylhet.

In Sirajganj, the overall flood condition remained unchanged while Jamuna was flowing 1 cm and 116 cm above the danger level at Sirajganj point and Kajipur points respectively.

Local WDB Deputy-Divisional Engineer Rafikul Islam said although water receded in last 24 hours but the flood affected people in five upazilas are suffering acutely.

“Thousands of families are still stranded by the flood,” he said.

In Bogura, Jamuna was flowing 125 cm above the danger level at Sariakandi point on Friday evening.

BISWAMBHARPUR: Almost four million people have been hit by monsoon floods in South Asia, officials said yesterday, with a third of Bangladesh already underwater from some of the heaviest rains in a decade. The monsoon-which usually falls from June to September-is crucial to the economy of the Indian sub-continent, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region each year. “This is going to be the worst flood in a decade,” Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre chief Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said.

The heavy rains have swollen two main Himalayan river systems-the Brahmaputra and the Ganges-that flow through India and Bangladesh. Bhuiyan said about a third of flood-prone Bangladesh-a delta-nation crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers-was underwater, and at least 1.5 million people were affected, with village homes and roads flooded.

In north-central Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra river was almost 40 centimeters higher than normal and threatening to burst its banks, district administrator Farook Ahmed said. Most villagers were trying to stay near their flood-damaged homes, but some 15,000 had fled severely affected areas, officials said. With a 10-day forecast pointing to rising waters, Bhuiyan said if more rivers burst their banks some 40 percent of the nation could be flooded “in a worst-case scenario”.

In the northern town of Biswambharpur, villagers said most of the houses were partly underwater after the Surma, a major river in northeast Bangladesh, burst its banks. Farmer Abdur Rashid, 35, said he sent his wife and three children to a multi-storied village school that has been turned into a government shelter. “My whole house has gone underwater. I have sent the rest of the family to the school, but I stayed behind to guard my properties,” Rashid told AFP.

Twin challenges

In Assam, northeast India, more than 2.1 million people have been affected since mid-May. At least 50 people have died so far – 12 in the past week as floodwaters surged-with tens of thousands of mostly rural residents evacuated to relief camps, officials said. Emergency services personnel wore head-to-toe bright-orange suits to protect themselves from the floods and coronavirus-which has infected almost 17,000 people in Assam-as they used boats to reach stranded villagers.

“We have two challenges here, one is COVID-19 and another is (the) flood,” the head of a local rescue team, Abhijeet Kumar Verma, told AFP. In Nepal, at least 50 people have died in landslides and floods triggered by the monsoon rains, with homes swept away and roads and bridges damaged. “We are distributing food and relief goods from helicopters to about 300 displaced families after the roads were blocked by floods and landslides,” district official Gyan Nath Dahal said. —AFP","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.kuwaittimes.net/website/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sub1-2.jpg,"['region', 'flooded', 'million', 'river', 'underwater', 'rains', 'monsoon', 'flood', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'officials', 'roads', 'drenches']",

China's worst floods in recent decades came in 1998 during an El Nino weather effect, killing more than 4,000 people

Floods across large swathes of central and eastern China that have left more than 140 people dead or missing are hitting record levels, with authorities warning the worst was yet to come.

The coronavirus ground zero of Wuhan, through which the powerful Yangtze River winds, is on an expanding list of areas warily watching the rising waters, with the river hitting its third-highest levels in history in the city of 11 million and projected to increase through the week, according to state-controlled media.

Summer flooding has been an annual scourge in China since ancient times, often focused along the vast Yangtze basin that drains much of the central part of the country.

Steady rains since late June have flooded huge areas, leaving 141 people dead or missing so far, affecting 37.89 million others and destroying 28,000 homes, according to central government tallies.

But worsening downpours since last week have caused water levels to spike higher and the government to ramp up alert levels.

Thirty-three rivers have reached record highs, while alerts have been issued on a total of 433 rivers, officials from the Ministry of Water Resources said during a briefing in Beijing on Monday.

Video broadcast by Chinese state-run media at the weekend showed vast stretches of cities and towns inundated by water that rose in some places to the roofs of single-story homes, as rescue personnel evacuated men, women and children aboard inflatable boats.

Elsewhere, homes were shown flattened by landslides that had tumbled from water-logged hillsides.

The worst-hit provinces were Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan in central China, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu in the country's east, and the southwestern mega-city of Chongqing, authorities said.

Illustrating the growing alarm, President Xi Jinping on Sunday called on authorities in affected areas to mobilise to help stricken residents, urging them to be ""courageous.""

Netrakona, Jul 13: Flood situation in Netrakona has taken an alarming turn as the Magra and Dhanu rivers are flowing above their danger levels.

The rain-fed rivers associated with the waters rushing from hills have aggravated the flooding in the last few days.

About 200 villages in Madan, Kalmakanda, Durgapur, Barhatta and Mohangonj upazilas have been affected by the flood.

Some 50,000 families in 35 unions have remained stranded.

As the water levels of the rivers continue to rise, a large number of vegetable fields, Aman seedbeds and fish farms are being washed away in different areas of the district, causing huge losses to the farmers.

Aman farmers are particularly in trouble. Their seedbeds have got swamped and even those who were trying to prepare seedbeds are losing their grown paddy.

As a result, farmers of the district are greatly worried about their targeted Aman production.

Several hundred homesteads in the low-lying areas have been submerged.

People of the district are in tension and fear as the water levels of the rivers keep swelling every day.

Till today, no government assistance has reached the affected areas.

Touhid Ullah, Babul, Sattar and Rahim, residents of Govindshree Guchh village, said many families have moved to the adjacent village as water entered their houses on Sunday.

""Even though our income has stopped, so far no one has come to see us, nor have we received any government aid,"" said one of them.

Syed Shafiqul Islam Nayan, a resident of Madan Dakshinpara village, Asad Milky, a fish farmer from Fatehpur village, Anna Mia from Baghmara village and Al Mahboob Alam of the municipality area, said the fish ponds have been submerged due to sudden rise in river waters. This has caused them a substantial loss.

Aman farmer Injil Khan of Fatehpur village, Babul Mia of Baghmara village and Arab Ali of Madan village said their seedbeds have gone under water.

Again, those who were trying to make a seedbed are also losing their paddy.

As a result, they are worried about the crisis of the next Aman season.

Habibur Rahman, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension, said, ""I have received news that vegetable fields and seedbeds in low-lying areas have been submerged due to sudden rise in water.

A meeting has been held with the field workers in this regard. The amount of damage will be known soon.""

A total of 14 rivers were flowing above the danger level yesterday, according to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre.

The Water Development Board issued a red alert in Dowani area of the Teesta Barrage in Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila on Sunday night.

Hundreds of families living in the Teesta Barrage area were evacuated, said Hafizul Islam, sub-divisional engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) at Teesta Barrage.

There was an abnormal rise in the water level of the Teesta, Dharla, Brahmaputra and a few other adjoining rivers in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram yesterday. The flood situation has worsened greatly in the two districts.

In the morning, the Teesta was flowing 52 cm above the danger level at Teesta Barrage point and 64 cm above the danger level at Shimulbari point.

The Brahmaputra was flowing 45 cm above the danger level at Chilmari point in Kurigram yesterday morning, said local WDB officials.

According to the WDB and the Kurigram and Lalmonirhat district administrations, new areas are being flooded every day due to an abnormal rise in the water level of rivers.

Floodwaters have inundated 120 villages in 21 unions of Lalmonirhat's five upazilas. About one lakh people have been affected.

In Kurigram, flood has hit 250 villages in 42 unions of seven upazilas. It has affected about two and a half lakh people.

In Nilphamari, the Teesta was flowing 55 cm above the danger mark at Dalia point near the Teesta Barrage in Dimla upazila at 2:00am yesterday, said WDB.

Rabiul Islam Lithon, chairman of Khagakharibari Union Parishad in Dimla upazila, said flooding has eroded about 80 percent area of Kisamoter Char, a shoal of the Teesta.

Tayeb Ali, 60, and his six family members are among the flood victims who have taken shelter on a groin dam across the Teesta. Tayeb said although they were unfed for days, nobody came forward with relief to help them.

In Sunamganj, the Surma was flowing 31 cm above the danger level at Sunamganj point yesterday morning. Over 70,000 families of the district's all 11 upazilas were affected in the last four days, said the district administration.

Flood victims are in distress as the crisis of food and drinking water is deepening.

Dilar Begum, an elderly woman from Hosenpur village in Sunamganj Sadar upazila, said she and her daughter-in-law used to work as day labourer to earn their living after the death of her son.

As they had no work for the last three months due to the Covid-19 situation and there is floodwater in their house now, it has become difficult for her to feed her four grandchildren, she added.

Sunamganj Deputy Commissioner Abdul Ahad said, ""We are continuing relief activities and trying to reach every affected people of all villages. No one will be left out of the coverage of the relief activities.""

The Sylhet district administration said more than 48,000 families of five upazilas have been affected by flood in the last three days.

Meanwhile, dwellers of around 50 areas in the city have been suffering from waterlogging since Saturday due to rise in water level of the Surma river and poor drainage of rainwater.

A resident of the city's Jamtola area, Pinak Roy said, ""The whole area is waterlogged for the last two days. Rainwater has entered my home as well. We are suffering because of the poor drainage system in the area.""

In Sirajganj, the Jamuna, which swelled rapidly in the last few days, was flowing above the danger level at Hard Point and Kazipur Point yesterday. Many people have taken shelter in flood protection embankments.

Jahanara Begum from Shuvogacha village in Karipur upazila said, ""There is floodwater in my house for about a month. I cannot build a house at a safe place due to poverty. So I have taken shelter on the flood protection embankment with my two cows.""

In Gaibandha, over 1.22 lakh people have been affected due to the flood as the Teesta, Brahmaputra and Ghaghat rivers were flowing above the danger level yesterday.

""Water level of these three rivers will increase in the next two days,"" said Mokhlesur Rahman, executive engineer of the Gaibandha WDB.

In Bogura, over 80,000 people have been hit by the flood as the Jamuna was flowing 46 cm above of the danger level at the Sariakandi Mathurapara point yesterday.

In Jamalpur, the overall flood situation was getting worse as the Jamuna was flowing 64 cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad Ghat point in Dewanganj upazila yesterday.

Over one lakh people, who were hit hard by the first phase of flood a few days ago, have been marooned again.

The flood situation triggered by monsoon rains in India's northeastern state Assam escalated on Sunday, according to local officials, leaving 24 districts heavily flooded. The number of deaths increased to 84, with five more deaths reported on Sunday. A similar situation also prevails in its neighboring country, Nepal, where the Flood Forecasting Section of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has issued warnings urging people living along the river banks and low land areas Terai, southern Nepal, to move to safe sites due to the possibility of floods. Torrential rains during the annual monsoon season between June and September cause floods, landslides and lightning strikes across the region, with hundreds dying every year. So far, nearly four million people in this region have been displaced, with dozens missing as deaths rose to at least 189.

India issued a red alert for heavy rain in Assam till July 21. Officials said 108 wild animals have died at Kaziranga National Park, including eight rhinos. According to the local disaster management authorities, more than 2.75 million people in Assam have been displaced by three waves of floods since late May. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday assured all support to Assam in dealing with the floods. Modi discussed the flood situation with Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal over the phone and also asked about the COVID-19 situation.

Other south Asian countries are facing flooding due to the impact of monsoon rainfall.

In Bangladesh, at least 67 people had died and another 2.6 million had been affected by swollen rivers bursting their banks and inundating villages over the past two weeks, officials said. ""Of the total, 55 people have died from drowning and eight from lighting strikes,"" Bangladesh health department spokeswoman Ayesha Akther said, adding that the flood situation improved in the last few days. ""But now rivers are again rising in the north after a fresh deluge of rainfall,"" the country's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center chief Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan added.

Unusually heavy monsoon rainfall and flooding is affecting India and neighbouring South Asian countries, as well as China and Japan. This has caused major disruption, displacement and loss of life, and once again highlighted the importance of national meteorological and hydrological services in protecting public safety.

The situation is expected to be aggravated by further rain. More than 200mm of rainfall could fall in 24 hours in some mountainous regions of Bhutan/Bangladesh, Northeast India, Myanmar and Nepal according to the South East Asia Flash Flood Forecast System. Additional similar amounts could be possible for the next 4-5 days. Authorities in China are also warning of more rains.

“Challenges posed by the devastating rains and floods in Asia are being complicated by COVID-19. Even though global attention is understandably focussed on the pandemic, this should not distract us from the continuing need for investment in multi-hazard early warning systems to boost resilience, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

“This is especially true given that climate change is increasing the risk of extreme rainfall events, flooding and coastal inundation,” he said. ""WMO and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services will continue to work to protect lives and livelihoods.""

The India Meteorological Department has issued top-level red warnings for heavy rainfall for many north and northeastern Indian sub-divisions for the next 4 days, mainly Assam & Mehghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, and East and West Uttar Pradesh, valid through 12 May.

A number of flood warnings have been issued by the Flood Forecast Center in Bangladesh, where many northern parts of the countries were submerged in late June. The Bhutan National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology and the Hydrology and Meteorology department in Nepal are also issuing advisories for heavy rainfall, the potential for flash floods and landslides and the risk of rivers breaking embankments.

The South Asian monsoon is the backbone of the regional economy. But in addition to its benefits, it causes loss of life and disruption every year.

Many areas in central and north/northeast India have seen more than 150mm above average monsoon rains so far this year. Tens of thousands of people have been forced out of their homes in the Assam region of India, and there has been coastal flooding in the state of Gujarat.

Flash Flood Guidance System

The warnings of heavy rainfall and flooding in South Asia coincide with an online Flash Flood Guidance System training session from 8-10 July. It was led by the India Meteorological Department, which is the Regional Center of the South Asia Flash Flood Guidance System, and involved more than 100 operational forecasters from 40 IMD sub-offices and from Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

The training program promotes the implementation of the FFGS through regional and national Centers in South Asia, which is prone to natural hazards like flash floods, riverine floods and tropical cyclones. Participants conducted hands-on exercises, discussed regional operations and case studies including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka.

FFGS was developed to improve the capacity of NMHSs to issue flash flood warnings and alerts about a major natural hazard. As of the beginning of 2020, it provides early warnings to three billion people – 40% of the world’s population – across more than 60 countries.

The global initiative brings together WMO, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Hydrologic Research Center (HRC) and U.S. Agency for International Development/Bureau For Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA).

“Thousands of people die in riverine and flash floods. Many of them could be saved by improved early warnings, information about the risks of these sudden-onset events and better water resource management,” Hwirin Kim, Head of WMO Hydrological and Water Resources Services Division, told the training session.

China

Severe flooding has affected millions of people, with dozens of casualties. Since June, continuous downpours have lashed large parts of southern China, and the waters of many rivers – including the mighty Yangtze river - in the affected regions have exceeded warning levels. Dozens of lives have been lost and there has been major disruption.

China's State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters upgraded the emergency response for flood control from level IV to level III on 7 July, as incessant downpours continued to wreak havoc across vast stretches of the country. China has a four-tier flood control emergency response system, with level I representing the most severe.

The China Meteorological Administration says that until 11 July, rainstorms will still reign over Southwest China, South of the Yangtze River Region, Jianghan Region, and Jianghuai Region, and then move northwards. Heavy downpour will lash northern Jiangxi, northeastern Hunan, and central and northern Sichuan Basin. There will be severe convective weather like short-range heavy rainfall. The hourly intensity will reach 30-50mm.

Japan

For more than a week flooding has affected southern parts of Japan, with dozens of reported fatalities and missing people. At least 270,000 people were told to evacuate in four prefectures across Kyushu Island.

The Japan Meteorological Agency continues to issue many warnings and advisories for heavy rain, thunderstorms and ground loosening rain. It has also set up a dedicated multi-lingual portal on the heavy rainfall event.","Fri, 10 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.preventionweb.net/files/72703_largeImage.jpg,"['flash', 'flooding', 'asia', 'meteorological', 'heavy', 'rains', 'hit', 'rainfall', 'flood', 'south', 'india', 'large', 'warnings', 'parts', 'china']", 
44,44,FL-2020-000166-BGD,Bangladesh and water: A complicated relationship - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/bangladesh-and-water-complicated-relationship-1931945,"Did you ever consider that water management may not always improve livelihoods? For a long time, we thought better water management will indeed make a better country of Bangladesh. And maybe you are thinking the same. And of course, it is true up to a certain level. But we sometimes seem to forget that our goal should not be to manage water issues better in Bangladesh. Rather it should be to enhance living conditions for people. And this simple truth turns our desire for improved water management into just one of the multiple means. There is a greater, further reaching goal beyond that.

Why is this important, you may ask? Well, we think, strict focus on only water management is blurring the perspective on the overall greater objective: improving livelihoods of people.

Nature has handed Bangladesh (also the home country of one of the authors, The Netherlands) with, let's say, a very peculiar share of all the forces there could be. Water is everywhere, flooding and cyclones and storms. This abundance of water seems to classify Bangladesh as one of the most uninhabitable places on earth. The misery doesn't seem to end here though. An old folk song goes: ""Lalon morey jol pipashai, kaasse thakte nadi Meghna (Lalon suffers from thirst of water whilst river Meghna flows nearby)"". Water here is either too much or too less. Now, take a step back, think again. The truth is far more nuanced, far more subtle, far more interesting. Bengalis proudly introduce their country as ""Nodi-Matrik Bangladesh""—a word that compares the mighty rivers (Nodi) to a Mother (Mata), signifying the strong and gentle, unrelenting and yielding, protecting and releasing, demanding and unassuming power of mother's love. This largest delta of the world is a very fertile place, with a climate that is favourable for vegetation and thus for agriculture. And this very environment has enabled numerous Bengalis to carve out a living in the ""most uninhabitable place on earth"". Thousands of years. Millions of people. So, there must be something good here. There must be something very valuable here. Nodi-Matrik Bangladesh. Think again…

Let's step back to reality and rethink the purpose of water management. Why do we manage the water after all? Fact is, water management is only worth the effort we spend on it, if and only if, it ensures improvement of the life situation of the people. Only if it offers better changes for the children of these people, empowers people, makes life a little less marginalised.

The question we are raising is not whether water management could ultimately benefit the people. It undoubtedly does. We are rather concerned whether the current practice of large-scale top-down infrastructure-oriented management is the most effective way to address the water issues. And we think the answer to that question is negative. The current practice largely focuses on infrastructural approaches forcing engineering on people without properly understanding the needs and situation of the community. Such approaches seem to be willing to sacrifice functioning, well adapted livelihoods for optimised monocultures of agricultural production. This optimised agricultural production is obtained by interventions that can be summarised as Flood Control Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects, which basically aims to optimise yields by obtaining full control over the hydrologic system. Some substantial projects of the past can be highlighted, such as the Flood Action Plan of the 1990s, the Coastal Embankment Projects, the larger irrigation and river barrages projects. All of these examples are spectacular in their failure. There are, however, other projects, just as spectacular—but this time in their successes. The most prominent one to highlight is of course the hugely successful Flood and Cyclone Forecasting and Cyclone Shelter programmes, but also projects, such as rehabilitations of wetlands and local small-scale adaptations such as the (century old concepts of) floating farming.

We would like to point out the difference between the two approaches—""fighting the natural system to make it behave"" versus ""adapting people's livelihoods to learn how to survive and live with the system"". These two schemes direct to very different ways of water management. Most lessons from the past show that the first approach of trying to control the system has little chance of success and carries huge consequences disrupting social and environmental processes. We prefer the second approach. Although a little less ambitious, it has a larger success rate and lower impact from social and environmental disruption. This poses importance to serious efforts of involving local people, their knowledge and experience, in the strategic planning. And thus effectively abandon the perspective in which we aim for huge infrastructures to totally control the system.

Water management strategy in Bangladesh at present is fragmented and public participation in water projects is an utmost necessity. A united effort of water experts and the general public (local communities, farmers) through information sharing, diffusion of new technology and shared governance is required, practicing not just top-down approach but also prioritising bottom up perspective. It is high time we shift the perception from single-focused management action towards a less standardised and more reflexive process. Thus, enhancing stakeholders' capacity to adapt to complexities and uncertainties of future climate challenges, viewing water management not as a conventional or prescriptive system, rather as an evolving learning process. Water management is too important to leave it to just the water managers.

We all have heard the story before, we all have paid lip service to participatory water management, and we all have said that this time it will be different. But it is time that we really need to start evaluating our previous projects and learn from the mistakes we made then. Otherwise we are condemned to repeat the same mistakes again. We should know better by now.

Bangladesh has made incredible steps in improving livelihoods of people. From becoming self-sufficient in rice production to realising huge economic growth through textile, jute, seafood, shipbuilding, pharmaceutical industries and so on—the success is impressive and overwhelming. But the future still holds some challenges. Most of them are related directly or indirectly to water. And there are major and minor water related projects in the planning pipeline. Combined they will cost a fortune. Bangladesh has to make some very wise decisions about these projects. Are they worth these hefty investments or are they just white elephants? Rhetorical plans, exorbitant real construction costs, but with ""benefits"" yet to be realised! Are these the most efficient projects, or are they overambitious, not well in-tune with the local situations and the local needs? And in the end, the very hard question is: which way is the most effective to improve the quality of life? ""Nodi-Matrik Bangladesh"" surely has some very hard thinking to do to find the wise answers.

A global initiative to improve early warnings of flash floods – one of the deadliest natural hazards _ has advanced in South Asia, just as the region is hit by unusually heavy monsoon rains and floods.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Regional Center of South Asia Flash Flood Guidance System, conducted an online training from 8 to 10 July 2020 for 130 forecasters from Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

The aim is to integrate flash food guidance products into operational forecasts which can be used by disaster managers both throughout India and in other participating countries by harnessing new technology, forecast tools, super computers and local expertise. It is part of a global system which currently provides early warnings to three billion people – 40% of the world’s population – across more than 60 countries.

Flash floods and riverine floods contribute to major loss of life and property in South Asia during the monsoon season. Currently many Indian states in the Eastern Himalayan region are facing severe flood situations in major river basins.

“Thousands of people die in riverine and flash floods. Many of them could be saved by improved early warnings, information about the risks of these sudden-onset events and better water resource management. The training program is very important to ensure that the Flash Flood Guidance System is established and sustained for the Regional and National Centers in South Asia, which is a region prone to natural hazards such as flash floods, riverine floods and tropical cyclones.” said Hwirin Kim, Head of WMO Hydrological and Water Resources Services Division.

The IMD three-day training, held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, provided hands-on exercises and shared recent case study analysis from participating countries. A 30-day operational online Information Technology training is also being given to 15 selected experts to ensure that the system is sustainable.

IMD provides value-added quantitative precipitation forecasts for the 153 flood-prone river basins through its 14 flood meteorological offices established across the country. A two-day online training programme 1 and 2 July 2020 was successfully conducted for 50 forecasters by IMD’s Hydromet Division, for improving the flood meteorological services of the country.

“These ambitious services and new initiatives have become a reality in this monsoon season and will definitely help in its sustainability in future,” said Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General of IMD.

“These trained forecasters will start operations across the region at local level for the whole flood season with the support and guidance of Regional Centre at New Delhi,” said B P Yadav, Deputy Director General (Hydromet) & Head of Regional Operations of the South Asia Flash Flood Guidance System.

The South Asia Flash Flood Guidance System was launched in 2016, covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) was selected as the regional centre to provide forecast products and data to the participating countries and conduct verification studies in collaboration with the NMHSs and WMO.

The World Meteorological Organization is working together in partnership with U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Hydrologic Research Center and U.S. Agency for International Development/Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance on developing and implementing Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) with Global coverage.

Flash floods cause more than 5,000 deaths worldwide annually, exceeding any other flood-related event. They have enough power to change the course of rivers, bury houses in mud, and sweep away or destroy whatever is on their path.

They are among the world’s deadliest disasters and result in significant social, economic and environmental impacts. Accounting for approximately 85% of the flooding cases, flash floods also have the highest mortality rate.

As the global population increases, especially in urban areas, and societies continue to encroach upon floodplains, the need for flash flood early warning systems becomes more paramount.","Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.preventionweb.net/files/72741_largeImage.jpg,"['regional', 'training', 'trained', 'flash', 'asia', 'forecasters', 'meteorological', 'system', 'asian', 'guidance', 'south', 'flood', 'floods', 'warnings']",

The Brahmaputra River continued to wreak havoc, displacing more than 2 million people, the officials said. Vast tracts were still underwater with 26 of the state’s 33 districts badly affected.

M.S. Mannivanan, head of the State Disaster Management Authority, said rescue and relief operations were underway.

“We have 40 teams of the State Disaster Response Force in the worst-hit areas and the army also is on standby,” Mannivanan said.

The Brahmaputra River, which flows through Tibet, India and Bangladesh, burst its banks in Assam late last month, inundating large swathes of the state and triggering mudslides.

In neighboring Bangladesh, over a million people are marooned or have left their homes for higher ground along with their cattle and other belongings.

“The situation is grim, although the Brahmaputra's waters have receded slightly today with the intensity of rains coming down a bit,” Manninanan said.

More people in Atrai upazila in Naogaon and Bagmara upazila in Rajshahi have been marooned amid the erosion of flood control embankments caused by onrushing floodwater from the upstream in the past 24 hours.

In Rajshahi, houses and croplands have been inundated after a 200-feet stretch of flood protection embankment from Peergonj Bazar to Meerpur in Bagmara upazila was breached in the early hours of Friday.

Bagmara Upazila Chairman Anil Kumar Sarker told journalists that the condition of the marooned people has become deplorable due to houses and standing crops being inundated.

Around 50,000 people of Kalikapur, Ahsanganj, Panchupur and Bisha unions under Atrai upazila are stranded as different parts of the flood control embankment were eroded, said Abdul Latif, a local of Parmohanghosh village in Bagmara.

Most of the areas of Shibpur village adjacent to Upazila Parishad office have gone underwater, leaving thousands of people marooned. Many of them have taken shelter on the embankment or on elevated roadsides to be away from the flood.

In Naogaon, rivers have been flowing through Sadupur point of Atrai-Naogaon road and on Atrai-Porakhali road. Water continues to flow over the Kasiabari sluice gate and on different parts of Atrai-Bandhaikhara road.

Movement of all sorts of vehicles through the roads has been restricted due to the flood. Movement of heavy vehicles through Atrai-Naogaon, Atrai-Bandhaikhara, Atrai-Kaliganj, and Atrai-Singra has also been suspended temporarily by the concerned authorities.

Kaosar Hossain, agriculture officer of Atrai upazila, said standing crops on around 2,057 hectares of land were inundated by the floodwaters caused by erosion of embankment in the upazila.

Atrai Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Sanaul Islam said 1,800 flood-affected people have already been given 10 kilograms of relief rice each.

River water still flowing above danger line

Muhammad Arifuzzaman, executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, said the Atrai has been flowing 7 cm below the danger level at Atrai point on Saturday morning and has started receding.

He also said the Jamuna has been flowing 117cm, 104cm and 96cm respectively above the danger mark at Sariakandi point in Bogra and two different points in Sirajganj.

Besides, the Gur River is flowing 50cm above the danger mark at Shingra point in Natore. The Atrai River has been flowing 100 centimeter above the danger level at Baghabari point in Sirajganj district and both of these rivers are showing a rising trend over the past 24 hours until 9am on Saturday.

Crops have also been affected

Meanwhile, around 11,682 hectares of croplands have, so far, become submerged by the floodwaters in different districts of Rajshahi division, officials said.

Various crops including recently planted aush and aman paddy, aman seedbeds, and vegetable plants were affected due to the swelling of rivers caused by heavy rainfall and onrushing water from upstream.

According to sources of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), 4,725 hectares of Aush paddy, 2,700 hectares of Aman seedlings, 1,932 hectares of Aman plants and 503 hectares of Aman seedbeds were either completely or partially affected by the deluge in Rajshahi, Naogaon, Natore, Bogra, and Sirajganj.

The Covid-19 lockdown coupled with fund shortages have crippled Christian groups' ability to reach out to the flood-hit Assam state in northeast India, where 66 people have lost lives and 3.6 million are marooned.

“We are in a terrible situation not knowing what to do as all over the state is flooded and people are struggling to find food and accommodation,” said Bishop Thomas Pullopillil of Bongaigaon diocese on July 16.

The local meteorological department has predicted heavy rainfall over the next 72 hours, creating fear in the minds of people who are already bearing the brunt of the torrential rain and resultant flood.

The agency warned that “the situation will further deteriorate.”

The government has put the flood death toll for the season at 66 and those badly affected by it at 3.6 million, highlighting the enormity of a crisis that the state is facing amid its Covid-19 lockdown.

“The torrential rain and floods are an annual phenomenon, however, this year it has broken all records"" affecting millions, said Bishop Pullopillil told UCA News.

“The government agencies are doing what little they can but that is not enough to address the enormity of the situation,” he said.

“Church agencies of different denominational churches, including Catholics, used to pool resources from different agencies and help the people in situations like this.

“Unfortunately, now we are unable to do much for those struggling as our funds were spent feeding the stranded migrant workers and other poor during the Covid-19 lockdown,” the prelate said.

Meanwhile, Father G. P. Amalraj, the deputy secretary of the northeastern regional bishops’ council, told UCA News that “Most Catholic dioceses in Assam and other northern eastern states are suffering from severe financial crises. So we are not able to reach out to the flood-affected people.""

He said they are asking individual Churches to do ""whatever little they can to help the needy.”

Dibrugarh diocese in Assam was particularly affected with many institutions under flood water for a week at the end of June, as well the houses of hundreds of thousands of people in the diocese.

“The bishop’s house and cathedral flooded after water from the Brahmaputra overflowed and entered villages and towns in the diocese and other localities in the state,” according to Father Palatty Devassy, secretary to the bishop.

“Now, there is some respite from the rain but the situation is likely to get worse"" with predictions of more rains.

“We can do hardly anything to help those stranded or marooned in the flood as the Covid-19 lockdown has restricted travel in the state,” the priest said.

Allen Brooks, spokesperson for the Assam Christian Forum, an umbrella organization of all Christian denominational churches in the area said, “Church leaders [of all denominations] took stock of the plight of people of Assam on July 14 and the ways to help them at this hour of crisis.

“Everyone is facing serious financial problems. Many pastors have not taken their salary over the past three months,” he told UCA News on July 15.

“Even if we want to do something we cannot go out of our homes and it is almost impossible for us to help those who are stranded,"" said Brooks, who is based in Guwahati, the state's commercial capital.

""I cannot move out of the district because of Covid-19 restrictions, and this is the case for most others too,"" he said.

Church groups have now agreed to gather aid through the local churches and ""do whatever we can for those in our close vicinity,” Brooks said.

Brooks also blamed the government for its failure to repair embankments this year which he claimed aggravated the food situation.

Bishop Pullopillil said he regretted that “the state is not getting any focus in the national news despite such a huge calamity.”

With the next month is likely to be one of the worst of the rainy season, the bishop warned: “If the situation continues like this, we do not know what our plight will be.”","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2020/07/churches-struggling-to-help-flood-victims-in-india-5f10161926530_600.png,"['state', 'stranded', 'churches', 'northeast', 'situation', 'help', 'uca', 'covid19', 'victims', 'struggle', 'flood', 'india', 'assam', 'rain', 'told']",

Growers of aus and aman rice crops, jute and summer vegetables in 14 districts suffered the biggest losses as the floods submerged nearly 42,000 hectares of the cropland, said Alhaz Uddin Ahmed, director of the field services wing at the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

""There is no scope of recovery of the crops that went underwater,"" he said.

The estimate of the loss was prepared based on inundation from June 25 to July 9. As soon as the DAE had completed the primary estimates, the floods, resulting from heavy rainfall and onrush of water from upstream, started submerging the localities and farmlands in the northern and central regions.

Until yesterday, crops on 62,000 hectares area in 26 districts were affected by the floodwaters. This includes the districts that were affected by the flood in the first spell, said DAE officials.

The natural disaster hit the country and farming at a time when the government has given a thrust to utilise every piece of cultivable land to ensure enough food production so that the nation can manage food supply and fight the Covid-19 pandemic without having to rely on global markets.

As part of the plan, the agriculture ministry earlier allocated Tk 33 crore for distribution of seed and fertilizer among small and marginal farmers to encourage them to grow rice during the aus season and cultivate summer onion.

It widened aus rice acreage and yield targets, apart from increasing the cultivation of aman, the second-biggest rice crop contributing 39 per cent to the total 3.63 crore tonnes of rice output in the last fiscal year.

The ministry increased the aus paddy planting target by 17 per cent from the previous year's acreage.

The acreage for aus, which is harvested in July and August, crossed the target and stood at 13.36 lakh hectares, the highest in two decades.

The ministry earlier raised the rice production target by 20 per cent to 36 lakh tonnes during the aus season and targeted to increase the cultivation and yields during the current aman rice season by encouraging farmers to grow newly released improved varieties of rice.

Farmers plant the crop during the rainy season and harvest in November and December. The agriculture ministry reduced the prices of seeds.

As the floods continue to inundate, the DAE prepares to provide rehabilitation support to farmers.

""We will begin rehabilitation activities after the water recedes,"" said DAE Director General Md Abdul Muyeed.

""We have taken a three-pronged strategy to support growers with seedlings,"" he said, adding that agricultural workers would encourage farmers to plant vegetables like bottle gourd in moveable bags.

To provide seedlings of aman crop, the DAE took a Tk 2.14-crore project to develop community seedbeds on 527 acres. The idea is to support 35,000 farmers to grow rice on the same bighas of land, said Ahmed.

It would support more than 1,250 farmers to grow seedlings on floating seedbeds.

The DAE will pilot a scheme of growing seedbeds in trays of rice transplanters to distribute seedlings among 1,600 growers, said Alhaz.

He said seedlings of late varieties of aman rice such as BR-22 and BR-23 would be prepared to help farmers make up their losses caused by the floods.

The government aims to bring 58.95 lakh hectares of land under aman cultivation this year to produce 1.53 crore tonnes of rice.

Until yesterday, farmers planted aman on five lakh hectares of area, including three lakh hectares of broadcast variety, according to the DAE.","Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/flood-lose.jpg?itok=oh0iXA73,"['seedlings', 'tk', 'support', 'season', 'aus', 'far', '350cr', 'dae', 'rice', 'aman', 'farmers', 'floods', 'crops', 'hectares', 'lakh', 'damage']",

In the southern plains bordering India, the Koshi river, which causes deadly floods in the Indian state of Bihar almost every year, was flowing above the danger level, police said.

Monsoon-induced disasters are common in Nepal owing to the country's mountainous topography and dozens of big rivers. Since the beginning of the monsoon season in June, scores of people have lost their lives in floods and landslides.

The floods in Nepal have put the authorities in Bihar on high alert.

Heavy rain is expected in Sichuan and Anhui in China's central regions over the next few days before heading north towards the capital Beijing, according to the National Meteorology Center.

The Yangtze, China's longest river, flows through the central regions of the country, where the Three Gorges Dam is also located. Some residents there have raised concerns recently over the dam's capacity to cope with the extra amounts of water.

Videos posted on social media showed many areas in Wuhan, one of the cities in the Yangtze River basin downstream of the dam and which has lately become known for being the initial epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, were still flooded as authorities rushed to reinforce dykes. Water levels in the city were recorded at 28.47 meters on Wednesday, above the warning level of 27.50 meters.

Since June, average rainfall nationwide was 172.7 mm, or 12% more than the same period last year. China saw some serious flood-led disasters centered around the Yangtze River in 1998 and 2016. Authorities said on Wednesday the rain record in the river basin since the start of the monsoon season last month reached 600 mm, higher than 2016's level of 580 mm but still below the 700 mm recorded in 1998.

Even so, floods around districts near the country's largest lake, Poyang in Jiangsi Province, have worsened in recent days, prompting the rescue of 6.4 million people, officials said on Wednesday. This is in addition to the 38 million people who have been evacuated across the country, which was announced on Monday.

As rains are predicted to move north, authorities in Xiongan New Area and Baoding, south of Beijing, are strengthening flood control measures, state media Xinhua reported on Monday.

Xiongan is one of the key economic development regions promoted by the government of President Xi Jinping. It is also the location of Daxing International Airport, Beijing's latest travel gateway.

Economists have raised concerns over the impact of the floods on the country's economic recovery, projecting there will be a drag on investment activities in the current quarter.

The government is expected to announce economic data for the April to June quarter on Thursday, with many analysts pointing to growth after a contraction of 6.8% in the first quarter.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F3%252F8%252F1%252F1%252F28261183-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-159480846520200715%2520china%2520flood%2520AP20197169936095.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['country', 'levels', 'river', 'stays', 'regions', 'authorities', 'basin', 'mm', 'days', 'yangtze', 'warning', 'economic', 'floods', 'warns', 'china']",

A week of torrential rain pounded southwestern and central Japan, triggering severe flooding and landslides that have killed at least 68 people in the region. Kumamoto prefecture in Japan’s southern island of Kyushu has been hardest hit, and over the weekend residents braced for more extreme weather. On Saturday some areas observed more than 80 millimeters of rainfall per hour and 1,000 mm over three consecutive days. Strong winds, lightning, and tornadoes were also added to the weather warning. The Ministry of Land reported 282 mudslide disasters across 27 prefectures with the largest number, 52, in Kumamoto prefecture.

Eastern and western Japan are on high alert for heavy 24-hour downpours with a risk that rivers in Iwate and Aomori could overflow. New mudslide warnings have also been issued for Kyushu as past rain loosens the ground and damaged river levees inundate low-lying areas.

Residents have been urged to secure their safety, with authorities stressing that conditions can suddenly deteriorate with the stopping and starting of heavy rains. As of Saturday, 2,909 people were staying in evacuation shelters across eight prefectures. On Kyushu Island, 283 people in Kumamoto were trapped after roads were damaged.

On Saturday local authorities warned that the water level of the Kuma River, which stretches across Kumamoto prefecture, was rapidly rising and the river was at risk of bursting its banks again. On July 4, the Kuma River overflowed in seven locations, with rapid flooding trapping some 3,000 households. Disaster-affected communities in mountainous areas were cut off due to collapsed roads and highways and large debris which caused disruptions to phone lines. Floodwaters reportedly reached as high as 4.3 meters in some areas, damaging about 10,000 homes and also washing away cars, railway lines, and a bridge.

Japan’s Meteorological Agency says the atmospheric conditions remain unstable over a wide area from western Japan to Tohoku as a result of an active weather front and low pressure system extending over the East China Sea to the Sea of Japan. Local heavy rains are expected to continue for 12 to 15 days.

Search and rescue efforts for 13 missing people, mainly in Kumamoto, are being hampered by intermittent heavy rains. Bad weather has delayed helicopter aerial searches as well the construction of temporary individual emergency shelters. Volunteers who arrived to help with the clean up of damaged houses were sent home after locals in Hitoyoshi city were ordered to evacuate via radio. Despite that, Japan’s disaster management minister made a public appeal for volunteers, saying the COVID-19 pandemic has affected recruitment numbers.

This year, managing the rainy season was complicated by the spread of coronavirus. Volunteers are being restricted to their own prefecture, which has created a shortage of manpower. Meanwhile, evacuation centers also pose a dangerous risk for COVID-19 clusters as continued heavy rains prolong evacuees’ stay. In preparation, authorities opened more evacuation shelters to help reduce crowd density. Socially distanced cardboard partitions have also been set up around groups of evacuees.

Japan’s rainy season is the milder precursor to a notoriously hot and humid summer. While the rainy season varies depending on the region and year, generally falling from late May to late July, heavy rains that lead to major disasters tend to happen toward the end of the season, from late June to late July. However, the intensifying level of damage and death toll in recent years has been linked to the fallout of global warming. As temperatures and sea levels rise, large amounts of water vapor from the East China Sea and South China Sea form a “river of atmospheric water vapor,” leading to the near-annual occurrence of severe rainstorms and torrential rains.

Devastation from strong winds and floods has brought an inflow of sediment into paddy fields and flood water to farmland, damaging rice crops for harvest season. Last Thursday Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared this year’s rainy season as a “violent disaster” and pledged financial support to local municipalities to ease the burden of recovery and rebuilding. At this stage the full extent of the damage is unknown, but Abe said authorities would speed up inspections to calculate the price tag of the destruction.","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-07-07-4.jpg,"['floods', 'sea', 'season', 'river', 'water', 'rains', 'japan', 'heavy', 'kumamoto', 'weather', 'torrential', 'recordbreaking', 'deadly', 'hammered', 'late', 'rainy']", 
58,58,FL-2020-000166-BGD,Floods hit Bihar again after heavy early monsoon rain - thethirdpole.net,https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/regional-cooperation/floods-bihar/,"On July 11, Reshmi Devi was forced to leave her village, which is within the embankments of the Koshi river in Supaul district, Bihar. Floods have been a routine threat to Devi, a widow, and many others in the east Indian state of Bihar, for the past few decades. Since the weekend hundreds of people have fled, or are fleeing, their homes in nearly a dozen districts. They have taken shelter on embankments, highways and the rooftops of buildings.

Devi is one of more than 50 people from the villages of Dharahara and Rupauli. They are mostly elderly, female or children. Close to the Nepal border, they were among the first villages affected in Bihar. “Flood waters not only entered our thatched houses; it fully inundated the village. Our past experience reminded us to move to a safer place outside the embankment,” she said.

Devkumar Mehta is the husband of a local elected member of Kamalpur panchayat (village council), and arranged four private boats to rescue Devi and other villagers. He expressed unhappiness about the government’s failure to provide boats to evacuate people from marooned villages. “The administration claimed to hire local boatmen for the purpose but they were not paid money for their work last year during floods. How they will work? Boatmen are not ready to work. People were compelled to pay boatmen from their pockets to reach safer places from their inundated villages.”

Harendar Paswan and his family took shelter on an embankment in Aurai in Muzaffarpur district after the swollen Bagmati river created havoc in dozens of villages. “Our village is inundated and flood waters spread all around. We shifted to the Bagmati embankment for safety. We are living under a polythene sheet but it failed to protect us from heavy rain,” said Paswan, a farm labourer.

Ranjeev (who uses one name), a local river activist, said hundreds of thousands of people are worried as water from rising rivers has been spreading fast. “Fear of inundation is increasing because heavy rains are not stopping. If paddy seedlings are damaged, it will result in heavy crop loss. To date no relief camp or shelter is set up for those forced to flee. There is nothing except government’s preparedness on paper.”

The Patna Meteorological Centre forecast heavy to very heavy rain from July 9 to 12 in districts bordering Nepal.

Sanjay Jha, the minister of water resources in Bihar, said that after the forecast the government prepared to shift people from low-lying areas, and that a constant vigil was being maintained on embankments. “All embankments were safe, there was no need to panic and field officials were maintaining round the clock vigil to undertake flood protection work.” He added that the eastern Koshi embankment, which was breached in 2008 flooding five districts of northern Bihar, was “totally safe”.

Jha said the Water Resources Department (WRD) has recently launched the “HelloWRD” campaign, which asks people to use the department’s Twitter hashtag to report any visible cracks or breaches in embankments and point out any shortcomings in flood-prevention structures. He added that the department has launched a 24/7 call centre with a toll-free number for flood-affected people.

The pandemic question

The Covid-19 issue is also being considered, according to the government. Avinash Kumar, officer on special duty at the Disaster Management Department (DMD), said flood-relief camps will “maintain physical distancing and pay attention to sanitation and hygiene. All district officials have been instructed to arrange for boats and to increase flood shelters. All people suspected to be Covid positive will be kept at quarantine centres being set up in flooded areas.”

The National Disaster Response Force has also been deployed. Vijay Sinha, head of its ninth battalion, said those likely to be involved in relief work will be provided personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, gloves, face shields and other appropriate material.

The pandemic and the nationwide lockdown on March 25, have had other consequences for residents. Mahendar Yadav, founder and convenor of the a local people’s organisation Koshi Nav Nirman Manch, said migrant workers returned home hoping to cultivate their farms or get local employment. According to DMD data, the majority of the more than two million migrant workers who returned to the state between May 3 and June 21 are from the flood-prone Koshi and Seemanchal regions.

Yadav said that most of them are disappointed. The government failed to provide them with employment despite announcements made two months ago. “Thousands have already left their villages again for livelihood taking high risk amid pandemic as there was no option for them. More will follow in the coming days.” Those cultivating paddy, maize and jute are now very worried about flood damage to their crops.

Waters will continue to rise

The overall flood situation in the state is likely to worsen, with forecasts of heavy to moderate rains in the catchment areas of all major rivers on July 13 and 14. The state’s agriculture minister, Prem Kumar, is worried. He said, “We have received information that standing maize crops in low-lying areas were submerged after heavy rains and paddy seedlings also damaged.”

According to an official from the Patna weather office, Bihar had received nearly 55% surplus rain as of Sunday during the ongoing monsoon season. All the reservoirs are completely filled within a month of the onset of the monsoon.

Abdus Sattar, assistant professor and agro-meteorologist at the Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, said, “This is the first time in many years that the monsoon has remained continuously so vigorous after its onset. Good monsoon rainfall is now a boon for the farmers as well as possible bane for many.”

India-Nepal tensions hit flood-protection works

The annual job of repairing river embankments came to a halt with the India-wide lockdown on March 25, and work could only start in mid-May as the lockdown was eased. Another problem was coordinating with Nepal as tensions between the two countries rose in recent weeks.

Anjani Kumar Singh of the WRD claimed flood-control measures were completed on the Indian side, but work on the Nepal side, from which most of the rivers flow into Bihar, remain incomplete. Ten days after the onset of monsoon, Nepal put up barricades that hindered Bihar’s work, he alleged. Every year, Bihar officials help repair embankments in Nepal. This year, however, it took the intervention of Bihar’s chief minister to start the work.

Are women being left behind?

As the authorities prepare to deal with the floods, Kumar of the DMD said the department’s first focus is always to first evacuate women. “We identify vulnerable groups like pregnant women through jeevika didi and anganwadi kendra [government support programmes] … If there are devastating floods, state government pays some amount to newborn children. We also provide dignity kits, including sanitary pads, to women.”

Shri Vyasji, vice-chairman of the Bihar State Disaster Management Authority, said it conducts a survey to identify pregnant and breastfeeding women. “We make a village-wise list and first rescue them. We arrange milk for children at camps and set up anganwadi kendra [childcare centres] and maternity huts where doctors, nurses and medicines are available. For complicated delivery cases, we send them by ambulance to hospital.”

Not everyone thinks the government’s response is adequate. Sushmita, gender justice programme officer with Oxfam Bihar, said official responses to disasters like floods generally ignore gender. Oxfam had suggested building toilets three feet above the ground at flood shelters, plus separate toilets for men and women. The lack of care for women is often to the cost of children, she pointed out. During floods minors are sometimes parted from their families and become victims of trafficking.","Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thethirdpole.net/content/uploads/2020/07/Floods-hit-Bihar-scaled.jpg,"['state', 'nepal', 'embankments', 'villages', 'heavy', 'hit', 'bihar', 'monsoon', 'flood', 'floods', 'rain', 'women', 'early', 'work']",

• Mixed price trends observed across the markets. Price of rice, red lentils, chicken peas, vegetable oil and onions remained stable and/or declined, while chicken and egg prices has considerably increased.

• The current market stability can be attributed to increased market surveillance and reduced clearance time for imported food commodities at the port.

• Rice traders are however expressing concerns on potential supply disruptions, due to the current heavy rains and flooding in northern parts of the country, a major rice supply hub for many traders.

• Compared to May, egg prices have increased by up to 20 percent following recovery of the poultry market, after COVID-19 transmission rumours affected it at the early stages of the crisis.

• While food availability in the markets remains stable, economic access by households is the major concern. Purchasing power dropped by 42 percent in June compared to pre-crisis period.

• As household incomes continue to fall, or unavailable altogether for some, a shift in dietary patterns is evident with many households favouring less preferred or cheaper foods, with low nutritional value. A compromise on healthy diets makes the population more vulnerable to the current pandemic.

• Livestock trade has also experienced substantial disruptions, with demand for livestock products being atypically low. Farmers and traders stand to lose more, with the Eid al-Adha festivals coming up, typically the peak season for livestock business in Bangladesh.

• Camp markets have seen a sudden increase in demand for fresh foods, amidst typical supply levels, exerting an upward pressure on fresh food prices in those markets, and exposing refugees to very unfavourable terms-of-trade.

• Overall, most markets continue operating at atypically low levels- dampened demand from households being the main reason, but also due to substantial reduction in demand for relief efforts.

• Movement restrictions threatens to disrupt agricultural activities, through labour shortages and high input costs, which could lead to acreage contractions and low yields in future, exacerbating vulnerabilities.","Sun, 12 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1526359-WFP-0000117581.png?itok=Wa4X6-2o,"['traders', 'demand', 'increased', 'market', 'monitor', '2020', 'coxs', 'bazar', 'livestock', 'bangladesh', 'low', 'rice', 'markets', 'prices', 'supply']",

'Some Ilish from coastal areas also reached the market. But the restriction against netting fish in the deep sea continues'

Big sized Ilish has flooded Barisal markets in the off season and are being offered at comparatively low prices.

Visiting the Ilish mokam (wholesale market) at Port Road area of the city on Thursday, it was found that huge Ilish weighing average 700-1000 grams were being netted in rivers of the Barisal region, and flooded the market at the start of the rainy season.

After ending the 65-day restriction against netting Ilish on June 30, till July 9, 2020, at least 10,000 maunds of the fish netted from local rivers and estuaries, reached the wholesale market of Barisal, said Nirob Hossain Tutul, secretary of Barisal district Matsya Aratdar Samity.

Altogether 1,246 maunds of the fish on Saturday, 2,328 maunds on Sunday, 1,468 maunds on Monday, more than 4,000 maunds on Tuesday and Wednesday were supplied at the Ilish mokam.

“Some Ilish from coastal areas also reached the market. But the restriction against netting fish in the deep sea continues. After the restriction ends in the third week of July, more Ilish will be available in the market from the first week of August,” he added.

According to the local fishermen, most of these Ilish were netted from the sweet water rivers of Elisha, Kalabdar, Meghna and its branches and estuaries at Char Mamtaz, Shayam Raj, Laharhut of Bhola, Hizla, Mehendiganj, Babuganj, Kaliganj, Ulania of the district.

Fish traders, packers and buyers were found busy supplying ilish by trucks to Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and other areas of the country at relatively cheaper price compared to previous year.

Barisal Port Road wholesale Ilish market trader Ujjal Das said that a huge supply of big Ilish in the last seven days has also made the price cheaper than the same season last year.

Now, the fish are selling at Tk 800 for over one kilogram in weight. Those below 1000 gram sell at the rate of Tk 650-700. Previous year it was sold at Tk 1,200 and Tk 800 respectively, he said.

On Thursday, the price of per maund of sweet-water IlIsh weighing 800-800 grams was Tk22,000 to 23,000; 800-1200 grams was Tk 23,000 to 25,000; and 1300-1500 grams was Tk 25,000 to 28,000.

The price of Ilish netted in the sea was priced at Tk 1,500-2,500 less per maund than the Ilish netted from sweetwater river.

Usually the Ilish season starts from August and reaches its peak in October.

“We do not know the reason as to how such large fishes got caught during this off-season,” said Shah Alam, an Ilish trader.

Hasan Mia, a fisherman, said he netted 20 maunds of Ilish from Elisha River in Bhola district.

Dr.Bimal Chandra Das, district fishery officer (Ilish), said that the government's efforts to protect Jatka (Ilish fries less than 10 inches in length) for ensuring safe breeding in the sanctuary is increasing Ilish production and making it available during off season.

Anisur Rahman, Ilish researcher and chief scientific officer of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) at Chandpur centre, said the main Ilish season is from August to October.","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2018/09/watermarked/335676/1594627372655hilsha-featured-1536435802140.jpg,"['tk', 'season', 'big', 'lower', 'barisal', 'netted', 'market', 'restriction', 'price', 'maunds', 'grams', 'prices', 'floods', 'fish', 'ilish', 'sized']",

SYLHET: The extent of damage to the roads in Sunamganj district, by the last week's flood has been estimated to be over Tk 800 million, official sources informed.

A number of important roads at some places had already been washed away or got damaged severely, causing suffering to the pedestrians as well as the vehicles of all types. The district town's road link with three upazilas-Jamalganj, Tahirpur and Doarabazar has been disrupted.

Jamalganj upazila has been cut off with the Jamalganj-Kathoir road at Ujjalpur and the Noagaon-Katakhali area on Doarabazar-Sunamganj road has been washed away by the gushing waters. The damage to about 100- km of LGED roads has been estimated preliminarily to be at Tk 600 million, an official informed.

Damage to the five different roads belonging to Roads & Highways (R & H) would be worth over Tk 200 million, said an official. The loss was due to the floods, caused by the excessive rains coupled with rolling of waters from the upstream in the Meghalayan hills in India.

The roads include Biswambharpur-Kachirgati, Niamatpur-Tahirpur, Sunamganj-Jamalganj, Sunamganj-Doarabazar and Chhatak- Jawabazar roads. The major damage was caused to 11- km area while at places the roads were either breached or washed away. The cost for repairing these roads may be about taka 210 million, the official said.

Sub-Divisional Engineer of the R&H, Sunamganj Kazi Nazrul Islam said a damage report in this regard had already been sent to the higher authority.

Meanwhile, UNB adds from Sherpur: Narayankhola Dakshin Primary School, an old school in Nakla upazila of sherpur, is being gobbled up by the Mrigi River.

River erosion has taken a severe turn in the area. Although the Water Development Board is placing geobags, already one third area of the school has been eaten up by the river, said Shamsun Nahar, headmistress of the school.

Delowar Hossain, deputy assistant engineer of WDB, said they have started placing 8,500 geobags.

More than one million people have been marooned in Nepal, Bangladesh and India, while hundreds of thousands have fled their homes for higher ground.

Indian officials said floods and mudslides killed 16 more people in the country’s north-east, raising the death toll in the country to 93.

Nepal reported at least 117 deaths over the past month and Bangladesh reported three.

Vast tracts are still underwater, with 26 of the state’s 33 districts badly affected.

Authorities rescued about 4,000 people trapped by the surging floodwaters in various parts of Assam, said M.S. Mannivanan, chief of the state Disaster Management Authority.

About 36,000 people whose homes were destroyed or submerged have taken shelter in nearly 300 government-run relief camps, he said.

The floods also inundated most of India’s Kaziranga National Park, home to an estimated 2,500 rare one-horned rhinos, Indian authorities said.

In the eastern state of Bihar, at least nine rivers swollen by heavy downpours in Nepal rose beyond their danger levels and inundated many villages.

One of them, the Gandak River, swept away the connecting roads of a newly built multimillion-dollar bridge in Bihar’s Gopalganj district, disrupting transportation in the area.

Nepal’s Home Ministry said 117 people have died in the Himalayan nation in monsoon-related incidents.

It said the rains triggered landslides in mountainous areas and flooding in the southern plains.

At least 47 people were reported missing and 126 have been injured in the past month, it said.

In Bangladesh, the Ministry of Disaster and Relief said at least three people have died and more than one million people have been marooned since floods hit the country late last month.

Officials said heavy rainfall and the onrush of river waters from upstream India has caused havoc in Bangladesh, a delta nation of 160 million people that is criss-crossed by 230 rivers.

Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said on Thursday that flooding could worsen at the beginning of next week because of growing devastation in the vast region along the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers.

It said the situation would remain unstable over the next two weeks, causing further suffering for affected people.

65,65,FL-2020-000166-BGD,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistan’s flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to “manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle”, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this ‘annual surprise’ presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bang­la­desh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacue­­es, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

The flooding, which was triggered by heavy rains that caused three rivers to overflow, began on Monday evening and has since affected more than 4,000 residents of six subdistricts in North Luwu.

Raditya Jati, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said on Wednesday that mud covering the main road into North Luwu district had blocked access to affected areas.

“The latest update from National Search and Rescue Agency 16 people dead and we are looking for 23 people,” Jati said.

In one village, photographs showed a damaged house and a truck partially submerged under thick mud, while a runway at a local airport was also swamped by mud and debris.

“I hope we will be united in our recovery efforts,” Nurdin Abdullah, the governor of South Sulawesi, said on Kompas TV.

Indonesia frequently suffers from floods and landslides particularly during the rainy season, though the situation is often made worse by the cutting down of forests.

In January, flooding killed 66 people in the capital, Jakarta, amid some of the heaviest rain since records began.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7b5189c179784358ab28990cb9d36df6_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['missing', 'landslides', 'kill', 'flash', 'truck', 'submerged', 'sulawesi', 'village', 'mud', '23', 'search', 'north', 'affected', 'indonesia', 'floods', 'south', '16']",

“With sharp rise in water level, the Teesta was flowing 28cm above the danger mark at Dalia point in Nilphamari district at 6 pm today,” Executive Engineer of Teesta Barrage division of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Md. Rabiul Islam told BSS.

Some low-lying and char areas of four upazilas in Nilphamari and other areas of adjoining Lalmonirhat districts again went under floodwaters as the Teesta river again crossed its danger mark this evening.

The BWDB official said water levels of all major rivers marked rises following onrush of huge water amid heavy monsoon rains from the upper catchment in India in the basin during the last 24 hours till at 9 am today.

The rising trend in water levels of major rivers might continue during the next 72 hours and the Dharla may also cross the danger mark in the next 24 hours.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) of BWDB, heavy rains might continue in northern Bangladesh and adjoining northeastern Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, Bihar and West Bengal during the next 72 hours.

During the past 24 hours till 9am, 551mm rainfall was recorded at Cherrapunji, 120mm at Shillong, 297mm at Pasighat, 99mm at Dhubri, 154mm at Goalpara and 50mm at Jalpaiguri points of the northwestern Indian states in the upstream.

Besides, 103mm rainfall was recorded at Chilmari in Kurigram, 58mm at Kawnia in Rangpur and 53mm at Gaibandha monitoring points of BWDB during the same period.

Due to huge onrush of water from the upstream, water levels of the Dharla rose by 18cm at Kurigram, Brahmaputra rose by 15cm at Noonkhawa and 10cm at Chilmari points during the last 24 hours till 9am today.

Besides, water levels of the river Jamuna rose by 11cm at Fulchhari, 6cm at Bahadurabad, 4cm at Sariakandi, 2cm at Kazipur and 4cm at Sirajganj points in Sirajganj during the period.

The Dharla was flowing only 24cm below the danger mark at Kurigram, Brahmanpara 43cm at Noonkhawa and 31cm at Chilmari and Ghaghot 50cm below the danger mark at Gaibandha points at 9 am.

During the same period, the Jamuna was flowing only 11cm below the danger mark at Fulchhari in Gaibandha, 21cm at Bahadurabad in Jamalpur, 27cm at Sariakandi in Bogura, 35cm at Kazipur and 39cm at Sirajganj points.

While talking to BSS, Chief Engineer for Rangpur Zone of BWDB Jyoti Prosad Ghosh said water levels of the Dharla, Teesta, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers might continue to rise further during the next 72 hours to cause a flood situation again in the basin.

“We’re closely monitoring the situation round the clock and ready to take immediate steps to repair any damages or breached flood control structures on an emergency basis anywhere in all eight districts of Rangpur division,” he said.

“All flood control embankments and structures are remaining safe in the BWDB’s Rangpur zone where riverbank protection works are continuing at most of the 52 vulnerable points in Lalmonirhat, Kurigram and Gaibandha districts,” Ghosh added.

68,68,FL-2020-000166-BGD,High-Tide ‘Nuisance’ Flooding to Continue to Grow and Plague U.S. Communities: NOAA - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/07/16/575715.htm,"Coastal communities in the U.S. continued to see record-setting high-tide flooding last year, forcing their residents and visitors to deal with flooded shorelines, streets and basements — a trend that is expected to continue into 2021. The elevated water levels affected coastal economies, tourism and crucial infrastructure like waste and stormwater systems, according to a new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) report.

“Sea level rise flooding of U.S. coastlines is happening now, and it is becoming more frequent each year,” the report says.

According to NOAA, evidence of a rapid increase in sea level rise related flooding started to emerge about two decades ago and it is now very clear. “This type of coastal flooding will continue to grow in extent, frequency, and depth as sea levels continue to rise over the coming years and decades,” the report concludes.

The report, 2019 State of High-Tide Flooding and 2020 Outlook, documents changes in high-tide flooding patterns from May 2019 to April 2020 at 98 NOAA tidal gauges along the U.S. coast. The report also gives a flooding outlook for these locations for the coming meteorological year, May 2020 to April 2021, and projections for the next several decades.

High-tide flooding, often referred to as “nuisance” or “sunny day” flooding, is increasingly common due to years of relative sea level increases. It occurs when tides reach anywhere from 1.75 to 2 feet above the daily average high tide and start spilling onto streets or bubbling up from storm drains. As sea level rise continues, damaging floods that decades ago happened only during a storm now happen more regularly, such as during a full-moon tide or with a change in prevailing winds or currents, according to NOAA.

“America’s coastal communities and their economies are suffering from the effects of high tide flooding, and it’s only going to increase in the future,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, acting director of NOAA’s National Ocean Service.

According to the report, U.S. coastal communities saw a median flood frequency of four days in 2019, just shy of the record set last year. However, 19 locations along the East and Gulf coasts set or tied records where rapidly increasing trends in high tide flooding have emerged.

In 2019, the Southeast saw a threefold increase in flooding days compared to the year 2000. For example, Charleston, S.C., had 13 days where flooding reached damaging levels, compared to only two days typical in 2000. Along the Western Gulf, percentage increases were the highest, greater than 5-fold. In Texas, Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi had 21 and 18 flooding days in 2019, and in 2000 those locations would typically only experience about one and three days, respectively.

“As a Chesapeake Bay resident, I see the flooding first hand and it is getting worse. Records seem to be set every year,” said William Sweet, Ph.D., an oceanographer for NOAA’s National Ocean Service and lead author of the report. “Communities are straddled with this growing problem. Fortunately, NOAA’s tide gauge network is keeping a close watch and helping us provide guidance about the disruptive flooding that is likely next year and for decades to come.”

Sweet and his co-authors project that from May 2020 to April 2021, the national high tide flood frequency is expected to accelerate, with U.S. coastal communities seeing an average of 2 to 6 days of flooding in the coming year. Communities along the northeast and western Gulf coasts are projected to see even more days of flooding.

By 2030, long-term projections show seven to 15 days of high-tide flooding for coastal communities nationally. By 2050, that rises to 25 to 75 days, suggesting high tide flood levels may become the new high tide. These long term outlooks are based on the range of relative sea level rise, using 2 scenarios of the Fourth National Climate Assessment considered more likely to occur by 2030 and 2050 – Intermediate Low and Intermediate.

NOAA maintains ocean observing infrastructure, including more than 200 permanent water level stations on the U.S. coasts and Great Lakes.

69,69,FL-2020-000166-BGD,UK Plans to Spend $6.6 Billion on Building Flood Defenses Through 2027 - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/07/14/575426.htm,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposed 5.2 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) of spending on flood defenses through 2027 as his government seeks to protect hundreds of thousands of British homes.

Under the plan, billed as “the most comprehensive in a decade,” the UK will build about 2,000 new flood and coastal defenses to better protect about 336,000 properties, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in an emailed statement. Some 170 million pounds of spending will be accelerated to push forward on “shovel-ready” projects this year and next, it said.

The UK has been beset by a series of floods in recent years, including inundations in northern England in the run-up to December’s general election, when Johnson was criticized by the opposition Labour Party for his “woeful” response.

“Last winter I saw for myself the misery and upheaval that flooding can bring to lives and livelihoods and I said we would do more to help people,” Johnson said in the statement. “This long-term plan will help push back the flood waters and protect hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses and livelihoods.”

Under the plans, the UK’s Flood Re insurance program will also be modified to allow claims to include the installation of flood resilience measures as well as repairs for affected properties.

The government will put 200 million pounds into drainage techniques that make use of nature and restore habitats, according to the statement.

“For every pound spent improving protection from flooding and coastal erosion, we avoid around 5 pounds of property damages,” Environment Agency Chairman Emma Howard Boyd said. “The long-term commitments announced today will make homes, businesses and infrastructure more resilient to the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis.”

Stature matters to plants. Short crops can carry more grain without bending under their own weight—a key trait that helped power the Green Revolution in the 1960s. But tall plants are better at surviving long floods. Now, researchers have found two genes that together help control the height of rice plants: one that accelerates the elongation of the stem and another that acts as a brake. If the system is similar in other plants, scientists say it could be useful in the breeding of many kinds of crops.

“This could be one more great tool in the toolbox,” says Julia Bailey-Serres, a rice biologist at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new research.

In the mid–20th century, plant breeders typically selected for wheat and rice varieties with short stems; these plants devoted more resources to grain and were less likely to fall over in heavy wind or rain. Biologists later discovered that these varieties, at certain times in their development, produce less of a hormone called gibberellic acid (GA) or can’t respond to its signals to elongate their stems. Side effects of those mutations can include young plants that sometimes emerge from the ground too soon in drought-prone regions.

Plant molecular geneticist Motoyuki Ashikari of Nagoya University and colleagues have been studying rice varieties that survive long, deep floods by growing taller—and quickly, if need be, up to 25 centimeters per day. So-called “deep-water rice” is grown in delta areas, mainly in Southeast Asia where slow seasonal floods can reach 1 meter or deeper. Previous work had shown that when plants are submerged, ethylene gas accumulates in their tissues and triggers GA production. Ashikari and his colleagues wanted to know how GA coaxes stems to grow in deep-water varieties of rice.

The team compared the DNA of one species of deep-water rice with another rice variety that can only grow in shallow water. They soon located the two genes, which they dubbed ACE1 (accelerator of internode elongation) and DEC1 (decelerator of internode elongation). Greenhouse experiments showed what the genes did: In deep-water rice, ACE1 turns on when plants are covered in water, stimulating cell division in their stems and helping them grow, the researchers report this week in Nature . But a typical shallow-water variety, which has a mutation in ACE1, did not lengthen its stem when flooded.

In other experiments, the team showed that DEC1 suppresses stem growth. DEC1 was active in the shallow-water variety, and it stayed active when those plants were flooded, essentially keeping the brakes on stem growth. In contrast, when deep-water rice was exposed to flooding, the brakes were lifted: DEC1 stopped expressing, further allowing for stem growth.

If plant breeders or molecular biologists can control those two genes, they might be able to adjust plant height without having to modify GA levels—perhaps even in crops other than rice—says Laura Dixon, a plant biologist at the University of Leeds. That means GA would continue to influence other parts of the plant normally. The two new genes could act like a simple “dimmer switch” for plant height, says Susan McCouch, a rice biologist at Cornell University, who was also not involved in the research.

The two genes also exist in sugarcane, barley, and the well-studied grass Brachypodium distachyon. They might occur widely in other agriculturally important grasses, Ashikari believes. Another important crop, corn, has an equivalent to ACE1, but it has a gene that only partially resembles DEC1. Still, the range of species with the two genes makes the new discovery “supersignificant,” McCouch says.

The genes might help rice breeders improve low-yield varieties that can already cope with seasonal flooding—or engineer new ones from productive shorter varieties. If this approach works in other plants, it could even help engineer flood-proof crops for areas experiencing more frequent flooding because of climate change, including the U.S. Midwest, Bailey-Serras says. Such efforts would depend entirely on whether the genes in the target crops are responsive, but, “It would make a heck of a lot of difference to the farmer.”","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/rice_1280p_0.jpg?itok=HHv6OJHS,"['control', 'genes', 'height', 'plants', 'deepwater', 'ga', 'dec1', 'floodproof', 'rice', 'stem', 'crops', 'lead', 'plant', 'university', 'varieties']",

The 306 Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar were put on Bhashan Char island in April after being taken off two boats trying to traffic them to Malaysia.

Their plight has been taken up by the United Nations, an international rights group, and community leaders, who want them moved to more established refugee camps on the mainland.

""They will stay at Bhasan Char until they are repatriated to Myanmar,"" Mohammed Khorshed Alam Khan, administrator for the district covering the island, told AFP.

He said the refugees are well taken care of and have better facilities than in the overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar where 700,000 Rohingya fled in 2017 to escape a Myanmar military clampdown.

In April, Bangladesh authorities said the Rohingya would be kept on the island in order to stop the spread of coronavirus in the sprawling refugee camps.

But Human Rights Watch (HRW) questioned that motivation and said the refugees were not being treated well.

""Bangladesh authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to detain refugees on a spit of land in the middle of a churning monsoon sea while their families anxiously pray for their return,"" said Brad Adams, the organisation's Asia representative.

He also asked why Bangladesh authorities were not giving aid workers access to the island settlement.

A Rohingya leader from the Cox's Bazar camps said relatives of those on the island wanted to hold talks with Bangladesh's refugee commissioner.

""We request the authorities to send our children to our families,"" said Mohib Ullah, head of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, which lobbies for the Rohingya.

HRW said it had received reports that refugees on Bhashan Char had little freedom of movement or adequate access to food, safe water and medical care.

A government official involved with the case rejected the criticism but admitted some refugees wanted to be reunited with their families.","Fri, 10 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/04/17/137184-px0zljgf.jpg,"['families', 'island', 'authorities', 'taken', 'rights', 'leave', 'refugees', 'char', 'bangladesh', 'refugee', 'rohingya', 'myanmar', 'cant']",

Large areas in Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar and Malda are either flooded or waterlogged.

In Jalpaiguri, around 30,000 people in 30 panchayats in Sadar, Malbazar and Maynaguri blocks are affected by the overflowing Teesta and some other rivers.

Thousands of people have been shifted to safer places. “Unprotected areas (without embankments) have been flooded by the rivers as water levels have increased during the past three days due to incessant rainfall. We are keeping a watch. BDOs have been asked to extend all possible aid to people,” said Abhishek Tiwary, Jalpaiguri district magistrate.

On Monday, the DM held a meeting with the BDOs to ask them to ensure that water is pumped out from the areas to prevent the outbreak of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and maintain social distancing in relief shelters to prevent spreading of Covid-19.

In Cooch Behar, villages in Tufanganj subdivision and in some blocks of Dinhata subdivision have been inundated by the raging rivers. Rain led to waterlogging in a number of wards in Cooch Behar town.

Around 800 persons have been shifted to 24 flood shelters in Tufanganj, Arabinda Ghosh, the SDO said.

“In Tufanganj town, Raidak river flowing above danger level has flooded some wards and adjoining villages. Also, some villages near the India-Bangladesh border in Dinhata subdivision are flooded,” said an official.

76,76,FL-2020-000166-BGD,Stanford researcher finds lead in South Asian turmeric and jumpstarts a bigger movement | Stanford King Center on Global Development - Stanford University News,https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/news/stanford-researcher-finds-lead-south-asian-turmeric-and-jumpstarts-bigger-movement,"

By Krysten Crawford

Jenna Forsyth had a hunch. Pregnant women in rural Bangladesh were showing higher-than-expected levels of lead in their blood—and nobody knew why. Lead, a devastating neurotoxin that is especially harmful to children’s cognitive development, costs the country an estimated $6 billion a year in lost GDP.

Likely culprits for lead contamination included rice, pesticides, food cans, and even clay fragments that expectant mothers chew on to alleviate nausea. Forsyth had another idea, based on a small study of Bangladeshi children that she had read: turmeric, the yellow-hued spice found in curries and other South Asian foods and prized worldwide as a health supplement.

Forsyth, then a Stanford doctoral student in environment and resources, thought there might be something to the turmeric theory. With the encouragement of Stephen Luby, her adviser and a Stanford professor of medicine, she ran with her suspicion—even as lead experts repeatedly voiced their doubts. They pulled together a team of Stanford experts and, with financial support from the Stanford King Center on Global Development, set out to solve the problem of lead exposure in rural Bangladesh.

Five years later, Forsyth’s doggedness is paying off.

In a pair of peer-reviewed studies, published last fall in Environmental Research and Environmental Science & Technology, Forsyth and her collaborators show that turmeric is a key contributor to lead levels in the blood of rural Bangladeshis and that the problem arises when some processors, unaware of the health risks, add a color-enhancing industrial pigment to make their product more attractive to buyers. Their findings followed earlier research confirming that lead levels in pregnant women in Bangladesh were elevated.

As news of Stanford’s discoveries spread, the response was swift. Bangladesh’s prime minister vowed to control imports of the added pigment, lead chromate. The country’s food safety officials began issuing fines to wholesalers and distributed 50,000 posters that were designed with the Stanford team’s input and sought to educate the public about lead risk in turmeric.



Jenna Forsyth

Outside of Bangladesh, Forsyth connected with public health representatives from around the world who had evidence that adulterated spices were responsible for higher-than-expected lead levels among South and Central Asians living at home and abroad. Anxious consumers contacted Forsyth directly and flocked to a Reddit discussion. Small U.S. spice purveyors sought her input on ways to make the turmeric supply chain more transparent.

Now there are early signs that heightened public awareness—and government action—about turmeric are having an impact at points of sale. Turmeric samples collected by research partners in Bangladesh before her studies became public had found that nearly 50 percent contained higher than expected levels of lead—16 percent of those had exceedingly high levels. A few months later, in early 2020, fresh turmeric samples tested for lead showed a precipitous drop: only 5 percent contained above-normal amount of lead and, of those, 1 percent had concentrations that were off the charts.

Forsyth cautions that the sample results are preliminary and that plans for additional testing are on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible, she says, that the decrease will not hold up over time. Still, she is optimistic that awareness will lead to changes that are meaningful and permanent.

“The problem of adulterated spices, especially in lower and middle-income countries, has been going on for so long,” says Forsyth, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment. “Now we have proof that links lead in spices to lead levels in humans. People can’t sweep this under the rug anymore.”

An ‘enormously bad actor’

The real-world impacts may just be beginning. Forsyth is now part of an expanded initiative at the King Center to design market innovations to reduce lead exposure more broadly in Bangladesh and possibly beyond. This includes not only turmeric, but also another major source of poisoning: recycled lead acid batteries, which are increasingly used to power rickshaws and solar panels in Bangladesh and are cheaper alternatives to brand new ones. Much of the country’s battery recycling happens informally and under incredibly unsafe conditions.

When Forsyth and her team sampled 70 children living near an abandoned recycled battery site, every one of them had exorbitant levels of lead in their blood, according to Forsyth. “We don’t have evidence of any battery recyclers operating safely in Bangladesh,” she says. Exposure can be short-lived and still have dangerous, long-term effects.

The lead initiative has attracted top Stanford scholars from across multiple disciplines—including medicine, environmental science, engineering, business, law, and design thinking—as well as officials from leading NGOs, government officials, and other researchers in Bangladesh. With support from the King Center, the team is working on, among other solutions, easier ways to detect adulterated turmeric and cheaper alternatives to processing the spice so it better retains its bright yellow color.



Steve Luby

The problem they are trying to address is global, but it is most damaging to lower income countries, where 90 percent of children with elevated blood levels live. The metal irreversibly damages the brain and permanently lowers IQ. It also increases the risk of heart disease and strokes and has been associated with depression, panic disorders, and difficulty with mood regulation.

“Lead is just an enormously bad actor,” says Luby, who is a faculty affiliate at the King Center. The global economy, he says, loses an estimated $1 trillion a year from lead’s cognitive impacts alone.

Practical solutions, global impacts

In Bangladesh, lead-contaminated turmeric appeared after a 1988 flood damaged crops and led to a sustained increase in imports from India. To compete, Bangladeshi processors began adding lead chromate, which cheap and easy to do and ensured a brilliant yellow product in years with heavy rains.

“The color of turmeric powder is not necessarily indicative of its quality, but consumers don’t always know this,” says Forsyth. With help from Scott Fendorf, a Stanford professor and a King Center faculty affiliate, and his researchers at the Department of Earth System Science, she was able to match blood lead levels to turmeric using isotope analysis.

One solution to consumers’ misconception, then, is to educate them about turmeric quality and the dangers of lead chromate. A team led by Stanford Professor of Bioengineering Manu Prakash is also developing low-cost technology that relies on density separation and centrifugation to identify lead chromate, which is invisible to the human eye. Using just a handheld device, health officials could better spot adulterated turmeric across the supply chain.

But a fix also requires helping suppliers through incentive-compatible approaches. Jeff Wood, a Stanford lecturer in mechanical engineering, will soon be working with undergraduate students to adapt a low-cost root dehydrator that previous students developed to improve large-scale chili pepper processing in India. Imagine mini solar greenhouses, but with advanced features including water thermal storage.

Wood says that, if successful, the concept would preserve turmeric’s color and quality. Processing would also take less time and be less labor-intensive. “We think we can improve turmeric processing in ways that are culturally sensitive, efficient, and inexpensive,” says Wood, who teaches a course that allows undergraduate seniors to work on real-world problems.

Erica Plambeck, a professor at the Graduate School of Business, is pulling together a team of students to develop supply-chain innovations both for turmeric processing and battery recycling. Among other steps, they are working to educate rickshaw owners and other users about the benefits of longer-lasting, higher-quality batteries. They also see an opportunity to raise awareness within Bangladesh’s powerful garment manufacturing industry about the impact that lead poisoning can have on workers, through turmeric consumption or proximity to battery recycling centers.

If successful, the lead initiative’s multi-pronged approach could extend across South Asia and to other developing regions experiencing especially high concentrations of lead contamination. Since 2011, there have been nine turmeric recalls worldwide targeting spice exports from Bangladesh and India. Batteries of all kinds, meanwhile, account for 80 percent of lead used globally.

“We are confident,” says Luby, “that we can solve these problems through incentive-compatible approaches that benefit not only Bangladesh, but also the world.”","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/sites/all/themes/povdev/favicon.ico,"['processing', 'king', 'stanford', 'levels', 'bigger', 'researcher', 'forsyth', 'asian', 'turmeric', 'finds', 'south', 'bangladesh', 'jumpstarts', 'team', 'lead', 'center', 'movement']",

The pandemic and the need for social distancing have also constrained the responses to cyclones, floods and other climate-related disasters.

Nevertheless, the pandemic also brings opportunities – for directing economic stimulus packages towards investments in disaster-resilient infrastructure and services that will support a greener and more productive future.

COVID-19 has swept the globe. As of June 2020, it had infected more than 11 million people, and killed around 533,000. South Asia accounted for around 8.5 per cent of confirmed cases and 4.2 per cent of the deaths. And the economic fallout arising from lockdowns and social distancing has pushed the sub-region’s economies into recession.

From March 2020, governments across South Asia imposed national lockdowns and other stringent measures to contain the spread of the pandemic and save lives. But this also disrupted supply chains and caused sudden drops in demand, pushing national economies into recessionary spirals. In South Asia, COVID-19-related measures could drive more than 130 million people into extreme poverty.

Converging crises

At the same time, families struggling to cope with COVID-19 remain exposed to climaterelated disasters. In May 2020 India and Bangladesh were struck by Amphan – the most powerful cyclone in 20 years, which claimed over 100 lives and destroyed the homes and livelihoods of thousands of families. Then in June, cyclone Nisarga hit the west coast of India. In addition, during the spring there had been swarms of desert locusts in South-West Asia. And in June there were floods in the Indian state of Assam.

Climate-related disasters have different risk pathways from COVID-19, but they can intersect and converge with the pandemic in complex and destructive ways. Many communities are exposed to both, and the long-term consequences can be similar – damage to people’s health and livelihoods and their prospects of escaping poverty.

How can governments respond to these cascading and converging crises? Faced with the pandemic, many countries declared states of emergency that closed schools, offices, places of worship and restaurants and locked down other public places. Many activities and business subsequently restarted but with limitations on activities that involve physical contacts or movements of people. These restrictions have also applied to disaster response measures which have also needed to ensure social distancing.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1526810-Policy%20brief_when%20crises%20converge_v1%20%284%29.png?itok=BW07YGgB,"['responding', 'distancing', 'natural', 'asia', 'million', 'covid19', 'disasters', 'crises', 'pandemic', 'world', '2020', 'social', 'south', 'places', 'converge', 'measures']",

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet decided Tuesday to use 2.2 billion yen ($20.5 million) from Japan's reserve funds for fiscal 2020 to support areas hit hard by torrential rain and flooding this month.

The government will use the emergency money to mainly help disaster-affected small businesses as well as the agricultural, forestry and fisheries industries in the southwestern region of Kyushu, including Kumamoto Prefecture where more than 60 people have died, and other areas, officials said.

Finance Minister Taro Aso told a press conference after the Cabinet approval that the money will be used to deliver ""supplies essential to people's lives and livelihoods"" such as water, food and emergency cardboard beds to ad hoc shelters, and face masks, without waiting for local municipalities to request such help.

The torrential rain struck a wide area of Kyushu Island and western and central regions for about a week from July 3, with the nationwide death toll topping 70 as of Tuesday, authorities said.

Abe instructed government officials on Monday to compile a rescue package worth more than 400 billion yen by the end of this month for devastated areas, after he visited Kumamoto Prefecture the same day.

To boost recovery, the Cabinet designated the downpours a special natural disaster, facilitating extensions for completing official procedures such as renewing a driver's license and business licenses.

In total, 61 municipalities in Kumamoto and five of the country's other 46 prefectures benefit from the relief measures, which the government implemented for previous large-scale disasters such as heavy rain and flooding in western Japan in 2018, and last year's Typhoon Hagibis.

The government's initial budget for the fiscal year has set aside 500 billion yen as a reserve fund, apart from an 11.5 trillion yen fund for measures to fight the new coronavirus pandemic which was earmarked by the country's two supplementary budgets of more than 50 trillion yen in total for fiscal 2020.

Assam is currently reeling from a devastating flood with over 54 lakh people in 30 of the state's 33 districts affected. As many as 81 people have lost their lives due to the floods so far. Many people are stranded and rescue operations are underway.

The floods don't affect just human life but also the animals. An area of 85 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat has been submerged into water and this has led to a crisis on the survival of protected wild species.

So far, 96 animals have died and 132 animals have been rescued in Kaziranga National Park.

In the present situation, there is a huge crisis for animals. A variety of campaigns are being run for animals but the situation in Assam will take time to recover.

According to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger mark at several places. In Assam, 30 districts are reeling under flood and more than 54 lakh people are affected. NDRF teams are also continuously conducting rescue operations.

Meanwhile, Assam has recorded 22,981 cases, of which 10,503 have been reported from the Guwahati city alone. The total number of people who died due to COVID-19 stands at 53.

Moreover, a fire that broke out at the Oil India's gas well in Assam's Tinsukia district in May has damaged the gas well and is spewing gas uncontrollably for the last 54 days.

New Delhi: As floods continue to ravage the state of Assam, killing 97 people and affecting over 35 lakh others — a major fatality this year has been the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.

Nearly 85 per cent of the park’s total area has been submerged by the relentless Brahmaputra river and 96 animals have died as a result, according to the daily flood report released by park authorities Saturday.

While floods are an annual occurrence in the state of Assam, the past two years have proven especially worrisome for the national park. Almost the entire park has submerged for the second year in a row, putting the survival of many endangered species at peril.

According to park director P. Shivkumar, the water levels crossed the ‘danger’ mark this year, which is proving to be a huge problem for several animals, especially young calves.

Assam Chief Minister Sarabanda Sonowal also visited the Kaziranga Park to assess the flood situation Thursday.

“Assessed the situation in #KazirangaNationalPark as vast areas of the world heritage site are currently submerged in flood water. Forest officials, with assistance of civil admin, police and other agencies, providing adequate food and veterinary services to the affected animals,” tweeted Sonowal.

Several animals at risk in Kaziranga

Officials at the Kaziranga National Park have been carrying out relief measures for the past few weeks and 132 animals have been rescued by them.

This included an endangered female rhino calf that was rescued Tuesday and is currently at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC). The park is home to 2,200 Indian one-horned rhinoceros, which accounts for approximately two-third of their total world population.

It is also a breeding ground of elephants, wild water buffalo, swamp deer and an increasing population of tigers.

“In upper Assam, the flood situation is a rising trend. As of Monday, it is the sixth highest flood in the history of Kaziranga, the highest one being in 1988. Rescued animals with major injuries and the young ones who are separated from the mother are taken to our rescue centres. Others are released in the highland area,” Shivkumar told ThePrint.

Incidentally, the annual deluge of the Brahmaputra river is actually essential for the park to ensure the animals’ survival, a revitalised grassland, and to ensure the animals move to higher grounds within the park.

The floods also have a regenerative nature that replenish water bodies and maintain its landscape.

However, now, with almost the entire park submerged — for the second year in a row — the animals have nowhere left to go.

This helplessness spreads to the rest of Assam as well. Even though floods occur yearly in Assam, the loss of lives, livelihood and property remains a stark reality.

In the past two months, the state has witnessed two waves of floods that have affected over 35 lakh people in 3,014 villages across Assam. Almost 1.28 lakh hectares of crop area has been damaged by the floods, according to recent government data.

This year, the situation has also been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic that is raging across the country.

The state has also recorded over 19,000 cases of coronavirus and 48 deaths. With numbers steadily increasing, the yearly floods combined with the monsoon could not have come at a worse time.

“Every year we start afresh. This year it is scarier because of Covid-19. Floods just come and ravage everything we have. My ghumti (small shop) broke, my house is damaged. Now, I can only pray that the flood season gets over soon and my family can go back to rebuilding it all again,” 41-year-old Shamsur Ali from the Barpeta district, who was forced to flee to a relief camp, told ThePrint.

According to a daily bulletin by the State Disaster Management Authority, 711 relief camps have been set up across 28 districts in Assam, with 51,421 people occupying them.

CM Sonowal noted that those residing in these relief camps are being supplied with an uninterrupted supply of food grains, drinking water and medical facilities.

“Besides providing quality materials, [I have] instructed district admin to give special attention [to] maintaining hygiene,” he said.

In the Lower Assam district of Goalpara, one of the worst-affected regions, more than 4 lakh people have been affected and the region has set-up 92 relief camps.

“About 259 villages have been affected, and 4.43 lakh people have been affected. Areas are still under water, exact assessment to understand how many families have been completely displaced, total property damaged, crops damaged can only be done after the water subsidies,” Goalpara District Commissioner Varnali Deka told ThePrint.

“This year the situation is grim and the impact has been more, compared to the last few years. The floods have been heavier, lots of roads have been broken, the embankment also broke,” Deka added.

Why Assam floods every monsoon season

The Brahmaputra river cuts through four countries — India, China, Bhutan and Bangladesh — and divides the state of Assam neatly into two halves. The river system consists of multiple channels and water bodies, and a 5,80,000 sq km basin spread,

However, excessive rains over time have left it reeling with multiple lives displaced or lost, as well as villages, crops and basic infrastructure destroyed.

The naturally dynamic and unstable Brahmaputra river deposits vast amounts of silt — brought from Tibet, where it originates — to Assam’s flood plains surrounded by hills. As a result, this causes erosion and floods.

Furthermore, the situation has been worsened by man-made interventions.

Over the past six decades, Assam governments have spent over Rs 30,000 crore on building embankments across the Brahmaputra river.

According to Partha J. Das, who heads the Water, Climate & Hazard Division of Guwahati-based wildlife NGO Aaranyak, these structures “were proposed only as an interim and ad hoc measure for short-term mitigation”.

Additionally, habitation, deforestation and population growth in catchment areas have compounded the problem further.

“The flood situation in Assam is extremely serious, especially in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP). The frequency of floods in KNP has increased in the last couple of years. The Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, have also been inundated by the flood wave,” environmentalist Apurba Ballav Goswami told ThePrint.

“There has to be a long term solution for Assam’s flood situation. Animals are getting displaced, even if they move up to the highlands, there is still a problem with food. Timely action needs to be taken, which I feel could be done better,” Goswami added.

Small shops and vendors of betel leaf have shut their business since the pandemic began

The betel farmers of Rajshahi have been reeling from financial distress, already exacerbated by the nationwide novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19), when recent super cyclone Amphan and current flood struck and made matters worse for them.

Betel-leaf farming plays a vital role towards improving the socio-economic condition of people in many areas of the region as it has gained fame for the crop and its marketing.

As it is more profitable than many other crops for the farmers, its farming and acreage is increasing day-by-day.

But this year,betel vines of the district have been hit hard by flood, storm and rain. The strong winds have battered thousands of betel vines. Thousands of people in Mohanpur, Durapur and Bagmara upazilas of the district are heavily dependent on betel plantation.

Cyclone Amphan also destroyed a thousand hectares of cropland of the district.

Farmers said the amount of losses has been enhanced to a great extent as they are being forced to sell their betel leaf harvest at a lower rate compared to the normal time amid the pandemic situation.

Dabirul Islam, a farmer Mohanpur upazila, said production of the cash crop is very good this year but its retail price has been reduced abnormally in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier, a big size 64-leaf bundle was sold at Tk 70 but it is being sold at Tk 10-15 at present while the small size at Tk 2 to 3 against the previous Tk 50 frustrating the growers badly, he added.

Hasibur Rahman, another farmer of the upazila, said betel leaf could not be exported besides non-coming of traders and business from different areas this year due to the global fallout resulting in abnormal price declining of the crop in local markets.

Farmer Abul Kalam Azad of Halidagachhi village in the upazila said even the farmers are also failing to recoup the harvesting cost of the crop.

Small shops and vendors of betel leaf have shut their business since the pandemic began.

In Bagmara upazila, many of the betel leaf farming plots have become submerged due to the onrush of floodwater from upstream which is also damaging the crop.

According to the sources of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), around 68,976 tons of betel leaf are produced from 4,311 hectares of land in the district every year valued at around Tk 3.61 crore which is higher than the seasonal mango marketing as betel leaf is a year-round crop.

Shamsul Haque, Deputy Director of DAE, Rajshahi, said Mohanpur, Durapur and Bagmara Upazila are the highest betel leaf producing areas in the district and around 69,228 farmers are involved in the farming.

He also said highest betel leaves are produced in Mohanpur upazila and the betel leaf is the main economic crop in upazila.

Entire farmers of Dhurail, Khanpur, Mallikpur and Mohabbatpur villages in the upazila are engaged in the farming, he added.

Living and livelihood conditions of more than one lakh people in the upazilas are dependent on the farming of the cash crop.

Local farmers became interested in betel leaf farming as they have been getting a fair price of the produce in the market for the last couple of years.

Farming of the cash crop has doubled this year only in Mougachhi village under Mohanpur Upazila. More than twenty farmers including Gaziuddin Sheikh, Abdus Salam and Altaf Hossain have set up a new ‘Baraj’ unit of farming this year.

Muhammad Ali, a farmer of Chandapur village under Bagmara Upazila of the district, has become self-reliant through betel leaf farming.

As the first betel leaf grower in his locality, Ali earned fame as a successful farmer in the region. His three sons - Aminul Islam, Abdul Hamid and Ali Hossain extend support to his works earnestly.

By dint of his hard work and relentless efforts towards the betel leaf farming, Ali built a concrete house for the first time in the area. Witnessing his success many of his neighbours became inspired and established ‘Baraj’ and they are now doing well.

Unfortunately, this year’s pandemic situation has brought devastation to the betel leaf farmers together with the promising sector, Haque added.","Sun, 19 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/336360/1595148242149satkhira-betel-1595148125772.jpeg,"['vine', 'tk', 'rajshahi', 'suffer', 'double', 'covid19', 'blow', 'leaf', 'amphan', 'crop', 'pandemic', 'mohanpur', 'farmers', 'betel', 'district', 'upazila', 'farming']",

86,86,FL-2020-000166-BGD,"South Asian farmers are back in the fields despite high costs, labour shortage and a pandemic - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/966753/south-asian-farmers-are-back-in-the-fields-despite-high-costs-labour-shortage-and-a-pandemic,"The Southwest monsoon has arrived in most parts of South Asia and farmers in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal have started planting the summer crop. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the already distressed agriculture sector in these countries in different ways, and the stakes couldn’t be higher for farmers in this cropping season.

Covid-19 has already afflicted more than a million people in the four countries, with infections rising fast in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, latest data shows. South Asia has taken a beating from the lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the virus, and with growth shrinking in the industrial and services sectors, hope is now pinned on adequate monsoon rainfall and farmers gathering a good harvest to breathe life back into the battered economies.

Although the share of agriculture in national Gross Domestic Products varies from 25% in Nepal to 13% in Bangladesh, farming provides a livelihood to the vast majority of the countries’ working populations.

As the pandemic-forced lockdowns disrupted labour mobility and vehicular transportation, farmers have struggled to harvest and sell the winter crop, leading to widespread losses across the subcontinent. “In the past few months, I have fed vegetables from the farm to the livestock as I couldn’t sell them,” said Ishwar Acharya, a farmer from Morang district in eastern Nepal.

Farm inputs

As the summer sowing season approached, scarcities in farm inputs were reported, and prices rose. “Cost of seeds in Jharkhand and Bihar have increased by as much as 15% to 25%, which has led to difficulties for small and marginal farmers,” said Ranchi-based Ashok Kumar of Transform Rural India Foundation, a non-profit that works in the poorest states of India.

Big farmers in India’s breadbasket in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh are better insulated from such price shocks as they are able to place bulk orders in advance, said New Delhi-based Satyabrata Acharyya of Professional Assistance for Development Action, a rural grassroots organisation.

Prices of farm inputs have risen in Southern India as well. However, farmer producer organisations have intervened significantly in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka so that cultivators have not been short on seeds, according to Ravindra Adusimilli of Hyderabad-based Watershed Support Services and Activities Network.

In Pakistan, prices of farm inputs have increased significantly, farmers said. The country imports large amounts of chemicals for fertilisers and pesticides, and the supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic has led to price increases. This will eat into the margins of smallholder and middle farmers, according to Waqas Gondal, a farmer from the southern part of Punjab province.

The government has, however, provided some financial assistance to farmers to buy inputs. Cultivators will also soon get relief in energy costs, which account for 30% of all inputs, according to Khalid Jamil of the National Agriculture Research Centre.

In Nepal, there is an acute scarcity of fertilisers. The Himalayan nation imports nearly all of its chemical fertilisers, mostly from the Middle East and China via India’s ports. Some 50,000 tonnes of fertilisers are stuck in the port of Kolkata and 21,000 tonnes in Kandla’s port in Gujarat, according to Nepal’s farm ministry.

“It will take more than a month to bring the stuck fertilisers,” the ministry said in a press statement. The government aims to sell nearly half a million tonnes of subsidised fertilisers to farmers this year to tide them over the Covid-19 crisis.

“If you ask a supplier for urea, the answer would be, we don’t have it now. If you ask for Diammonium Phosphate, you would be told to wait a couple of weeks,” said Acharya, a farmer from Eastern Nepal. “Only about 25% is provided, and that too after queuing up for two weeks at least.”

Farmers at receiving end

“The worst part is that farmers cannot determine their prices; the middleman does that,” said Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a farmer from Pakpattan district of Punjab province in Pakistan. “And the government has a terrible role in this. It gives zero security to farmers.” Instead of giving farmers a little bit of extra money during the crisis, the government opened the market for importers, he alleged.

To add to the woes, the huge migrant labour force that works in cities returned to their villages and, in the absence of gainful employment, used up precious savings that would have been invested in cultivating the summer crop.

In Pakistan, expectations of farmers who grow rice, corn, cotton and sugar during the monsoon are running low. “Take cotton, our major crop that runs our entire textile industry. In this fiscal year, nothing has been kept aside for cotton,” said Bhandara. “There is no development even though the prime minister had been willing to revive the crop once upon a time.” Even the target of 2.8% of the national budget for agricultural development this fiscal year is lower than usual, he said.

In India and Pakistan, a plague of locusts has further decimated crops. Authorities haven’t ruled out the threat of locusts swarming again in July.

Labour issues

The lockdown in South Asia led to a mass exodus of migrant labourers to villages, which resulted in labour scarcity in some areas and excess in others.

In the poorer states of India such as Jharkhand in the East, which is home to a large number of migrant labourers, the recent influx has led to a surplus. Villages in Bangladesh and Nepal, too, are flush with returned migrants.

While this is good news for landholders, the same cannot be said of temporary farmhands because wages have crashed. In Bangladesh, for instance, farm wages have been rising steadily in the past decade, said Abdur Razzak, a farmer from the Northern district of Rangpur. “It was tough to get adequate numbers of them when it was required,” he said.

The situation has dramatically changed in recent weeks, according to Razzak. “Many of them who migrated from the village to urban areas are returning to villages, so wages have gone down,” he said.

The same holds true in the poorer provinces in eastern India, said Kumar of TRIF.

On the other hand, farmers with large landholdings in the breadbaskets of India and Pakistan are facing a labour shortage. In the Punjab province of India, for instance, farmers’ groups are ferrying farmhands back to the state. Since paddy sowing depends heavily on manual labour, the shortage due to the earlier exodus has led to a rise in wages, which will impact profit margins, farmers say.

Fear of floods

Despite the farming lifeline the monsoon extends to South Asia, it also exacts a heavy price during floods. Although the 2020 Southwest monsoon has just about started, heavy rains are already flooding large parts of Assam, Meghalaya, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal. Some 50 people have been killed in these parts of South Asia, including 23 in Assam and 18 in Nepal.

Farmers in flood-prone Bangladesh are bracing themselves. “In case of Aman, I have been cultivating flood-resistant varieties for two years,” said Akram Hossain, a farmer from Lalmonirhat district in the Teesta river basin. Aman is the principal paddy variety grown in Bangladesh and eastern India at this time of the year.

Farmers in the Indian state of Bihar are less prepared to face floods than they are in normal years. The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed flood-control preparations, with nearly 30% of embankment repair and anti-erosion works incomplete. The state government has just started a Twitter handle through which it is inviting citizens to inform the authorities if any embankment is breached.

“I consider the Nile something I have not parted with since I was born,” al-Ameen said, as workers around him shaped bricks with blistered hands and laid them out to dry in the sun. “I eat from it, I farm with it. And I extract these bricks from it.”

But the labourers on Tuti Island in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, fear a giant dam Ethiopia is building close to the border between the two countries could endanger their livelihood.

They worry the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam upstream could weaken the Blue Nile’s force, putting at risk an industry that locals say provided bricks for some of Khartoum’s first modern public buildings about a century ago.

Pottery makers, farmers and fishermen around the Nile’s convergence share similar concerns, though other residents displaced by flooding last summer see a benefit in a dam that will regulate the powerful river’s waters.

The dam “will stabilise the Nile and we will get less flooding”, said Mutasim al-Jeiry, a 50-year-old potter in a village outside Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, where workers craft jars with clay from the river.

“But on the other hand, we will get less clay and less water. Farmers, brick and pottery makers will be seriously affected,” he predicted.

The residents’ views are a snapshot of the hopes and fears thrown up along the length of the Nile by the vast hydropower project, which has triggered a high-wire diplomatic standoff between Ethiopia and Egypt downstream.

Ethiopia, which says it is finally asserting its right to harness the Blue Nile’s waters to power its economy, promises to start filling the reservoir later this month.

Egypt, which sees a risk to its scarce water supplies, is frantically trying to secure a deal that would guarantee minimum flows from the Blue Nile, the source of about 86 percent of the waters of the Nile, which flows into the Mediterranean.

Sudan’s government says the dam could threaten the safety of some 20 million Sudanese living downstream and damage the country’s flood-plain agricultural system if not built and operated correctly.

But it also sees potential benefits in controlling floods during the rainy season and improving the performance of its own dams.

That ambivalence is echoed in the village of Wad Ramli, 60km (37 miles) downstream from Khartoum, where flooding was especially bad last summer. Some residents whose houses were damaged or destroyed were displaced to canvas tents pitched nearby.

“It is true the Renaissance Dam will lower the Nile’s water levels and prevent flooding,” said Manal Abdelnaay, a 23-year-old living in one of the tents. “However, it will affect farming, and the Wad Ramli area is one that lives off farming.”

On Tuti Island, farmers and landowners are anxious that if the dam saps the river’s strength, there will be less water to irrigate and replenish the soil.

“I came to Tuti in 1988 because the land here is the best for agriculture and close enough to supply markets, and it makes good incomes,” said Mussa Adam Bakr, who farms a plot where vegetable fields back onto citrus and mango groves, next to the brick factory.

“Through the year the Tuti earth produces all sorts of vegetables like potatoes, onions, aubergines,” said Bakr.

Sudan was long overshadowed in the dispute over the dam by its two larger neighbours, but has recently stepped up to broker new negotiations between the three countries.

Its citizens will be watching carefully for any changes in the waters they are so dependent upon.

“A fish out of water will die, it cannot survive,” said Ashraf Hassan, a 45-year-old fish trader in Omdurman. “Us too, we live as part of the water, or around it.”","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/66467ddf2b5b4be5b16a538da9dd9159_8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630,"['giant', 'blue', 'sudan', 'nile', 'flooding', 'water', 'dam', 'fears', 'waters', 'bricks', 'hopes', 'convergence', 'niles', 'tuti', 'summer']",

There are a number of reasons

Health authorities in Bangladesh had increased Covid-19 tests in the past few months, after experts kept on saying that doing so will provide a look into the pandemic’s real situation in the country.

However, the number of daily tests gradually started declining at the end of June due to a number of reasons.

Experts and health officials have said that imposing a fee on tests at government-run facilities and requiring a doctor’s note to get tested are two of those reasons behind the drop.

Since the deadly disease entered the country back in March, 940,524 tests have been conducted in 77 laboratories around the country, until Sunday morning, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

But data shows that the number of tests authorities concerned have conducted in the last 13 days have seen a significant drop.

On June 30, health authorities disclosed that 18,426 tests were conducted around the country since the previous day, and on Saturday, the number of tests in the same period dropped to 11,193.

On Sunday, the number dropped again — to 11,059.

On July 7, the number of tests in a day came down to 13,173; while 15,572 tests were conducted on July 8, 15,632 tests on July 9, and 13,488 tests on July 10.

Earlier, on July 1, 17,875 tests were conducted; 18,362 on July 2, 14,650 on July 3, 14,727 on July 4, 13,988 on July 5, and 14,245 on July 6.

DGHS spokesperson Dr Ayesha Akther told Dhaka Tribune: “There may be several factors contributing to the decline in daily tests.

“[The government] charging for the test, testing facilities requiring to see a doctor’s prescription for the test, flood in different areas of the country, and health workers who are Covid-19 positive going off duty can be some of them.”

She said they were working on addressing these issues and the number of tests will increase again.

Until Sunday morning, according to DGHS, a total of 2,352 people died from Covid-19 around the country while the total number of cases climbed to 183,795.

Nationwide uniform testing must

Prof Dr Nazrul Islam, virologist and former vice-chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, told Dhaka Tribune that increasing the number of Covid-19 tests only in certain areas will not help if the testing is not uniformly distributed.

“For example, if health authorities conduct around 25 tests in each upazila and at least 20 in each hotspot in Dhaka, we will be able to get the real picture,” he said.

Dr Nazrul said health authorities should conduct tests across the country, locate areas where the number of Covid-19 cases is high, and properly isolate the infected patients.

He said the government has decided to charge for the tests, which were free at state-run facilities until the end of June, and because of that ultra-poor people cannot afford it anymore.

“Therefore, these people are probably not going to the testing facilities,” he added.

The virologist recommended engaging more volunteer organizations for collecting samples and running tests, as the state-run health facilities are facing manpower shortage with many health workers down with Covid-19.

The government on June 29 had fixed Tk500 for testing samples collected from home and Tk200 for testing samples collected from suspected patients at government hospitals and booths.

Dhaka Tribune also talked to several civil surgeons of different districts and health workers around the country, who said charging for tests at state-run facilities and making doctor’s prescription required were the major reasons behind people avoiding getting tested, unless it’s an emergency.

Dr MA Matin, the superintendent of Patuakhali 250-bed General Hospital, said he found in the past couple of days that people were not coming to get tested as they used to over the past few months.

Charging for the test could be a reason, he said.

Khulna Civil Surgeon Dr Suzat Ahmad said doctors were prescribing Covid-19 tests only for those suspected patients who they think actually need it.

Meanwhile, people suffering from mild fever and cold were not coming to get tested anymore as the panic among them centring this disease was somehow gradually disappearing, he said.","Sun, 12 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/05/watermarked/335579/1594559269291whatsapp-image-2020-05-21-at-2-39-28-pm-1590052168068.jpeg,"['significant', 'decline', 'country', 'health', 'authorities', 'covid19', 'seeing', 'daily', 'tested', 'conducted', 'bangladesh', 'facilities', 'testing', 'tests', 'number']",

Nitu Bora took a “risk” with an unfamiliar variety of paddy in 2019. A year later, he has inspired a majority of some 1,500 farmers who saw their hard work undone by floods in Assam’s Golaghat district.

According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, this year’s flood since May 22 has affected crop, mainly paddy, on more than 125,097 hectares of land across 25 of the State’s 33 districts.

Nitu Bora’s 0.9-hectare paddy field in Balidua village of Golaghat district’s West Brahmaputra area was flooded too. But unlike that of most other farmers in Assam, his paddy crop of the Ranjit Sub1 variety withstood the deluge.

He had tested waters in July 2019 with the variety – the Sub in its name means submergence – on about 0.2 hectares of his plot.

“I decided to take the risk with the new variety after listening to crop experts. This paddy survived 15 days under water while the flood damaged the common varieties in the rest of my plot,” the 45-year-old farmer said.

He had virtually dragged neighbours Luhit Bora and Babu Bora to the District Agriculture Office in Golaghat town two days after crop specialists had campaigned for adopting Ranit Sub1 and two other flood-tolerant varieties named Swarna Sub1 and Bahadur Sub1.

The other two farmers too used a fraction of their respective plot to invest in seedlings of the flood-resistant paddy collected from the Agriculture Department.

Farmers in flood-prone areas of Assam have been harvesting the water-resistant Swarna Sub1, developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Manila-based International Rice Research Institute, since 2009. But the switchover from traditional varieties of paddy has been slow.

Flood impact study

“We introduced the flood-resistant varieties in 2018 and the 5.6 tonnes of rice per hectare that Nitu Bora harvested was the first flood-impact study, although we cannot compare with the traditional varieties since they were damaged,” said Abhishek Singha, research technician of the Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project (APART).

The Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Services Society headed by bureaucrat Laya Madduri is the coordinating agency for the World Bank-funded project.

“The experiment of the Boras has this year made about 60% of the farmers in the West Brahmaputra area switch to the flood-tolerant paddy. Some 1,500 farmers cultivate on about 950 hectares in this area,” Mr Singha told The Hindu on July 5.

Description of the disaster

On 16 May 2020 over the Indian Ocean Cyclone Amphan was formed and started moving north over the Bay of Bengal, towards north-east India coastal areas and south of Bangladesh. On 20 May, the BMD issued ‘great danger’ signal number 10 for costal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalokathi, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barisal, Laxmipur, Chandpur and their offshore islands and chars1 . Following the great danger signal and evacuation order of the GoB, more than 2.4 million people were moved to 14,636 permanent and temporary shelters in 19 coastal districts before the cyclone hit the country's coast. The cyclone Amphan slammed into the coastal districts of West Bengal, India and then it entered Bangladesh on 20 May evening with wind speed of 150 kmph and caused huge destruction in 26 districts across the country.

According to Need Assessment Working Group (NAWG2) report dated 31 May; approximately 2.6 million people were affected; 205,368 houses were damaged; 55,767 houses were destroyed in the 19 affected districts. Total 26 people lost their lives. In addition to that 40,894 latrines; 18,235 water points; 32,037 hectares of crops and vegetable; 18,707 hector of fish cultivation area; 440 km of road and 76 km of embankment were damaged.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1526762-MDRBD024eu1.png?itok=4enER9t2,"['coastal', 'operation', 'support', 'cyclone', 'million', 'districts', 'volunteers', 'plan', 'total', 'amphan', 'emergency', 'needs', 'update', 'n', 'bangladesh', 'mdrbd024', 'affected', 'dref']",

KOLKATA: While there has been little or no support for the disastrous flood situation in Assam from Indian sports icons, social media witnessed an unlikely sympathiser for the situation in one of the biggest football clubs in the world. Premier League giants Arsenal posted a video on their Instagram account on Friday showing solidarity for the north-eastern state.The less-than-30-second video was short and simple. It had the phrase 'We are with you' flashed onto the screen in English, followed by a repeat of the same in Assamese. Below the video was the message “Stay strong, Assam”.While the northeastern state boasts of a crazy following for football, both local and international, even the most die-hard Arsenal fan in the region had not expected the English giants to send such words of solidarity for a state in the other corner of the world.But the post did open the floodgates of criticism as people all over not only appreciated the message sent by the Gunners but also pointed out the failure of the mainstream Indian celebrities in not coming forward and showing their support of the flood-ravaged people of the state.One of the prominent to bring the matter up was actor Adil Hussain, who hails from Goalpara in the northeastern state.“Arsenal FC #ArsenalFC @Arsenal stands with Assamese People. I don't understand why, then, our Celebrities, Mainstream Media, Cricket Stars are not raising their voices in support of Assamese people! So disappointed with you all,” the actor tweeted on Friday.","Sat, 18 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77029573,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35768,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['state', 'support', 'stands', 'northeastern', 'message', 'celebrities', 'solidarity', 'floodravaged', 'send', 'video', 'assam', 'flood', 'arsenal', 'assamese', 'premier', 'league', 'understand', 'giants']",

95,95,FL-2020-000166-BGD,June 2020: Earth’s third-warmest June on record - Yale Climate Connections,https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/07/june-2020-earths-third-warmest-june-on-record/,"June 2020 was the planet’s third-warmest June since record-keeping began in 1880, said NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, July 13. NASA rated June as tied with 2019 for the warmest June on record. Minor differences in rankings often occur between NOAA and NASA, the result of the different techniques they use to handle data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.

The year-to-date period of January-June was 1.07°C (1.93°F) above the 20th-century average, said NOAA, making it the second-warmest such period on record, just 0.05°C behind the record set in 2016. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2020 has more than a 99.9% chance to rank among the five warmest years on record, and a 36% chance of being the warmest year on record. If so, calendar 2020 would make the past seven years the seven warmest on record.

Earth’s warmest 12-month period on record was July 2019 – June 2020 (tied with a period in 2015-16 when there was a very large El Niño event), according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.

The July 8 forecast from the World Meteorological Organization gave a 24% chance that at least one of the coming five years will have a temperature 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels (the period 1850-1900).

Role of human-caused warming underscored

Global temperature records are more likely to be set during the peak of the solar cycle and during strong El Niño events, because of the extra heat from the tropical Pacific Ocean given up to the atmosphere. The remarkable warmth of 2020 has come in the absence of an El Niño event and during the minimum of one of the weakest 11-year solar cycles in the past century, underscoring the dominant role human-caused global warming has in heating the planet.

Global ocean temperatures during May 2020 were the third-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were also the third warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in June 2020 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the third- or second-warmest in the 42-year record, according to the University of Alabama Huntsville and Remote Sensing Systems, respectively.

Three billion-dollar weather disasters in June 2020, 17 for first half of year

Three billion-dollar weather-related disasters hit the Earth in June, according to the June 2020 Catastrophe Report from insurance broker Aon:

– Torrential June downpours inundated southeast China, leaving 106 people dead and causing at least $5.1 billion in damage. Among the hardest-hit areas were Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, and Chongqing, where more than 250,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. More than 309 river locations reached flood stage, and 891,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) of cropland were submerged.

– Severe thunderstorms in Calgary, Canada on June 13-14 brought damaging hail and flooding, causing damages of $1.25 billion – one of the costliest thunderstorm-related disasters in Canadian history. Thousands of homes and vehicles sustained significant damage and vast areas of agricultural land were severely impacted.

– Drought affected western and northern China, causing damages estimated at $1 billion.

Earth had 17 billion-dollar weather disasters in the first six months of the year, including 10 in the U.S. from severe storms. (The Australian wildfires span the boundary between 2019-2020 and may end up being classified as a 2019 disaster rather than a 2020 disaster).

Here is the 2020 list of the 17 billion-dollar weather disasters through June, listed by dollars of damage, according to Aon:

1. Cyclone Amphan, India and Bangladesh, 5/15 – 5/22, $15 billion, 118 killed

2. Flooding, China, 5/29 – 7/1, $5.1 billion, 106 killed

3. Severe weather, Midwest, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., 4/10 – 4/14, $3.1 billion, 38 killed

4. Severe weather, Midwest, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., 4/6 – 4/9, $2.75 billion, zero killed

5. Windstorm Ciara, Western & Central Europe, 2/9 – 2/10, $2.3 billion, 14 killed

6. Wildfires and heat wave, Australia, 11/8 – 1/17, $2+ billion, 34 killed

7. Severe weather/Nashville tornado, Central and Eastern U.S., 3/2 – 3/5, $2.0 billion, 25 killed

8. Severe weather, Plains, Southeast, and Midwest U.S., 5/16 – 5/21, $1.5 billion, one killed

9. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., 3/27 – 3/30, $1.45 billion, zero killed

10. Severe weather, Australia, 1/18 – 1/20, $1.43 billion, zero killed

11. Severe weather, Rockies, Plains, and Midwest U.S., 5/20 – 5/24, $1.3 billion, two killed

12. Severe weather, Texas, 5/27 – 5/28, $1.3 billion, zero killed

13. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., 2/3 – 2/8, $1.25 billion, five killed

14. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., 1/10 – 1/12, $1.2 billion, 12 killed

15. Flooding, Iran, 2/24 – 4/30, $1.2 billion, 23 killed

16. Severe weather, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., 4/21 – 4/24, $1.1 billion, seven killed

17. Drought, northern and western China, 1/1 – 7/30, $1.0 billion, zero killed

The deadliest weather event of June, monsoon flooding in India, killed 189 people. The deadliest weather event of the first half of 2020 has been flooding in East Africa from the “Long Rain” season, which runs from March through May. More than 500 people died in the floods. Kenya and Rwanda have been the hardest-hit, with 237 and 209 deaths, respectively.

NOAA issues La Niña watch

NOAA issued the year’s first La Niña Watch in its July 9 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have been near-average, falling well short of the 0.5°C below-average threshold for La Niña conditions.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) are calling for neutral conditions to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer. They put the odds of a La Niña’s forming during the autumn or winter between 50 and 55%, with a 50% chance of the event lasting through the winter.

The Tweet below by Steve Bowen of Aon shows U.S. landfalling hurricane activity by phase of ENSO:

For the August-September-October peak of the hurricane season, the odds of El Niño were put at 3%, and the odds of a La Niña event at 50% (an increase from the 30% estimated two months ago). Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be much more active during La Niña conditions than during El Niño conditions, because weaker upper-level winds create less wind shear. During La Niña events, the U.S. East Coast from Georgia to Maine experiences much higher landfall frequency than in ENSO-neutral years, according to a 2007 paper.

Arctic sea ice: third lowest June extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during June 2020 was the third lowest in the 42-year satellite record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The record low for June occurred in 2016. At the end of June 2020, an unusually intense area of high pressure developed over the North Pole, bringing clear skies and record melting of sea ice. By July 5, Arctic sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the date, and record low daily extents have continued through July 13. Late June into early July is typically the period of most rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic.

The sea ice is particularly low along Russia’s Siberian coast, where temperatures in June were more than 5°C (8°F) above average. The Siberian heat reached an extraordinary 38.0°C (100.4°F) at Verkhoyansk, Russia on June 20 – the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic Circle. Verkhoyansk also shares the official Northern Hemisphere record for coldest temperature ever measured: -67.8°C (-90.0°F) on 5 February, 1892.

June heat was also pronounced over Greenland, where a significant melting event began on 21 June and ended on July 3.

Antarctic sea ice extent in June 2020 was slightly below the 1981-2010 average. Research published on June 29 in Nature Climate Change found that the South Pole is one of the most rapidly warming places on the planet, with surface air temperatures rising three times faster than the global average since the 1990s. The authors of that research said it is likely that human-caused warming contributed to the warming, though natural climate fluctuations alone could account for the warming.

The river was flowing 28cm above the danger level at Teesta Barrage point at Dowani area of Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila since 6:00pm today, said Abdul Quader, sub-divisional engineer of Lalmonirhat Water Development Board.

Meanwhile, the water of Dharla River was flowing only two centimetres below danger level at Shimulbari Ghat point yesterday morning, he said.

The Teesta and Dharla rivers' water was rising due to heavy rains and an onrush of water from upstream in India, said Quader, adding that he feared another the onset of another flood.

Abdul Quader said WDB officials are monitoring the situation. All the gates of Teesta Barrage were kept open this afternoon for controlling water flow pressure i.

Meanwhile, char areas and low-lying areas along the rivers have been inundated due to the sudden rise in water level of the river Teesta, our Lalmonirhat correspondent reports quoting the WDB officials.

River water has seeped into the house in these areas, the WDB officials said.

Over one lakh of people in 110 villages under 21 unions of the five upazilas are worried about the flood situation again due to the alarmingly rise of the Teesta river water, they said.

Aklas Uddin,58, a flood victim at Teesta River char Dowani in Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila said the Teesta water started increasing again since this morning.

Jonai Circle Officer Sumbar Chutia informed that over 80,000 populations of 228 villages under the circle have been affected in the flood and the figure might be increased till Sunday.

As per report, flood water has submerged several hundred dwelling houses and crop fields in the affected area besides breaching rural roads and washed out bridge abutments at Berachapori, Bijoypur, Gali, Borong, Ramdhon and Misamara areas thereby creating communication problems.

Around 130 people, who were taking shelter on the river dyke at Bera Bengali gain of Bahir-Jonai, were evacuated by NDRF and SDRF jawans as the dyke was gone under flood water this morning.

Over 500 affected families are taking shelter on four ‘raised platforms’ at Gali Mesaki, while 30 families are dwelling on such platforms at Lamajan.

The sub divisional administration has set up four relief camps at different locations and given accommodation to more than 100 affected families.

A 17-member team of NDRF along with 12 SDRF jawans equipped with five mechanized rubber boats has been deployed in rescue operations in Jonai.

The local administration has also requisitioned three machine boats for relief purposes.

Observing the alarming situation, the district administration has started communication with the army for help in rescue operation in flood hit sites of Jonai sub division.

The weather condition in the region is remaining unchanged. Siang and Brahmaputra rivers are still flowing above the danger level at Pasighat (Arunachal Pradesh) and Sissiborgaon in the downstream.

As per DDMA report, flood situation in Dhemaji and Sissiborgaon revenue circles under Dhemaji district is reported stable as around 52,000 populations of 124 villages are affected in the two circles.

“The flood-hit townships are Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Bhamo and Shwegu Township in Kachin State, Katha, Htigyaing, Khamti Township in Sagaing Region and six townships in Magway Region,"" he said.

In Kachin State, the floods affected 729 households and 3,200 population. There are already 27 relief camps set up for flood victims.



In Sagaing Region, the floods affected 257 households and 1,240 populations. There were eight relief camps in Sagaing Region. The floods hit 26 households and 107 population. There were three relief camps in Magway Region, she added.

Floods are common in Myanmar especially in July and August.



The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement has warned that the people need to be cautious of the flash flooding, hill slides and landslides caused by incessant heavy downpours.

Xinhua, Meanwhile, Myanmar's total border trade using Individual Trading Cards (ITC) exceeded 34 billion kyats (US$24mil) in nine months of present fiscal year (FY) 2019-2020 which started in October, said figures released by the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday.

As of June 30 this FY, the ministry issued 50 individual trading cards and export using ICT cards through border gates earned over 2.42 billion kyats (US$1.7mil) while its imports exceeded 31.6 billion kyats (US$22.5mil).

During the period, Myawady border gate recorded the highest ITC's trade with 22.8 billion kyats (US$16.3mil).

99,99,FL-2020-000166-BGD,Twin crises of coronavirus and climate change put girls in India at risk of trafficking - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/twin-crises-coronavirus-climate-change-putting-girls-india-risk/,"The flood came first, washing away everything in its path. A few months later a stranger appeared in the village.

By that time, Rumana* had been sleeping under a piece of tarpaulin on the side of the road for six months. It was 2010 and Cyclone Aila had destroyed most of the houses in Goran Bose, the village in eastern India where the 14-year-old lived.

Her father had left almost immediately after the disaster to find work in the city, but the money he sent home wasn’t enough, and the family often had to resort to begging. Rumana’s predominant memory of that time is of “poverty and hunger”.

So when the stranger offered her work in a garment factory 100km away in Kolkata, she didn’t hesitate.

But there was no exciting new job in the city. Instead, the man sold her to a brothel in Kolkata’s infamous red light district, where she spent the next three years in forced prostitution.","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/07/16/06-20-TELE-covid-X-cc-X-traf-3_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU0jHSj23-rqgtcFc9pglTmUPFb-AzGdL1RVS7-HZh0s.JPG?impolicy=logo-overlay,"['trafficking', 'months', 'risk', 'climate', 'city', 'away', 'coronavirus', 'village', 'tarpaulin', 'work', 'villageby', 'wasnt', 'stranger', 'washing', 'girls', 'crises', 'change', 'india', 'twin']",
