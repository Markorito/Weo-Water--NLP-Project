Description of the disaster

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD), the Climate Outlook for the 2021 March-April-May â??Long Rainsâ? season indicates that several parts of the country will experience enhanced rainfall while North Eastern parts of the country will receive below-average rainfall. Based on the state of the Ocean and the early onset, KMD has been issuing heavy rainfall advisories with the most recent being 19 April 2021. The advisory indicated that heavy rainfall was expected over North East, South East, the Coastal Regions of Kenya, Western and Central regions including Nairobi Area. As predicted, from mid-March heavy rainfalls have been experienced in the country with the Western parts of the country being the most affected through displacement of populations and disruption of livelihoods. Tana River county has received moderate rains, but some parts have been affected by flash floods due to waters from the rains upstream.

Effects from the rains have been observed as early as of the 7 of April with the KRCS responding with local resources to the minor emergencies since the onset. Since the 16 of April, the effects have worsened leading to displacements of population and livelihood disruptions, with the KRCS scaling up its response, especially in the provision of shelter services. This increase of the impact, the need to continue to scale up the KRCS response, as well as the latest forecast issued on the 19 April, signaling a continuation of the rains for the next seven days, have triggered the request for a DREF allocation to support the ongoing operation, replenishment of already used resources, and allowing any possible scale up.

The â??Long Rainsâ? currently being experienced have brought heavy rain and subsequent flooding to Counties of the counties of Tana River, Busia, Kisumu, Garissa, and Marsabit. Based on latest assessments from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers the flooding has displaced a total of 4,493 households (26,958 people). At this time two deaths have been reported. Some of the displaced persons are hosted in makeshift camps and others hosted by friends and relatives. KRCS is coordinating with local administration to set up displacements' camps. In addition, 3,232 acres of land with crops have been destroyed in the Tana River basin.

With regards to looking ahead, the forecast indicates that the Lake Basin region, parts of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi county), the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, parts of the North-West, the Southern Rift Valley and Central Rift are forecasted to experience enhanced rainfall. Particularly concerning are the risks associated with the major dams in the eastern part of the country overflowing into some major rivers (such as Tana river and Athi river) leading to flooding and displacement along the riverine basin. The surface and river flooding will compound the lakes backflow that has been seen for the past 2 years around Rift valley lakes and Lake Victoria.

This situation could lead to over 300,000 people displaced by flood as recently experienced in 2019 October-November-December (OND) short rains and 2020 March-April-May long rain (MAM) which caused substantial flooding. It is also likely that a significant number of communities will be marooned for a long period of time, posing access challenges in the immediate aftermath of the flood event.

The current arrangements in Kenya humanitarian partners is that the Kenya Red Cross (KRCS) provides leadership in response to the needs of up to 150,000 flood affected people whilst any additional number in excess of the 150,000 will activate the response by the international community (UN and NGOs). This means KRCS and its partners including movement partners will target to respond to the needs of people up to 150,000. The UN agencies will respond to the excess of 150,000 people.","Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564711-MDRKE047do.png?itok=1bbiZ7jg,"['n', 'mdrke047', 'rift', 'parts', 'rainfall', 'country', 'river', 'action', 'krcs', 'emergency', 'plan', 'valley', 'kenya', 'epoa', 'flooding', 'rains', 'floods']", ,flood

Description of the disaster

October â?? November â?? December 2020 Rains Season

Heavy rains were experienced in many parts of the country following onset of the October-November-December (O-N-D) 2019. The enhanced OND 2019 rains resulted into widespread flooding affecting 29 counties in Kenya: Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River and Taita Taveta of the Coastal region, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera of North Eastern Kenya and Marsabit, Isiolo and Samburu of the Upper Eastern part of the country. Other counties include Meru, Kirinyaga and Murangâ??a of the Mount Kenya area while Eastern part counties had Kitui, Kajiado, Machakos and Makueni being affected. The flooding did not spare Turkana, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Narok, Kakamega, Bungoma, Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay either and response operations were sustained in all the counties mentioned by the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) response operation. The heaviest dayâ??s rainfall amount received was for 22 November 2019 which had the greatest flooding impact in the country with areas hardly hit being Northern parts, Western, Central and Coastal regions.

A total of 41,417HHs (233,339 people) were affected during the October, November, December 2019 rains season which continued into January and February 2020. In addition, 11,135HHs were displaced, 26,636 livestock deaths and 5051.5 acres of farmland destroyed. A total of 25 fatalities were recorded with KRCS as a result of the O-N-D rains.

March â?? April â?? May 2020 Rains Season

Following onset of the March â?? April â?? May 2020 rains season in March 2020, most parts of the country received more rainfall as indicated in green bars in Figure 1, which is compared with the rainfall amounts normally received as per the Long-Term Mam (LTM) as indicated in the orange bars. As observed in the figure most parts of the county received rains in the first week with a significant spike in rainfall amounts experienced from the third and fourth weeks of March 2020. In parts of Western Kenya as it were in many other parts in Kenya, rainfall continued from the O-N-D 2019 season with a short break in February and then getting into the pick of M-A-M in March 2020.

Further, April 2020 was also marked with increased rainfall amounts starting from the third week with heavy rainfall reported over most parts of the country in the week of 19th to 25th April (Figure 2). This resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in Central, South Eastern, Western and Northeastern regions where over 150mm (Figure 2, purple shaded areas) of rainfall were recorded.

The worst incident occurred on 18 April 2020, when heavy rains resulted in landslides in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, leaving 19 people dead, several missing persons and extensive damage to shelter, infrastructure and livelihoods assets.

As of 17th June 2020, KRCS had registered at least 42,064 HHs (252,384 people) displaced in 35 counties in Kenya. The society also identified 79 camps country wide where the displaced persons are staying with majority of them being in Nyanza and Western Kenya â?? Kisumu, Busia, Homabay and Migori â?? (51 camps) and Coast â?? mainly Tana River county with 20 camps.

During the M-A-M rains, at least 94 loss of lives were recorded by KRCS. In addition to the widespread impact on lives lost and destruction of critical livelihood support assets and shelter, communication, and transportation between Kitale â?? Lodwar was significantly impacted negatively with the washing away of the Murun Bridge and dozens of community members and commuters were cut off from the rest of the world.

Similarly, Garissa and Tana River Counties were affected in many parts as well following the bursting of banks of River Tana. This resulted into 15 people being marooned at Hadama location in Tana North Sub-county and KRCS response team registered 624 Households (HHs) cases of displacements and supported them with relief supplies.

The season also resulted in increased inflows which resulted in critical rise in water levels in Turkwel Dam which achieved the highest levels since the dam was constructed in early 1990s. At the peak of the surge in water levels in November 2020, water levels rose to 1,148.38 meters above sea level, leaving only 1.64 meters to spillage. The IFRC launched a Preparedness DREF to support KRCS roll out preparedness actions ahead of possible spillage. The operation ended when the trigger wasnâ??t achieved due to a reduction in rainfall amounts as a result of the cessation of the O-N-D 2020 rains in Kenya.

A surge in lake water levels in many rift valley lakes in Kenya, as well as in Lake Victoria, has also resulted in displacement of families along the shores of the lakes. Displaced families continue to camp in informal settlements on the shores of the lakes as their farms and homes have been marooned by rising water levels.

March â?? April â?? May (MAM) 2021 Forecast

On 18 February 2020, KMD issued the seasonal forecast for March-April-May 2021 rains season. The indicates a likelihood of above average rainfall in most parts of the country during the month of May 2020, including parts of Western, Nyanza, Central and Rift valley in Kenya. There is therefore a continued risk of flooding and landslides, resulting in renewed displacements of communities in flood-prone areas.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565164-Kenya%20-%20Floods%20-%20Final%20Report%20Appeal%20n%C2%B0%20MDRKE045.png?itok=hr2pza63,"['n', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'parts', 'country', 'appeal', 'resulted', 'counties', 'krcs', 'report', 'kenya', 'final', 'mdrke045', '2020', 'floods', 'western']", ,flood
2,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,How Kenya Copes with Thousands of Displaced Climate Migrants - TIME,https://time.com/5953402/climate-migrants-kenya-floods/,"When he was a child, James Owuor loved hearing the elders talk about the way life used to be. So it comes as something of a surprise that at 38, he is now the one tasked with the job of describing the Before Times in Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley. Before Lake Baringo started to rise, before it flooded and stole everything he knew.

â??At the beginning, we just thought it was a bad rainy season, that the water would recede when the dry season came. It didnâ??t,â? he says ruefully, peering over the edge of his motorized canoe at what used to be houses below the milky brown waters. Over the past decade, an unprecedented increase in annual rainfallâ??widely attributed to climate changeâ??has raised the lake by 40 ft. (12 m), inundating nearly 22,000 acres and destroying homes, businesses and Roberts Camp, the lakeside resort where Owuor has worked for most of his adult life.

In 2014, he watched the waters overtake the two-story-tall shorefront lodge. The restaurant went next, then the bar. In September, the resortâ??s entrance gate on the road to the nearby town of Kampi Ya Samaki went under. Navigating through the drowned remnants of downtown, Owuor points out the remains of a fish factoryâ??s roof. A crocodile paddles past the submerged rooms of the Lake Breeze Restaurant and Bar while a hippo grunts from the nave of a flooded church. Water laps at the third-floor balconies of the luxury Soi Safari Lodge, an 80-room resort that once employed 300 locals.

Eventually, he says, â??people will have to leave this place and find somewhere else to live. If they were running a business, that means they probably will not have that business anymore. Life is drastically going to change.â?

An even bigger threat looms. The nearby alkaline Lake Bogoria is also rising. Twice as salty as seawater, and home to more than a million flamingos, Lake Bogoria is on the brink of breaching its own natural barriers. If the waters rise up by another 4 m, says Professor Simon M. Onywere, a geologist at Kenyatta Universityâ??s department of environmental planning, it could flood freshwater Lake Baringo with a deadly spill of alkaline waters. The two lakes used to be 12 miles (20 km) apart. Over the past decade, climate change has nearly halved the distance.

The merging of the two lakes would be devastating, says Paul Chepsoi, an environmentalist and advocate for local Indigenous rights from the area. â??Itâ??s not just a worst-case scenario. Itâ??s an ecological and human disaster.â? More than 100,000 people depend on Baringo for income, from either fishing or agriculture. A saltwater influx would destroy both industries. â??It means that livelihoods will be affected for generations to come,â? Chepsoi says, standing in the middle of a paved road that once led to the gates of Bogoriaâ??s national park. Water laps at his feet. A nearby lakeside lodge, like the park entrance sign behind him, is mostly underwater.

Nothing short of a catastrophic droughtâ??the kind that would also destroy livelihoodsâ??will stop the rising waters. â??The people here will have to leave,â? says Chepsoi. Many, he says, are already being forced to migrate to neighboring towns and cities largely unprepared for the influx. â??The pressure of so many new arrivals will overwhelm the services providers,â? he worries. â??They are not prepared with housing, water, health care facilities or police.â? Migration may be inevitable, but if the destination cannot absorb the new migrants, they may find themselves even worse off.

In some parts of the world, climate change brings drought. In Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley, it has brought torrential, out-of-season rains over the past decade, which, combined with deforestation, have resulted in rising waters in all of the valleyâ??s eight lakes. Some have nearly doubled in size, drowning pastureland, farms, homes, schools, churches, clinics and businesses in what Elizabeth Meyerhoff, an American social anthropologist who studies Rift Valley communities, calls a â??slow-motion tsunami.â? By the end of 2020, one of Kenyaâ??s wettest years on record, Baringo had risen by several meters, and had claimed 34 sq. mi. of land.

The local ward administrator says that a health clinic, a technical college, five schools, seven churches, 48 shops and 1,250 housesâ??home to nearly a third of the populationâ??have been destroyed. Thousands in the Rift Valley lakes region have been forced from their homes. They are part of a new, global movement of refugees fleeing not conflict but climate change.

â??If you just lose your income that is one thing, because you can adapt. You find another job or another field,â? says Meyerhoff. â??But once you lose everythingâ?? your home, your school, your clinic, your road, your churchâ??then itâ??s an impossible situation. You become an environmental migrant because you have to find those facilities in some other place.â? She is no detached observer; her own home for the past 40 years is just a few inches away from being swallowed by Baringoâ??s rising waters. In her notebook, she carries a photo of her teenage children leaping from her gardenâ??s cliffside edge into the lake 40 ft. (12 m) below. Now in their 30s, they could sit in the same spot and dabble their feet in the water. They are begging her to pack up and leave; if she does, she will need to get a boatâ??the road to her house is already underwater.

Some 24 million peopleâ??more than three times the number fleeing armed conflictâ??are displaced each year by ecological disasters such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and rising sea levels, according to an October 2020 analysis by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a global think tank headquartered in Sydney. In the next 30 years, some 1.2 billion more people could be displaced if greenhouse-gas emissions continue on an upward trajectory, accelerating global warming and amplifying climate impacts, particularly in rural areas where livelihoods are dependent on the kind of agriculture most affected by changing weather patterns.

For a long time, experts have seen this kind of migration as flowing from the failure of carbon-spewing nations to rein in their emissions, along with the inability of poorer governments to protect their citizens through adequate adaptation measures. But that view is changing: there comes a point where no amount of infrastructure can hold back the sea, bring back the seasonal rains or cool the global climate. At that point, â??migration becomes the adaptation strategy,â? says Vittoria Zanuso, executive director of the Mayors Migration Council (MMC), a global organization that works with cities to develop comprehensive urban-migration programs. For many of these climate migrants, cities and towns will be their final destination.

Wealthy countries are not exempt. A 2018 study, published in the University of Chicagoâ??s Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, predicts that climate change will push 1 in 12 Southern and Midwestern residents of the U.S. to move to less affected areas in the Northeast and Northwest over the next 45 years. â??Itâ??s no longer a question of if climate migration is happening but rather who, how much, where and when,â? says Alex Randall of the U.K.-based Climate and Migration Coalition. â??Up until now, the focus has been on stopping people from migrating in the first place. Now the focus needs to be on how to make them an asset rather than a burden for the places they are going.â?

Cities need migrants in order to grow, but chaotic, undirected migration can be as disruptive as an influx of salt into a freshwater lake. That means preparing towns for a new generation of climate migrants by building up infrastructure and increasing services from sanitation to education and health careâ??often a pricey undertaking for cash-strapped municipalities. New York Cityâ??s annual budget per resident is approximately $9,500; Nairobiâ??s is around $74.

Several citiesâ??including Orlando; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Freetown, Sierra Leoneâ??have launched programs to build climate resilience while making sure new arrivals have opportunities for both safe housing and fair employment. These programs are usually funded by the municipality, but in order for them to expand, more investment is needed. International climate funds should play more of a role, says Randall. â??Once you accept that moving is a form of adaptation, we would potentially get to a point where climate-adaptation finance could be spent on helping people move safely, or making sure cities had the necessary infrastructure for coping with rapid growth.â?

As part of the discussions that led to the Paris Agreement, wealthier nations committed to contribute $100 billion a year to help poorer countries combat climate change through loans, grants, cash and private investments. The Green Climate Fund, as it is known, is the worldâ??s largest fund dedicated to addressing climate change, but so far, only 20% of global contributions have gone toward adaptation, with the rest largely going to greenhouse-gas-reduction projectsâ??despite a stated goal of 50-50 allocation. (Donor nations make the final decision on project financing.)

To developing nations that typically bear a lesser responsibility for the climate crisis, itâ??s an egregious oversight. â??When it comes to a country like Bangladesh or Kenya, where our emissions are small to start with, telling us to use the money to reduce emissions doesnâ??t make sense,â? says Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD). â??We need the money for adaptation; that should be the priority.â? Zanuso, of the MMC, estimates that urban-adaptation projectsâ??enabling cities to absorb migrants in a way that helps them and their host communities flourishâ??receive only 3% to 5% of the adaptation funding that has been made available.

When the rising waters of Lake Nakuru, 85 miles (137 km) south of Lake Baringo, claimed the rural settlement of Mwariki in September, Evelyn Ajuang, a 41-year-old widow with close-cropped dark hair, had nowhere to go. She had just spent her entire life savings building and furnishing a four-bedroom house and had nothing to fall back on. So Ajuang took a single room in a low-income neighborhood in the middle of Nakuru town. She sold her goats and chickens to cover three monthsâ?? rentâ??besides, the concrete warren of crammed shacks offered no space for livestock. Now, unable to sell the eggs, milk and vegetables that once provided a steady income, she fears the uncertainty ahead.

Ajuang, like most of us, has only a vague understanding of how rising carbon emissions could trigger the rains that have flooded the Rift Valley lakes, but she knows enough to blame it for destroying her life. â??Climate change is why I donâ??t think I will ever return to my home,â? she says, eyeing the four roomsâ?? worth of furniture stacked to the ceiling of her rented room.

Ajuang has been thrust unprepared, and unsupported, into urban life. Every market day, she goes to the wholesale market across town to buy the vegetables she once grew in her own garden, which she sells for a slight profit in her new neighborhood. But transport is expensive, and competition is high. Most months, she canâ??t even make her $30 rent. So far, 153 families from Mwariki have lost their homes; another 174 farmers have lost their fields. Most are sheltering with family or charity organizations in town. While Kenyan authorities say they are looking into the matter, the former residents of Mwariki say the government has yet to distribute any substantial aid or even broach a resettlement plan, leaving victims in agonizing limbo. At least one has committed suicide, says community organizer David Kahoro; several have suffered heart attacks, and many are facing destitution. But it doesnâ??t have to be this way.

Sub-Saharan Africa is already one of the fastest urbanizing regions, with around 450 million city dwellers. That number is expected to climb to 621 million by 2030, the equivalent of adding two New York Citys to the continent each year. Climate change has been a major driver of this urbanization and is likely to increase the pressure on city infrastructure and resources, says sociologist Marc Helbling of Germanyâ??s University of Mannheim. Helbling has tracked 50 yearsâ?? worth of urbanization trends in 133 countries and found that rising temperatures consistently lead to higher levels of rural-to-urban migration.

Done right, urbanization can foster economic growth. No modern country has ever reached middle-income status without urbanizing first. But uncontrolled, it can result in slums, mismanaged sprawl, poor public health and rising insecurity for residentsâ??a city that is less inclusive, less productive and less sustainable. An influx of climate migrants could drive the development of several African megacities (population 10 million or more) into global powerhouses within the next decade and a halfâ??but it could also create unprecedented mega-slums.

â??If cities donâ??t start planning now for climate migrants, this will certainly increase all the problems that come with uncontrolled urbanizationâ??overpopulation, increased pollution, sanitation challengesâ??and it means that they wonâ??t be able to pre-empt the negative or indirect impact of those migrants,â? says Linda Adhiambo Oucho, executive director of the Nairobi-based African Migration and Development Policy Centre.

That means doing something that few governments are good at: preparing for a crisis that hasnâ??t yet happened. Urban planning is a slow science, says Oucho. â??We donâ??t want to get to a situation where we are talking about what to do about mass displacement when climate refugees are already streaming into the city; we need to start addressing it now while it is still manageable.â? In part, that means expanding schools, health clinics, sewage systems and transport networks, but it also means making sure that the new arrivals move into safe areas where they wonâ??t be exposed to additional climate hazards, like the flooding and storm surges that already threaten the low-income neighborhoods usually found in low-lying areas.

Most important is making sure that rural migrants are able to transition to urban livelihoods. â??We donâ??t want to see cattle herders begging on street corners because they donâ??t have the skills to thrive in the city,â? says Oucho. â??The only way climate migrants can become a positive factor in urban growth is if they have the retraining and skills transfer that will allow them to adapt and survive and find new opportunities.â?

While Kenya is only just starting to see the impacts of climate migration, some countries have had years of experience and can offer a template for urban-adaptation solutions. Bangladesh, with its population of 163 million relatively poor residents residing on a flood-prone delta threatened by rising sea levels, was once the global symbol for climate-change victims. But over the past decade, the nation has embarked on a multipronged adaptation strategy that is now starting to show results. â??We are still very vulnerable,â? says Huq of the ICCCAD, â??but that vulnerability isnâ??t the story anymore. Itâ??s how we deal with the vulnerability.â?

The key, says Huq, is long-term thinking. Even as the adult population is taught to adapt by switching to salt-tolerant rice, or to farm shrimp instead of vegetables, younger generations are offered an education that will allow them to eventually flourish in an urban setting. â??The second order of adaptation is preparing people to move by their own volition, not being forced to move [by climatic conditions] but being enabled to move and resettle in towns with greater protection.â?

Huqâ??s center, which focuses on climate change and adaptation in developing countries, also works to divert migration streams away from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, toward secondary cities better prepared to absorb the flows. The center identified some 20 target towns on the basis of their ability both to withstand climatic changes and to offer employment and education opportunities for newcomers. The most overlooked part, he says, is what he calls the â??softwareâ? that accompanies the â??hardwareâ? of infrastructure development: working with civil-society organizations to â??help residents understand that there will be climate migrants coming in and that they need to be welcomed and supported so they can settle in and become citizens of that town.â? Otherwise, he says, conflict between groups could derail progress.

To a certain extent, every place will have to keep its own unique geography in mind. The state of New Jersey, for example, has worked with Rutgers University to map out the areas most likely to flood as sea levels rise in the coming years in order to forestall risky development projects. That kind of thinking should be more widespread, says Randall, particularly when it comes to the poorer urban areas where climate migrants are most likely to settle. â??What we are seeing at the moment is people leaving a rural area affected by drought, for example, and moving to a city where theyâ??ve managed to find work but are living in an informal settlement that is vulnerable to flooding. They may have moved, but they have traded one kind of climate risk for another.â?

And in some cases, a proactive climate-adaptation policy may mean helping whole communities start all over again. In Louisiana, government officials are spending $48.3 million to relocate several dozen households from the low-lying Isle de Jean Charles to higher ground 40 miles away, as part of the first federally funded, climate-change-induced community resettlement project in the U.S. Construction on the new houses started in May 2020.

Wholesale community relocation is expensive and best used as an option of last resort, but Ajuang, who lost her home to the rising waters of Lake Nakuru, canâ??t help wondering how different her life would have been if the government was able to offer her another property. She doesnâ??t think victims of the floods should get money, but having a safe place to land and the resources to start over would have helped. She worked for years to buy her own house to be self-sufficient in retirement and is desperate to regain that autonomy.

Wading hip-deep past what used to be her front porch one recent afternoon, she shoos away a pelican stalking fish in her old goat pen. Referring to the hustle that helped her get her own home, she says she would happily do it all over again, given an opportunity. She just needs a dry piece of land to start. â??Without somewhere to go, the dreams I had for my future and my life will end just like that.â?

NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's quest to realize climate resilient growth is facing headwinds as widespread flooding experienced in the March-May season of long rains is damaging livelihoods and vital ecosystems in the country.

A number of civilians have lost their lives and property of unknown value destroyed in the recent past as storm water swept across Kenyan lowlands and densely-populated urban slums following a heavy downpour.

Local media reported Friday that four people were killed in Nairobi's Kibera slum Thursday night after they were swept away by raging waters as they attempted to cross a swollen river in the country's biggest slum.

The heavy rains that pounded the capital Thursday night caused flooding in other informal settlements, marooning local residents and worsening the risk of disease outbreaks.

Kenya Metrological Department said Friday that the heavy rains are expected to subside this weekend, but due to already saturated soils, it is likely to trigger landslides in hilly parts of the country.

The weathermen said that light showers could become a regular phenomenon in many parts of the country until the end of May, hence signaling improved agricultural productivity.

Massive flooding that accompanied torrential rains in western Kenyan lowlands and the coast region in the past week has displaced hundreds of families, destroying farms, roads and critical amenities such as schools.

Cyrus Oguna, spokesman for the Government of Kenya, said at a briefing early this week that the state was working on a long-term plan to help communities cope with recurrent floods.

""In the interim, we will be providing humanitarian assistance to flood victims in different parts of the country. These assistance include food, life-saving medicine and shelter,"" said Oguna.

He said the government had prioritized early warning, renovation of urban drainage infrastructure and tree planting to cushion local communities from negative impacts of flooding.

Kenya has been experiencing widespread flooding in the past several years during rainy seasons worsened by human encroachment on natural buffers like forests, wetlands and mangrove swamps.

The recurrent floods, that are also linked to climate change and unplanned settlements in urban areas, have jeopardized the country's ability to realize low-carbon development.

Keriako Tobiko, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said that Kenya's ability to tame climatic shocks including severe droughts and floods, is key to boosting green and inclusive growth.

""We aspire to attain green growth through strengthening the capacity of communities to withstand negative impacts of climate change,"" Tobiko said at a virtual Kenya-European Union green diplomacy conference held Tuesday.

He said the government will increase funding, promote uptake of clean technologies and regeneration of ecosystems to boost resilience of communities amid climatic stresses.

Tobiko said that some climate change adaptation projects under implementation including construction of large dams, restoration of degraded landscapes and household-based water harvesting initiatives, are aimed at containing floods.

He said that Kenya is leveraging on domestic resource mobilization, partnership and technology adoption to realize climate resilient and sustainable growth as part of the pandemic recovery.

Chris Kiptoo, the principal secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said the government is focusing on community-led interventions to minimize the impact of flooding, drought and habitat loss on livelihoods.

""Ultimately, local-led actions will strengthen resilience of our communities and the natural habitats whenever they experience climate change-related impacts like acute drought and flooding,"" said Kiptoo, adding that climatic stresses will be inevitable in the future hence the need to boost coping mechanism for local communities as part of Kenya's green aspirations.

Nairobi residents woke up to heavy traffic snarl ups and flooded roads as heavy rains pounded the capital city on Monday morning.

The rains that pounded the city overnight left flood-prone areas submerged, with emergency services concerned on the fate of people living near river banks and riparian areas.

The Kenya Meteorological Department had over the weekend warned of heavy downpours in the city that will continue throughout the week.

A forecast of the rainfall situation by the weatherman indicated that there will be heavy rainfall in the Nairobi region, Central Kenya and parts of the Eastern Region from Saturday.

â??Showers and thunderstorms are expected over most places on Saturday night, while rains are expected during the week followed by a thunderstorm,â? Met said.

Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, in the statement, called for measures to be put in place to avoid loss of lives and property during the rains.

Aura has warned Kenyans, especially motorists and pedestrians, to be on the lookout and be cautious while passing through moving water.

â??Itâ??s going to rain heavy tonight. Everyone using the roads either as a driver or pedestrian is advised to observe extra caution. Avoid passing through moving waters. Keep safe,â? she said.

On Monday morning, along Mombasa Road, near Imara Daima estate, motorists were forced to use only one lane with access to several offices completely cut-off by the raging waters.

Some blamed the situation on the construction of the expressway saying contractors were spilling rainwater from their site onto the road.

Others blamed the perennial flooding challenge on poor drainage in the area.

Mr Ongudi appealed to the county government and well-wishers to step in and provide relief food, medical aid and non-food items for the flood victims.

In Migori, pupils in Angugo, Kabuto and Nyora primary schools in Nyatike sub-county failed to report as schools reopened for third term due to the floods

The ongoing heavy downpour has seen over 800 families left homeless for close to a month weeks after Kuja river broke its banks, flooding several villages . Compounded by the backflow from Lake Victoria, Angugo, Nyora, Modi and Lwanda villages are inhabitable.

Transport services were cut off between Kanyamkago in Migori County and Kanyikela in Homa Bay County after a bridge that connects the two areas collapsed. The Oria-Riat bridge on Kuja river collapsed on Wednesday morning. No casualties were reported.

Migori County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich said a team comprising the Red Cross, education officials and local administration had been dispatched to assess the situation.

""We are planning to relocate the pupils to neighbouring schools,"" he said.

""Since there is no alternative access to Osieko, we wish to advise motorists along that section not to attempt crossing the overtopped section and to only cross when the water levels are low,"" read the tweet.

""The water has already covered the road, we fear that if the rains continue the Lake Victoria water will spread to River Yala and the road will be no more,"" said George Omondi, a resident of Nyangera in Usenge.

Kenha also warned heavy trucks to avoid using the crossing for now as they evaluate mechanisms of undertaking works on the structure.

""A permanent bridge is planned and procurement process is underway to solve the rising Lake Victoria water levels at this crossing,"" read the statement.

According to the Assistant Director of Meteorological Services Dr. Richard Mwita, some of the unsafe areas are the flood plains where water may have receded during the dry weather and attracted people to set up homes or started farming activities on the fertile alluvial soils.

The weatherman is also attributing the heavy rainfall to the presence of a low-pressure belt, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the East African region that is then attracting rain-bearing clouds into the region and resulting in heavy rainfall or storms.

The region is also still within the March, April to May long rains season.

This notice by MET comes a few days after Port users were advised to be cautious of bad weather along the coastline as a tropical cyclone named Jobo was expected to hit the Tanzanian coast.

In a statement released Saturday, Kenya Ports Authority said that due to low-pressure systems that developed in the South Western Indian Ocean, the cyclone was moving towards the East African coastline.

The statement which was signed by Head of Marine Operations Capt. Moses Muthama also advised that all ships in the harbor lookout for imminent bad weather and take every necessary action to secure vessels against strong winds including doubling of mooring lines.

Capt. Muthama stated that all ships at anchorage and moored to buoys should have main engines and crew on standby at short notice during this period.

He added that all ships drifting outside port limits should maintain not less than 15 nautical miles from the nearest point of land and keep crew and engines on standby.","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/floods.jpg,"['met', 'rainfall', 'weather', 'heavy', 'wajir', 'marsabit', 'ships', 'region', 'areas', 'flash', 'mandera', 'meteorological', 'kbc', 'warns', 'floods', 'statement']", ,flood

Like many people on New Yearâ??s eve, I was very hopeful that 2021 could bring hope and change especially after a very challenging pandemic year. I was excited at the prospect of leaving my lockdown life behind, to see family and loved ones- to finally live and experience life without fear. Unfortunately, things have not changed much for most of the world. The â??new normalâ?? is normal now.

While Covid-19 remains a threat, many of us forgot about the other bigger threat to humanity. A looming monster that has been around for much longer putting millions in harmâ??s way. Unfortunately, there is no cure yet for this menace and once again, the world needs to tackle this problem collectively, head-on.



At the start of 2021, the world was beset by climate emergencies one after another. We have seen extreme weather events, from the chilling polar vortex in North America, the super cyclones in Africa, to the devastating floods in Australia and parts of Asia. There were also record-breaking sandstorms and unprecedented wildfires.



Scientists have long sounded the alarm on the climate crisis. Until world governments come together and commit to ambitious action for climate and social equity, no one is safe.

Record-breaking snow in Spain

The year started with an unprecedented snowstorm in Spain. On the 8th of January, Filomena brought record-breaking cold waves and heavy snowfall in the Spanish capital Madrid which has not experienced such a phenomenon since 1917. Filomena also paralyzed many parts of the country, disrupting air and land transport.

The rains currently experienced in Nairobi led to the Nairobi Dam bursting its banks.

Since the past week, heavy rains have been experienced in many parts of Nairobi, contrary to the prediction from the weatherman that Nairobi would not experience long rains in the month.

In its May review, Kenya Meteorological Department had ruled Nairobi out of the regions that were expected to receive heavy rains.

According to the Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, the outlook for May 2021 indicates that several parts of the Lake Victoria Basin region and Western Kenya; Central and Southern Rift Valley are likely to experience slightly enhanced rainfall.

Counties in the southeastern and North-eastern are likely to receive near-average rainfall.

Counties in the Coastal region are likely to experience below-average rainfall.

The distribution of the rain is likely to be poor in the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and the Coastal region.

Rainfall is expected to continue during the month of May in the Lake Victoria Basin; Highlands West of the Rift Valley; and Central and South Rift Valley.

However, the rainfall amounts are expected to be above average during the first half of the month and near average during the second half of the month.

The rains will continue into the month of June.

Turkana, West Pokot, and Samburu counties are likely to be characterised by near to slightly above average rainfall during the first half of the month.

Occasional rainfall is likely to occur during the second half of the month. The expected total rainfall amounts are likely to be near the long-term average for the region.

Above-average rainfall is expected during the first half of the month in the Highlands East of the Rift Valley and Central Kenya.

The rain is likely to be conducive for agricultural production, especially in the high-potential counties in the Lake Victoria basin Region, Highlands West of the Rift Valley as well as Central and Southern Rift Valley.

There is a likelihood of flooding in low-lying areas and flood plains especially over the Western parts of Kenya where occasional rainfall is expected.

Cases of lightning strikes are still likely in the Lake Victoria Basin and highlands west of Rift Valley and landslides may occur in the hilly areas of the highlands west and east of the Rift Valley.

Rainfall performance in April

April marks the peak of the Long Rains (March-April-May) season.

The month began with dry weather conditions over several parts of the country except for the Lake basin, highlands west and east of the Rift valley where occasional rainfall was experienced.

The most enhanced rainfall of 337.7mm was recorded at Suba station. This was followed by Kisumu at 276.9mm, Kabete at 272.3mm, and Kakamega at 271.3mm.

Other stations that recorded more than 200 mm include Kericho, Kitui, Kisii, Dagoretti, Kangema, Embu, Thika, Wilson, and Moi Air Base.

Several stations reported rainfall that was less than 100mm with Lodwar recording the lowest amount at 2mm.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pLnp8WNyQ8MRVRrxXSujwfLc4GZ3xTqKQSw3gNE4yHTLscZfP-DHBKwoA3UfOnjbtHrOJiTZBeW902eAVOwEE5zhUxZZ=s1000,"['lake', 'west', 'rift', 'rainfall', 'long', 'likely', 'end', 'season', 'month', 'valley', 'weatherman', 'highlands', 'rains', 'expected', 'half']", ,none

â??Iâ??ve never been a fisherman before,â? says Erick Ochieng on the edge of a flooded creek in the port city of Kisumu on the banks of Lake Victoria. â??I used to work as a bouncer but nightclubs have closed. Sometimes my family sleeps without eating.â?

As the frequency of extreme weather events increase, climate experts are warning of above normal levels of rainfall in the already saturated region in the coming months.

â??Now we donâ??t have jobs, our houses are flooded and we are living in a school,â? says Patrick Obondo, an out-of-work mechanic.

Africaâ??s largest inland body of water, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, hit the highest level ever recorded in mid May, submerging parts of towns and whole villages on its banks â?? and water levels are still high.

â??My family go to bed hungry,â? Ochieng says. His rent is 8,000 Kenyan shillings (Â£60) a month. â??Iâ??m already two months behind.â? He is not the only one struggling; nearly 84% of Kenyaâ??s workforce is made up of informal labourers, whose families rely on money made each day to eat.

Around 233,000 people have been affected by the floods in Kenya, and more than 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross, after two consecutive seasons of record rains caused rivers across the country to burst their banks, devastating towns and villages.

â??The water started rising at about 6pm in the mud house and by 9pm I had to leave everything. My home and the animals on my small farm were washed away by the Nzoia River at the start of May,â? says Celine Apondi, 50, sitting in the shade of a tree in a schoolyard in Siaya county near the lake.

Apondi and her seven children survived but the Kenyan government says 237 people have died from the flooding. She is one of more than 3,000 displaced people living in Nyambare secondary school.

As well as food items, pots and pans, and thick plastic sheeting to make tents, the Kenya Red Cross is also being given face masks â?? but Apondi says social distancing is impossible.

The government closed schools in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but now more than 100 are home to the displaced.

Kenya has recorded 62 deaths from Covid-19 and has had 1,745 confirmed cases. Movement has been restricted in and out of Mombasa and Nairobi and a 7pm to 5am national curfew has been enforced by police using violence and teargas.

Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government was distributing 250m Kenyan shillings (Â£19m) a week to vulnerable families hit by the economic crisis and 1bn shillings (Â£75m) has been set aside for flood control measures.

However, apart from Kenya Red Cross emergency handouts, people who were made homeless by the floods told the Guardian they have yet to be given any substantial government support and cannot afford to move away from living on increasingly volatile flood plains.

â??I would expect the government to resettle these people elsewhere â?? that is the only solution to this place.â? says Joseph Oyamo, a 62-year-old retired primary teacher, as he looks at an eroded river bank close to some houses near Ahero town in Kisumu county.

James Okumbe, deputy governor of Siaya county, said plans to build a dam and dykes to control river levels have been delayed. â??It could have been finished but the national government has not completed the compensation of the land owners [who need to be relocated and] live along the river banks,â? says Okumbe.

There are predictions of above normal rainfall in the region between June and September, says Mark Majodina, World Meteorological Organization representative for eastern and southern Africa.

Climate experts are reluctant to pin one weather event to global heating but there is increasing alarm at the frequency of extreme and unpredictable weather systems.

For the past decade high temperatures in the western Indian Ocean have heated the sea and moisture is absorbed into the atmosphere. That moisture is then precipitated over east Africa, says Guleid Artan, director at the Climate Prediction and Application Centre.

Artan says rainfall records were broken in the October, November and December 2019 rainy season, and a wetter than normal January and precipitation over the March, April and May rainy season have also broken records in the region.

So much rain saturates the soil that chunks of farmland have broken off Ugandaâ??s shores and created several floating islands that have clogged dams and the lakeâ??s only outlet into the Nile River.

Three villages next to the lake are now partially under water, says Owiena Hezekiah, assistant chief of Kogembo sub-location, in Homa Bay county, which also borders the lake. â??There are more mosquitoes, which cause malaria, and aggressive hippos have come inland.

â??We are worried about sanitation and cholera. People relied on pit latrines which are now overflowing with water.â?

Majodina says weather prediction data is becoming increasingly accurate and is communicated through the media to fishing communities, and to government departments. â??They donâ??t sit on the relevant information, they act, but people are still resisting,â? says Majodina.

People are reluctant to leave their homes, and think someone is going to take their belongings, he adds. â??One needs to look at how you compensate people. Is there some sort of insurance you can give people once they leave [their homes]?â?

â??I had to walk for three kilometres to safety with the water around my neck,â? says farmer James Yogo, 27, at an emergency distribution at a school in Kisumu county.

â??There was a child from the area who died from the water,â? adds Yogo. â??Some people climbed trees and sat on roofs. My house has collapsed. No one came to help.â?

â??Itâ??s just climate change,â? Yogo says. â??Iâ??m reluctant to replant my crops as I know the water will come back â?? but there are no jobs and I have no choice, Iâ??ll have to start again.â?","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d92ac907c3992a17e2601795cd63fac6c439a6fa/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=562826237139aa782d10a18ff2ce48ab,"['lake', 'banks', 'weather', 'kenyas', 'river', 'photograph', 'ed', 'struggle', 'county', 'water', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'far', 'living', 'come']", ,flood

The broadcast dubbed The Exchange: Conversation for a better future which featured IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva and Christiana Figueres ended after 24 minutes with most comments from netizens against the body for loaning the government.

The comment section of the 24-minute long broadcast featured remarks by Kenyans who told the IMF to stop giving Kenya loans.

Kenyans also accused IMF of indirectly funding corruption in the country by giving the government more loans yet the previous ones were allegedly embezzled.

The two were discussing the effects of Covid-19 and climate change on the economy of the various countries.

Kenyans online in early April failed to convince IMF through social media activism to cancel a Sh255.9 billion credit facility advanced to Kenya after over 185,000 citizens signed an online petition seeking to convince the body to stop giving the government loans.

Through a stopgivingKenyaloans hashtag, the citizens said the loans have seen the countryâ??s public debt balloons with little to show in terms of development, a position the government has dismissed.

President Uhuru Kenyatta is on record saying the government has utilised money borrowed in developing the country

But experts have said the IMF negotiate with governments and not individual citizens, but added that the petition could see the lender look at the conditions in future when dealing with Kenya

Kenya has already received Sh33.7b already disbursed with Sh79 billion will be disbursed in June while the remaining Sh176.9 billion will be disbursed after a review by IMF done after every six months.

Kenyans have questioned the use of the money borrowed already with the public debt now standing at Sh7.25 trillion bulk of resources from outside lenders while Sh3.4 trillion procured locally

In March 2013, the country debt stood at Sh1.79 trillion with Former President Mwai Kibaki administration servicing Sh981 billion domestic Sh812 billion in external debt.

Lake Naivasha has expanded to 173 square kilometres, from 112 square kilometres just 10 years ago, mainly due to increased rainfall and siltation, which pushes the waters outwards, said Cyrus Oguna, the Kenyan government spokesman.

In many other parts of the East Africa region too, heavy rains have ravaged crops and rising waters from lakes and rivers have destroyed shoreline communities.

â??This is a global phenomenon which has come to Kenya now. Climate change is now affecting the East African region,â? said Festus Ngâ??eno, the executive in charge of water in Nakuru county, where Lake Naivasha is situated.

Ruth Wanjiru, forced to leave her home in the shoreline village of Kihoto in May, said she had lived in the area for nearly three decades but had never seen flooding on this scale.

â??It all started in April. The water started rising, coming to the residential areas. It got worse and I had to move out,â? said the 47-year-old mother, one of around 500 people displaced by the flooding from Lake Naivasha.

She watched crestfallen as five young men waded through thigh-high waters to salvage windows and doors from the house she had to abandon.

â??I am now trying to save the little that I can,â? said Wanjiru, adding that she would sell retrievable parts of the house for food and other essentials.

Ten small rental houses she had built in the area have also been abandoned, depriving her of her primary source of income.

â??We woke up to massive floods in the morning from the Nyando River, and my entire farm and houses were swept away,â? said Otieno. â??I only saved my two goats.â?

In Kenyaâ??s Western and Nyanza regions, heavy rainfall since March has displaced more than 100,000 people and devastated homes and crops.

At the same time, the government is fighting to contain the coronavirus outbreak at national and local levels, with measures like social distancing.

In the western part of the country, following such guidelines is nearly impossible for those forced from their homes by the rains and flooding, residents and aid workers said.

Otienoâ??s family of six was among several evacuated from his village and is now sheltering in nearby Okanja primary school. There they are finding it hard to stay away from others to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.

â??We have stayed here for two weeks, and it is very challenging to maintain social distancing,â? Otieno told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

Women and children sleep together in the school compound, while men spend the night in separate rooms.

The nearly 500 displaced people staying in local schools are trying to follow government guidelines to prevent COVID-19 infection, such as wearing face masks and sanitising hands, said Otieno.

â??Well-wishers came and distributed some masks but there were not enough for all of us,â? he added, urging the Kisumu County government to supply masks and send medical officers to check on the situation regularly.

Families at the Okanja school are fortunate, however, because it has plenty of rainwater collected in tanks. Church and other local leaders have donated equipment, so they can easily wash their hands and keep good hygiene.

Kenya has so far recorded more than 580 cases of the virus, with 26 confirmed deaths. Most infections have occurred in cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, but community transmission is also happening in other parts of the country.

Health cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in early May that people should observe the virus containment protocols recommended by the government, particularly keeping a distance of at least 2 metres (6.6 feet) from others.

â??If we donâ??t adhere to the measures, the disease will spread very quickly within our communities,â? he added.

While the coronavirus outbreak threatens all Kenyans, the heavy rains and floods have made thousands of families more vulnerable to the virus, aid workers said.

Nearly 200 people have been killed by floods and landslides in Kenya this year â?? considerably more deaths than caused by the COVID-19 respiratory disease so far, government figures show.

According to Peter Abwao, a spokesman for the Kenya Red Cross, about 17,000 households, each with an average of six members, have been affected by floods, with 10,000 families left homeless in the western part of the country.

The aid agency has been working with the Kisumu County government to get those displaced by the floods relocated to more schools, so that if possible, each family has their own classroom, to be able to maintain social distancing.

MORE FLOODS DUE

Mayâ??s weather forecast, from the Kenya Meteorological Department, predicted above-average rainfall during the first week of the month and near-average precipitation in the second half, with rains likely to continue into June.

Senior meteorologist Misiani Zachary warned further flooding was likely, especially in western areas that have already received lots of wet weather.

Zachary also said persistent rains could lead to huge cracks in roads and landslides, hampering relief for remote villages.

â??The ongoing rains will absolutely create impassable roads for the rescue team of medics and other emergency assistance,â? he added.

Julius Otieno, a community liaison officer at the Nyando Constituency Development Fund who has been helping flood victims on the frontline, said thousands of acres of crops and rice plantations had been destroyed.

Meeting the basic needs of displaced people was difficult during a pandemic, he added, warning that other diseases like cholera and malaria could easily break out.

â??As much as the government discourages people coming together in large numbers, we have no choice at the moment as this is an emergency,â? he said.

â??Food is provided (in the shelters), so we are trying our best to ensure movements in and out of the schools are restricted.â?

RISING LAKE

On top of the flash floods and major rivers bursting their banks, there is a new phenomenon to contend with: a backflow of water from Lake Victoria due to heavy rains in its catchment area, which is inundating its shores.

That has rendered more than 1,000 families homeless and roads impassable in parts of western Kenya, complicating the humanitarian situation further.

The lakeâ??s rising level is also affecting people in Uganda, where authorities say the problem began last October.

The waterâ??s depth has crept up from 12 metres to more than 13.3 metres, affecting major towns in the three countries that border the lake, including Kisumu in Kenya, Mwanza in Tanzania, and Entebbe in Uganda.

The effects of the lakeâ??s unusually high waters are hampering hydropower generation and transport, and have also flooded settlements on its shores.","Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['uproot', 'virus', 'fight', 'social', 'complicating', 'displaced', 'waters', 'families', 'coronavirus', 'schools', 'otieno', 'kenya', 'rains', 'floods', 'western']", ,flood

According to a release from Save Giraffes Now â?? a non-profit committed to saving giraffes from extinction â?? the flooding stranded a group of Rothschild's giraffes on the lake's Longicharo Island, cutting the animals off from the resources they needed to survive.

After learning of the giraffes' dire situation, Save Giraffes Now, the Ruko Community Conservancy, the Northern Rangelands Trust, and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) worked together to make a rescue plan. The fruits of this collaboration resulted in the creation of a custom barge (named ""The GiRaft"") and a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland for the animals.

Rescuers used The GiRaft to float the animals, one by one, from the flooded island to the fenced sanctuary built for them within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

""We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue,"" David O'Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, said in a statement. ""With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, everyone we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.""

Ruko rangers introduced The GiRaft to the animals before they boarded, leaving the giraffes' favorite treats inside the barge, so they got used to the idea of getting on and off the vessel voluntarily. In December 2020, they started floating the animals to the sanctuary, only moving the giraffes when it was safe.

On April 12, the rescue mission came to an end when the last giraffe stepped off The GiRaft and into the sanctuary. Among the final giraffes to make the trek was Noelle, a giraffe calf born on the flooded island around Christmastime. Rescuers waited until the calf was strong enough the make the barge journey to the sanctuary comfortably before moving her.

Now, all of the giraffes are together again inside their new sanctuary, where rangers say the animals are looking happy and healthy. Protecting this group is especially important with so few Rothschild's giraffes left in the world. Today, fewer than 3,000 of these giraffes are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya, per Save Giraffes Now.

""KWS is keen to grow the numbers of Rothschild giraffes in the country,"" Dr. Isaac Lekolool, senior veterinary officer for Kenya Wildlife Service, said in a statement. ""The management of Ruko Sanctuary, in collaboration with the local community, has done a commendable job in efforts to conserve this rare species. Indeed, Ruko Sanctuary is a model conservation initiative worth replicating elsewhere.""

""Not only did this groundbreaking project save these giraffes, but it also marks their reintroduction to the mainland for the first time in 70 years,"" O'Connor added. ""This rescue is a significant success for both of those reasons.""

From here, the long-term goal for the groups that rescued these giraffes is to introduce other Rothschild's giraffes from elsewhere in Kenya to those living in the sanctuary. These introductions will help build a genetically healthy population of giraffes that can eventually be released into the greater ecosystem outside the sanctuary.","Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&rect=0%2C278%2C2000%2C1278&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F04%2F13%2FGiraffe-rescue-float2-2000.jpg,"['significant', 'safety', 'floated', 'northern', 'ruko', 'island', 'save', 'rescue', 'sanctuary', 'kenyan', 'stranded', 'animals', 'float', 'flooded', 'rothschilds', 'giraffes', 'success']", ,flood

Heavy rains have intensified in Kenya over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides. At least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May.

Since the beginning of the countryâ??s â??long rainsâ?? season in early March, more than 233,000 people have been affected, including over 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society.

Flooding has been reported in more than three quarters of Kenyaâ??s counties (36 out of 47), with landslides reported in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the Governmentâ??s National Disaster Operations Centre.

The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding.

The heavy rains have increased the risk of health emergencies and provided conditions conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts in Kenya.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Heavy rains in Kenya have intensified over the past three weeks, causing death, displacement, flooding and landslides in multiple locations across the country. Landslides have caused destruction and loss of lives in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC).

The long rains season, which began in March, has to date affected over 233,000 people across 36 of Kenyaâ??s 47 counties, including more than 116,000 people displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 85,000 people are sheltering in displacement camps in the western (more than 55,800 people), North Rift (nearly 15,000), coastal (almost 7,800) and north-eastern (7,000 people) regions. According to the KRCS, at least 54 per cent of the displaced population are female-headed families, while 11 per cent are children under age 5. Kenyaâ??s Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang, confirmed during a press conference on 6 May that at least 194 people have been killed by the floods since March. Damage to infrastructure, including schools, houses, roads and bridges has been reported, and over 8,000 acres of farmland, mainly rice nearly mature, have reportedly been destroyed, according to the Government.

In western Kenya, one of the hardest-hit regions, at least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May. Meanwhile, the rising level of Lake Victoria is impacting families in Kisumu,

Siaya, Busia, Migori and Nyanza counties. According to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, the water level in the Lake has risen by more than two metres, a situation last seen when the overflow rose by close to 2.5 metres between 1960 and 1964.

In the north-western region, at least 15 people reportedly died and nearly 4,000 were displaced following a mudslide triggered by heavy rains on 18 April in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, according to the KRCS. Multiple homes, a shopping centre and a police post have been damaged. The displaced are sheltered in Sambalat Primary School, where a rescue command centre has been established to coordinate humanitarian assistance. According to humanitarian partners, access to the area remains challenging, as roads have been damaged and heavy rains continue in the area. West Pokot County is prone to landslides and has faced several similar incidents in November 2019.

In Mount Kenya and the Aberdares, heavy rainfall has caused an increase in the volume of the Seven Fork Dam, with flooding reported downstream in areas around Tana River, according to media reports. The Government has urged residents living along Tana River and Garrisa districts to move to higher grounds, as water levels in Kiambere. Kindaruma and Masinga dams are likely to overflow. The Government has also issued a red flood alert to people living in upper Kitui, Murangâ??a and Elgeyo-Marakwet counties.

The heavy rainfall has increased the risk of disease outbreaks and hampered efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Marsabit county and parts of north-eastern region. People displaced by floods and landslides are living in temporary camps, where more than 70 per cent of people do not have adequate access to clean water. Congestion, poor sanitation, inadequate food and other essentialsâ??such as medicines, mosquito nets, bedding and clothesâ??are major concerns, according to KRCS. Displaced people are also vulnerable to pneumonia, bilharzia, diarrhoea and cholera, which are prevalent during flooding.

The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned that more heavy rains are expected in the coming days, especially in the Rift Valley, central, western and coastal areas. These conditions are conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts.","Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1516031-ROSEA_20200507_Kenya_Floods_FlashUpdate%231.png?itok=4qgTlDuv,"['rift', 'rains', 'regions', 'heavy', 'update', 'displaced', 'reported', 'coastal', 'landslides', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', '2020', 'floods']", ,flood

The County Government of Mandera, Kenya.

Already navigating the coronavirus pandemic and the worst invasion of desert locusts for more than 25 years, parts of East Africa are now being devastated by flooding. Heavy rains over the last month have led to overflowing rivers and lakes and mudslides, with Kenya particularly impacted. Almost 200 people have lost their lives and according to the Kenyan Red Cross, while hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced since the rainy season began in March. Authorities and international organizations on the ground face an uphill battle against spiraling food insecurity, which had already been exacerbated by the locust outbreak, while at the same time working to curtail the spread of Covid-19, which remains the main focus of government resources.

Consecutive climate shocks

The latest floods have followed a series of intermittent droughts and flooding. Oxfam's Director of Humanitarian Systems in Kenya, Matthew Cousins, told CNBC that these weather events and the locust outbreak are the latest in ""a decade of back-to-back crises"" linked to climate change. ""It's a bit of a triple whammy really with Covid, locusts, floods, and it's happening more and more often which is our primary concern,"" Cousins told CNBC via telephone from Nairobi. ""Cycles between the droughts are getting a lot shorter, which impairs recovery time for herds for the poorest families to get their lives back. These areas are particularly vulnerable anyway, you've got underlying absolute poverty of anywhere up to 90% in some of the northern counties,"" he explained. Jemimah Khamadi Wekhomba, Kenya's health and nutrition coordinator for Action Against Hunger, said NGOs and authorities on the ground have barely had time to respond to one crisis before another hits.

Residents in Mandera County, Kenya, assess the damage from the latest round of flooding which has devastated the region. The County Government of Mandera, Kenya.

""These communities' roads were cut off, their infrastructure was destroyed, communication was destroyed, the health facilities submerged, schools submerged,"" she told CNBC. Wekhomba added that thousands of displaced people had been forced to move into the houses of friends or relatives, or into makeshift camps in vacant schools, which presents new challenges to social distancing in the age of Covid-19. ""The issue is there is not enough funding in terms of a response because the needs keep on increasing over and over again. There is a need for funding which the government cannot support by itself,"" she said, adding that the international community has a role to play. The International Monetary Fund last week announced a $739 million disbursement to Kenya under its Rapid Credit Facility, aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic. So far, just 887 cases have been confirmed in the country, but policymakers are wary of the impact the virus could have if allowed to take root in densely populated informal settlements. Wekhomba said policymakers and the affected communities were both ""overwhelmed"" by the scale and concurrence of the crises. She suggested that beyond the immediate response, funding will be required for a further three to five years to return affected communities to stability and better equip them to weather future shocks.

""People are talking about the effects of climate change, but we are here. We are already facing the effects of climate change,"" she told CNBC. ""There is a need to support these communities in terms of knowing how to handle their shocks and bounce back to their normal lives."" At a press conference last week, Eugene Wamalwa, the Kenyan cabinet Secretary for Devolution, appealed to Kenyans living in areas susceptible to floods and landslides to relocate to safer ground, with the situation expected to worsen in the coming weeks as rains persist until June. Wamalwa noted that the last time Lake Victoria reached current levels was in the 1950s, while Lake Naivasha has reached levels not seen since 1961. Along with ravaging crops and communities directly, the rains also favor the locusts' reproduction, with a second wave anticipated around June, coinciding with harvest season and further adding to the mounting humanitarian crisis.

Return of the locusts

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 20 million people are in severe acute food insecurity in East Africa. A single Desert Locust swarm, which can contain up to 150 million insects per square kilometer, is capable of eating as much food in a day as 35,000 people. It is thought to be the most destructive migratory pest in the world. The FAO's Desert Locust appeal, launched in January, has now requested $153 million in external funding and currently covers 10 countries â?? Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Yemen.

If left unchecked, the FAO estimates that the locusts could multiply 400 times by the end of June. Oxfam is coordinating with local partner organizations on the ground in affected areas across northern and eastern Kenya, who are working to track the swarms and deploy aerial and ground pesticide operations. ""I don't think they will be able to get on top of this swarm, so we will be looking at a third wave a little bit later on, and then after that, the locusts will naturally migrate with the winds back up north and then out over the Arabian sea to parts of the Middle East, or more likely Iran,"" Oxfam's Cousins said. He added that communities have ""very little room for maneuver"" in terms of food security should the next wave coincide with harvest season in June. ""With Covid and the floods hampering transport connections, the pesticides have been slow coming in, because they're normally brought in by flight and now they have to be brought in by sea,"" Cousins explained. The greatest concern, Cousins said, is the impact of the climate crisis on long term food security, particularly for children, in some of the poorest communities and harshest regions of the country.

[Collins Oduor, Standard]

The Nubian community has called on authorities to improve conditions at a field in Kolwa, Kisumu County, where they are living in makeshift structures after they were evicted from a disputed land.

They have also urged the county government to expedite the process of resettling them.

Kenya Railways (KR) has laid claim to the land in Kibos, which the Nubians say was given to them by the colonial government in 1937.

The field, next to Kisumu East CDF office, is prone to floods that have made life difficult, especially for the elderly. The 850 people have been living in deplorable conditions for three months now since they were evicted from what KR says was a railway reserve.

KR accused them of encroaching on land meant for expansion of the railway line and forcefully evicted them.

The Nubians say their eviction was illegal.

They were moved to the land where they are currently living by the Kisumu City authorities.

â??We had lived on the land since 1937 before we were forcefully evicted. It has been tough for some of us, especially those of us who are elderly,â? said 82-year-old Khadija Rajab.

â??We did not expect this. But if we must move out so the railway can be expanded, then the government should compensate us,â? she said.

Rajab said other than floods, they have to contend will mosquitoes and rodents. She wondered why they were taken to the flood-prone field, a move she said has complicated their lives.

They have been depending on Kenya Red Cross Society, relatives and well wishers for food.

Abdi Asha, 39, called for justice saying KR had no right to take away their land.

â??We are Kenyans by birth and deserve fair treatment,â? Asha said.

Most of those living on the 18 acres belonging to the county government cannot fend for themselves.

Acting City Manager Abala Wanga said the county government has started the process of resettling the Nubians.

In the meantime, Wanga said they had built three tents to improve their living conditions and were in the process of controlling floods at the site.

Hassan Hussein, an elder, said they were happy the county government had started settling them, but urged the authorities to expedite the process.

Last month, the Environment and Land Court extended conservatory orders stopping KR from forcefully evicting the Nubians from the land.

This followed a petition by Fatuma Bilal, Rashid Sadii, Mohamed Abdulrahman, Mwanamisi Kinduli, Yaya Musa and Asaman Musa filed on behalf of the community.

A small calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni were loaded onto the same steel barge that carried the other seven one-mile through Lake Baringo to the Roku Conservancy.

The herd crossed what was once a peninsula to feed, but days of intense rain cut off access to the mainland and imprisoned them on Longicharo Island.

Ngarikoni gave birth to Noelle while on the island and were the last to be saved due to the extra cared needed to move such a young giraffe.

'Relief and elation emanated from the rescue team as little Noelle stepped confidently off the custom-built barge and onto dry land, followed by her mother, marking the successful conclusion of this ambitious rescue,' the rescuers shard in a statement.

Two juvenile females, Susan and Pasaka, were rescued weeks after and the four remaining adult females, Ngarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, and one adult male, Lbarnnoti, were moved this year.

The area had been plagued with intense rain that caused water levels of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day.

Ruko rangers brought food to the stranded animals, but with rising water they a long-term was needed.

Working with the other teams, the rangers attempted to get each animal use to the barge by leaving treats like pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos on board with the hopes the giraffes would walk inside voluntarily and make the journey with ease.

Rift Valley, Kenya â?? It was seven years ago when Job Chebon, owner of a tourist lodge on the edge of Lake Baringo, first noticed the waters near his property rise dangerously.

â??The water would come and then recede. For years, it would come a little bit further to dry land, to our homes, then go back,â? he said earlier in August, standing on a sandbag leading to the flooded reception lobby of his Soi Safari Lodge â?? at least, what remains of it.

â??In 2020, it has come with a vengeance.â?

The rising waters of Lake Baringo in the Great Rift Valley have dealt a heavy blow to tourism, a key sector in this part of Kenya.

Chebon said he had lost thousands of dollars in accommodation fees and damage to his property, while several other hotels in the region have also been either totally or partially submerged.

Elizabeth Meyerhoff, a social scientist, who along her husband Murray Roberts, has been studying the lake since 2013, said the water level has been rising at about 2.5cm (0.98 inches) a day.

â??In the last seven years, [it] has raised to about 9-12 metres (30-39 feet).â?

The couple, who live next door to Chebonâ??s lodge, have also been running a programme aimed at rehabilitating semi-arid environments by producing dry land seed which they have already distributed to more than 900 farmers.

Almost all the land where the grass, mostly meant for grazing was planted, is underwater. The coupleâ??s stores, offices and a dispensary have had a similar fate.

â??The water comes from the rivers, but because of deforestation itâ??s bringing down huge amount of flash flooding with sediments which fill the bottom of the lake,â? said Meyerhoff, after a tour on a boat â?? a mode of transport that is the new norm in these parts of Baringo.

Climate change and unusually heavy rains this year have also contributed to the problem.

The rising waters have displaced more than 5,000 people in 2020, according to government officials, submerging homes, schools, roads, hospitals, farmland â?? and even entire islands.

â??This island was whole, we could move around,â? said Nongaseuria Lenaisiaku, an elderly lady who has had to relocate to higher ground twice after Kokwa Island was split into three parts.

â??Now the water has separated us from our relatives. I donâ??t even have a boat take me to other parts of the village.â?

Nearby, in Rugus, another fishing village of mud-thatched huts, Singh Lenapunya was seated on his raft â?? scaling fish he had just caught. He acknowledged that the rising waters have brought along plenty of fish â?? but also crocodile and hippos. A herdsman was recently killed by a crocodile.

Lake Bogoria rising

However, it is not just Lake Baringo and its dependents that are in trouble.

Further to the south, Lake Bogoria â?? a World Heritage site which at times hosts up to 1.2 million flamingoes â?? has also been rising. Just a few years ago, Baringo and Bogoria â?? freshwater and alkaline lakes, respectively â?? were 20km (12 miles) apart, but local officials say that distance has now been cut to 13km (eight miles).

Located on an eponymous national reserve, Lake Bogoria is a significant tourist attraction, whose hundreds of bird species and beautiful landscape, as well as geysers and hot springs, draw visitors from many parts of the world.

Lake Bogoria is a major tourist attraction [Chaterine Wambua-Soi/Al Jazeera]

According to James Kimaru, the game reserveâ??s senior warden, the lake has expanded from 34 square kilometres in 2017 to 43 square kilometres in 2020.

â??Almost 80 percent of the hot springs are under water, especially the main ones which were shooting almost three metres up,â? said Kimaru. â??They used to be our main tourist attraction but now the number of visitors has reduced. The main road, the gate to our reserve and our offices are under water â?? we have to move for a second time. The hospital, hotels and homes adjacent to the reserve are also submerged.â?

Meanwhile, there are growing concerns about the swamps between the lakes. Both Meyerhoff and Kimaru said if the alkaline water from Bogoria reached the swamps which link to Baringoâ??s freshwater â?? it would be an ecological disaster.

With both lakes having no known channels that allow the flow of excess water, some scientists have suggested building a barrier between them. Others have recommended constructing a canal for water to flow out of Lake Baringo, which is rising faster. They say the water can be channelled through a natural course outlet further north.

It is still unclear, however, what the effect of such a move would be on Kenyan farmers and pastoralists downstream, as well as the lake itself.

Government officials told Al Jazeera they are examining these suggestions, while also carrying out a study to find out whether there are other reasons why the lakes are rising so fast to determine safe solutions to protect them and the millions of people whose lives are at stake.

Back in Soi Safari Lodge, Chebon said he is afraid that it is only a matter of time before his entire property â?? and with it, his entire livelihood â?? is swept away by the rising waters.","Sun, 30 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/56ccfa4c8551442aaea13f1c88c98858_18.jpeg?fit=999%2C562,"['lake', 'lakes', 'tourist', 'rift', 'bogoria', 'kenyas', 'rising', 'crisis', 'homes', 'valley', 'water', 'baringo', 'waters', 'going', 'lodge']", ,flood

Heavy overnight downpour that pounded Nairobi Monday has exposed the underbelly of the city that is poor drainage system.

Pools of water, flooded roads and over-flowing storm water drainages characterised most parts of the capital as residents woke up to a heavy rain causing pools of water that mixed with mounds of garbage, turning the city into an eyesore.

Nairobi residents were forced to hop, skip and jump through the puddles of water while businesses were interrupted as most of them had their entrance blocked by the sudden â??lakesâ? with flood-prone areas submerged in water.

â??I cannot open my business as usual because of the flash floods as I have to wait for the pools of water. This is crazy,â? said Mary Njeri, a shop owner in Nairobiâ??s city centre.

â??Look at my shoes, they are dirty after having to wade through the pools. This means I have to spend at least Sh50 bob to clean them,â? said James Omondi.

But this situation will not be a one-off with the Kenya Meteorological Department warning that the heavy rains in the city will continue throughout the week.

When it rains in Nairobi, the central business district to the outskirts of the city centre, flash floods and stagnant water have been a constant fixture.

The problem has been blamed on outdated designs and continuous dumping of solid waste in drainage systems.

Constructions on road reserves as well as trading activities including selling building materials like sand, stones, and ballast, some of which end up in the drains, have also been faulted for blocking the drainage systems.

â??The county government has never taken any step to address drainage issue in Nairobi. We are used to the floods whenever it rains so it does not come as a surprise,â? said another trader on Moi Avenue in Nairobi.

The menace has been perennial despite millions of shillings being spent by City Hall annually to address poor drainage systems in Nairobi.

When former Governor Mike Sonko assumed office, he accused his predecessor, Dr Evans Kidero, of squandering funds meant for rehabilitating drainage system in the county. But he fared no better with his administration also spending millions to address the problem with no tangible results.

In March 2018, City Hall together with the Directorate of Urban and Nairobi Metropolitan Development set aside Sh194 million to address the flooding menace in Nairobi. A total of Sh32 million was to be used to improve the drainage system in the county and put up measures to mitigate the effects of the heavy rains.","Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3395326/21fcd07cfce6e67c066d8b5242b8ec55/floods-na-data.jpg,"['drainage', 'nairobi', 'heavy', 'exposes', 'poor', 'pools', 'city', 'address', 'underbelly', 'water', 'deep', 'rains', 'rain', 'runs']", ,flood

At least 100 are dead and nearly 2,000 are homeless after heavy rains and thunderstorms led to severe flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent days.

Eugene Wamalwa, cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Devolution, said Thursday that at least 116 people had died in the country due to the flooding, which spans across 29 counties.

Massive landslides were also reported starting on Friday, leaving dozens displaced in the Kisii County region.

Flooding along the River Nzoia also left many homes submerged, with more than 1,800 now homeless across western Kenya.

Images showed residents setting up makeshift shelters on the raised ground near floodwaters.

""It has been flooding for three days now; I think the government is not even aware but now we are telling them,"" said one resident, Vincent Ochieng, according to Sky News. ""We are asking if there are any plans to assist us, only two boats are here for evacuating people.""

The Kenya Red Cross has also asked county governments for additional shelters, due to concerns that coronavirus could spread due to overcrowding.

The relief agency's secretary-general, Asha Mohammed, told the Daily Nation much more needed to be done for the people affected.

""We will be doing mobile outreaches with the county department of health to provide medicines and treat minor illnesses,"" she said.

But they face two problems: Many markets are already awash with plastic, and few countries are willing to be dumping grounds for the worldâ??s plastic waste.

The industry thinks it has found a solution to both problems in Africa.

According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, an industry group representing the worldâ??s largest chemical makers and fossil fuel companies is lobbying to influence United States trade negotiations with Kenya, one of Africaâ??s biggest economies, to reverse its strict limits on plastics â?? including a tough plastic-bag ban. It is also pressing for Kenya to continue importing foreign plastic garbage, a practice it has pledged to limit.

Plastics makers are looking well beyond Kenyaâ??s borders. â??We anticipate that Kenya could serve in the future as a hub for supplying U.S.-made chemicals and plastics to other markets in Africa through this trade agreement,â? Ed Brzytwa, the director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council, wrote in an April 28 letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.

The United States and Kenya are in the midst of trade negotiations and the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has made clear he is eager to strike a deal.

Hundreds of thousands have been forced by torrential rains to flee their homes across Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda.

Many weather stations have recorded their highest levels of rainfall in 40 years, damaging homes and destroying water sources, making it impossible for families to practice handwashing or practice social distancing despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Vital infrastructure across the region, including hospitals, roads and bridges have been washed away, further compounding the difficulty of accessing healthcare.

By Luke Anami

East Africa continues to suffer the effects of flooding and landslides as more than 481,000 people are currently displaced and over 360 people have died.

The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned of more rainfall this month.

Already, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, has hit the highest water levels in over 50 years, at 13.45 metres, causing widespread flooding in many areas.

â??With the ongoing rains expected to continue, the water levels may rise further, aggravating the challenges of flooding especially on the Kenyan side that has more rivers that drain into Lake Victoria,â? said Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ali-Said Matano.

Across the region, it is a tale of death, displacement and destruction.

In Uganda, Lake Victoriaâ??s rising water levels have displaced communities living close to the shoreline, and created challenges for the countryâ??s hydropower infrastructure.

Ugandaâ??s Minister of Water and Environment Sam Cheptoris attributed the backflow and increased flooding to the emergence of several floating islands that has led to the blockage of River Nile, which is the only outflow of Lake Victoria.

In a statement last week, Mr Cheptoris said the islands will be removed or stopped from moving as soon as they are identified through surveillance.

Sweeping floods in western Uganda killed four people and displaced 5,000 as heavy rains continue to inundate the region, according to Ugandan police.

Isingiro County South member of parliament Alex Byarugaba Bakunda said they have recorded 5,000 people who have been displaced, and called for emergency government support.

In Kenya, hundreds have been killed by floods and about 161,000 displaced.

â??More than 237 Kenyans have lost their lives to floods. The rains are still pounding many parts of the country and our dams are filled up,â? said Eugene Wamalwa, Kenyaâ??s Devolution Cabinet Secretary, on May 13 after assessing the effects of floods in the country.

Homes and recreation centres built on and near wetlands in Kisumu (Kenya), Mwanza (Tanzania) and in Entebbe (Uganda) are flooded.

In western Kenya, the rivers Nzoia, Lusumu, Yala, Kipsangui, Malakisi, Sio and Malabar, and Lake Naivasha water levels have risen.

â??In areas around Lake Naivasha, many people have been displaced, while Budalangi in Kenya has been affected by backflows from Lake Victoria and River Nzoia, which has burst its banks,â? said Mr Wamalwa.

In Burundi, around 50,000 people have been affected, most of whom were displaced as Rusizi River burst its banks on April 30, for the second time in two weeks.

Ruined harvest

In Rwanda, an estimated 2,200 households (11,000 people) have been affected by heavy rain this year, and 1,000 hectares of cropsâ??potatoes, maize, bananas, tea and sugarâ??have been destroyed.

The floods have left at least 70 people dead. Since May 1, floods have severely impacted seven districtsâ??Gakenke, Musanze, Nyabihu, Muganga, Ruhango, Rubavu and Ngororero.

In Tanzania, more than 31,000 people have been affected, including 13,500 displaced.

The Tanzania Red Cross Society and local government authorities have reported floods in Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Katavi, Mara, Manyara, Kigoma and Rukwa regions, with about 4,409 households and 10,540 people affected. Over 752 acres of farms were destroyed.

Lindi and Coast regions were among the first parts of Tanzania hit by floods, with 21 deaths and 1,702 people displaced families early this year.

About 180 houses in Western Tanzania with 1,655 people were affected by flooding water from Lake Tanganyika, government authorities said.

The Zanzibar Commission for Disasters said early this week that six people have died, 200 displaced and some 690 houses damaged on the main island of Unguja and the twin island of Pemba.

In Somalia, torrential rains and riverine floods have inundated at least 27 districts, with Belet Weyne in Hiran region worst-hit.

The recent heavy rains come just after an above-average short-rains season in the region, driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole, which affected at least 3.4 million people across Eastern Africa and caused water bodies across the region to swell.

This month, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Climate Prediction and Applications Centre predicts heavy rainfall above 200 mm expected in western and northwestern Kenya and along the Ethiopian rift.

Thermal discomfort is expected in south and southeastern Sudan extending into northwestern Ethiopia and northern south Sudan.

But the rescues have begun - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/12/world/giraffe-rescue-kenya-cnnphotos/index.html,"Asiwa the giraffe is ferried off a flooded island in Kenya. She was blindfolded to keep her calm during the trip.

Asiwa the giraffe is ferried off a flooded island in Kenya. She was blindfolded to keep her calm during the trip.

Time was running out for Asiwa, a Rothschildâ??s giraffe in western Kenya.

For years, she and seven other giraffes had been living on a peninsula that reached out into Lake Baringo. But rising lake levels, caused by relentless rain, had gradually turned the peninsula into an island, leaving the animals stranded.

It was especially grim for Asiwa, who was stuck on a marshy part of the island, separated from the other giraffes with only about an acre of land to forage for food. And the flooding was only getting worse.

She needed to be rescued.

Mike Parkei, a ranger for the Ruko Conservancy, looks after the eight giraffes stranded on an island in Kenya.

Asiwa is attended to after being hit with a tranquilizer dart on the day of her rescue. She was not hurt; she just had to be sedated before being guided to the barge.

Conservationists have teamed up with Kenyan wildlife authorities and local members of the community to start moving the giraffes off the island and into a new sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

Asiwa was the first to be ferried to safety last week, taking about an hourlong ride on a custom-made steel barge. A second giraffe, Pasaka, was rescued the day after Asiwa.

But itâ??s not so easy to move these gentle giants.

â??They don't know that you're trying to help them,â? said David Oâ??Connor, the president of Save Giraffes Now who has been actively participating in the rescue efforts. â??They think you're a predator. So they're really trying to work against you, which makes it even harder.â?

The initial hope, Oâ??Connor said, was that theyâ??d be able to coax the giraffes onto the barge by putting mangoes and other treats there. But because of the rainy season, thereâ??s been an abundance of food on the island. The treats would not be enough.

That meant the giraffes would have to be hit with a tranquilizer dart â?? and that is an especially dangerous proposition because of their anatomy. Oâ??Connor said that when giraffes go down on the ground, they can choke on their own saliva, or their brains can be damaged by the changes in blood pressure. So itâ??s important that once the giraffe falls, a vet is there to immediately counteract the drug with a reversal drug.

â??It's not like an elephant or a rhino where you just dart it, it flops over and it's fine,â? he said. â??The giraffes, they're kind of like a Formula One car. You can't mess with their innards too much or they really have problems.â?

Pasaka, a younger giraffe, was rescued a day after Asiwa.

The rescue mission was a collaborative effort involving the Kenya Wildlife Service, local community members, and conservationists with Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust.

Rescuers keep a close eye on Pasaka before helping her to the barge.

Asiwa went down in thick acacia brush, probably as far away from the barge as possible. But the team was there immediately to attend to her needs.

They put guide ropes around her shoulders and a blindfold over her eyes to keep her calm.

â??She was incredible,â? Oâ??Connor said. â??She's a very, very tough girl. â?¦ Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.â?

Asiwa is guided to a waiting barge.

The rescued giraffes are being moved to a new sanctuary at the Ruko Conservancy, where they will be protected from poachers and predators.

It was smooth sailing on the barge, with Asiwaâ??s head poking over the high walls. She still had her blindfold on, and socks were put in her ears to block out sound.

She was surrounded by Oâ??Connor and the other rescue workers, who kept their voices low and focused intently on the job at hand.

â??Although it got all our hearts pounding at the beginning of the sedation, at the end of it, it was absolutely perfect,â? he said. â??And Asiwa was absolutely wonderful on the barge ride over. I think she was built for the sea.â?

Boats surround Asiwaâ??s barge on the day of her rescue.

David Oâ??Connor, the president of Save Giraffes Now, keeps an eye on Asiwa.

Photographer Ami Vitale documented Asiwaâ??s rescue mission and was there once the barge reached the mainland.

â??The wonderful part was watching her gently amble off the boat once the blindfold was released as if nothing had happened,â? Vitale said. â??It really was a scene that could have been biblical.â?

There was a celebration at the Ruko Conservancy, which was formed in 2006 by two formerly warring communities.

â??The plan was to make the giraffe a symbol of unity and peace to end their long-standing conflict,â? said Vitale, a National Geographic photographer whose work often reminds us of how our fate is intertwined with the fate of other species.

Since she started documenting a story about one of the worldâ??s last white rhinos in 2009, Vitale has focused on wildlife and conservation efforts. Her latest book shows how China is trying to save pandas from extinction.

â??My hope is that these images can inspire people and remind them that this is the only home we have,â? she said. â??We have poked some big holes in our shared little life raft. What happens next is in all of our hands.â?

Pasaka was the second of eight planned rescues.

Rescuers move Pasaka to safety.

Six giraffes still remain on the flooded island in Kenya, but the plan is to save them by the end of January.

The Rothchildâ??s giraffe is an endangered subspecies. Because of poaching and habitat loss, only about 2,000 of them remain in Africa â?? 800 in Kenya â?? according to Oâ??Connor.

â??The hope is that this is just the first step of reintroducing these giraffes back to their historical home across the Western Rift Valley, hopefully over the next 20-30 years,â? he said.

Action Against Hunger, Kenya

In Kenya, Action Against Hunger is helping communities displaced by deadly flooding

When mudslides and heavy rainfall struck the area of Chesegon Center in West Pokot County, Kenya, in April, dozens of people were killed, 2,000 were displaced, and many more lost their livelihoods.

Floods happen quickly, but for families who lost everything, recovery after disaster takes months, even years. Action Against Hungerâ??s teams in West Pokot were there every step of the way to help, even after the waters receded.

With support from the Fields Foundation, Action Against Hunger quickly launched an emergency response to help the neediest families. Our teams distributed crucial supplies, provided lifesaving nutrition services, and promoted healthy hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.

We also installed new handwashing stations and provided primary health services. Additionally, we continue to train and support health volunteers in West Pokot, who work each day to improve hygiene, nutrition, and health in their communities.

HELPING THOSE DISPLACED BY FLOODING

Eveline Kutoyi, a 40-year-old woman, barely survived the floods. The raging waters â?? which carried rocks and logs in the torrent â?? swept her miles away from Chesegon Center, leaving her with bruises and a broken leg.

She recovered from her injuries, but after being discharged from the hospital, Eveline realized she had lost everything, including her farm. While thankful that her life had been spared, she could not escape the pain of her loss and the uncertainty of how to start her life over.

â??I felt like all the wounds on my body were open, I was heartbroken, and my life was frozen,â? she remembers.

Eveline and her four children found refuge with another family, who offered to host them for two months â?? but life was not the same again. They would sleep on rags, recycle clothing, share plates during meals, and share basic items like soap and even bathe without it when they ran out.

In June, Eveline received a jerrican, mattress, bucket, laundry detergent, soap, a dignity kit with feminine hygiene supplies, and a kitchen set from Action Against Hunger and the Field Foundation. To Eveline, they were â??life changers.â?

â??I did not have money to buy soap or [cooking pots] of high quality like the ones I received,"" says Eveline. ""We used to sleep on rags during the cold nights, but life changed when we received mattresses. Iâ??m so grateful to Action Against Hunger for restoring our dignity back.â?

IMPROVING HYGIENE & SANITATION

When the floods hit Chesegon Center, families lost their homes and access to clean water, hygiene supplies, and safe sanitation, as well as health and nutrition services. Living in displacement camps, the most vulnerable populations faced a higher risk of diarrhea, malaria, respiratory infections, and malnutrition.

To prevent the spread of disease among the displaced, Action Against Hunger worked with community health volunteers (CHVs) to spread the word about good hygiene practices, healthy child care and feeding, and COVID-19 preventive measures. The CHVs also helped with active case finding.

Faith Chesuko, who has been working as a CHV for more than three years, found the trainings on handwashing and hygiene very effective. She understood her responsibility to practice what she had learned and pass it on to her community. In her own home, she installed a homemade â??tippy tapâ? for handwashing, a dish rack, and kept everything swept and clean.

All of these changes were the result of her training. â??Initially, the only times I thought it was important to wash my hands were before and after eating but now I understand that there are other critical times for handwashing,â? she says.

Faith enjoys her role as community educator: she visits homes, spreads the word, and feels motivated by her neighborsâ?? trust and willingness to change. With her encouragement, hygiene and sanitation practices are improving. Throughout the village, improvised handwashing stations, compost pits, dish racks, and latrines built with local materials started appearing.

â??The lives of the community members have not been the same since I started teaching them. They now understand the importance of handwashing, the need to have a toilet and the importance of clean and safe water,â? says Faith.

Before her visits, community members would drink water directly from rivers and streams, without treating it. Many families did not have latrines or toilets in their homes and used the forests and fields instead â?? resulting in contaminated water and sickness.

Now, according to Faithâ??s records, diarrhea has significantly decreased. Before, she treated or referred as many as 20 diarrhea cases in a month, but sheâ??s had just six cases in the last two months.

â??I am so grateful for the training I received from Action Against Hunger,â? says Faith. â??It has given me the confidence to walk into houses and share the knowledge. I am excited to save the lives of my community.â?","Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['hunger', 'hygiene', 'hope', 'action', 'received', 'handwashing', 'community', 'lost', 'health', 'kenya', 'water', 'floods', 'life']", ,flood

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenyaâ??s western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africaâ??s largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called â??backflowâ?.

â??We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,â? said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

â??There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,â? said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lakeâ??s water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

â??Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,â? he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Ugandaâ??s Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Ugandaâ??s environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the â??speedy movement of water into the lakes and riversâ? feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoriaâ??s shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

â??While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,â? Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenyaâ??s government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

â??The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,â? Opere said.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['victoria', 'lake', 'rainfall', 'rivers', 'expose', 'need', 'climate', 'recordhigh', 'water', 'dams', 'flooding', 'cooperation', 'floods', 'school', 'uganda']", ,flood

Public schools have reopened in Kenya following a closure ordered by the government in March 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The flooding has made parents to spend more in maintaining their kids attendance to schools despite the beckoning dangers

""When the coronavirus came all the pupils stayed home, but today the schools reopen and we are forced to take them back to their original schools where they were learning. But it's impossible as the school is marooned and the only way to reach it is through water transport in boats. But they have to eat lunch and we also pay the boat fare again in the evening for the return,"" a parent said.

The floods now poise high risks to the learners as some of them are expected to compete with other students and schools in the upcoming national examinations.

""There is a lot of water in the school. We cannot learn like the others (in other schools), but we will sit the same national exams,"" a student told journalists.

Villages are sinking, schools, places of worship, highways, and farms.

Hundreds of families and thousands of wildlife are under threat as water levels of lakes along the Rift Valley basin continuously increase.

Most vulnerable of all is the El Molo ethnic group, one of the smallest in Kenya, living on islands in Lake Turkana, a lake on the northern side of Rift Valley.

Since Lake Turkana's waters started rising, they have moved to higher grounds, mixing with other communities, explains James Emose, an El Molo community elder.

""Our home in Choro, Namukuse and Longech Islands are now underwater. We don't have a place to stay right now. We were rescued by well-wishers in boats to the shores of Kalokol. Our home is in the middle of the lake,"" he says.

According to a 2019 census, there are only 1,104 El Molo residents.

The region has always been unstable geologically, its name refers to the fracturing of the Earth's crust, where two tectonic plates collide.

But now, deforestation in the highlands has decreased the permeability of the soil and recent heavy rainfall has swamped much of the low-lying land.

Scientists say heavy rains in East Africa made 2019 one of the region's wettest years on record, the water drains into the lakes.

Without the forests, the rain erodes the land, washing tones and tones of silt into lakes.

This clogs the underground drainage fault lines that means water cannot drain out of the lakes, causing water levels to rise dramatically following the 2019 rainfall.

""The Rift Valley lakes have underground drainage which is basically because of normal faults. These normal faults have actually been buried by the siltation. Now when they are buried by the siltation, the permeability is reduced. And that is why you see the high water levels within the lakes,"" explains geologist and government consultant, Bernard Limo.

""One of the communities that has been 'impactly' affected is the El Molo community which has lived within Lake Turkana and has existed there depending on the lake and even the Island around there. Currently the Island has been submerged by water and the community is displaced and we don't know whether this community will be able to survive or cope up with the new ecosystem,"" he says.

Wild animals

Lake Naivasha waters, for instance, have claimed more than one kilometre inland since 2019, according to the Kenyan Ministry of Water and Fisheries.

This animated map shows the increase in water levels at Lake Naivasha Crescent Island between 2001-2021.

Limo is surveying the flooding in Lake Naivasha with local Stephen Kuria.

Lake Naivasha resident Kuria describes how people were caught off guard by rising waters.

""The water was filling in slowly such that nobody thought it was that serious. So, people were not cautious that these waters will one day flood their houses and businesses. So, they were not careful to stow away their wares. So, after one month is when water got into those houses over there and that's when people started demolishing and rebuilding on this upper side,"" he says.

Hippos and other wild animals have invaded the area and can pose a danger to people.

Kuria says locals need help moving away to safer land.

""This water can retract, but future rains might bring it back there and find people and displace them again. So, if they can be compensated and go a little further from the lake. Because now wild animals have invaded the area, there are buffaloes, there are hippopotamus which may attack the people. So even if water will go back, people can be attacked by animals, and even snakes, because snakes have also come and can attack them,"" he says.

""These losses are basically because of the losses in terms of the schools, displacement of human beings, and also loss in terms of capital, that is the construction of buildings within here, and even indirect losses as a result of businesses that have been lost around the lakes."" says Limo.

All that can be seen are submerged homes.

Owners are making do with makeshift tents, hoping nature will have mercy and retract the waters back to their original levels.","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/05/35/55/10/1024x538_cmsv2_4b73e76a-4b32-565e-9c23-70fe9416788c-5355510.jpg?1612766592,"['lake', 'lakes', 'el', 'rift', 'kenyas', 'levels', 'naivasha', 'community', 'valley', 'landless', 'water', 'molo', 'waters', 'flooded', 'communities']", ,none

Wildlife conservationists braved crocodile infested waters to rescue a critically endangered Nubian giraffe trapped on a flooding island in Kenya

The remarkable rescue was organized by Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) today joined forces with the US-based non-profit Save Giraffes Now and an African non-government organization.

Conservationists with KWS, Save Giraffes Now and Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) collaborated with local community members to undertake the monumental task of moving the massive animal to Ruko Community Wildlife Conservancy, a protected wildlife reserve.

Aswia has been brought to safety, however seven more giraffes' lives are in limbo.

There are two juvenile females, Susan and Pasaka that are scheduled to be moved later this week.

The giraffe, named Asiwa, was one of eight stranded due to days on intense rain that cut off access to the mainland, leaving the herd imprisoned on Longicharo Island

The boat was is strong enough to hold a massive giraffe and is designed in a fashion that keeps it from escaping

The four remaining adult females, Nkarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, and one adult male, Lbarnnoti, will be moved early next year.

The area has been plagued with intense rain, which has caused the water level of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day.

David O'Connor, president of Dallas, Texas-based Save Giraffes Now, said: 'There is great urgency to execute this rescue.'

'We couldn't have asked for a better result, and we're eager to move the others soon. With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters.'

Asiwa was loaded into the barge made of steel and empty drums, with the help of the team, and then transported four miles down the river to safety

The animals are Rothschild's, or Nubian, giraffe, which is a critically endangered subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda.

Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

Dr. Patrick Omondi, KWS Director Biodiversity Research and Planning, said: 'These giraffes are critical to our ongoing efforts to implement the National Giraffe Recovery Strategy 2020-2025.'

'At Ruko, they'll be protected from predators, poachers and other threats.'

The giraffe were originally reintroduced to the peninsula in 2011, in hopes that the isolated location would provide shelter from poaching and increase the population in their native Western Kenyan range.

Asiwa boarded a custom-made steel barge, then was taken four miles down the river to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the Ruko Conservancy.

The barge, build by the Ruko community, is designed and built specifically to carry tall, heavy giraffes.

The rectangular steel structure floats atop a series of empty drums and the sides were reinforced to keep the giraffe from jumping out.

Susan Myers, Save Giraffes Now founder and CEO, said: 'Each giraffe has its own personality.'

'Some are very timid, while others are brave and go onto the barge readily. This is a painstaking process, and the team is being very deliberate about the training.'

For years, the local communities of the Baringo Lake region â?? the Pokot and the Ilchamus tribes â?? were in deep and often vicious conflict.

Yet the plight of these giraffe worsened to such a degree that the elders of those tribes in these areas (Rugus and Komolion) put years of warfare aside to unite and protect the giraffe.

The area has been plagued with intense rain, which has caused the water level of Lake Baringo, which is surrounding the peninsula, to steadily rising up to six inches a day. David O'Connor, president of Dallas, Texas-based Save Giraffes Now, said: 'There is great urgency to execute this rescue'

Conservancy rangers have been taking supplemental food to the island for them, as well as conducting routine health checks

Mike Parkei, a ranger at Ruko Conservancy, said: 'These giraffe are the heart of our homeland.

'We knew we had to come together and do everything possible to save them.'

As the lake water slowly claimed the peninsula, the giraffe were forced onto a shrinking slice of land on which to forage.

Conservancy rangers have been taking supplemental food to the island for them, as well as conducting routine health checks.

Nkarikoni is also pregnant, seven months into a 15-month gestation and officials hope she will give birth at Ruko Conservancy.

'In 40 to 50 years, we hope to have repopulated the entire Western Rift Valley through the chain of community conservancies,' O'Connor said. 'It's unthinkable to imagine an Africa without giraffes, and this rescue may well help ensure the future of this species.'

In a trial run for the larger move, several other animals were recently relocated to Ruko, including two rather aggressive ostriches and a handful of impala and warthogs.","Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/12/02/21/36373090-0-image-a-32_1606944842603.jpg,"['nubian', 'barge', 'giraffe', 'conservationists', '16foot', 'ruko', 'island', 'save', 'rescue', 'peninsula', 'stranded', 'steel', 'kenya', 'community', 'flooding', 'giraffes', 'wildlife']", ,none

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been â??literally â?? submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africaâ??s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and youâ??re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly thereâ??s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall â?? you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.â?

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesnâ??t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

â??The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,â? he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa â?? what isnâ??t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

â??It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, itâ??s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,â? he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

â??My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens. Over time, we have noticed that, because of what I think is negligence, we have been involved in practices that have completely destroyed our rain cycle, our climate is deteriorating every other day. I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.â?

This, he says, is a living nightmare. This is his home, and he wants future generations to see its beauty, too.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/kaltura-video-thumbs/1_z/1_zr629y9g.jpg,"['widespread', 'rainfall', 'hospital', 'know', 'destroyed', 'youre', 'world', 'large', 'lose', 'east', 'africa', 'relief', 'sections', 'floods', 'devastate', 'uganda']", ,flood

New Business Ethiopia - New Business Ethiopia,https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/solution-for-kenyas-flooding-ahead-of-rainy-season/,"The annual rainy season in March â?? June, in conjunction with climate change, is a major concern for Kenyans across the country. Dirty flood waters rendering the roads unusable, and submerging residential areas, are expected again this year, and experts warn that better waste management, urban planning and warning systems are needed to help protect citizens.



So says Simon Thomas, an international consultant and board member of Megapipes Solutions Limited which provides sustainable stormwater, sanitation and flood alleviation solutions throughout Kenya and East Africa. â??The lack of adequate drainage and sanitation systems in Kenya has been well documented, however, not enough attention is being paid to how the sewerage systems have been designed and set up, or where excess water ends up,â? he says. â??Compounding the problem, there are multiple settlements that do not have adequate sewerage and sanitation services that edge onto Nairobiâ??s three main rivers, namely Mathare, Ngong and Nairobi.â?







According to him, citizens who live in flood-prone regions are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives. â??And itâ??s always those living under the poverty line that are most vulnerable and need the most help and support in the event of such a disaster.â?

He says in the past few years, many regions in Kenya have had above-normal rainfall, resulting in flooding across the country. â??To lessen the potential impact of floods, the government has to map out and implement strategic plans to address flood disaster risk. These plans must pinpoint the projects and initiatives that are needed to manage and prevent floods.â?

Currently, many densely populated formal and informal settlements in Kenya employ open drainage channels, which are used to discharge rainwater, to address the problem. However, Thomas says while drains can help prevent flooding, when they are left open, they can easily become clogged with solid and domestic waste, making the problem far worse.

â??Moreover, multiple environmental hazards go hand in hand with open drainage channels, including groundwater contamination, a slew of easily preventable diseases, a lessening of soil productivity, and the contamination of vegetables and crops.â?

Unfortunately, building exposed drainage systems has been around for decades and has become the norm. â??Various regions in Kenya are prone to flooding, and at the same time, are notorious for blocked drainage systems. Also, town planners, do not seem to grasp the fact that open drains use land, which takes away space for pavements and walkways, forcing pedestrians, onto the streets and putting them in danger of being hit by motorists.â?

The bottom line? Thomas says that if Kenya is to achieve its Millennium Development Goal for increasing access to water and sanitation this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.







Thomas says a wider implementation of properly engineered and sustainable drainage initiatives is required, which mitigate the effects of large amounts of rainfall coming down in urban areas. While other solutions exist, including putting in additional drainage ditches, these are unable to cope with significant rainfall or extreme weather.

However, itâ??s not all doom and gloom. â??At Megapipes, we understand there is an urgent requirement for better systems that would be able to cope with larger volumes of waste and stormwater, particularly in fast-growing urban environments. With this in mind, we conducted studies into new large diameter pipe technology, already widely used with big success in other parts of the world. Megapipes Solutions made the visionary decision to opt for Weholite HDPE structured wall pipes, manholes, chambers and tanks, which address Kenyaâ??s need for sustainable water systems.â?","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://newbusinessethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-cropped-logo-orange-sub-Title-1-e1578818531794-1-32x32.png,"['solutions', 'sanitation', 'drainage', 'ahead', 'kenyas', 'business', 'ethiopia', 'systems', 'thomas', 'open', 'season', 'solution', 'water', 'kenya', 'urban', 'flooding', 'waste', 'rainy']", ,flood

A helicopter was dispatched from the capital Nairobi, which is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the park, to help with search efforts on Sunday

The gorge in the popular park was closed Sunday following the incident, according to the agency which said that tour groups were usually accompanied by guides, who are trained to detect storm water flowing down from the gorge and alert visitors to impending danger.

Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger â?? Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder â?? with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in Nâ??Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

In West Coast, Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana have also experienced flooding throughout August-September 2020.","Sun, 06 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539716-Africa%20-%20Floods%20and%20multiple%20disasters%20-%20Information%20bulletin%2C%2006%20September%202020.png?itok=7OMwtMBe,"['multiple', 'africa', 'rains', 'bulletin', 'affected', 'displaced', 'countries', 'states', 'chad', 'disasters', 'flooding', 'sudan', '06', 'niger', 'information', '2020', 'floods']", ,flood

NAIROBI, Kenya -- Heavy rains in Kenya unleashed a deluge that killed five people overnight in the Rift Valley, raising the death toll from weekend flooding to 65, officials said Monday.

The five were returning home after attending a wedding in Tanzania when their car was washed away, said Daudi Loronyokwe, a police chief in Kajiado Central community.

The victims included three children, he said.

Governor John Lonyangâ??apuo said between 80,000 and 120,000 people have been affected in West Pokot county, the worst hit by the floods and mudslides. The governor said at least 52 people were confirmed dead there.

â??I have lost three children,â? said one resident, William Lokapel. He described how his wife managed to struggle to safety, clutching another child, after the mudslide covered their home while they slept.

The torrential rain is uncommon for this time of year. Parts of the country could continue to face destructive flooding this week, the Kenya Red Cross said. The aid group

Evacuations continued.

â??No one can sleep in their homes for now because we donâ??t know when the next land slide will occur,â? resident Peter Lokor said. â??So many people have been affected, actually all those who live in this area, and everybody is afraid of going back home.â?

The Kenya Red Cross cited what it called a record-breaking temperature rise in the Indian Ocean in recent weeks that also has caused flooding in South Sudan and Somalia.

Now Djibouti is affected. The Horn of Africa nationâ??s capital reportedly saw more than three times its annual rainfall between Thursday and Sunday alone, the United Nations humanitarian office said. More heavy rains are forecast.

A group of wildlife experts has started the process to rescue eight giraffes stranded on an island in western Kenya.

Rothschild giraffes are endangered animals and this group was placed in an area near the lake 10 years ago.

The area was a peninsula then but has recently become an island due to unexpected high water levels.

Two giraffes, including the groupâ??s only female, were rescued Sunday.

The rescues were a delicate operation with each animal being tranquilized, blindfolded, and led to a barge that will ferry the animal to its new 4,400-acre refuge.

The remaining six giraffes will be moved from the island in the next month or so.

Three groups took part in the rescue, the Kenyan Wildlife Service, the Northern Rangelands Trust and Save the Giraffes Now.

Rising waters have inundated homes, businesses, farms, and even entire islands. The torrential rains have also caused two important lakes to swell, creating several issues for local wildlife and businesses.

The natural-color images above show water levels on the south end of Lake Baringo on May 30, 2013 (left) and May 1, 2020 (right). The images below show flooding on the north end of Lake Bogoria, located less than 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Lake Baringo. The images were acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8. Waters shaded brown and tan have heavy loads of suspended sediment.

The water levels of both lakes have been rising in recent years, but they have been particularly high in 2020. The senior warden for the Kenya Wildlife Service told Reuters that the area of Lake Baringo has expanded by 60 percent in the past seven years; it now covers 270 square kilometers (105 square miles). Lake Bogoria has swollen by 25 percent, now covering 43 square kilometers (17 square miles).

Both lakes play significant roles in sustaining local citizens, attracting tourists, and providing a home for many wildlife species. Lake Baringo provides irrigation and drinking water and is also home to Nile crocodiles. Rising waters at the lake have damaged businesses, schools, homes, and hotels, while bringing crocodiles and hippos dangerously close to people. Lake Bogoria is a World Heritage site and home to hundreds of bird species, including as many as one million flamingos at times. It also contains several geysers and hot springs that are popular with tourists; nearly 80 percent of these hot springs are now underwater.

Officials are particularly concerned that the freshwater Lake Baringo and alkaline Lake Bogoria could merge soon, which would cause cross-contamination and threaten wildlife even more. The two lakes were once 20 kilometers (13 miles) apart, but now sit 13 kilometers (8 miles) from one another. Neither lake has an outlet to allow excess water to flow out.

Editorâ??s note: Due to the persistent rain and the frequent midday cloudiness of nations around the equator, the images from May 2020 are the most recent clear views of the flooded areas acquired by Landsat satellites.

According to media reports, as of 24 October, 9 people have died as a result, 4 in Elgeyo-Marakwet County, 4 in Wajir county and 1 in Turkana County. Thousands of people have been displaced and roads and houses have been damaged. (ECHO, 24 Oct 2019)

[H]eavy rain has affected large areas over the last week, causing flash flooding and landslides. The northern and north-eastern counties are most affected; as of 24 October, at least 21 people have died, thousands have been displaced, and houses, roads and other infrastructure have been damaged. The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned of continued, countrywide heavy rain and strong winds over the coming days. Further severe flooding is predicted, particularly along the Tana River. (ECHO, 26 Oct 2019)

Based on data from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers a total of 14,083HHs (approx. 84,367 people) have been affected, 21 deaths reported with 2 others injured. The number of displaced households is currently estimated at 6,000HHs. In addition, 531 acres of farmland have been destroyed and 21,675 livestock have been washed away. Assessments are continuously ongoing with a possibility of a significant increase in the number of affected populations. (IFRC, 29 Oct 2019)

Heavy rainfall in many regions of Kenya since the start of the short rains season in early October has led to riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides. More than 101,000 people have been affected, mainly in the north-eastern, central, and coastal regions, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced who were living in low-lying areas where rivers have burst their banks. At least 29 flood-related deaths have been reported and the death toll and number of people displaced is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information is received and verified from affected areas.(OCHA, 30 Oct 2019)

43,000 people have been affected in Wajir County (north-east Kenya) and the number of flood-related deaths has increased to 29. Approximately 36,000 people have been displaced, more than 101,000 affected, 52 schools and 14 facilities are inaccessible. Roads are flooded and two bridges damaged, including the main bridge linking Tanzania and Kenya. (ECHO, 31 Oct 2019.)

More than 144,000 people in 25 counties across the country are estimated to be affected by riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The Governmentâ??s National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC) also confirmed that at least 17,000 people have been displaced and 48 died due to the floods. With the current weather forecasts, which predicts heavy rains until the end of November, the NDOC expects these numbers to rise, including affecting 200,000 refugees living in settlements in Dadaab. (OCHA, 5 Nov 2019)

Kenya Red Cross teams in various parts of the country are supporting the evacuation of families to safer areas. Working alongside the Government of Kenya, Red Cross teams are delivering emergency relief items and essential supplies like household and sanitation items in evacuation centres hosting those who have been displaced by the flooding. Areas affected by flooding so far include Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Tana River, Turkana, Elgeiyo Marakwet, Kitui, Meru, Kajiado, Nandi, Kwale, Garissa, Muranga and Busia. (IFRC, 25 Nov 2019)

Heavy rain has been affecting western Kenya, triggering landslides that have resulted in casualties and widespread damage. As of 26 November, at least 52 fatalities after major landslides occurred on 24 November in Tapach, Weiwei and Batei Wards Villages (West Pokot County). Around 45 people are reportedly still missing (ECHO, 26 Nov 2019.)

More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in northwestern Kenya, according to the Government. Infrastructure of undetermined value, including roads and bridges, have been damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas (OCHA, 27 Nov 2019.)

UNICEF has sent supplies in response to the heavy rains and floods experienced in Kenya since mid-October, bringing relief to around 130,000 affected people. According to the Government spokesman, 330,000 people have been affected, 17,000 displaced and 132 died, due to floods and landslides. Damage to essential infrastructure including roads, schools and health facilities has disrupted access to critical services for children and families. (UNICEF, 4 Dec 2019)

From October to December, Kenya experienced one of the wettest short rains seasons on record, with rainfall totals ranging up to 400 percent of average. A second round of floods and landslides in November caused the death of 132 people, displaced 17,000 people, and affected approximately 330,000 people, primarily in West Pokot. Disruptions to critical transport infrastructure and ongoing delays in the unimodal harvest have reduced the availability of food in markets, sustaining high food prices. In localized areas, crop and livestock losses have been reported.

â?¢ The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

â?¢ The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

â?¢ However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

â?¢ Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

â?¢ Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

People Flee as Lakes Flood

Thousands have left their livelihoods and homes as severe flooding threatens their safety. The flooding was caused by unusually heavy rain that lasted for months. Advocates say that the situation would not have been as destructive if there had been no illegal deforestation in the area.

The flooding lakes include Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo. Before, their distance from each other was 12.5 miles or 20 kilometers. The flooding has grown too close to one another that people fear each will contaminate the other, resulting in even more threats to livelihoods and wildlife.

The Great Rift Valley's Lake System in Kenya

The Lake System of Kenya that is part of the African Great Rift Valley is a relatively shallow system and interlinked lakes. These are Lake Nakuru, Lake Elementaita, and Lake Bogoria.

The area comprises 32,034 hectares and is the habitat of 13 threatened species of birds. This system has some of the world's most diverse diversities of avian species; it is also the Lesser Flamingo's most crucial forage area. It is also a significant breeding and nesting site for the species of great white pelicans.

The area also has significant mammalian fauna, the most important of which is the Rothschild's giraffe, black rhino, greater kudu, cheetah, wild dogs, and lions.

It is also famous as a study site for major ecological processes.

Lake Baringo

Meanwhile, Lake Baringo is also located in Kenya in the west-central region. It is located 975 meters or 3,200 feet above sea level. Its area is 129 km2 or 50 mi2, with a length of 18 kilometers, a width of 8 kilometers, and a depth averaging 5 meters.

It is a freshwater lake without any visible outlet; instead, it seeps into the lavas on its north side. Biodiversity is also abundant in the lake, including various crocodiles and hippopotamuses. It is vital for the livelihood of the Njamus/Njemps and Kamasya groups, who utilize it to harvest tilapia fish, herd their livestock, and plant crops.



Kenya Lake System

Meanwhile, the Kenya lake system has three alkaline lakes on the Great Rift Valley's floor. It has high biodiversity, including a hundred migratory bird species, including the Black-Necked Grebe, Pied Avocet, African Spoonbill, Gull Billed Tern, Little Grebe, Black Winged Stilt, Yellow-Billed Stork, and Grey-Headed Gull. It is part of the critical Eurasian-African avian migratory flyway where billions travel back and forth their breeding grounds in the north and their wintering areas in the south.



Managing and Protecting the Lake System

This area has legal protection, updated management plans, as well as adequate hands-on management. Sustaining this management system is essential in addressing various issues. Management includes management of catchment level development and threats, particularly on groundwater, forest cover, and surface pollution. And participatory and intersectoral governance, especially regarding environmental impact assessment and creating better ecological connectivity among the system's various parts.

All of these delicate components are currently being threatened by the flooding, which can merge Baringo and Bogoria lakes.

Mobile lending apps have become an easy source of credit for Kenyans who donâ??t have accounts with banks and other traditional financial institutions, or the regular income needed to borrow from such establishments.

Since the launch of the mobile-based savings and loans product M-Shwari by Safaricom in 2012, dozens of lending apps have popped up offering short-term loans, and with many selling the goal of financial inclusivity. The apps in the market include Silicon Valleyâ??backed Tala and Branch, as well as Zenka, Opesa and Okash, which is owned by the Norwegian software maker Opera.

Financial inclusionâ??defined as access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet needs and are delivered in a responsible and sustainable wayâ??rose from 26.7% in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019 in Kenya, driven largely by the growth of mobile money. A 2019 survey on digital credit found that 13.6% of Kenyans had borrowed loans from a digital lender, citing their convenience and ease of access.

But the industry has been largely unregulated. As a result, some apps offer loans with annual percentage rates of up to 400%, and borrowers have accused them of shady practices including illegally mining customer data, and shaming of defaulters.

As an example of the rates on offer, Tala currently offers 30-day loans with interest of between 7 and 19% per month, while Branch charges interest of between 2 and 16% percent per month for loans of up to $700. A standard bank loan in Kenya has an average rate of approximately 12%.

Digital loans usually have a repayment period of less than one month, and borrowers who roll over their loans have to pay interest on the balance.

While digital loans have helped with access to finance, they have been linked with an increase in personal debt, with a concerning number of customers using the loans to pay for basic household expenses.

The privacy of app users has also been an issue for some time. Some digital lending apps have been accused of collecting data on location, call records, and text messages, many times from unknowing customers, to make financial decisions.

They have also been accused of using data from borrowersâ?? phones to shame them when they default on the loans, in some cases making threatening calls to the borrower, and sending text messages to contacts in their phone books.

Reuters/Thomas Mukoya An online financial micro lending platform is seen on a mobile phone in 2018.

Citing public complaints over the misuse of the credit information-sharing process, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) last year stopped digital lenders from forwarding defaultersâ?? names to credit reporting agencies. It also stopped the blacklisting of defaulters for amounts less than $10. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge has on many occasions criticized the practices of digital lenders, even comparing the apps to shylocks and calling them fleas.

Google, which hosts loan apps on its store, has also taken measures to protect consumers. In 2019, it barred apps that promote personal loans that require repayment in full in 60 days or less from its app store.

The new bill seeks to have the CBK, the countryâ??s monetary authority, license and regulate digital lenders. Currently, the authority licenses, regulates and supervises deposit-taking institutions. Digital lenders have escaped the CBKâ??s scrutiny thus far because they donâ??t take deposits.

â??Weâ??re trying to protect or provide a safe space for everyone,â? the billâ??s sponsor, nominated legislator Gideon Keter, told Quartz.

The proposed legislation will be introduced in parliament on Thursday.

Kevin Mutiso, the chairman of the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya, a group of 20 digital lenders in the country, distanced the associationâ??s members from bad practices and said thereâ??s need for regulation.

â??It will bring sanity to the industry because weâ??ve got some bad actorsâ??rogue actors,â? he told Quartz.

ighty-year-old Christina Alooâ??s thin legs lie straight out as she sits up on a mattress in the corner of a dark classroom scattered with other peopleâ??s belongings.

â??I canâ??t walk,â? she says. â??The floodwater came into my mud house at night and my grandson picked me up and helped me to escape.â?

Kenya is experiencing some of the worst flooding for generations, adding a third layer of crisis to a nation buckled by the threat of Covid-19 and battling a massive locust invasion that is destroying vast areas of crops.

About 233,000 people have been affected by the floods, including more than 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross, after record-breaking rains caused rivers to burst their banks, devastating towns and villages.

In the west of the country, Africaâ??s largest inland body of water, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, is at its highest level ever recorded â?? 13.42 metres â?? and has enveloped whole villages around its shores.

The Kenyan government says 237 people who were unable to escape the water have died from the flooding.

â??These are the worst floods Iâ??ve ever seen, weâ??ve lost everything,â? says Aloo, who has a breathing condition that causes shortness of breath when there is humidity in the air.

Schools in Kenya were closed in March because of fears of the spread of Covid-19. Now more than 100 are full again, packed with families whose makeshift houses are flooded or completely destroyed by water.

Social distancing is not possible for the hundreds, like Aloo, sleeping on classroom floors in Nyambare Secondary School in Siaya County.

Outside in the schoolyard, James Owende is shouting desperately in the middle of a tight circle of onlookers.

â??My house was drowned. All my animals â?? my cows, my hens, my goats have all drowned. I canâ??t work,â? he says. Owende earned a living by digging sand, used for construction, out of the lake, but the mines have been overwhelmed.

For many in the area, it is the only source of income. â??Iâ??m just begging the government, they have to do something for me.â?

â??We need food,â? someone in the crowd calls. â??We need houses,â??â?? says another.

The Kenya Red Cross is giving out emergency food parcels and basic living items such as pots, pans, thick plastic sheets to make temporary shelters, face masks and mosquito nets.

Last Sunday, Kenyaâ??s president, Uhuru Kennyatta, said the government is dispatching 250m Kenyan shillings (Â£190,000) every week to vulnerable families impacted by the economic crisis and 1bn shillings has been set aside for flood control measures, he said.

James Okumbe, deputy governor of Siaya county, told The Independent about plans, which have been delayed, to build a dam and dykes to control the flow of rivers that burst their banks.

â??It could have been finished, but the national government has not completed the compensation of the landowners [who need to be relocated and] live along the river banksâ?, says Okumbe.

The unknown threat of Covid-19 hangs over the displaced and defenceless communities.

â??Iâ??m worried about corona,â? Owende continues. â??Kids are asking their mothers: â??Mum am I going to die?â??â?

Kenya has recorded 63 deaths from Covid-19 and 1,888 confirmed cases, as of Saturday. Movement has been restricted in and out of big cities and a national 7pm to 5am dusk-until-dawn curfew has been enforced, with police using violence and teargas.

Informal labourers make up 83.6 per cent of the Kenyan workforce, many of whom are struggling to find work in an economy on its knees.

â??This is the worst business we have ever had,â? says Eddie Ochieng, who gives boat rides to tourists in the port city of Kisumu on the shores of the vast lake.

Even if riverside hotels werenâ??t submerged, they would be largely empty. Kenyaâ??s tourist industry evaporated when international flights were grounded on 25 March, leaving tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy.

People are really suffering, says Ochieng, who is also living in school: â??Floods arenâ??t unusual in this region, but normally the water doesnâ??t wash away houses then stay high for weeks.â?

Weather scientists point to global warming to explain the increasing frequency of record-breaking climate systems over the past decade.

Guleid Artan, director of the Nairobi-based Climate Prediction and Application Centre, explains that the higher temperatures in the western Indian ocean heat water and suck moisture into the atmosphere; this moisture is then dumped over the higher ground in east Africa, causing record-breaking rainfall.

â??Now there is more water going into the lake than coming out,â? says Artan. The land is saturated with water and â??rivers leading out of the lake are also full, so the water gets backed up,â? he says.

On Lake Victoriaâ??s shores in Uganda, chunks of farmland have broken away to form floating islands and have been clogging dams that generate much of east Africaâ??s power and drain the lake.

Stepping from a road into a long wooden boat in Debani, Busia County, Gertrude Nerima explains that her mud house has been destroyed. Sheâ??s going to stay with some friends with her husband and four children.

Bony cows perch on a dry spit of grass surrounded by water and roads taper off into the new shores of the muddy lake.

Like tens of thousands of others around the lake, Nerima is homeless. Her small farm and recently planted crops have been completely swept away.

â??Iâ??ll have to rebuild my house and replant crops when the water goes down in the next couple of weeks, and weâ??ll try to get back to normal.â?

Around her feet, the flood can be seen sliding backwards â?? inland towards a river.

The World Meteorological Organisation has warned that above-normal rainfall is predicted between June and September in the region.

In Homa Bay county, 100km away, Owiena Hezekiah, assistant chief of Kogembo tells The Independent: â??This is the worst situation that the community has experienced â?? the worst.â?

â??Three villages in the area are now partially underwater. There are more mosquitoes which cause malaria and aggressive hippos have come inland,â? he says.

â??We are worried about sanitation and cholera. People relied on pit latrines which are now overflowing with water.â?

On the floor in Nyambare Secondary School, Aloo says the community needs to build houses on higher ground. â??I worry about younger generations. We canâ??t keep living in these areas, but without government support we have no choice,â? she says.

In the classroom next door, which is now home to 20 people, Kennedy Oduor sits with his wife and eight children.

â??Iâ??m stressed. My life is broken now; I canâ??t work and I have nowhere to live,â??â?? he says. â??Our fathers and grandfathers have lived by this lake, but itâ??s getting too dangerous. The problem is we donâ??t have money to buy land so there is nowhere else to go.â?","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/29/09/christina-aloo-in-the-classroom-where-she-sleeps.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['lake', 'locust', 'school', 'houses', 'reeling', 'living', 'covid19', 'county', 'swarms', 'water', 'kenya', 'worst', 'flooding', 'house', 'communities', 'devastates', 'generations']", ,flood

The Kenya Red Cross is requesting additional shelters be opened, to avoid overcrowding, which could lead to a spread of the coronavirus.

At least 100 are dead and 1,800 are homeless in eastern Kenya after severe rain and thunderstorms caused flooding and landslides over the last few days.

Eugene Wamalwa, cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Devolution, said on April 30 that 116 people had died in the country due to the flooding across 29 counties.

â??Some houses were covered by soil, while others are uninhabitable because water is seeping from underground"" Kenyenya Deputy County Commissioner David Mbevi told Kenya's Daily Nation. ""Trees and crops in farms have also been destroyed.""

Locals are struggling. ""It's been flooding for three days now,"" Vincent Ochieng, one of the residents affected by the floods, told Al Jazeera. ""I think the government is not even aware, but now we are telling them. We are asking them if there are any plans to assist us, only two boats are here for evacuating people.""

After weeks of heavy rains and thunderstorms, the River Nzoia burst its banks, according to the Kenya Red Cross, destroying crucial infrastructure and leaving scores of families homeless.

The deadly situation is being exacerbated by the buildup of waters whose levels continue to rise by the day, thanks to the flooding river and continued rains. Local news reported that the bodies of a two-year-old girl and a boy who died are yet to be retrieved.

Advertisement Kenya has two rainy seasons: one from October to December and the other is March to May. This is part of East Africa considers its ""Long Rains."" The rainy season is the worst between April and June. During this period, moist winds coming off the Indian Ocean swing around and drop heavy rain on Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia.

Because of east Africaâ??s topography with its mountains, the heavy rain is forced upwards, which increases the risk of severe thunderstorms, flash flooding and landslides. Of all the countries threatened by these weather patterns, Kenya is particularly susceptible to landslides. These landslides are particularly deadly, especially where people have practiced deforestation.

Of this bout of deadly rain, Kenyenya Deputy County Commissioner David Mbevi confirmed 31 families have been affected, though locals claim the number could be over 50.

The Kenya Red Crossâ?? secretary-general, Asha Mohammed, said much more needed to be done for the people affected.

""We will be doing mobile outreaches with the county department of health to provide medicines and treat minor illnesses,"" she said.

The Kenya Red Cross approached the local government, asking them to open rescue centers, given concerns that COVID-19 could spread due to overcrowding in limited existing centers.

There are many lakes along the length of the African Rift Valley, which runs from the Red Sea in the north to Mozambique in the south. Kenyaâ??s eastern Rift Valley has a string of eight lakes.

These lakes provide diverse habitats ranging from the freshwater lakes of Naivasha and Baringo to the semi-saline Lake Turkana, the saline alkaline lakes of Magadi, Elmentaita, Nakuru, and Bogoria, and the transient Lake Logipi.

The alkaline lakes provide unique feeding habitats for East Africaâ??s famous lesser flamingos. The freshwater lakes support important fisheries and agriculture. Lake Turkanaâ??s unique semi-saline hydrobiology sustains indigenous fisheries, including some endemic species.

Some lakes are recognized as Wetlands of International Importance, and all are Important Bird Areas, with several being within UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites.

The lake level rises are worrying because of the destruction to homes, livelihoods, industry, and infrastructure, and loss of terrestrial wildlife habitat. So far this year, the rising waters of Lake Baringo alone have displaced more than 5,000 people and destroyed schools, hospitals, hotels, and roads.

10,000 years ago, Lake Turkana was 100 meters higher while Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had merged into one lake. Nakuru and Naivasha would have been under water.

And the effects on lake ecologies are a concern as flooding increases lake turbidity and dilutes the saline waters of alkaline lakes.

Having worked on East African hydrology for decades, including these lakes, I wanted to share insights on the rise in water levels.

The Rift Valley is subject to ongoing plate tectonics and crustal movement that can affect the lakes. The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.

Story continues

Land use changes, riparian zone encroachment, loss of wetlands, and urban growth are all contributing to more extreme flooding. This is because the proportion of rain and sediment that runs off from the catchments is increasing.

Not unprecedented

The lakesâ?? water cycles are governed by rainfall on highland catchment areas, evaporation, and seepage. Water reaches the lakes through direct rainfall, rivers, groundwater flows, and in some cases hot springs from underground geothermal fields.

The eastern Rift Valley is semi-arid and its high evaporation rate concentrates salts in the lakes. The lakes are especially sensitive to changing catchment rainfall and have, in the past, ranged from near empty to much higher levels than today.

Flamingos crowd together in Lake Nakuru, Kenya, Aug. 27, 2020

The studies Iâ??m currently doing show, as have others, that there has been above-average annual rainfall over the last decade. Kenyaâ??s October to December 2019 rains were the highest on record for decades. These were followed by above-average rains in 2020. In some areas they were 400% more than normal.

With persistent rainfall, the catchment surface layers saturate, resulting in extended flood periods. For instance the Turkwel dam, which was built on the Turkwel river in the northern Rift Valley Basin, recently reached its highest level on record.

And in May this year, Lake Naivasha reached its highest level since 1932. The lakeâ??s expansion has flooded developments, such as surrounding flower farms.

Yet, like the other lakes, Lake Naivashaâ??s waters have historically been higher. The lake is 1.4 vertical meters short of its official riparian boundary. In 1917, the lake was 2.4 meters higher. In earlier centuries, the lake was at least 13 meters higher.

Lakes Nakuru, Bogoria, and Baringo have also risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century. Lake Turkanaâ??s current level was also reached in the 1970s and early 1900s, and in 1896 it was 14.6 meters higher.

A photo showing a structure before it was submerged under rising water in Lake Baringo, Kenya, Aug. 25, 2020.

Regional lake water levels were higher still during the Holocene, up to 10,000 years before the present, during a wetter period. For instance, Lake Turkana was 100 meters higher and Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had risen high enough to merge into one lake. Present-day Nakuru and Naivasha townships would have been under water.

While this shows that the levels arenâ??t unprecedented, today all of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes face modern challenges arising from growing infrastructure development pressures.

Increasing pressure

The water cycles of Rift Valley lakes are changing as water is taken out for use and because the catchments and land surrounding the lakes are being degraded. For instance, forests are being converted into agricultural land, there is increasing urbanization and people are encroaching onto riparian and wetland zones.

These catchment changes reduce rainfall recharging of underground aquifers, and cause more sedimentâ??such as soilâ??to run off into rivers. This sediment reaches and accumulates in lakes and reservoirs. This can clog natural underground freshwater outlets, in which case lake salinity and levels will rise. The deposited sediments also build the lake beds and displace lake water levels upwards. I have measured up to 30 meters of sediment accumulated within Turkwel damâ??s reservoir since 1991.

Changes caused by people are different for different lakes.

Lake Nakuruâ??s ecology has long been affected by catchment change. For instance, the forest cover of its catchment area is reported to have declined from 70% to 15% over the past 50 years, leading to greater runoff into rivers and thence to the lake. On top of that, the growth of Nakuru town requires more water supply which will be imported. Unless otherwise channeled, this extra water will end up in the lake, raising water levels, and if not properly treated, will worsen pollution.

Meanwhile, Lake Naivasha declined in recent years to critically low levels. Growing developmentsâ??such as Naivasha town and a new Industrial Cityâ??need water, which puts more pressure on the already critically stressed lake water resource. In addition, the lake suffers from heavy pollution loads.

The flow of water into Lake Turkana is being regulated by dam and irrigation developments, potentially affecting the lake ecology and fisheries.

Excessive river inflows into the lakes result from increasing catchment rainfall coupled with the effects of land use changes. Dilution of saline waters affects the production of cyanobacteria, the food sources of lesser flamingos. Increased turbidity reduces light penetration into water, and affects photosynthesis, an engine of the aquatic food chain.

Future concerns

While tectonic plate changes are beyond humansâ?? control, biodiversity-friendly land use and commitment to existing legislation and national vegetation cover goals can limit catastrophic damage to lake ecological systems, people, and property.

In the context of increasing rainfall trends, it is vital that official demarcation of riparian and wetland zones takes full account of the very well-documented extreme high lake level precedents and extent of flooding of the last century and before.

This has resulted in floods and landslides.

The unusual weather can be attributed to the Indian Ocean Dipole. This is the difference in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean.

In Kenya, when warmer sea surface temperatures are experienced heavy rainfall occurs, while hot dry conditions (conducive for wildfires) are experienced in Australia. When warmer sea surface temperatures are experienced off the West Coast of Australia, Australia is likely to experience heavy rainfall, while Kenya experiences drought conditions.

The larger the difference in temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean, the more severe the climatic effects will be.

This event is similar to the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Sea surface temperatures are measured by the Interagency Global Climate Observing System just off the coasts of Kenya and western Australia. In some years, temperatures will be warmer in the western half of the Indian Ocean and in other years they will be warmer in the eastern half. This dipole cycles between these extremes over three to five year periods, ordinarily with a 1Â°C difference in sea surface temperature. Between these extremes, temperatures will be fairly uniform across the tropical Indian Ocean.

When sea surface temperatures off Kenya are warmer than those off western Australia, itâ??s called a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event. When sea surface temperatures off Australia are warmer than those off Kenya, itâ??s referred to as a negative event.

The 2019 to 2020 dipole has been unusually strong, with a temperature differential of 2Â°C. This is more than double the intensity of the average event.

As a result there have been very strong low pressure systems over parts of the region, such as Kenya, inducing heavy and prolonged rainfall. It is also, in part, responsible for the very hot, dry conditions over western Australia which have contributed to the conditions suitable for wildfires.

REUTERS/Tracey Nearmy A burning gum tree is felled to stop it from falling on a car in Corbago, as bushfires continue in New South Wales, Australia January 5, 2020.

Causes

The Indian Ocean Dipole is caused by changes in trade wind strength which can make the ocean cooler. Trade winds are permanent winds that blow from east-to-west in the Earthâ??s equatorial region.

When trade winds blow, they push the surface water of oceans westwards. This causes upwelling â?? when deep, cold water rises towards the surface â?? off the west coasts of all southern hemisphere continents. Essentially, water is pulled away from the coastline, leaving a void which is filled by bottom water which moves up to the surface.

This upwelled water is not exposed to sunlight until it reaches the surface, and is therefore much colder than the surrounding surface water. So the water is colder along the western coast of Australia.

If the trade winds relax, the strength of upwelling is significantly reduced. This increases the temperature of these western coast areas, as the cooling effect of water from lower regions of the water column is reduced, and the sun has a larger impact in warming the sea surface.

The changes in trade wind strength can therefore result in the formation of tropical ocean dipoles.

Affecting the weather

The Indian Ocean Dipole can affect the weather because sea surface temperature in large water bodies affects the temperature and dynamics of the atmosphere above and adjacent to them.

Cold waters cool down the air directly above them, causing the cool, dense air to â??sinkâ? downwards and the formation of a high pressure system. By contrast, warm water heats up the air directly above it. This results in air molecules expanding, becoming less dense, and rising. This uplift brings on a low pressure system.

These systems then influence the surrounding continental and oceanic regions.

Low pressure cellsâ??caused when oceans are warmerâ??are atmospherically unstable, resulting in moist air rising, condensing to form clouds, and precipitating as rainfall. High pressure cells â?? caused when oceans are coolerâ??inhibit rainfall, and result in hot, dry conditions due to the subsidence, when air â??sinksâ? downwards.

The stronger the Indian Ocean Dipole, the stronger these pressure cells.

Future outlook

As of the end of January 2020, the Indian Ocean Dipole index returned to 0. This means that temperatures in the western and eastern tropical Indian Ocean are approximately equal, and that the low and high pressure systems will lose intensity.

This would signal the end of Indian Ocean Dipole-driven floods in eastern Africa and the very hot, dry conditions in Australia, likely for the rest of the season.

However, under climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events is increasing. We can therefore expect to experience strong 2Â°C Indian Ocean Dipoles more often in the years and decades to come.

After months of effort, a mother giraffe and her calf were rescued from an island as rising waters threatened their home in Lake Baringo in Kenya. They were the last of nine endangered giraffes to be transported to Kenyaâ??s mainland. Now, photos shared by wildlife services in the country are going viral, with people lauding them for their prolonged effort.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and conservation partners said the rescue of the last two remaining Rothschildâ??s Giraffe from a disappearing Longicharo island in Lake Baringo, brings them immense joy, marking the conclusion of a mammoth rescue effort which started in December 2020.

The crucial effort was led by the local community in Ruko Conservancy, Kenya Wildlife Service, Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) that has since saved nine Rothschildâ??s giraffes, successfully transporting them on make-shift barges across the muddy waters, which took 15 months of planning and work.

Water levels in Lake Baringo have been rising for some time, but in 2020 the rate of rise increased flooding threatened the lives of a small group of subspecies of the northern giraffe which is classified as endangered.

In December, one of the females still on the island, Ngarikoni, gave birth to a calf named Noelle. Ngarikoni and Noelle were two of the final animals to be rescued due to the sensitive nature of moving such a young giraffe.

Kenya is home to about 800 out of an estimated 3,000 Rothschildâ??s giraffes that roam African jungles but are grappling with a host of threats, including habitat loss and poaching for game meat, Xinhua reported.

Patrick Omondi, KWS director of biodiversity research and planning, told the agency that moving the Rothschildâ??s giraffes to the mainland sanctuary will shield them from predators and enhance their ability to breed without interruption.

The rare giraffe species was reintroduced on Longicharo Island, in Ruko Community Conservancy in the north-western Kenyan county of Baringo, in 2011 to enhance their survival in a natural habitat and have been under community stewardship here for almost ten years, NRT said. â??Back then, no one predicted that their peninsula home would one day become a shrinking island,â? the agency said in a statement.

The wildlife conservation agency explained that rising water levels cut off their peninsula home from the mainland and Ruko rangers had to supplement the giraffeâ??s food as natural browse became scarce. To protect the endangered species, the Ruko Community Conservancy decided to build a new giraffe sanctuary on the mainland.

The wildlife agency explained that one by one, each giraffe was first introduced to the barge and only after it grew comfortable transportation began.

One by one, the giraffes were floated to safety on a custom barge with many boats making sure their transit was safe. â??Ruko rangers worked hard to get each animal accustomed to the barge beforehand, leaving their favourite treats (mangos) on board every day to get them used to the idea of getting on and off the vessel voluntarily,â? they said.

With the last two arriving safely rescue teams are now relieved. The rangers reported that the giraffe in the mainland sanctuary are â??thriving and look so healthy and happyâ?. Now, the conservation team is not only keen to protect the rescued ones but also grow the numbers of Rothschild giraffes in the country. For the long-term, they want to â??introduce other giraffes from elsewhere in Kenya, in order to build up a genetically healthy population of giraffes in the sanctuaryâ?. Eventually, and assuming all goes well, the giraffes will be released into the Greater Rift Valley ecosystem.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/kenya-giraffe-rescue-1200.jpg,"['source', 'giraffe', 'northern', 'rangelands', 'flooded', 'ruko', 'island', 'rescued', 'calf', 'mother', 'kenya', 'mainland', 'marooned', 'trust', 'endangered', 'giraffes', 'rothschilds']", ,flood

â??Disasters directly cause disease and damage to education and health infrastructure, while indirectly lowering disease resistance by heightening poverty and malnutrition,â? he said.

Books will help learners

Issuing the cheque and books, Moran (E.A.) Publishers Limited Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Muita, expressed hope that the donation will alleviate the pain of the victims affected by the devastating floods, landslides, and COVID-19.

â??We also believe that the books will be of great use to both the students and teachers in the affected schools and will go a long way in uplifting educational standards in the community,â? he added.

Flooding in Busia and Kisumu counties

Parts of Busia and Kisumu Counties are faced with disasters following the onset of seasonal rains and increased water levels in Lake Victoria that has led to the backflow of water thus causing flooding in Budalangi, Samia, Matayos, Nyando, and Ugenya Sub Counties.

According to reports, the heavy rainfall and floods have caused pit latrines and toilets to fill up and overflow, with some collapsing or sinking. Over 607 households have been affected and schools submerged. It is estimated that up to 11 schools are submerged in Budalangi alone.

Schools such as Mundika Primary School are being used to shelter Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).

The situation is critical with the potential for an outbreak of Cholera. This is occurring at a time when the counties are fighting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Budalangi, Kenya â?? Leonida Oloo's worst nightmare came back to haunt her again the night of April 28, when the Nzoia River spilled over its banks in the middle of the night and engulfed the surrounding communities. ""It was shocking. I can't believe I'm still alive,"" said the 81-year-old grandmother, who lives in this remote area of western Kenya near the border with Uganda. ""I was woken up by loud screams from neighbors around midnight. I forced myself off the bed and stepped into a pool of water. Within minutes, water had risen to my neck as I shouted for help."" Oloo was luckily saved in time by local boatmen who raced through thick fog using boats and canoes to find her and other stranded neighbors. On that night, the flood left dozens of people dead and thousands homeless in several villages. ""I really thank those youths who saved my life. I have lost loved ones and friends to floods,"" said Oloo, recalling how two of her adopted children died in flooding 18 years ago that also claimed the lives of three of her cousins. Flooding happens regularly in this region, and she has lost many friends and family members over the years. She is now among families taking refuge at St. Cajetan's Catholic Church Sirimba in Budalangi and facing a bleak future even as the nation steps up efforts to contain locusts and the threat of COVID-19.

Global Sisters Report found families the day after the flooding crowded inside a church and classrooms without face masks or the ability to practice social distancing. There were shortages of health care services, tents, latrines and sanitation facilities. Children slept on mats spread out on the cobblestones while several women clutched crying babies, trying to calm them. Many said they hadn't eaten anything for days. Religious sisters are among those who've moved swiftly to provide relief measures. Within a week, the sisters were helping to distribute some food, clothes, mattresses and beddings to some of the flood victims. They are also providing the residents with soaps, hand sanitizers, masks and encouraging social distancing. Sr. Litty Thattil, a nurse at a local hospital in Budalangi, said residents living in the church compound are also suffering from malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia. The heavy rainfalls have caused most latrines to overflow, which creates the potential for a cholera outbreak and other waterborne diseases, she said.

""We have so many problems here,"" said Thattil, a member of Missionary Sisters of St. Ann, Luzern. ""Many people, especially children, are sick because of dirty water and congestions in the camps. They have not enough food, mosquito nets and blankets. People are also scared of getting coronavirus because social distancing is impossible due to overcrowding."" The troubles here are mirrored in many other parts of the country, where floods and landslides have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads and crops. In parts of central and northern Kenya, several homes, schools, parishes and convents have been submerged in water following days of heavy rainfall. In April, several priests and nuns had to be evacuated to safer zones after floods submerged their residential areas. The East African country has so far lost nearly 250 lives due to floods and confirmed more than 1,962 cases of COVID-19 with 63 related deaths. Locust swarms have also wiped out crops across the country, where millions of people already struggle to obtain healthy food. The government has advised those living in floodplains and landslide-prone areas to be more cautious and move to higher ground, warning that more heavy rainfall is expected in parts of western, central and the coastal region of the country. But the government hasn't offered any permanent resettlement plans for those affected by floods and unusually rainy weather. Those moving often take shelter in various schools and churches.

""I'm calling on the government to help those affected by floods especially during this time the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic."" â?? Bishop John Oballa Owaa, Ngong Diocese, Nairobi, Kenya Tweet this

At a news conference in Nairobi on May 13, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said, ""Kenyans who have lost their lives due to floods are now 237. That is a very high number compared to those Kenyans who have lost their lives to COVID-19. With rains going on and our dams filling [up], it means more people will be affected. We are urging people in flood-prone areas, mudslide-prone areas to move to safer grounds."" The Ministry of Devolution supports Kenya's 47 counties through policy formulation and shares the function of disaster risk management between the national and county governments. The Catholic Church is urging the government to allocate resources to support more than 800,000 Kenyans affected by floods in various parts of the country. ""I'm calling on the government to help those affected by floods especially during this time the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Bishop John Oballa Owaa of Ngong Diocese in Nairobi, Kenya, in an interview. ""We are also asking the public to move to safer grounds to avert loss of lives and properties."" Sisters, who have been distributing relief items to families affected by COVID-19 restrictions and food shortages caused by locusts destroying crops are appealing for humanitarian support in regions where landslides and floods have displaced thousands. Many feel overwhelmed by the rising numbers of flood victims that are straining already stretched resources. ""We are actually appealing to the government and well wishers to assist us with medical supplies, humanitarian relief and other assistance to help children and expectant mothers,"" said Thattil, noting that they have been forced to use their own money to assist the affected families. ""People here require medicines, and they don't have money to pay for it. We are running out of medical supplies because the demand is high, and we don't have money to buy more.""

Sr. Miriam Jagogo, a regional superior of the Franciscan Sisters of St. Anna in the region of Siaya in western Kenya, said they have decided to start contributions among sisters from their various communities to pool together resources and help those families affected by floods. So far, they have distributed food, mattresses, blankets, clothes, sanitary towels, grains and other items to more than 200 families affected by floods around Kisumu, a port city in western Kenya.The sisters are struggling to raise resources to help the families, many appealing to donors to help families displaced by flooding caused by heavy rains and backflow from Lake Victoria. ""We would really want to reach out and assist many more families, but we have no constant supply to give continuously unless we get help elsewhere,"" said Jagogo. ""I urge the government and well wishers to come out and help these families. They really need our help especially during this period of COVID-19."" Kenya continues to impose wide-ranging and stringent measuresâ??including the national curfew and cessation of movements in the counties of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Manderaâ??to deal with the pandemic.

The issues extend beyond Kenya and affect much of the East African region. Heavy rains and floods during the month of May have killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes. The East African countries have also been hit by a locust invasion and are bracing for the effects of COVID-19. At least 65 people have died in Rwanda after landslides caused by heavy rains damaged houses and washed away bridges especially in the mountainous north-west of the country. In southern Somalia, more than 30 people have died in the flash floods that have affected thousands, according to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Sweeping floods in western Uganda have killed dozens of people and displaced thousands. Speaking to GSR in a telephone interview, Victor Bwire, a resident of Budalangi which has suffered from perennial flooding during rainy seasons, observed that the government needed to build dikes to help end perennial flooding that has killed hundreds of residents. ""The government is not really doing enough to deal with perennial flooding in the region,"" said Bwire, who is also an environmental journalist and the deputy chief executive officer at the Media Council of Kenya. ""The government needs to replace the current dikes, which are now old and weak, and also deepen the region where the backflows occurs so that the water can flow well into the lake. This will prevent future flooding."" While urging the government to set aside permanent resettlement schemes to help people during floods, Bwire said human activities are one of the main causes of backflows and increased water levels. ""The lake is actually overused. People use the lake for all kinds of activities. They wash clothes and take baths in the lake. Materials that are not supposed to be in the lake make it dirty and are usually deposited at the banks of the lake, and as a result when it starts to rain the water cannot flow well into the lake and so it is forced back to the land leading to excess flooding,"" he said. For now, Oloo and other residents living in various camps across the country say little is being done to address their plight and cried for more help. ""We are at risk of dying from coronavirus, hunger, cholera or malaria,"" said Oloo. ""The government should not concentrate on fighting COVID-19 and forget about us. We are going to die.""","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.globalsistersreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/7%20woman%20carrying%20chair%20c.jpg?itok=Wfn6ZlPm,"['lake', 'africa', 'displaces', 'country', 'help', 'western', 'affected', 'thousands', 'families', 'east', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'sisters', 'relief', 'floods', 'offer']", ,flood

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countriesâ?? response to the coronavirus pandemic.

â??This is compounding the COVID-19 response,â? Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

â??The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.â?

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

â??What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?â? Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime ministerâ??s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

â??There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldnâ??t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,â? Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenyaâ??s capital, Nairobi.

â??This is a carry-over of what we had last year,â? he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

Their breeding has been spurred by one of the wettest rainy seasons in the region in four decades.","Sat, 09 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5e5b9d1d53694cb7927899e63b9abf77_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['devastating', 'rains', 'african', 'displaced', 'swept', 'countries', 'losses', 'away', 'region', 'ethiopia', 'washed', 'east', 'count', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'floods']", ,flood

The three conservation groups â?? a Kenyan state wildlife organization, a U.S. nonprofit, and a non-government African conservation group respectively â?? are in the midst of an unusual rescue of eight Rothschildâ??s giraffes that ended up stranded on an island in Kenya's Lake Baringo due to flooding. The animals ended up in this precarious position because of recent heavy rains, which have caused the lake's water levels to rise 6 inches every day and have turned the peninsula the giraffes live on into an island, cutting off the Rothschildâ??s giraffes, a dwindling subspecies, from the resources they need.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The stranded animals are part of a group of Rothschildâ??s giraffes that were relocated to the area in 2011, in hopes that the remote area would protect the animals from poachers and help increase the subspecies' population. Rothschild's giraffes once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya, but there are fewer than 3,000 left in Africa today, with only about 800 in Kenya.

Over the past two days, conservationists with KWS, Save Giraffes Now, and (NRT) collaborated with local community members to complete the monumental task of floating two of the stranded giraffes from the flooded rangeland to a sanctuary that is part of the Ruko Community Wildlife Conservancy, a protected wildlife reserve, according to a release from Save Giraffes Now.

The first giraffe to arrive ""safely on the mainland, safe from rising floodwaters"" was an adult female named Asiwa, who was stranded on a more remote part of the island, away from the other giraffes, making her rescue a priority.

""There is great urgency to execute this rescue,"" said David Oâ??Connor, president of the Dallas, Texas-based Save Giraffes Now, on the day of Asiwa's move. ""We couldnâ??t have asked for a better result, and weâ??re eager to move the others soon. With giraffes undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters.""

Asiwa's rescue was followed up by Pasaka's. Like Asiwa, this juvenile giraffe was floated to a sanctuary that is part of the Ruko Community Wildlife Conservancy in a custom steel barge, built by the local Ruko community to rescue the animals.

Save Giraffes Now reports that the barge ""is an engineering marvel, designed and built specifically to carry tall, heavy giraffes. The rectangular steel structure floats atop a series of empty drums, for buoyancy."" Plus, reinforced sides keep giraffes from jumping out as the barge is gently maneuvered by boats on the four-mile trip to the sanctuary.

The same barge will likely be used to move the six giraffes â?? five females, Susan, Nkarikoni, Nalangu, Awala, and Nasieku, and one adult male, Lbarnnoti â?? still stranded on the ever-shrinking island. Save Giraffes Now says at least one more giraffe is set to be moved this week, with the rest likely making the barge trek early next year.

""Each giraffe has its own personality,"" said Susan Myers, Save Giraffes Now's founder and CEO. ""Some are very timid, while others are brave and go onto the barge readily. This is a painstaking process, and the team is being very deliberate about the training.""

According to Save Giraffes Now, everyone involved in the first two rescues is dedicated to saving every stranded giraffe, both for the safety of the affected animals and for giraffes as a whole.","Thu, 03 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B980%2C453%5D&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F12%2F03%2Fgiraffe-1-2000.jpg,"['safety', 'working', 'floating', 'barge', 'giraffe', 'save', 'island', 'rescue', 'community', 'stranded', 'rescuers', 'flooded', 'rothschilds', 'giraffes', 'wildlife']", ,flood

For many years, Rothschildâ??s giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) have lived on a peninsula in the lake. The lake's water levels had been slowly rising over time, but in 2020, torrential rains caused severe flooding, covering a stretch of the giraffesâ?? peninsula and turning the end into a muddy, shrinking island. Nine giraffes became stranded with limited resources available for survival. Planning the complex rescue mission took 15 months to coordinate and implement.

Now, the last two individualsâ??a mother and a calf, named Ngarikoni and Noelleâ??stuck on a remote part of the land mass have been safely transported to the mainland.

When the giraffes reached the shore, they galloped out onto the 4,400-acre Ruko Wildlife Sanctuary, where conservation groups involved in the project hope to support a growing population of the endangered subspecies.

And here's another clip of the giraffe named Lbarnoti's excited gallop once he's safely gotten off the ferry. Video Credit: Mike Parkei, Northern Rangelands Trust/Save Giraffes Now pic.twitter.com/AcH7PHkE7M â?? Aylin Woodward (@AylinWoodward) January 31, 2021

When the giraffes first became stranded on the island, Ruko wildlife rangers began delivering food for them, per Gizmodo. But they soon realized the need for a more sustainable long-term solution. The flood became severe last year, damaging businesses and homes along the shore of the lake, and one giraffe, named Asiwa, became separated from the rest of herd when flooding bisected the island once again.

Convincing a 14-foot-tall animal to get on a boat is no small feat, however. First, the team needed to develop a vessel fit for the task. The result, a barge that is kept afloat by 60 empty drums, decked-out with reinforced walls and pulled by a motorboat, was named the â??GiRaft.â?

To guide the animals to the raft, the team first had to sedate them, and then quickly apply a reversal drug. (When a giraffe is tranquilized and falls to the ground, it is in danger of choking on its own saliva, or being harmed by a change of blood pressure to its brain.) During the brief period when a giraffe is sedated, the team covers its face with a blindfold and sets up guide ropes around its shoulders. Then when the giraffe is able to walk, the team guides it to the raft.

When the rescue brought Asiwa to the raft, â??she was incredible,â? said Oâ??Connor to CNNâ??s Ami Vitale in December. â??She's a very, very tough girl. â?¦ Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.â?

Rescue workers accompanied the GiRaft on its one-mile journey to shore by standing on the steel beams or boating alongside in kayaks and canoes.

As Mindy Weisberger reports for Live Science, the Rothschildâ??s giraffe has lost about 80 percent of its population in the last 30 years, making it one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies. Out of a population of less than 3,000 animals, 800 live in Kenya. Now that the once-stranded giraffes are on the mainland, the conservation groups hope to relocate other giraffes of the same subspecies to the wildlife sanctuary to support a healthy, genetically diverse population.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/0K5H2oQfiLDqN82h8MZZgRcd650=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/e8/f4/e8f4ec27-ed40-4565-9e9e-a66eba16d6e4/14_giraft.jpeg,"['lake', 'task', 'giraffe', 'population', 'shore', 'island', 'rescued', 'disappearing', 'team', 'kenya', 'named', 'giraffes', 'wildlife']", ,none

National governments and UNOCHA estimate more than 1.5 million people have been directly affected by sustained, above-average seasonal rains across the region in July and August. Floods have affected Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia, and parts of Somalia, Kenya, and Uganda. The floods have also led to significant crop damage and property loss.

Outside of the worst-affected areas, the seasonal rains are generally beneficial for agricultural production in crop-producing zones in the northern and western sector. Additionally, water sources are fully replenished, and the water levels of many lakes, rivers, and dams are at historic levels.

Rangeland conditions broadly remain favorable. In the Horn, recent August rainfall helped slow the decline of pasture availability and surface water pans that usually occurs in the July-September dry season. The rain has also helped offset the impacts of the early end of the March to June seasonal rains and recent above-average temperatures in parts of the eastern Horn.","Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1536767-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_09_final.png?itok=YZcWggb6,"['helped', 'rains', '2020', 'parts', 'recent', 'affected', 'monitor', 'world', 'east', 'sudan', 'water', 'horn', 'africa', 'seasonal', 'floods']", ,flood

In May, an atypically high number of households are likely facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in Kenya. Poor urban households dependent on casual wage labor or work in the informal sector continue to face difficulty purchasing their minimum food needs due to the impacts of COVID-19 movement restrictions on economic activity. In some rural areas, recent floods, localized market closures, slowdowns in food supply chains resulting in high prices, and the absence of school meals are negatively affecting household food access. On the area level, however, the above-average long rains season is broadly beneficial for livestock and crop production and continues to drive Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes.

As of May 26, 2020, the Kenya Ministry of Health has confirmed 1,348 cases of COVID-19 with 891 active cases and 52 deaths across 27 counties. Restrictions such as a nightly curfew and movement in and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Kilifi, Kwale, Mandera, and Mombasa counties remain in place until at least June 6. Additional movement restrictions in and out of the Eastleigh neighbourhood in Nairobi and Old Town in Mombasa are in place due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases.

According to satellite-derived data, cumulative March to May rainfall broadly ranges from 120 to 200 percent of average across the country. Localized areas of Turkana, Wajir, Isiolo, Laikipia, Kwale, Kitui, and Tana River have received 200 to 400 percent of average rainfall. Recent heavy rains led to floods in 36 counties, where over 800,000 people were affected, including 237 fatalities and over 116,000 displaced. The floods also led to loss of property and livestock, considerable damage to crops, and disruption of agricultural activities in high and medium maize production areas. Worst-affected areas include Tana River, Mandera, Marsabit, and Turkana. With Lake Victoria reaching its highest water level on the historical record and a high likelihood of above normal rainfall in June, there is a threat of additional flooding from overflowing dams and river backflow. There also remains an increased risk for waterborne diseases, evidenced by an outbreak of cholera in Marsabit and Turkana and ICPALD/FAOâ??s Rift Valley Fever alert.

More desert locust hopper bands have been detected in northwest Kenya where control operations are ongoing. Mature swarms are still present in northwest and central Kenya, but damage to rangeland or crops are localized. Following a revised appeal for 32.1 million USD to curb the spread of the desert locusts, 61 percent of the requested funds have been received. The impacts of the desert locusts will likely continue to be mitigated given the ongoing procurement of necessary equipment for ground and air operations. However, efforts are likely to continue to be limited by insecurity in some areas along the Kenya-Somali border, most notably in Mandera county.

Despite the floods and desert locust infestation, the above-average rains continue to improve livestock production and crop growth prospects on the national level. Remote sensing imagery shows above-normal vegetation conditions across most of the country in mid-May, though localized areas of below-normal conditions are present. While late-planted crops (early to mid-April) in parts of the eastern and southeastern marginal agricultural lowlands are likely to be water-stressed in coming weeks with the end of the rainfall season, impacts may be locally significant but offset by above-average yields in terms of net national maize production. Most early planted maize crops are in good condition and in the reproductive to maturity stages.

Maize grain prices are being impacted by COVID-19 movement restrictions. In April, maize prices in urban reference markets ranged from 11 to 22 percent above the five-year average driven by delayed supply of cross-border imports from neighboring countries due to border restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 screenings of truck drivers. In Tharaka, Kilifi, Garissa, Wajir, and Mandera, above-average maize prices were 6 to 22 percent above their five-year averages primarily driven by declines in household stocks, COVID-19 related delays in the supply chain, and increased demand due to higher prices of substitutes. Across the rest of country, prices were mostly average except in Kitui, Makueni, and Turkana, where maize prices were 6 to 21 percent below average given proximity to cross-border source markets and available household stocks.","Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1520021-Kenya%20-%20Key%20Message%20Update_%20Fri%2C%202020-05-29.png?itok=RCByYlLJ,"['increase', 'insecure', 'areas', 'phase', 'kenya', 'message', 'prices', 'update', 'covid19', 'production', 'key', 'rainfall', 'food', 'turkana', 'floods', 'impacts', 'maize', 'population', 'average', 'restrictions']", ,flood

Mr Hassan Ali, who farms along the river, is counting loses after his onions were washed downstream.

Governor Roba warned locals to be cautious as the water levels continue rising.

By MANASE OTSIALO

Devastating floods from the swollen River Daua along the Kenya-Ethiopia border have left several villages in Mandera County under water, hundreds displaced of locals and farms washed away.

The most affected villages are Rhamu Dimtu, Khalicha, Yabicho, Girisa, Sala, Hareri, Darika, Gadudia and Khalalio.

Also at risk are residents of Bellah, Bulla Haji, Neboi, Shafshafey, Boystown and Border Point One, all located along the river.

FAMILIES DISPLACED

In Darika village in Mandera East, 56 families were forced out of their homes after houses were filled with water on Friday night.

â??We have nowhere to go to but to light a bonfire and stay in areas that are a little higher because there are floods everywhere,â? said Mr Ali Adan, a resident.

Mandera has recorded little rainfall this season but residents living along the river have been affected by floods.

â??We are always in this situation every time it rains heavily in Ethiopia where this river comes from and our pleas to have the water harvested and put to good use by our county government have fallen on deaf ears,â? said Mr Adan.

ONION FARM

Mr Hassan Ali, who farms along the river, is counting loses after his onions were washed downstream.

â??I have lost at least Sh600,000 in this situation after my onions were washed away by floods,â? he said.

Mr Harun Siad, another farmer, said his water pumping system on his 30-acre farm has been washed away.

â??I have lost my crops, farm machines including water pumping generators, all valued at Sh1.5 million,â? he said.

On Thursday, Governor Ali Roba raised concerns over threats posed by floods in the county due heavy rains in neighbouring Ethiopia.

â??We have reports of massive flooding of Daua River being experienced upstream from the Ethiopian highlands, which is the source of the river, and all the way to Mandera town,â? the governor said.

WATER SOURCES

The floods, he noted, had submerged the main sources of water serving Mandera Municipality residents.

Suftu intake, he said, was completely submerged as is Neboi whose three wells have collapsed.

The damage to water infrastructure has left the only private well â?? Haji Kerrow â?? to serve the populous Mandera Municipality. But Mr Roba said the water emergency teams are working round the clock to restore supply to the residents.

EMERGENCY TEAM

He warned locals to be cautious as the water levels continue rising.

An emergency surveillance team from the county government is on standby to evacuate residents threatened by floods from Rhamu Dimtu to Border Point One, according to the governor. But by Friday, the said team was yet to reach the affected areas.

The swollen river has so far claimed the lives of four teenagers along the Kenya-Ethiopia border.

Khalalio MCA Abdinoor Dakane Rafat appealed for humanitarian assistance for the affected families.

â??The situation is getting out of hand as the water levels continue rising. More people will be displaced and I call on well-wishers to come forward and offer assistance,â? he said.","Sun, 10 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['ethiopian', 'heavy', 'affected', 'river', 'ali', 'roba', 'washed', 'county', 'situation', 'mandera', 'water', 'kenya', 'highlands', 'flood', 'rains', 'floods']", ,flood

The regions including the southern part of Ethiopia, Southern Sudan, Uganda, the northern part of Tanzania, and Kenya usually get limited rainfall from September to December, according the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

This year, however, heavy rains have struck northern Kenya for weeks, causing flash floods that have displaced thousands of people and swept away hundreds of livestock.

Galma Dabaso lives in Walda, one of the affected areas. He says the area has lost hundreds of animals.

â??The rain started last night and [is] still pouring. We have never seen this much rainfall. It has caused so much destruction. We are circled by water. Houses are destroyed, rivers have overflown. We are moving to the higher ground to save our lives and animals,â? he tells VOA's Horn of Africa region.

Wassila Thiaw, a NOAA meteorologist, said while this is the beginning of the short rainfall season, eastern Africa has seen extremely heavy rainfall.

Parts of southern Ethiopia that ordinarily do not receive rain until around October, according to NOAA, have recorded more than 120 millimeters above their normal rainfall usual levels. ""That is about 625 percent of their normal rainfall,â? Thiaw said.

â??These rainfalls in the region,"" he says ""are very unusual.""

Thiaw blames the current heavy rainfall in East Africa on large-scale movements in the ocean and the atmosphere.

He says winds have brought in moist, warm air from the western Indian Ocean. This, he says, ""contributes to the moisture surplus that trigger extremely heavy rainfall amount in this regionâ?¦ triggering flooding that we have been seeing.â?

Thiaw says the situation to continue in coming weeks.

Then Came The Flood

It is 7 a.m. on a chilly morning in September.

Alice Akinyi Amonde is standing on a beach along the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. She makes her living by selling fish, and she's waiting for her boat to come in from a night on the lake so she can take the fisherman's catch, clean it and sell it in a nearby village.

When things were going well in her village of Nduru Beach, she'd earn about $50 a day. Now she is lucky if she makes $3 a day.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR Julia Gunther for NPR

The reason for this downturn: In March, after prolonged heavy rains, Nduru Beach, population roughly 1,000, was literally submerged in water. The homes, typically constructed with sturdy and thick mud walls and metal roofs, were damaged and destroyed. Flood waters carried away the villagers' cows, chickens and other farm animals.

No deaths were reported among the residents, who fled inland. Some have found alternate housing or are staying with family or friends. Others live in crowded makeshift quarters on the grounds of a local church and in schoolrooms. They depend on aid and the charity of neighbors for basic needs such as food.

Even now, months later, many houses are submerged in five feet of water. Amonde is one of the very few who have returned, hoping to earn some money again in the fish trade. The fishing boat she owns survived the flooding.

She and her children are squatting in a rusty abandoned building next to the flooded beach.

No Sex For Fish

Last year, a team from NPR met Alice Amonde when we traveled to Kenya to do a story about a revolutionary program called No Sex For Fish.

In her village, and others along the lake, men do the fishing and women sell the catch. In the 1970s, a new practice arose that the women hated.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR Julia Gunther for NPR

The population of fish in the lake began to diminish because of overfishing and environmental problems â?? sewage and agricultural runoff, for example.

So the men began saying: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

Many women felt they had no alternatives even if it meant they could be infected with HIV. ""I exchange sex, I get fish,"" Milka Onyango told us. The 40-year-old mother of six said, ""I don't care about getting HIV. Me, I need fish. I need earning to sustain my family.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther For NPR Julia Gunther For NPR

The women in Nduru Beach came up with a bold idea: What if women owned the boats? What if there was ... ""no sex for fish.""

With the initial help of a Peace Corps volunteer, the women got grants from USAID and later from the charity World Connect to buy their own boats. They hired men to fish for them. They flipped the power dynamic. Early on, a With a series of grants, the No Sex For Fish program got about 30 boats and gave them to women, including Amonde. The women hired men to do the fishing for them. It was an unprecedented flip of the power dynamic. Suddenly, women were in charge. They earned a good income. They told us how happy and proud they were.

On a sunny Sunday during our visit in November 2019, we visited Amonde in her well-kept home. Sitting on a comfy couch, we shared a meal of fried, fresh-caught fish and homemade bread while a kitten played at our feet.

Now the lake has risen so high that she can only see the roof of her home.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR Julia Gunther for NPR

The walls of other homes are above water but cracked, rendering them uninhabitable.

And the No Sex For Fish program has been devastated by the flooding and its aftermath.

Thick invasive water hyacinth weeds, washed ashore by the swollen lake, surround the homes and fishing boats. Some of the boats are so entangled they cannot be used. And when fishermen do go out they blame the tangle of weeds in the lake itself for the poor catch â?? they say they're not able to row out to breeding sites where they can net hundreds of fish.

""The swelling of the lake has totally destroyed our lives,"" she says.

""There are no chances of going back to my home,"" she says. ""You cannot even know that my home stood there.""

The reasons for this catastrophic flooding are up for debate. Researchers caution that one season of heavy and prolonged rains would not likely cause such a dramatic water level rise.

Reports are that earlier flooding along the beaches of Lake Victoria, in September 2019, was triggered by the closing of an outlet on the Nile River in Uganda.

Christopher Aura, a scientist with the Kenya Maritime Fisheries Institute, has his own theory: ""The waters of Lake Victoria are swelling as a result of climate change."" But more research is needed.

Flipping the power dynamic

Even before the catastrophic flooding, the collective No Sex For Fish had problems to address. Many of their wooden boats were no longer fit to go out on the lake. It costs about $1,000 for a new boat propelled by oars, $1,500 for a sailboat. Those sums were beyond the reach of the women.

So the collective was preparing a new grant for money to repair and replace their vessels. Justine Adhiambo Obura, a leader of the collective, was optimistic: ""When you have hope, you can get.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR Julia Gunther for NPR

Now, however, her mood â?? and the mood of her peers â?? is far different.

""My lovely house is gone,"" Obura says. ""I have nothing.""

Like Justine Adhiambo Obura, Naomy Akoth, a mother of four, is struggling to pick up the pieces.

Akoth got her own boat through No Sex For Fish. ""I was very, very happy because my life changed,"" she says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Julia Gunther For NPR Julia Gunther For NPR

She also owned a small boarding house along the shore where itinerant fishermen stayed. It's among the buildings destroyed by the floods.

""I am just surviving by the grace of God. The floods destroyed my source of living and destroyed me completely. I am currently staying with my children in a classroom and rely only on well-wishers for food,"" she says as she prepares breakfast for her children â?? their first meal since lunch the day before

""I was very scared especially for my four children. I guessed it was a matter of time before my home could be affected by the waters. Every day the waters kept rising and it was worsened by heavy rains which also brought flash floods,"" says Akoth.

The floods have washed away other means of supporting a family in Nduru Beach. Cheryl Awuor depended on her livestock for income.

""My goats died. They were swept away by the floods. I am still heartbroken, I had hopes of making a good life from them,"" says Awuor.

A widow who has 3 children, Awuor now shares temporary classroom quarters with Akoth and two other families.

What next?

The fishing trade that sustained many of the families of Nduru Beach (and other fishing villages) has collapsed. The women from No Sex For Fish worry that even if fishing were to become possible again, the practice of trading sex for fish would re-emerge due to the difficulty of catching fish in the weed-clogged lake.

So the refugees from Nduru Beach live in limbo. The women interviewed by NPR in September 2020 say the government has not provided support or assistance. ""The only people who have been helping those who were displaced are businessmen and a few politicians,"" says Cheryl Awuor.

But the government says there is a limit to what it will do. ""Victims of such circumstances should know that when such tragedies occur, the government only assists to save lives and not to make life comfortable for them,"" is what Ruth Odinga, Kisumu County director of special programs, told NPR.

According to Odinga, the victims were warned in advance to move to higher grounds but some families did not heed the warnings â?? although several of the women interviewed by NPR dispute this. ""No, we did not receive any warnings,"" says Naomy Akuth. ""The region has been prone to floods the last couple of years but this year it was worse.""

Patrick Higdon, who administered earlier grants to No Sex For Fish from the charity World Connect, sent a field agent to Nduru Beach this fall to assess the situation.

The women told the agent they very much want to go back and pick up their fishing trade. But they need financial support to do so, they said. And they worry that more flooding is in the future.

So they are trying to think of other ways to earn their living. If fishing isn't in the near future, the Nduru Beach refugees wonder about a dairy goats project â?? or growing rice on the flooded terrain.

There are ""many hurdles to jump,"" says Higdon. But ""the ideas and energy are there as ever."" As is the hope for better days to come.

""I am still hopeful that fate will change for us,"" says Akoth, the mother of four. ""The damage that we have received is immense and it will take us time to resume our normal trade. I am hoping that the water levels will reduce so that I can pick up my life again.""

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -Rich countries must provide more finance to help the poor cope with the impact of global warming, residents of Kenyaâ??s biggest informal settlement told the president of the COP26 global climate talks as he visited on Friday.

Alok Sharma, president of the United Nations conference, was visiting a community-led project in Nairobiâ??s flood-prone Kibera settlement that provides easy-to-understand weather forecasts via SMS, WhatsApp and radio.

â??The climate has changed a lot. We experience heavy rains more and this brings flooding which damages houses, brings diseases to our children and causes deaths,â? said Faith Ondiek, a weather forecast provider or â??Weather Mtaaniâ?? leader with the DARAJA project.

â??The message we want the president to take back to global leaders is that we are doing what we can to deal with climate change, but we need help. The rich nations must contribute some funds so we can improve our lives in the face of this threat.â?

Sharma said Britain would place adaptation and resilience â??front and centreâ? during its presidency of COP as he praised the forecasting project.

â??Globally as extreme weather events become more frequent and more severe we need to build resilience among the most vulnerable communities,â? Sharma said in a statement.

Governments will submit updated national action plans to reduce planet-warming emissions and adapt to a hotter climate ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.

Sharmaâ??s visit aimed to show that COP26 was not just focused on the West bringing down their carbon emissions, but also on garnering the finance so that countries like Kenya could adapt, said a British official.

Ministers from a number of countries will meet virtually next Wednesday ahead of the summit to identify practical next steps for climate vulnerable communities.

BUILDING RESILIENCE

Developed countries agreed at the United Nations in 2009 to jointly contribute $100 billion each year from 2020 in climate finance to poorer countries, many of which are grappling with rising seas, storms and droughts made worse by climate change.

But only a fifth of global contributions have so far gone towards adaptation, with most support focused on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries.

Adaptation action includes everything from expanding green space in cities to prevent floods and moving coastal communities to safer places to capturing rainwater, providing storm warnings and giving farmers weather and crop advice via mobile phones.

In Kibera, a sprawling informal settlement housing more than 200,000 people living cheek-by-jowl in makeshift homes, the change in weather patterns - in particular increased rainfall over a shorter period of time - has had a devastating impact.

Due to poor drainage and garbage collection, floods are a common occurrence - not only destroying homes and possessions, but also contaminating drinking water and even causing deaths through building collapses, electrocutions and drownings.

DARAJA provides localised weekly forecasts from the Kenya Meteorological Department, which are translated into Kiswahili and local slang Sheng and sent out daily via SMS, WhatsApp and radio.

The forecasts provide actionable information, telling residents to avoid a particular route as it may be flooded, or advising parents not let children play near the river as heavy rains are expected.

The Mtaani leaders also organise clean-ups of the river and drainage areas, ensure electrical cables are out of harmâ??s way, and advise residents to add waterproofing materials to their homes when heavy rains are forecast.

â??The DARAJA project has been an effective way to get the information out,â? said Pascaline Chemaiyo, principal meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department.

â??The project has formally finished, but the team members are still continuing the work as the community have found it very helpful and it has helped to make them more climate resilient.â?","Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['residents', 'cash', 'slum', 'weather', 'adapt', 'nations', 'countries', 'tell', 'project', 'global', 'need', 'president', 'climate', 'kenyan', 'dwellers', 'settlement', 'rains', 'cop26']", ,flood

SITUATION

Kenyaâ??s rainy season is from October through December. While the rains can improve pasture conditions in arid or semi-arid regions and recharge water systems, heavy storms and resulting flooding have also been devastating. Flash floods and overflowing rivers have affected at least 31 of Kenyaâ??s 47 counties, and some have experienced landslides or mudslides. On November 22, extreme rainfall struck parts of northern, western, central and coastal Kenya. That night, huge landslides and mudslides devastated parts of West Pokot County. The slides killed residents and destroyed homes and livelihoods.

According to the Kenya Red Cross Society, approximately 160,000 people have been affected by floods and/or slides as a result of heavy rainfall across the country, including 18,000 people who have been displaced. Following deadly landslides in West Pokot County in late November, Al Jazeera reported that, â??In Kenya, East Africaâ??s economic hub, the government said 120 people have been killed in flooding and mudslides during an unusually severe rainy season. More than 60 died over the weekend in West Pokot County. Tens of thousands of people across the country have been displaced, while infrastructure has been damaged, making aid delivery more difficult.â? According to the Kenyan government, of those 120 reported deaths, 72 were people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County. An estimated 11,000 people are now living in camps for displaced people in West Pokot County.

Heavy rains also affected Tana River County on November 22 and 23 and caused widespread flooding. The Tana River burst its banks as its water level rose quickly. Roughly 4,900 households have been affected by floods, conflict and drought in Tana River Sub-county and need food, shelter, water, health and livelihood support. Two thousand households urgently require shelter support, based on the CWS assessment in the region.

These floods are a horrific reminder of the effects of climate change. The same communities that are now coping with floods were facing severe drought just a few months ago and are among the most marginalized and impoverished in Kenya.

CWS Response

The Kenyan national and county governments are conducting search and rescue efforts and providing emergency supplies and officially designated evacuation shelters, but gaps remain in the relief effort. These gaps include shelter, food, clean water, safe sanitation, bedding, mosquito nets, medical supplies, kitchen supplies and psychosocial support.

CWS will respond in West Pokot and Tana River Counties alongside our partners. We work with Yangâ??at in West Pokot County and the Angelical Church and ADS Coastal Region in Tana River County. Our response will be collaborative within the ACT Alliance Forum Kenya and with the National Drought Management Authority and county governments.

A CWS team has completed a rapid assessment and identified the following priority needs:

Psychosocial support: counseling Clothing: warm clothes and sanitary items for women Bedding: blankets and mattresses Health: mosquito nets and water treatment tabs Food and nutrition: whole meals for children and rations for adults Other: utensils and water containers for displaced people

Regarding recovery, three priorities have emerged:

Shelter: iron sheets and roofing materials Farming restoration: irrigation systems, water pipes, farm tools and seeds Livelihood restoration: cash transfers

The CWS response is planned to reach 1,000 households in West Pokot County and 1,000 households in Tana River County.

First, we will identify the households and then purchase and distribute supplies based on specific needs. The focus will be on household items, food aid and aqua tabs for water treatment.

As the response turns to recovery and families return home, we will help them obtain iron sheets to repair roofs. When floods subside and farmers and fishers work to repair or replace damaged equipment, we will help them restart their livelihoods, including by providing seeds and agriculture tools. Communities will need to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure such as water sources and access paths, so we will look to use a cash for work system to help affected households while adding income flow into affected communities.

Throughout all these efforts, community involvement and stakeholder engagement will remain a priority. We will consistently engage with national and county government coordination committees and the ACT Alliance Kenyan Forum. We will capture lessons learned in order to help us improve future responses.

In Kenya, floods have displaced over 260,000 people and killed 100 others in at least 15 of the countryâ??s 47 counties, according to the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The floods, which have also affected refugees in northeastern Kenyaâ??s Dadaab camp, have damaged businesses, swept away homes and food supplies, closed more than 200 schools, destroyed community water points, and increased chances of disease outbreaks including cholera and malaria. The situation was so dire Facebook activated a safety feature this week asking users to indicate if they were safe.

In Somalia, 500,000 people were affected by the floods, prompting the government to ask for international assistance, and pushing African Union peacekeepers to relocate hundreds of people to safer grounds.

The flooding comes as many countries are just recovering from the devastating drought and famine that swept the Horn and East Africa region in the last two years. The drought, exacerbated by El Nino, curtailed crop production in Kenya, drove food prices higher, increased inflation, and put a strain on economic growth. It also forced over 1.3 million Somalis to leave their homes last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The current torrents show the poor planning and the lack of disaster preparedness among governments in the region. As such, countries experience a vicious cycle that alternates between droughts and floods, reacting to events instead of being proactive about attaining solutions.

In the aftermath of rains, for instance, roads are deemed impassable, drainage systems clog, transport networks break down, and rivers burst their banks blocking any humanitarian efforts. Both climatic conditions also exacerbate hunger and poverty, especially among pastoralists, who lose their herds for lack of water during dry periods and are swept away when it pours.

Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change compared to other continents. Even while emitting a small number of greenhouse gases, the continent is experiencing droughts, heatwaves, floods, and rising sea levels more frequently. To manage this challenge would require countries to invest in strategic approaches that would understand shortcomings, collaborate with research institutions to better understand climate phenomena, and create models that that would help prepare for and reduce the effects of disasters.

These are efforts and plans better started nowâ??since the rains, at least this time, are not abating anytime soon.","Sat, 05 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/h_00893521-e1525524953454.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['understand', 'humanitarian', 'region', 'lack', 'deadly', 'reminder', 'regions', 'poor', 'countries', 'service', 'rains', 'africas', 'preparedness', 'floods', 'disaster', 'swept', 'stark', 'east', 'water']", ,flood

At least 100 people have died and nearly 260,000 have been displaced by flooding in Kenya this month, the Kenyan Red Cross announced Thursday.

Kenyan authorities and humanitarian organizations have been working to airlift stranded residents to safety and provide aid to isolated communities after weeks of heavy rain and landslides.

The flooding comes as many continue to recover from the severe drought in 2017 that threatened millions of people across East Africa.

The extreme weather has also affected thousands in neighboring Somalia. The United Nations estimated that nearly 500,000 people have been impacted and close to 175,000 displaced from their homes.

â??Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,â? StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN secretary-general, told reporters this week.

â??Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, shelter and food response in their interventions,â? Dujarric added.

The flooding has also raised concerns that malaria and cholera outbreaks will worsen.

â??There are already active cholera outbreaks in five of the counties affected by floods,â? said Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-TraorÃ©, regional director for Africa at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). â??We fear that these outbreaks could worsen and spread.â?

Key infrastructure and dozens of health centers have been destroyed, exacerbating the health crisis, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. The flooding has also contaminated a number of water sources.

â?¢ Heavy rainfall since early October has affected more than 100,000 people, displaced thousands and caused at least 29 deaths in Kenya.

â?¢ The rains have driven flash floods, mudslides and landslides in various counties, with Wajir county amongst the hardest-hit.

â?¢ Floods have damaged infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and access to food, education and healthcare has been hampered.

â?¢ The heavy rains follow a period of prolonged drought which saw the number of severely food insecure people in Kenya rise to 3.1 million.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Heavy rainfall in many regions of Kenya since the start of the short rains season in early October has led to riverine and flash floods, rock falls, mudslides and landslides. More than 101,000 people have been affected, mainly in the north-eastern, central, and coastal regions, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced who were living in low-lying areas where rivers have burst their banks. At least 29 flood-related deaths have been registered, according to media reports quoting the Government, and the death toll and number of people displaced is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information is received and verified from affected areas.

Destruction and damage of key infrastructure -including roads, bridges, schools and health facilitiesâ?? has been reported in multiple locations. At least 983 acres of farmland have reportedly been destroyed and 21,710 livestock washed away, according to the KRCS, severely impacting livelihoods, including in areas already facing challenges due to drought. At least 52 schools are inaccessible in Mandera and Wajir counties and some 14 health facilities cannot be reached in Mandera, Wajir and Marsabit. Many parts of Mombasa County have reported power outages caused by fallen electricity pylons or water-soaked transformers. Two bridges, including one linking Diani and Lungalunga at Kinondoni and the main bridge linking Tanzania and Kenya at Mihogoni trading centre, have been badly damaged. In Lodwar town and surrounding areas in Turkana County, nine out of 12 water boreholes were destroyed, impacting about 70,000 people.

In Wajir county, which has been particularly hard-hit, at least 43,000 people have been affected by flooding and at least 10 schools have been either closed due to inundation or are inaccessible for learners and teachers, according to the Kenya Initial Rapid Assessment (KIRA) conducted on 12 and 13 October. This will have an impact on students sitting their final primary and secondary level exams, which began last week. Roads linking various towns and settlements in the county are impassable, hampering the supply of essential food commodities and drugs for health facilities. There are reports of shortages of food and the price of available food has started to increase. Immediate priority needs in the area include the creation of diversion streams on Buna-Beramu Laga to reduce flooding into the town, emergency food assistance and non-food items to areas accessible by road and airlifting to inaccessible areas. Evacuation of low-lying households to safer ground and provision of water treatment chemicals are also urgent.

The rains -driven by the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)- are expected to continue in the days and weeks ahead, with most parts of the country likely to experience above average rainfall until early December 2019, according to the Kenyan Meteorological Department.

The heavy rains and floods follow a prolonged period of drought in Kenya. Two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall and high land surface temperatures in many areas led to poor crop and livestock production and rapid deterioration of rangeland resources, according to the latest Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) report. Prior to the floods, a projected 3.1 million people were projected to face IPC Phases 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency) in October. Although the rains may bring reprieve in some locations, in others there is a risk that they will damage cropping for the next season.","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1392123-ROSEA_20191030_KenyaFloods_FlashUpdate%231_def.png?itok=tuPvRpIL,"['2019', 'rainfall', 'update', 'food', 'wajir', 'county', 'areas', '30', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', 'including', 'rains', 'floods']", ,flood

Footage released by charity Save Giraffes Now showed a female giraffe named Asiwa being loaded onto a steel barge and transported four miles down river to a nature reserve.

The NGO said that two of eight giraffes stuck on the island had now been rescued and the remaining animals are set to be moved in the next few months.

The Rothchilds giraffes were sent to the remote area in 2011 over fears they would be targeted by poachers, but became stranded from the mainland after recent intense rainfall.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) coordinated the daring rescue and was joined by Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT).

For years, Rothchilds giraffes have freely roamed Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley, but numbers have declined rapidly, partially due to poaching.

There are now only around 800 left in Kenya and fewer than 3,000 in all of Africa.

Susan is the name of the other giraffe who was saved by the groups. The four remaining adult females, Nkarikoni, Nalangu, Awala and Nasieku, one adult male, Lbarnnoti, and juvenile female Pasaka will be moved early next year.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

The United Nationsâ?? Global Goal 13 calls for action on climate change, including support for countries and communities to adapt to its effects. This UK aid project, which delivers accessible weather information to people living in informal settlements in Kenya and Tanzania, helps build climate resilience as defences can be put in place for when extreme weather occurs. To find out more about global efforts to tackle climate change and take action, join us here

It might seem simple, but having access to the weather forecast is something that's often taken for granted â?? even if the results are disappointing.

But lack of knowledge about the upcoming weather makes communities around the world vulnerable. Climate change means extreme conditions are becoming more common everywhere, so it is crucial to be able to prepare for rainfall, heatwaves, droughts, and more.

Without a weather forecast, everything from flood preparation to what clothes children should wear to school that day becomes difficult.

A UK aid project in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, is attempting to fill this gap. It used a new weather information system to help keep communities living in informal settlements better informed.

The project is called Daraja, meaning â??bridgeâ? in Swahili, because of the connection to the meteorological updates it provides. As well as providing this bridge, the project serves a wider goal of building climate resilience, because it means residents can take action to help protect themselves from the potential impacts of extreme weather.

â??We get the weather forecast from the Kenya Meteorological Department and after we get it we translate it into a language that is commonly used here, [like] Shengâ?? and Swahili,â? explains James Kirika, a community leader working with Daraja project organisers in Kibera, a vast informal settlement on the outskirts of Nairobi.

Kirika and his fellow â??weather community leadersâ? gather regularly to discuss the upcoming forecast and then distribute the information to the rest of the community. The group also had an input in designing easily identifiable symbols for the different types of weather too.

One way the information is sent is by SMS, a text messaging format, which is very useful for families with no television or computer, and for people on the go.

Primary school students in Dar es Salaam taking part in the DARAJA pilot, discuss weather warning advice.



""The Kenya Meteorological Department advises that it is going to rain the whole week in the afternoon except for Monday,â? reads one of the community weather advisers in a video created about the project, delivering a text message update.

â??We are advising you to open the trenches, put on rain jackets, and not allow your kids to play along the rivers,"" she says.

Kirika is also shown in the video discussing the weather and the new project on local radio, helping it to reach an even wider audience.



The Daraja project was developed by Resurgence, a weather and climate science systems design consultancy, in close partnership with two local enterprises: the Kounkuey Design Initiative (KDI) in Nairobi, and the Centre for Community Initiatives (CCI) in Dar es Salaam. The project ran from April 2018 to September 2020.

They now want to scale up the model and take it to other places. Having already reached over 1 million people living in these two cities, their ambitious plan means that in five years, the Daraja project aims to be serving 250 million people living in informal settlements in 30 cities across the globe, Resurgence says.

Itâ??s a service that is badly needed, with the impacts of climate change already being felt around the world.

Changing weather conditions has already impacted agricultural production in Burundi, for example, making it the most food insecure country in the world, according to an analysis by Christian Aid.

Meanwhile, the Climate Action Network predicts that 63 million people in countries in South Asia will be displaced as a result of climate change by 2050.

The importance of adaptation has been highlighted by Alok Sharma, who is serving as COP26 president this year â?? as the UK prepares to host the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference (COP26) in November.

On a visit to the Daraja project in Nairobi in March, Sharma told Reuters: â??Globally as extreme weather events become more frequent and more severe we need to build resilience among the most vulnerable communities.â?

He praised the project as an â??innovativeâ? example of that work and said that he wanted the UKâ??s COP Presidency to put â??adaptation and resilience front and centre.â?

Daraja was largely financed by the UK aid budget, managed by the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office. This aid budget now faces a 30% cut, worth Â£4.5 billion this year, with some programmes already being told to cut back by 70% to accommodate the reductions.

The FCDO has said it will still spend Â£11.6 billion on climate finance for developing countries over a period of five years.

But climate campaign groups such as Greenpeace UK and WaterAid have raised concerns that it will be harder for poorer countries to adapt with these aid-backed interventions at risk.

The UK Met Officeâ??s Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme managed the funding of the Daraja service.

A report on the project for WISER explains why the Daraja has had such an impact. It describes the two cities as being â??complexâ? and â??fragmentedâ? and argues that as urban areas continue to grow rapidly, weather information services need to expand too.

Bringing in local organisations and leaders to help design the services right from the start helped in their success, the report explains. The process meant there was a feedback loop between the community and the service, creating â??a more tailored and actionable forecast.â?

A survey of 700 households in the two areas participating has revealed that, as a result of Daraja, communities living in the informal settlements of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam have been able to take better preventative action ahead of high impact weather events.

""This has resulted in both avoided loss and improved livelihoods for the communities,â? it says.

Jane Brown, a teacher who works at the Keko Mwanga Primary School, in Dar es Salaam, said that being able to share updates with her pupils during the countryâ??s rainy season in April and May 2019 was especially useful to them. She was part of a Whatsapp group created by the Daraja project, giving her access to the updates.

â??Students informed their parents, especially those who live at the valley, who used the information to protect their belongings, including school books for children, which were usually destroyed by floods. This time, the case was different as precautions were taken much earlier,â? she explained.

As well as the practical benefits, those involved in the project noted a shift in attitudes too. Kirika says that before Daraja, people in his community didnâ??t always take weather information seriously because they couldn't access regular forecasts.

Speaking to a local radio host, Kirika said that he himself used to see weather bulletins as â??false informationâ?, but now sees their importance.

Emmah Mwangi, a climate scientist at the Kenya Red Cross, added: â??Seeing Daraja make that first step of providing climate information to communities and asking them to act on that information has really changed the perspective and the effect of disasters.â?

This story is part of a series from Global Citizen called â??UK Aid Worksâ? â?? a collection of stories about health care and climate development projects supported by Britainâ??s aid budget, collated by case studies from Action for Global Health UK (AfGH), an influential membership network convening more than 50 organisations working in global health, and the UKâ??s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO).

In September 2020, the Department for International Development (DfID) merged with the Foreign Office (FCO) to form the FCDO.

But there's cause for concern - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/kenyas-rift-valley-lakes-have-been-this-high-before-but-theres-cause-for-concern-147476,"Recent high water levels of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes have flooded properties and displaced communities, most notably around Lakes Baringo and Naivasha.

There are many lakes along the length of the African Rift Valley, which runs from the Red Sea in the north to Mozambique in the south. Kenyaâ??s eastern Rift Valley has a string of eight lakes.

These lakes provide diverse habitats ranging from the freshwater lakes of Naivasha and Baringo to the semi-saline Lake Turkana, the saline alkaline lakes of Magadi, Elmentaita, Nakuru and Bogoria and the transient Lake Logipi.

The alkaline lakes provide unique feeding habitats for East Africaâ??s famous lesser flamingos. The freshwater lakes support important fisheries and agriculture. Lake Turkanaâ??s unique semi-saline hydrobiology sustains indigenous fisheries, including some endemic species.

Some lakes are recognised as Wetlands of International Importance, and all are Important Bird Areas, with several being within UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites.

The lake level rises are worrying because of the destruction to homes, livelihoods, industry and infrastructure, and loss of terrestrial wildlife habitat. So far this year, the rising waters of Lake Baringo alone have displaced more than 5,000 people and destroyed schools, hospitals, hotels and roads.

And the effects on lake ecologies are a concern as flooding increases lake turbidity and dilutes the saline waters of alkaline lakes.

Having worked on East African hydrology for decades, including these lakes, I wanted to share insights on the rise in water levels.

The Rift Valley is subject to ongoing plate tectonics and crustal movement that can affect the lakes. The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.

Land use changes, riparian zone encroachment, loss of wetlands, and urban growth are all contributing to more extreme flooding. This is because the proportion of rain and sediment that runs off from the catchments is increasing.

Not unprecedented

The lakesâ?? water cycles are governed by rainfall on highland catchment areas, evaporation and seepage. Water reaches the lakes through direct rainfall, rivers, groundwater flows, and in some cases hot springs from underground geothermal fields.

The eastern Rift Valley is semi-arid and its high evaporation rate concentrates salts in the lakes. The lakes are especially sensitive to changing catchment rainfall and have, in the past, ranged from near empty to much higher levels than today.

The studies Iâ??m currently doing show, as have others, that there has been above-average annual rainfall over the last decade. Kenyaâ??s October to December 2019 rains were the highest on record for decades. These were followed by above-average rains in 2020. In some areas they were 400% more than normal.

With persistent rainfall, the catchment surface layers saturate, resulting in extended flood periods. For instance the Turkwel dam, which was built on the Turkwel river in the northern Rift Valley Basin, recently reached its highest level on record.

And in May this year, Lake Naivasha reached its highest level since 1932. The lakeâ??s expansion has flooded developments, such as surrounding flower farms.

Yet, like the other lakes, Lake Naivashaâ??s waters have historically been higher. The lake is 1.4 vertical metres short of its official riparian boundary. In 1917, the lake was 2.4 metres higher. In earlier centuries, the lake was at least 13 metres higher.

Lakes Nakuru, Bogoria and Baringo have also risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century. Lake Turkanaâ??s current level was also reached in the 1970s and early 1900s, and in 1896 it was 14.6 metres higher.

Regional lake water levels were higher still during the Holocene, up to 10,000 years before the present, during a wetter period. For instance, Lake Turkana was 100 metres higher and Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had risen high enough to merge into one lake. Present-day Nakuru and Naivasha townships would have been under water.

While this shows that the levels arenâ??t unprecedented, today all of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes face modern challenges arising from growing infrastructure development pressures.

Increasing pressure

The water cycles of Rift Valley lakes are changing as water is taken out for use and because the catchments and land surrounding the lakes are being degraded. For instance, forests are being converted into agricultural land, there is increasing urbanisation and people are encroaching onto riparian and wetland zones.

These catchment changes reduce rainfall recharging of underground aquifers, and cause more sediment â?? such as soil â?? to run off into rivers. This sediment reaches and accumulates in lakes and reservoirs. This can clog natural underground freshwater outlets, in which case lake salinity and levels will rise. The deposited sediments also build the lake beds and displace lake water levels upwards. I have measured up to 30 metres of sediment accumulated within Turkwel damâ??s reservoir since 1991.

Changes caused by people are different for different lakes.

Lake Nakuruâ??s ecology has long been affected by catchment change. For instance, the forest cover of its catchment area is reported to have declined from 70% to 15% over the past 50 years, leading to greater runoff into rivers and thence to the lake. On top of that, the growth of Nakuru town requires more water supply which will be imported. Unless otherwise channelled, this extra water will end up in the lake, raising water levels, and if not properly treated, will worsen pollution.

Meanwhile, Lake Naivasha declined in recent years to critically low levels. Growing developments â?? such as Naivasha town and a new Industrial City â?? need water, which puts more pressure on the already critically stressed lake water resource. In addition, the lake suffers from heavy pollution loads.

The flow of water into Lake Turkana is being regulated by dam and irrigation developments, potentially affecting the lake ecology and fisheries.

Excessive river inflows into the lakes result from increasing catchment rainfall coupled with the effects of land use changes. Dilution of saline waters affects the production of cyanobacteria, the food sources of lesser flamingos. Increased turbidity reduces light penetration into water, and affects photosynthesis, an engine of the aquatic food chain.

Future concerns

While tectonic plate changes are beyond humansâ?? control, biodiversity-friendly land use and commitment to existing legislation and national vegetation cover goals can limit catastrophic damage to lake ecological systems, people and property.

In the context of increasing rainfall trends, it is vital that official demarcation of riparian and wetland zones takes full account of the very well-documented extreme high lake level precedents and extent of flooding of the last century and before.","Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/361933/original/file-20201006-14-axwglu.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['theres', 'lakes', 'lake', 'rift', 'rainfall', 'cause', 'high', 'kenyas', 'metres', 'catchment', 'valley', 'water', 'levels', 'higher', 'concern']", ,flood

Ongoing heavy rainâ??which has killed nearly 300 and displaced about 500,000 peopleâ??has slowed down operations aimed at controlling the worst locust crisis in decades and increased the risk of the spread of COVID-19.

Dr Simon Missiri, IFRCâ??s Regional Director for Africa said:

â??The ongoing flooding crisis is exacerbating other threats caused by COVID-19 and the invasion of locusts. Travel and movement restrictions meant to slow down the spread of COVID-19 are hampering efforts to combat swarms of locusts that are ravaging crops. Flooding is also a â??threat amplifierâ?? with regards to the spread of COVID-19 as it makes it hard to implement preventive measures.â?

Flooding has left thousands of people homeless, many of them now seeking shelter in temporary accommodation centres where it is not easy or not possible at all to observe physical distancing. As a result, thousands are now at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or waterborne diseases and need emergency food assistance.

â??We are facing an unusually complex humanitarian situation. We are worried that the number of people who are hungry and sick will increase in the coming weeks as flooding and COVID-19 continue to severely affect the coping capacity of many families in the region,â? added Dr Missiri. â??Harsh weather conditions are having a multiplier effect on an already difficult situation and this could potentially lead to worrying levels of food insecurity in the region.â?

Red Cross teams in the affected countries are rushing to respond to multi-faceted and overlapping crises. To respond to flooding, COVID-19 and locusts, the IFRC has provided over 7 million Swiss francs to Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies in East and Horn of Africa.

Red Cross and Red Crescent teams in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda are helping communities mitigate the negative impacts of the triple disaster through community awareness and direct food and non-food support. In Kenya, the Red Cross is conducting assessments in 16 counties, using drones and satellite images. Red Cross teams are also airlifting household items to families that have been marooned by floods.

â??Flooding is a recurrent phenomenon in the region. To break this cycle, we call upon Governments and partners to invest more in preparedness and flood control methods,â? said Dr MISSIRI.","Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/Image-2-e1589981647936%20%281%29.jpg?itok=anQ0Xp_M,"['teams', 'missiri', 'menace', 'raises', 'cross', 'alarm', 'covid19', 'locusts', 'spread', 'food', 'crescent', 'triple', 'kenya', 'flooding', 'floods', 'red']", ,flood

LITCHFIELD PARK, Ariz. â?? A Valley wildlife conservationist is joining the effort to save stranded giraffes in Kenya, as flood waters cut them off from their herd and available food sources.

Kristy Morcom, who works with Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium and Safari Park in Litchfield Park, will be making the trek overseas to do what she can to help save the giraffes.

Save Giraffes Now, a nonprofit organization, is leading the effort. Nine Rothchildâ??s giraffes were originally introduced to a peninsula on Lake Baringo, which is their ancestral land.

â??By reintroducing them into the peninsula they can be safe from poachers there. Itâ??s easier to protect them on a peninsula,â? said David Oâ??Conner, president of Save Giraffes Now.

â??But unfortunately, the lake had other ideas and it rose about 40 or 50 feet, creating the island that they are trapped on now.â?

The question became, how do you get the worldâ??s tallest animal across a body of water? The answer: A gir-raft. Thatâ??s what Save Giraffes Now is calling the barge that is moving the giraffes, one-by-one, from the flooded peninsula to a sanctuary in the Eastern Rift valley of Kenya.

But getting the giraffes on the barge became an issue. Some would willingly follow volunteers using Acai seeds as a bribe. Others were a little more stubborn. Thatâ??s where Morcom comes in.

â??I am just going to be taking direction from David and his team and do whatever I can to support them,â? said Morcom.

â??We have to try to train them go to voluntarily on the barge and thatâ??s where people like yourself has so much more experience than I do,â? said Oâ??Connor to Morcom. â??Itâ??s a real great partnership.â?

The hopes are that anything Morcom and the folks she works with at Wildlife World Zoo have learned from the Reticulated giraffes, she can use in handling the Rothchildâ??s in the wild.

â??Itâ??s really wonderful when you can take information collected from these animals under human care and apply that to saving their wild counterparts,â? said Morcom.

Over the past 30 years, giraffes around the world have seen their population drop by roughly 40%, according to Save the Giraffes.

While organizing an international effort to save just nine giraffes may not seem like a worthwhile cause to those who are only casually familiar with giraffes, the nine that are stranded make up more than 1% of a population that is quickly and quietly on its way to extinction.

â??Everyone knows what a giraffe is, but a lot of people donâ??t realize the dire need that theyâ??re in because of their number rapidly decreasing,â? explained Morcom.

Saving the nine Rothchilds is just the first step in Save Giraffes Nowâ??s plan. Once all nine are safe, they will be reintroduced to an appropriate habitat on or near their ancestral lands and begin repopulating and increasing the number..","Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/815162c4-9b51-47cb-8f26-17eb1d013028/815162c4-9b51-47cb-8f26-17eb1d013028_1140x641.jpg,"['thats', 'morcom', 'rothchilds', 'park', 'volunteer', 'save', 'peninsula', 'world', 'valley', 'kenya', 'wildlife', 'effort', 'heads', 'giraffes']", ,flood

NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is facing one of its worst floods crises in years after rainwater displaced thousands of people across the country.

The rains have been pounding the East African nation for the last two months.

Up to 32 of the 47 counties have been affected by floods but the worst are among those in arid regions, which normally receive little rainfall.

They include counties in the dry North namely Mandera, and Garissa and at the Coast like Tana River and Kilifi and in Eastern Machakos and Kitui.

Up to 300,000 people have been affected by floods, according to the Kenya Red Cross, and they are in dire need of food, water, clothing and shelter.

The humanitarian agency has also noted that over 70,000 animals have been washed away, hundreds of acres of crops destroyed and thousands of homes marooned by floods.

Tens of schools have further been destroyed by floods, affecting learning in several regions across the country.

A number of schools are hosting flood victims as hundreds of learners fail to report back for the second term which started last week Wednesday.

Other infrastructure destroyed include roads and bridges, with the government noting it would require up to 600 million U.S. dollars to repair the network.

Julius Korir, Infrastructure Principal Secretary, said 110 million dollars will be used on repair of rural roads while 400 million dollars will be used on fixing urban roads.

Kenya Red Cross puts the number of deaths at least 112 and the society has appealed for 5 million dollars in the short-term to support families affected by floods.

In the capital Nairobi, the worst affected are residents in the tens of slum districts across the city, who have been displaced mainly due to poor drainage.

However, the National Disaster Management Authority and Meteorological Department on Monday warned of floods in several city estates in the coming days due to expected heavy rains.

They include Langata, Syokimau, South B and South C, areas populated by the middle-class.

The Meteorological Department had predicted near-normal rainfall in most parts of the country between the March-May long rain seasons.

However, the rains have surpassed the intensity predicted by the weatherman, pointing to their unpredictability.

Analysts have blamed the current crisis to the effects of climate change, as the weather alternates from one extreme to another.

""Kenya is battling two extreme weather conditions in a span of four months. Before the heavy rains, the country was gripped by dry weather that saw people and animals in arid areas starve to death. Now the same people who were starving are dying of floods. It is unexplainable,"" said Henry Wandera, an economics lecturer in Nairobi.

He attributed the predicament to the effects of climate change, whose vagaries are raging due to forest destruction, among other man-made causes.

""It is going to mid-May when the rains are supposed to have subsided in intensity but they are getting stronger to the worry of citizens,"" he said.

Besides floods and dry conditions, pests and diseases are other effects of climate change the country is grappling with.

Kenya is currently battling Fall armyworms that have ravaged acres upon acres of the maize crop for the second season threatening the staple.

But the worst it seems it is yet to come for the East African nation as more rains have been predicted.

""Heavy rainfall of more than 50mm in 24 hours is expected offshore and in all counties along the Coastal strip. On Wednesday, moderate rainfall of more than 30mm in 24 hours is expected in the South Coast region,"" Peter Ambenje, acting Director of Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement Monday.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['crisis', 'climate', 'million', 'kenya', 'south', 'flood', 'faces', 'country', 'change', 'weather', 'grapples', 'worst', 'rains', 'rainfall', 'affected', 'dollars', 'meteorological', 'floods', 'xinhua']", ,flood

â?¢ The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

â?¢ Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

â?¢ Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

â?¢ Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

â?¢ The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. However, much of eastern Horn is expected to remain sunny and dry, with a delayed and erratic onset of the short/deyr rains in eastern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539740-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_09_06_final.png?itok=kRTluo5N,"['significant', 'rains', 'rainfall', '2020', 'rivers', 'ethiopia', 'monitor', 'yemen', 'world', 'livestock', 'east', 'sudan', 'south', 'africa', 'seasonal']", ,flood

Kenya is mostly affected by mudslides and floods during two rainfall seasons, namely March-April-May (MAM) and October-November-December (OND).

These landslides, floods and mudslides more often than not lead to loss of human lives, destruction of houses, displacement of people, livestock deaths, loss of livelihoods among other impacts.

This paper highlights the use of earth observation satellite imageries from the Airbus foundation for post-disaster impact assessment during the 2019 OND rainfall season to support effective response.

On the 23rd of November 2019 during the OND rainfall season, mudslides and floods occurred in West Pokot resulting in disruption of road accessibility, loss of human lives, loss of livelihoods, houses destruction and displacement of people.

Due to continuation of rainfall, roads were cut-off and hence it was difficult to access the area to determine the damage and the number of households affected. Through the partnership with Airbus foundation, International Center for Humanitarian Affairs (ICHA) at Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) tasked the Pleiades satellite to acquire imageries of the affected areas five days after the mudslide event.

A spot 6 imagery archive captured on the 15th of May 2019 (months before the mudslide event) was downloaded from the Airbus foundation archives. A comparison of these two imageries through change detection was done in order to extract mudslide and flooding hazard extents. A hazard exposure analysis was done in order to determine houses and roads affected by the mudslide and flood hazard. Results from exposure analysis revealed over 145 houses as being destroyed and over 2.1 kilometers of roads being cut-off. Further analysis was done to determine partially and completely destroyed houses. KRCS was able to use this information for post-disaster recovery interventions such as search and rescue as well as shelter initiation of re-construction houses that were completely damaged by floods and mudslides.

This study has demonstrated the valuable use of satellite imageries from the Airbus Foundation to KRCS through provision of timely and accurate information on impacts of mudslides and floods in remote and inaccessible areas in a cost-effective manner and further support effective and efficient response and recovery. It is highly recommended for KRCS and other Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies to use earth observation satellites for post-disaster assessment especially in remote areas that are inaccessible. This by far would improve their humanitarian capacity in conducting post-disaster assessments in a cost-effective and timely manner.","Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1548479-Case%20Study%20-%20Use%20of%20earth%20observation%20products%20to%20enhance%20humanitarian%20disaster%20response%20West%20Pokot.png?itok=u9H3h7Vo,"['west', 'postdisaster', 'rainfall', 'observation', 'loss', 'houses', 'humanitarian', 'floods', 'foundation', 'pokot', 'krcs', 'study', 'mudslide', 'products', 'kenya', 'imageries', 'mudslides', 'response']", ,flood

Water levels in Lake Baringo in Kenya have been rising for some time, but in 2020, the rate increased â?? flooding lakeshore homes, businesses and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschildâ??s giraffe on Longicharo Island in Ruko Community Conservancy.

Conservationists have worked around the clock for more than a year to save them. Now, the last two, a mother and calf, are the final pair to be rescued from the island.

The rescuers constructed a special steel barge â?? â??The GiRaftâ? â?? in order to carry the giraffes to safety a mile away. Now, with the transfer of the calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni, all the animals are safe.

The giraffes have been moved to a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland.

David Oâ??Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, which works on over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries, said: â??We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue.

â??With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.â?

Park rangers had to lure the animals onto the barge using food they were fed on the island, including pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos.

Each time a giraffe joined the barge, it was sealed, and they were driven to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

The towermates (as groups of giraffe are called) are together again and safely exploring the Ruko Conservancy, where they have plenty of food and securty.

Approval to move the giraffes was needed from Kenya Wildlife Service. The first giraffe, named Asiwa, was moved in December without incident.

Rothschildâ??s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

NAIROBI, Kenya May 13 â?? 237 people have lost their lives due to floods as rains cause havoc across the country, according to official statistics.

The worst affected areas are around Lake Victoria, Lake Naivasha, Tana River, Nzoia River and parts of Central Kenya along tributaries that flow into Tana River from The Aberdares.

â??As of this (Wednesday) morning, Kenyans who have lost their lives due to floods are 237,â? said Eugene Wamalwa, the Devolution Cabinet Secretary, â??That is a very high number compared to those Kenyans who have lost their lives to COVID-19 who are about 33.â?

He said 161,000 households are also affected or displaced.

â??Meaning we have 807,000 Kenyans who are affected by these floods,â? he told a news conference in Nairobi. â??With rains going on and our dams filling (up), it means more will be affected. We are urging people in flood-prone areas, mudslide prone areas to move to higher grounds.â?

In recent weeks, security forces have been moving people out by force to higher grounds.

â??We are visiting all the affected areas, like in Lake Naivasha people around there have been affected but the worst affected is around Lake Victoria. We are assisting those affected with food and clean water and other basic necessities.â?

The Kenya Meteorological Department projects that the ongoing rains will continue to June.

By LEOPOLD OBI

More by this Author Summary Those who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.

The floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries.

Experts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.

Buildings that once stood defiantly along Chuowe Beach in Homabay on the shores of Lake Victoria now seem set to surrender to the unlikely fate of never being inhabited again after spending months strapped under water.

Those who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.

The floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries relying on the continentâ??s largest fresh water lake. Lake Victoria Basin Commission says the water body rose to a new record level of 13.42 metre â?? marginally higher than the 13.41 metre mark recorded in 1964.

Before the floods, Willis Omulo, his family and scores of locals around his tiny village in Karachuonyo North were living quite a normal life. They tilled their farms and went fishing. Others also harvested sand, indiscriminately.

In 2018, while covering sand harvesting incidents that was turning the village into ruins, Omulo â?? an environmental activist at Aluora Makare CBO â?? happily took us around.

At the time he was living in a one bedroom house built of iron sheets, from the wall to the roof. The structure, he says, could resist flash floods common in the area during heavy rains.

Submerged farms

Last week we returned to the village to follow up on sand harvesting, and asked Omulo who has been advocating for tree planting in the village to take us to his tree farm.

The father of one pensively looked into the far distance before calling an old man to hand him a boat paddle. He then steered the canoe into the water after which we all jumped in to head to the farm.

â??The farm no longer exists anymore. It was submerged,â? he offered, â??I donâ??t have a home either and for the last 12 months my family is being hosted at a nearby dispensary.â?

As we silently paddled the wooden boat to what used to be his home, Omuloâ??s frustration as a young family man looked palpable even behind the dark glass he wore.

Alice Kiche, mother of eight, explained the night when floods came. Everyone was comfortably asleep and nothing out of the ordinary was anticipated. Then suddenly, the lake swelled before furiously tearing its ways into nearby homes and farms.

â??The flash floods were so fast and strong we only managed to rescue our children and a few belongings but everything else was lost,â? the widow said.

Her two-bedroom bricked house was marooned and destroyed by the floods.

â??We sought refuge in a classroom at a nearby school. But moved out when schools reopened,â? she explained, adding that all her plots were swallowed by the lake.

The villagers thought the floods would disappear in a week or two. But more than a year later Kiche, her children including three daughters-in-law remain without a permanent place to call home.

Experts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.

The high water levels in the lake will be more frequent in the future due to heavy rainfalls, Dr Lydia Olaka, a geoscientist at the University of Nairobi warned â?? barely giving the region time to recover from one crisis, before another hits

Before the tragic floods, the beach was a lively spot, a fish landing bay and a convenient market for dealers like Kiche. Yet now it has been submerged by waist-high waters, sinking all the business in the process.

Hungry and homeless

Itâ??s not just those that rely on the lake for their livelihoods that have been affected. Like Kiche, Elijah Ngâ??ongâ??o, 54, has spent seven months living in his neighbourâ??s kitchen.

Towards the end of 2019 as farmers in prepared for planting during the October-December short rains, Ngâ??ongâ??o and his fellow villagers also prepared their farms. All went well until extreme rainfall came, flooded and swept the farms away, leaving them hungry and homeless.

â??We are living in very desperate conditions. Iâ??m a farmer who doesnâ??t like living at the mercy of others. But Iâ??ve become helpless after floods drowned all my harvest,â? he said.

Apart from the heavy rains, which are forcing a back flow of the lake, wanton sand harvesting is partly to blame with the rapid expansion of the lake.

With the top sandy soil heavily harvested, the layer left behind is close to the water table which easily recharges during heavy rains, adding to the deluge, the villagers observed.

Besides the floods, the village also do not have electricity.

â??Sand harvesters left electric poles standing dangerously, some have since collapsed, therefore Kenya Power disconnected the entire village,â? said William Amuom, a resident adding that some locals now use the power lines to hang their cloths.

Because of the swelling lake, wild animals such as hippos have not only moved to live closer to the people but are also terrorising them days on end.

The flood victims said the government promised them building materials, but over 12 months later they were still holding on.

Dr Olaka explained that the rains in the region were unusually heavy and due to the Indian Ocean Dipole â?? a weather phenomenon caused by differences in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean.

Apart from property destructions, there are concerns that floods have also increased the spread of pollution, and potential for disease.

Prof Richard Muga, health chief executive officer in Homabay, said the area was lucky to have escaped a public health crisis amid the floods and Covid-19 pandemic.

The lakeâ??s backwash flooded toilets, which posed a deadly risk to the communities who lack piped water. Prof Muga said the county had to spend millions of shillings distributing water treatment tablets to avert water borne diseases.

So far, the national government has provided little help beyond advising residents to move, said Omulo.

â??The government keeps telling us to move to higher grounds, yet they are not telling us where on the higher grounds they have reserved land for us,â? he said.","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3286620/5893f3a087c03e38000fb6c0bc9e1ae8/flood-1112-data.jpg,"['victoria', 'lake', 'heavy', 'livelihoods', 'gone', 'sand', 'rising', 'kiche', 'water', 'upends', 'months', 'village', 'rains', 'floods', 'living']", ,flood

This year has so far seen the region devastated by the triple menace of the coronavirus, floods and locusts.

Kenyaâ??s budgetary allocations for the 2020/21 financial year have included funds towards overcoming these natural calamities. Kenya has allocated Ksh48 billion ($480 million) to agriculture, and an additional Ksh4.3 billion ($43 million) from the World Bank has been set aside to combat the spread of the desert locust.

â??We are dealing with a triple menace of coronavirus, locusts and floods, which has made it difficult to focus on other sectors,â? said Ukur Yatani, Kenyaâ??s Treasury Cabinet Secretary in an interview on Wednesday.

In his budget presentation last week, Mr Yatani said the money allocated would address the challenges posed by locusts and floods.

â??We have released a stimulus package to deal with the specific effects of the locusts and floods that devastated many counties,â? he said.

In the face of the locust attack, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) increased the amount of money it has asked of partners from $76 million to $153 million between January and December 2020.

While a mere fraction of the amount was spent nearly two decades ago, today FAO is short by $42 million. Kenyaâ??s allocation is $21.4 million.

â??The fight against locusts received Ksh4.3 billion ($43 million) from the World Bank. We have another Ksh1.5 billion ($15 million) from the e-subsidy. This is through the e-voucher,â? said Hamadi Boga, Principal Secretary in the State Department for Crop Development and Agriculture Research.

FAO has warned that Turkana in northern Kenya is now the epicentre of desert locust control measures, with the highest number of hopper band sites reported.

â??It is important for Turkana to intensify control measures to ensure that the desert locusts do not mature and continue to compound the threat to Kenyaâ??s and East Africaâ??s food security,â? said Dr Tobias Takavarasha, FAO Representative to Kenya.","Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/epidemic.png,"['virus', 'fight', 'budgets', 'kenyas', 'locusts', 'agriculture', 'million', 'desert', 'fao', 'kenya', 'yatani', 'billion', 'floods']", ,flood

In much of the world, climate change is altering regional growing conditions and making them more unpredictable. Farmers are finding it harder to consistently grow enough food to meet increasing demand. Securing the worldâ??s food supply for the future, experts assert, requires us to tally the good and the bad in the current agricultural structure, including the infrastructure and technology in food distribution systems.

Small farms, which account for about 90 percent of the worldâ??s 570 million farms, are particularly vulnerable to changes in seasonal climate. Land tended by families for generations suddenly may become nonarable. A change in the timing or intensity of yearly rainy seasons or the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, could bring rains or drought that wipe out a familyâ??s crops.

In early May, the Nzoia River burst its banks. The floods that resulted in western Kenya capped off particularly heavy long rains that killed 237 people and adversely affected more than 800,000. Floods and landslides destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and more than 8,000 acres of Kenyan farmland.

Kenyaâ??s March-May rainy season (the long rains, as opposed to the short rains of October-December) provides vital moisture to the countryâ??s croplands â?? indeed, maize production was at least 10 percent above average in 2020 â?? but most Kenyans continue to face some level of food insecurity. In the past few years especially, climate change has caused a geographical shift in which areas receive rain and which suffer drought.

""Normally, we know where the flood areas are, but the rains the past few years have been unprecedented,"" said Ruth K. Oniangâ??o, founder of the Rural Outreach Africa Program and a 2017 Africa Food Prize Laureate. ""We have rain falling in areas that never used to have rain. I used to write all the time about famines and drought â?¦ but right now is something different. We can say, â??OK, climate variability, it changes every year.â?? No. This is different right now.""

The differences extend beyond Africa. Farmers in Iran, for example, share similar problems anticipating cycles of drought and floods despite being separated from their Kenyan counterparts by more than 4,350 miles. ""The recent harsh droughts and heavy floods in the [Middle East] region ruined a major part of food resources,"" explained Mohanna Zarei, a water resources engineer at the University of Kurdistan in Sanandaj, Iran. Sporadic precipitation cycles not only reduce crop yields but also can lead to secondary impacts that worsen food security, such as the wildfires that have ravaged the western United States, Australia, Brazil and elsewhere.

Financial and social inequality compound climate-related food security issues. Many of the worldâ??s smallholder farmers are poor and food insecure; even one lost season can push them from struggling to failing. ""Climate change plays a key role as a catalyzer"" in amplifying preexisting resource problems and ""will influence the quality and quantity of food we produce and our ability to distribute it equitably,"" Zarei said.

""Itâ??s not quite as simple as moving into less climate-affected areas. It remains an issue of climate and socioeconomic and technological development,"" said Weston Anderson, a hydroclimatologist at the International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate and Society at Columbia University. Understanding how agricultural practices and policies need to change along with the warming climate and then sowing the seeds of that change could be the difference between farmers thriving where they are or migrating to greener pastures.

Stressing the climate system

A regionâ??s agricultural stability depends on reliable, natural climate variations to bring seasonal shifts in weather. Large-scale climate modes such as ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole govern a regionâ??s temperature, precipitation and storm activity for months at a time. Climate modes also causally connect distant regions, something increasingly important as agricultural trade has become more global: A climate shift in one food-growing region also can affect crops half a world away.

Maize farmers around the world felt the impacts of climate teleconnections during one of the strongest El NiÃ±os of the past 150 years. The 1983 El NiÃ±o coincided with the largest global synchronous failure of maize crops in modern record, and recent research has shown that ENSO played a major role in causing that failure.

Often you see climate change acting on top of this climate variability and exacerbating stresses that are already existing in our food system.

""The El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation, because it organizes global weather and global precipitation, provides structure on the risk of global agriculture by rearranging where we get more drought and less drought in the year,"" Anderson explained. ""Itâ??s not necessarily creating more drought over the entire year, but it might be arranging those droughts in a way that disproportionately affects some of our crop growing regions.""

Andersonâ??s team found that ENSO is the only mode of climate variability that can affect maize, wheat and soybean crop production on a global scale. Other large-scale climate modes have more localized influence on certain crop yields. The tropical Atlantic variability, for instance, influences maize production in western Africa and wheat and soy production in southeastern South America simultaneously, but the North Atlantic Oscillation affects only wheat production in northern Africa and Europe.

""Climate will largely continue to affect our food system through climate variability,"" Anderson said. ""Often you see climate change acting on top of this climate variability and exacerbating stresses that are already existing in our food system."" For example, he said, a regional crop might withstand a normal ENSO-related drought but could fail if climate change-induced drought worsens, too.

Down in the dirt

Moreover, climate change also affects what goes on beneath Earthâ??s surface. To sustain an agricultural system with consistent, high and high-quality yield, ""you need the soil system to first and foremost be able to support plants,â? said Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California, Merced. ""Plants need physical support from the soil, and they also need nutrients and water to be available in the right forms and in the right time when plants need them.""

According to a 2015 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about one-third of the worldâ??s soil is moderately to highly degraded, and the conditions causing that degradation are, overall, getting worse. Unsustainable agricultural practices cause some decline in soil health, and some is caused by climate change, Berhe said. ""Hot temperatures, for example, are associated with rapid loss of organic matter from soil. This is a major issue, as organic matter is the major storehouse of food and energy for microbes in soil that are key for regulating nutrient availability.""

Moreover, ""the episodic high-intensity rainfall, wet periods and droughts, the going back and forth between extremes, could also lead to conditions where soils are actually eroding at a fast rate, especially under intense precipitation events,"" Berhe added. ""Thatâ??s a major concern."" Altered rainfall patterns also can unbalance a soilâ??s oxygen availability, acidity, salinity and water-holding capacity and can hinder the formation of new soil.

""Climate change reshapes the relationships among crops, pests, pathogens and weeds,"" Zarei said. ""And it intensifies several trends, including declines in pollinating insects, increasing water scarcity, increasing ground-level ozone concentrations and fishery declines. Climate change [has] posed pressures on availability of water resources for agriculture by shifting precipitation patterns, earlier seasonal snowmelt and intrusion of saltwater into coastal aquifers.""

It is true that some areas of the world are becoming more arable in the face of climate change, especially the Arctic. The warming planet pushes the agricultural frontier poleward and into carbon-rich areas of thawed permafrost and peatland. ""The climate envelope moving means that certain areas are now able to support different types of habitats,â? Berhe said. ""But I think itâ??s a little hard to call that improving soil health because of the way we got there.""

The health of the soil beneath vegetation, called relative soil health, is a fundamental aspect of food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, roughly one third of the worldâ??s soils are moderately degraded (pink) or in worse condition (red and burgundy). Regions that maintain good (green) or only slightly degraded (yellow) soils are, for the most part, uncultivated. // Image courtesy of FAO.

""A northward shift in where we grow foods commercially is one of the most likely new agricultural frontiers,"" said Merritt Turetsky. ""The cost of imported foods in the Arctic can be exorbitant."" Turetsky is an ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and a science adviser for Eos. ""Could an increase in commercial or local food production at high latitudes solve this problem of high food prices? Maybe, but it is likely to introduce some complex challenges for northern regions and the people who depend on those lands.""

Declining soil health around the world also encourages governments to cultivate untouched ecosystems, which can worsen environmental problems in the long run. For example, ""we know that drainage of tropical peatlands for palm oil production has released large amounts of stored peat carbon to the atmosphere,"" Turetsky continued. ""As a society, we must protect our northern peatlands and carbon-rich soils from drainage and cultivation.""

Short-term fixes make long-term problems

When it comes to humanityâ??s role in the decline in soil health and the growing unpredictability in crop yield, some aspects are out of farmersâ?? hands: rapid urbanization; inefficient infrastructures; unstable political relations; war. Problems such as widespread poverty, hunger, government corruption, gender inequality and lack of education multiply food security issues around the globe.

However, some ways in which farmers mitigate agricultural uncertainty, which may raise short-term yields, actually worsen growing conditions in the long run. The landsâ?? ""ability to provide the food, feed and fiber that we were getting from them is getting compromised,"" Berhe said. ""And so the only way to keep the lands productive, then, is to keep pumping them full of supplements in the form of fertilizers, in the form of irrigation water, in the form of tilling them even more destructively"" than we do now.

When crop yields go down, farmers try to expand into new land. ""But sometimes extending into other areas means that people are now working on marginal lands that we know are susceptible to degradation,"" Berhe explained. Marginal lands often already have poor soil or are prone to erosion. ""That could play out in very disastrous ways when people move away from their home or expand their production systems,"" Berhe added.

Too, lands might be marginal because they are wet, Turetsky added, and wetlands and seasonally flooded lands tend to store more carbon than more productive lands do. ""This means that extending agricultural practices can release more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere as those new soils are disturbed,"" she said.

Many growers believe that increasing the amount of fertilizer is synonymous with good yield.

The use of fertilizer also can cause significant long-term environmental damage. ""The issue of fertilizer is a central concern in the Senegal River valley,"" said Mor Ndiaye, an agricultural engineer and soil scientist who works with smallholder rice farmers in the valley. Ndiaye works at SAED, an organization that promotes sustainable agriculture in Saint-Louis, Senegal.

""As the use of fertilizer in agriculture has become more and more essential, however, the quality of the soil is not very often taken into account when it comes to the purchase of fertilizer by farmers [and] producers,"" Ndiaye said. ""Many growers believe that increasing the amount of fertilizer is synonymous with good yield.""

However, ""adding nitrogen fertilizers into agricultural areas is one of the most important causes of nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere and the one that we have the hardest time taming,"" Berhe said. Nitrous oxide is the third most prevalent greenhouse gas. â??Itâ??s a pretty vicious cycle.""

A lack of data also crops up as a problem when trying to secure agricultural production. Remote sensing data via satellite can provide environmental information such as temperature, moisture and plant cover, but it has data gaps. ""Often, remote sensing can get us 90 percent of the way there,"" said Matthew Cooper, an environmental geographer at the Harvard Data Science Initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""You do need a lot of ground data to validate the remote sensing variables. Measuring the actual rainfall on the ground or measuring actual crop yields on the ground will always be more accurate than what youâ??re trying to estimate from space.""

Moreover, smallholder farmers are more likely to thrive if they can analyze soil samples before buying and cultivating new land, but those data ""are sometimes difficult to obtain given the often exorbitant cost,"" Ndiaye said.

And satellites canâ??t collect data on ""things related to food systems around trade and access"" such as market prices, Cooper said. However, many governments lack resources for on-the-ground data collection initiatives as they tackle more immediate concerns, or as they attempt to mask the extent of environmental problems, for example, as has happened with deforestation in Brazil.

Cultivating a food secure future

The agricultural market has become irreversibly global, and with most nations far behind on climate goals, the impact of climate change on farmers is unlikely to abate. What can geoscientists do to support more sustainable agriculture in current food-growing regions and maintain soil health in new growing areas?

In some of the most food-insecure regions of the world, itâ??s difficult to pinpoint what actions are needed because food security research simply doesnâ??t cover those areas. According to a recent study that text-mined more than 16,000 abstracts from the food security literature, some of the most food-insecure regions of the world have very little presence in food security research, whereas some regions with high food security are overrepresented. ""Researchers tend to cluster in the countries where youâ??re not at risk of a sudden civil war or there are already established research institutions or where people have already built full careers,"" said Cooper, lead researcher on the study. In more unstable areas, ""local policymakers there are pretty well informed of the local situation but â?¦ it seems like places outside the Anglosphere are less visible to the global community.""

Areas addressed in the current body of food security literature are not evenly spread across the globe. Some regions are overrepresented despite having high food security (bright green), whereas many food-insecure areas are underrepresented (bright pink) and need more attention. Regions with low food security that are well represented by current research practices (gray) likely have preexisting infrastructure to support academic research, like in eastern and western Africa.// Image Courtesy of Cooper et al.

Improving data access is key. Even without on-the-ground data networks, ""we can tell a ton of stuff, especially about anything environmental, from remote sensing,"" Cooper said. ""You can get indices of vegetation health, precipitation, rainfall, droughts."" But that information needs to make its way to farmers in a way they can use.

Work such as Ndiayeâ??s helps connect smallholder farmers in developing agricultural areas with high-level data products such as digital soil maps. Access to that information has helped rice farmers in the Senegal River valley strengthen the capacity of their agricultural sector and establish trade partnerships between farmers, suppliers and buyers.

Most experts agree that water availability will continue to be a bottleneck in expanding current agricultural areas and establishing new ones. ""Irrigation uses 66 percent of annual water withdrawals and is the single largest human use of water,"" Zarei said. But in some areas of the world, including some Middle Eastern countries, she explained, water resources are being used as political leverage rather than as a common resource to support regional stability.

Moreover, the past 70 years or so have seen ""something like a 200 percent increase in irrigated agriculture area,"" Anderson said. ""And around 50 percent of that is not sustainable in the sense that weâ??re drawing irrigation water unsustainably from either surface water or groundwater.""

Developing sustainable irrigation infrastructure has governed much of the agricultural growth in recent decades and will continue to play a key role in our future food security// Image courtesy of Africa Rice Center

Cities such as Aqaba, Jordan; Bangkok, Thailand; Kampala, Uganda; Lima, Peru; and Manila, Philippines, have shifted to more sustainable water usage ""by reusing their wastewater and using this recycled water in the energy sector, food industry, agricultural irrigation, water sector [and] transitioning to a circular economy,"" Zarei said.

Looking back at agricultural production since 1950, Anderson added, much of agricultureâ??s geographic shift is tied directly to improvements in irrigation such as where rice is grown in China. ""When weâ??re thinking about the future and future responses to climate change and the possibility of moving things out of these hotter regions,"" Anderson explained, ""it really remains intertwined with our ability to sustainably use water and to build irrigation infrastructure in a way that is conducive to growing these crops where we have the available land and nutrients.""

Vulnerable beyond climate

Last yearâ??s East African floods may have boosted crop yields and eased food security concerns for people in rural areas, but the relief is temporary. ""Climate impacts are triggers, not the main drivers"" pushing smallholder farmers into poverty and insecurity, Ãngel G. MuÃ±oz said. Securing the worldâ??s future food supply is as much about equity and economic stability as it is about sustainable agriculture, he said.

Consider, for example, factors driving the recent caravan of thousands of people from Central America, and Guatemala in particular, toward the United States. ""What we have found â?¦ for the human migration that we saw in recent years from Guatemala is that itâ??s related to a multiyear drought that occurred between 2015 and 2017,"" explained MuÃ±oz, a climate scientist at IRI. Smallholder farmers on the brink of poverty faced year after year of poor harvest, lost income and political instability that finally forced them to migrate northward in search of a way to support their families.

""What we have found is that, actually, although there is a clear climate signal,"" he said, referring to the drought, ""we do not see a very important climate change signal in this particular migrationâ?¦. Socioeconomic factors and understanding the local vulnerability of the population are far more important than actually thinking in terms of only one stressor,"" such as climate change, driving farmers to new areas.

Not all countries or regions face the same socioeconomic problems as Guatemala, but that example highlights the need for climate-smart agricultural policies to consider vulnerabilities beyond climate and account for socioeconomic context. ""That makes it a difficult problem to approach,"" Anderson said. ""Because itâ??s certainly not something that can be solved entirely by scientists, or entirely through climate forecast-related approaches, or entirely in a policy sphere. You need all of these components, and so a lot of the work really is getting the right people talking to each other.""

The particulars of those components, Oniangâ??o said, greatly depend on the country, but each vulnerability makes any agricultural adaptation solution that much more difficult to accomplish. In many U.N.-designated developing economies, girls and women are severely undereducated and underrepresented in the workforce. In some countries, government corruption prevents monetary aid from reaching farmers in need. Most countries, however, are missing the mark at organizing a migration of agricultural areas and supporting the farmers needed to make it work, she said.

It needs to be national policy, but implemented locally, and keeping vulnerable people in mind so that we donâ??t push them to the edge.

""Even when new policies come up, or new trade practices come up, or when the world order changes â?? even if itâ??s supposed to be in a positive way, it doesnâ??t affect smallholder farmers positively,"" she said. ""I see increasing vulnerability because we have not been able to address the poverty issue, low income and hunger for many of the people I have been working with.

""The people themselves say, â??We have to move. We have to move from here.â?? But someone must organize them to move. It needs to be national policy, but implemented locally, and keeping vulnerable people in mind so that we donâ??t push them to the edge.""

In the end, the paths leading toward a climate-smart global agriculture already may be well-worn by generations of farmers. ""Indigenous communities in the north who rely on country foods that they harvest or hunt tend to be the most food-secure communities,"" Turetsky said. ""This is because these communities and traditions value the health of the boreal forest or the Arctic tundra. Any changes in local or commercial food production that do not uphold this value of the land or water may interfere with cultural traditions and practices. We must take the lessons learned from historical and existing food producing regions and ensure that we donâ??t repeat the same mistakes.""","Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.greenbiz.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_1200x630/public/2021-02/green-shoots-cracked-soil-800x600.jpg?itok=2s3kMmkr,"['agricultural', 'regions', 'change', 'food', 'farmers', 'altered', 'global', 'agriculture', 'climate', 'areas', 'water', 'security', 'soil', 'drastically']", ,flood

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of Chinaâ??s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countriesâ??African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten statesâ??Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summerâ??towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020â??were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name â??Black Summerâ??. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphanâ??the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cycloneâ??was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activityâ??caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceansâ??led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining Indiaâ??s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020â??s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasnâ??t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

Description of the disaster

On September 2nd, 2019, the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) issued a seasonal weather forecast for October â?? November â?? December (OND) 2019 short rains season which indicated a high probability for enhanced rainfall over the Western, North-western and Central parts of Kenya, while the Eastern sector had a high probability for normal rainfall. A much earlier onset was observed than had been predicted, particularly in the Northern, Eastern, Coastal, Central and Western parts of the country which started experiencing heavy rains from early October as opposed to 2nd to 3rd weeks or October as had been predicted. As per the weather predictions, the areas have seen highly enhanced rainfall since the start of October 2019. The heaviest rains with the highest intensity were received on 16/17 October with Mombasa, Matunga and Marine meteorological stations recording 100mm of rainfall as seen in Figure 1 below:

The KMD have since shared further information and explanation to the heavy and early onset of the rainfall. Scientific evidence has shown that Kenyaâ??s OND seasonal rainfall is highly influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). A positive IOD and El Nino result in enhanced rainfall in Kenya while a negative IOD and La Nina result in depressed rainfall. The heavy rains have been attributed to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index of .15Â°C (as of 12th October 2019).

This is the highest ever recorded in a season with neutral ENSO and a positive IOD. It is notably higher than was observed in 1961 (.0Â°C) which resulted in much higher rainfall and widespread flooding over much of the Country.

Figure 2 shows the rainfall observed in the OND season of 1961 (blue bars) as compared to the long-term mean (Orange bars) which shows the effect of the positive IOD and subsequently results in high possibility of heavy rains over the coming months than in 1961.

Based on the state of the Ocean and the early onset KMD has been issuing heavy rainfall advisories with the most recent being issued on the 23rd of October, 20191. The advisory indicated that heavy rainfall was expected over North East, South East, the Coastal Regions of Kenya, Western and Central regions including Nairobi Area. The 10-day dekad forecasts from the IGAD Climate Prediction & Application Center projected heavy rains for the period 21 to 31 October 2019. Additionally, with the enhanced rainfall expected in November and December, the frequency of heavy rain days is expected to increase over most parts of the Country Moyale, in Marsabit county as well as Turkana, Wajir and Mandera counties received very heavy rainfall and have remained cut off from access by humanitarian actors including the KRCS for two (2) weeks with a number of roads remaining impassable following collapse of bridges and roads cut off. This inaccessibility has affected community access to food from the markets which could negatively impact their food security status. There is also a risk of outbreak of diseases due to contamination of water sources and vector-breeding.

In parts of the Rift valley, West Kenya and Central highlands, heavy rains have also been experienced with varying levels of impacts including landslides and mud slides as reported by Kenya Red Cross branch staff and volunteers. In Elgeyo Marakwet County, a family of 4 lost their lives after their house was swept by a landslide in Turung village, Marakwet East. In Murangâ??a County, two landslides were reported which resulted in damage to houses and farms, but no injuries or deaths were reported.

Based on data from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers a total of 14,083HHs (approx. 84,367 people) have been affected, 21 deaths reported with 2 others injured. The number of displaced households is currently estimated at 6,000HHs. In addition, 531 acres of farmland have been destroyed and 21,675 livestock have been washed away. Assessments are continuously ongoing with a possibility of a significant increase in the number of affected populations.

The most affected counties are; Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kitui, Meru, Kajiado, Kwale, Nandi, Mombasa, Murangâ??a and Busia. It is important to note that flood prone counties in Kenya are those in western parts of Kenya as well as the coastal region. It is projected that as the rainfall intensifies counties in these regions will experience flooding and population displacements.","Tue, 29 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1391024-MDRKE045do%20%281%29.png?itok=mmcUUBaL,"['iod', 'n', 'rainfall', 'positive', 'heavy', 'parts', 'dref', 'action', 'enhanced', 'counties', 'emergency', 'plan', 'kenya', 'mdrke045', 'rains', 'floods', 'western']", ,none

At a Glance A locust swarm of biblical proportions is expected to invade Kenya via Ethiopia, for the second time this year.

Governments and the U.N. have warned that the locust will cause major food shortage in the region.

The East African Community secretariat will set aside emergency funds to turn tides against floods and locusts.

As deadly flooding leaves thousands homeless in Kenya, and a second wave of locust threatens the countryâ??s food supply, the east African nation is having its economy tested along with its neighbors in the region.

Earlier this week, deadly flooding and landslides in the eastern part of the country killed at least 100 and left over 1,800 homeless. This comes just weeks after flooding in the western part of the country left scores more homeless, too.

Now, a locust swarm of biblical proportions is expected to invade Kenya via Ethiopia for the second time this year.

The first swarm was the largest swarm that east Africa had seen in over 30 years, and the worst Kenya had seen in 70 years. The swarms can move up to 100 miles a day, depending on the wind, and can eat their weight daily. The first generation swarm peaked in the region two months ago, with locusts numbering in the hundreds of millions.

This second generation swarm is even bigger and more threatening.

This is known as the second generation of the pests, meaning the first swarm reproduced. This second generation is younger and more aggressive than the first. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), left unchecked, locusts swarms multiply by a factor of 20 per generation. Practically, that means there are probably trillions of locusts in the current swarm. They also estimate that this swarm is 400 times stronger than the first.

Governments and the U.N. have warned that the locust will cause major food shortage in the region. In its latest locust watch update, the U.N. said the situation was â??extremely alarmingâ? as an increasing number of new swarms form in north and central Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.

There are currently 18 swarms in Kenya. Regional governments have asked for financial aid to fight the swarms, but it is low priority due to COVID-19.

The swarms are near impossible to manage, especially without proper gear. As Ambroke Ngetich, FAO Project Officer in Kenya, told the BBC: â??Every time you are trying to control in one region, there is another swarm that is happening in a diff region and it is not possible to control them simultaneously.â?

Tens of thousands of liters of pesticides havenâ??t been able to reach the region, as the novel coronavirus closed international borders and disrupted the supply chain. Masses of adequate protective gear, to be used while spraying the pesticides, have also not made it to the region.

Advertisement Even if the materials were able to be delivered, however, it could be too late. Current solutions have not and will not work, the FAO warns local countries, as the sizes of the swarms are too big for aerial spraying. Further, current spraying practices donâ??t kill everything, leaving bugs in the ground.

The locusts present â??an extremely alarming and unprecedented threatâ? to food security and livelihoods, according to the U.N.

David Hughes from the U.N.â??s FAO, told the BBC that the swarms â??threaten the food of 23 million people. It is the number one food security issue in East Africa at the moment.â?

And, he explains, â??when you add on top of it, cyclones or whatever else weâ??ll have in the next 2-3 months... it's an absolutely unmitigated disaster.â?

The FAO warns that it will be too late to stop the locusts from spreading in less than six months, which would threaten millions with starvation.

Thus far, the winds have kept the swarm in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, which contains lots of open land unused by farmers. But with tens of millions in the region already dependent on food aid, this could turn into a humanitarian crisis quickly.

â??The current situation in East Africa remains extremely alarming as more swarms form and mature in northern and central Kenya and southern Ethiopia. This represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods because it coincides with the early beginning of the long rains and the current growing season,â? warns desert locust situation update report by FAO.

The swarm threatens the entire East Africa region, not just Kenya. In February, eight east African countries experienced the worst outbreak in 70 years, exacerbated by climate change and war in Yemen. Yemen and east Africa are roughly 152 miles apart, separated just by the Gulf of Aden. Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda were worst hit by the swarms.

All of this happens as the Lake Victoria Basin countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have experienced abnormally heavy rainfall since October 2019, which has effectively caused flooding, which also threatens food supply.

The East African Community (EAC) secretariat will set aside emergency funds to turn tides against floods and locusts, a new report by ReliefWeb indicates.

â??We have convened a meeting of Agriculture Ministers from the EAC to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture and the impending invasion of locusts in our region,â? said Christoph Bazivamo, deputy EAC secretary general in charge of the productive and social sector.","Wed, 06 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/2020-02-27T131202Z_1264416841_RC219F9A3MNZ_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-LOCUSTS.JPG,"['africas', 'locust', 'swarm', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'second', 'region', 'locusts', 'supply', 'swarms', 'east', 'kenya', 'severe', 'wave', 'generation']", ,none

â?¢ More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS).

â?¢ At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in north-western Kenya, according to the Government.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Most parts of the country continue to experience above average rainfall since the onset of the 2019 short rains (October â?? December). While the rainsâ?? driven by the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)â??might result in improved pasture conditions in arid and semi-arid lands, especially Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, and Wajir counties, as well as recharge of surface water pans and dams, including in Masinga, Kiambere and Turkwell dams, there are also reports of overspread damage, loss of lives and livelihoods due to heavy storms. Flash and riverine floods have affected at least 31 of the 47 Kenyaâ??s counties, including in Central, Coastal, Eastern, Northern, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western regions, and urban areas in Nairobi and Mombasa, according to the Governmentâ??s National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC). Landslides and mudslides have been reported in Meru, Murangâ??a, Taita Taveta and West Pokot counties, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). Overall, more than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to KRCS.

On 22 November, landslides and mudslides in parts of West Pokot County resulted in the death of at least 72 people and displacement of more than 10,000 people, according to the County authorities. Farms, food stores and livestock were swept away, and two bridges along the Kitale-Lodwar road (Ortum) and along Sigor road (Chepera) were cut-off, leaving dozens of commuters stranded and disrupting communication networks in the area. Search and rescue efforts are still ongoing in the area and the numbers of affected population could increase in the coming days. According to the County authorities, priority needs in the area include food and shelter, medical attention, water treatment chemicals and critical non-food items.

In Wajir County, floods arising from rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands cut off all the roads leading to Bute and Gurar in Wajir North sub-county and washed away a bridge in Buna Town, impacting supplies and response in the area. Communication to Moyale and Bute was reportedly disrupted and at least 5,000 people near Buna market were displaced to higher grounds.

In Garissa and Tana River counties, heavy rains on 22 and 23 November led to massive flooding in the area, exacerbated by the bursting of Tana River. On 24 November, KRCS response teams rescued 15 people who had been marooned at Hadama location in Tana North Sub-county in Tana River County. Preliminary assessments from Tana River and Garissa indicate that 624 families have been displaced. In the Central region, at least 550 people were reportedly displaced in Tigania, in Meru County.

Sections of roads and bridges have been cut-off, paralyzing transport and humanitarian access in Embu, Garissa, Isiolo, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Mombasa, Samburu, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Trans Nzoia, Turkana and Samburu counties. The Gurdis and Botula dams in Banisain Mandera County broke their walls or banks and require urgent repairs.

In Turkana, flash floods destroyed boreholes, calling for the installation of improved drainage system and relocation of people in affected residential areas to safer grounds. Public toilets and latrines have reported collapsed or are flooded in many areas, increasing the risks of disease outbreaks. Schools are closed in Trans Nzoia and Machakos counties, where several classrooms were flooded.

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue across the country over the next few weeks, mainly due to the positive IOD measurements. Flood alerts have been issued especially for Coastal, Northern and Western regions of the country, with the risk of landslides and mudslides expected in parts of the Central Highlands and parts of the Rift Valley, including West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi counties.

Kenya was already facing increase hunger prior to the floods, with 3.1 million people projected to be in crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity since October, according to the latest report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).","Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/East-Africa-Floods-May-2018-scr%20%281%29.png?itok=VeTki5bU,"['2019', '27', 'update', 'affected', 'river', 'counties', 'county', 'landslides', 'including', 'flash', 'according', 'kenya', 'rains', 'floods', 'tana']", ,flood
