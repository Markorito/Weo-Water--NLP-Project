A flash flood washed away 29 houses and damaged 64 houses in South Bolaang Mongondow district, North Sulawesi province on Saturday, 1 August 2020. Prior to the flash flood, communities were already dealing with floods due to continuous heavy rain since 26 July 2020. The flash flood was triggered by heavy rainfall that lasted from 18:45 to 19:05 hours local time on 31 July 2020 causing overflow of several rivers in Bolangaso, Toluaya, Salongo, Nunuka, Mongolidia and Milangodaadan.

Based on a report from the Provincial Indonesian Disaster Management Authority (Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah, BPBD), a total of 1,327 households (4,308 people) from 11 villages in three sub-districts were affected by the flash flood where in Salongo, Toluya, Soguo and West Salongo villages in Bolaang Uki sub-district – affecting 1,032 households (3,188 people); Biniha, South Biniha, Halabolu and Sindaka villages in Helumo sub-district – affecting 223 households (870 people); and Pakuku Jaya, Milangodaa and West Milangodaa villages in Tomini sub-district – affecting 62 households (250 people). One person was also reported missing due to the flash flood.

The flash flood collapsed four bridges in the area, making access difficult. However, the community constructed one temporary bridge using wood and local resources.

Responding to the flood emergency situation that started on 25 July 2020, South Bolaang Mongondow district government declared an initial emergency status for the area from 26 July to 6 August 2020. Due to the impacts from the flash flood, which occurred on 1 August 2020, a decision was made to extend the emergency status until 26 August 2020 (based on the Head of District of Decision Letter number 158/2020 about the emergency status declaration for South Bolaang Mongondow floods and landslide response). According to latest field reports, the flood has receded in most of the affected areas.

As of 4 August 2020, there have been eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Bolaang Mongondow district, with seven people recovered. To date, no positive cases have been reported from the evacuation zone. However, there have been dengue cases reported in the area earlier in the year, making the displaced households more vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases. Water borne diseases such as bacterial diarrhea, typhoid and Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E are all prevalent in Indonesia. Diarrhea remains one of the top ten causes of death in the country. Dengue is endemic in many cities and towns in the country and the infection rate increases every year. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of regencies and cities are affected. The increasing infection rate is associated with increased rainfall and temperatures.

Immediate needs and challenges

Based on PMI’s latest update, the current immediate needs are Psychosocial Support (PSS), family kits, hygiene kits, baby kits, medicines and mosquito nets. PMI South Bolaang Mongondow, with additional support from PMI East Bolaang Mongondow, has already mobilized support to fulfil several needs such as food packages, PSS, clean water supplies, blankets and hygiene kits.","Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1530901-MDRID018do.png?itok=_1SVdhRb,"['kits', 'n', 'bolaang', '2020', 'emergency', 'plan', 'flood', 'mdrid018', 'epoa', 'indonesia', 'floods', 'south', 'north', 'mongondow', 'villages', 'sulawesi', 'flash', 'operation', 'households']",

Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Central Jakarta Water Resource Agency has established 300 vertical drainages, in the form of infiltration wells, in anticipation of flooding in the area during the rainy season.“We have worked on (installing) 300 infiltration wells as vertical drainages,” said head of the agency, Ahmad Saiful, in Jakarta on Tuesday.He said the number of vertical drainages that have been in the works since the beginning of January this year has surpassed the halfway mark of the targeted vertical drainage construction in Central Jakarta.“Our target is to have infiltration wells in 500 spots. We have been able to develop the wells in 300 spots,” he said.Aside from developing more vertical drainages in Central Jakarta, the agency is also routinely ensuring the normalization of waterways in areas that are prone to flooding.Meanwhile, Central Jakarta Mayor Bayu Meghantara said another anticipatory measure that has been undertaken is cleaning out of waterways and maintenance of existing drainages.Earlier this year, massive floods swept several regions in the areas of Jakarta and Greater Jakarta, including Bogor, Tangerang, Depok, and Bekasi, due to torrential rains since the New Year's eve.Some areas in the Central part of Jakarta were inundated by high levels of water, including Bendungan Hilir, Anyar Menteng street, Surabaya street, Cilacap street, and Pegangsaan Barat street.

At least 20 people were killed and 13 others wounded Sunday in torrential rains and flooding, the latest victims of days of flooding in Sudan, the civil defense said.

Heavy rains typically hit Sudan between June and October each year, and this week the country has been badly battered by the downpour.

The latest toll brings to 35 the number of people killed since the end of July and to more than 7,000 the number of houses destroyed or damaged as a result of heavy rains and flooding.

The UN said on Wednesday that more than 50,000 people had been affected by the flooding.

Landslides and flooding triggered by days of heavy rain in South Korea have left at least 30 people dead and 12 missing, officials said Sunday, warning of more downpours.

Torrential rain has wreaked havoc across the country since the beginning of the month, but nearly half of the deaths occurred in the past three days, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

Since Friday more than 3,700 people have been displaced from their homes after flooding in the country's hardest-hit southern region.

In all, nearly 6,000 people have been evacuated from their homes across the country this month, with about 4,600 of them staying at temporary shelters.

Among the victims was a man in his 80s who was found dead after he was buried in a landslide with his tractor. A 61-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman were killed after their home was swallowed by a landslide.

Authorities have issued landslide warnings for 24 regions. At least 667 landslides have been reported so far in August.

More heavy rain is expected to cause further damage in flood-hit areas as Typhoon Jangmi, the season's fifth typhoon, is forecast to strike the southern region from Monday, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration.","Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/10/2020_08_10_101993_1596999903._large.jpg,"['typhoon', 'landslides', 'southern', 'rain', 'korea', 'landslide', '30', 'man', 'floods', 'homes', 'triggers', 'month', 'nearly', 'dead', 'south']",

The Red Cross has trained 43,000 North Korean volunteers to help communities, including the locked-down city of Kaesong, fight the novel coronavirus and provide flood assistance, an official with the relief organization said on Monday.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an emergency last month and imposed a lockdown on Kaesong, near the inter-Korean border, after a man who defected to the South in 2017 returned to the city showing coronavirus symptoms.

Heavy rain and flooding in recent days have also sparked concern about crop damage and food supplies in the isolated country.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has built an extensive network of North Korean volunteers to help residents in all nine provinces to avoid the virus and reduce damage from floods and landslides, spokesman Antony Balmain said.

""Hundreds of homes have been damaged and large areas of rice fields have been submerged due to heavy rain and some flash flooding,"" Balmain said.

Precipitation levels in the North this month were higher than 2007 when the country suffered its worst floods, a spokesman at Seoul's Unification Ministry overseeing inter-Korean affairs said.

In Kaesong, which was grappling with both the lockdown and floods, IFRC volunteers were providing 2,100 families most at risk with relief items including tarpaulins, kitchen sets, quilts, hygiene kits and water containers, Balmain said.

""Families are being supported with psychological first aid and awareness activities to maintain hygiene and stay healthy,"" he added.

Kim has also sent special aid packages to Kaesong, and state media reported on Monday that grain supplies from Pyongyang had arrived in another flood-ravaged county he visited last week.

North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus cases but has enforced strict quarantine measures. South Korea has said there is no evidence the returning defector was infected.

The IFRC last month provided North Korea with kits designed to run up to 10,000 coronavirus tests, alongside infrared thermometers, surgical masks, gowns and protective gears.

In South Korea, at least 32 people have died after 49 days of monsoon rains, the country's longest since 1987, caused flooding, landslides and evacuations.","Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/06/25/2020_06_25_98669_1593056408._large.jpg,"['volunteers', 'help', 'north', 'cope', 'trains', 'korea', 'coronavirus', 'kaesong', 'cross', 'nkoreans', 'floods', 'thousands', 'ifrc', 'month', 'korean', 'red', 'south']",

Days of heavy rain could cause flooding or landslides across North Korea, officials warned, as the South said Thursday 16 people had died in the downpours lashing the peninsula.

North Korea is particularly vulnerable to sustained heavy rain as many mountains and hills have long been stripped of vegetation, allowing water to flow downhill unchecked.

But the South has also suffered, with authorities saying at least 16 people had been killed in the past few days by floods in the central region.

Another 11 were missing, while 1,600 people had been displaced from their homes, authorities said.

The North's official KCNA news agency said areas hardest-hit by the downpour include Hwanghae province, a major agricultural region.

""It is important to take necessary measures for the regions which are in danger,"" said Dokgo Hyok Chol, an official at the State Hydro-meteorological Administration.

KCNA did not mention any casualties or damage caused by the rain.

At least 138 North Koreans died after torrential rain triggered major floods in 2016, the United Nations said at the time.

Flash floods triggered by torrential rains have killed at least 172 people across Yemen over the past month, damaging homes and UNESCO-listed world heritage sites, officials said.

The destruction has dealt a new blow to a country already in the grips of what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis after years of war between a Saudi-backed government and Iran-allied rebels.

In the mainly government-held province of Maarib east of the capital, 19 children were among 30 people killed by the floods, a government official said.

In the province's displaced persons camps, 1,340 families saw their tents and belongings swept away, the agency in charge of them said.

In Lahij province in the government-held south, seven people were drowned when their vehicle was swept downstream, a government official told AFP.

Another four people were killed on the road connecting the southern provinces of Hadramawt and Shabwa, the official added.

In the rebel-held north, the floods killed 131 people and injured 124 between mid-July and August 7, the rebel health ministry said.

They destroyed 106 homes and buildings and heavily damaged another 156, the rebel ministry added.

UNESCO expressed sadness at the flood damage to historic buildings in the cities of Sanaa, Zabid and Shibam that are on its world heritage list.","Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/12/2020_08_12_102222_1597232157._large.jpg,"['killed', '170', 'rebel', 'saidin', 'provinces', 'world', 'swept', 'floods', 'sanaa', 'yemen', 'official', 'dead']",

Days of heavy rain caused floods in South Korea that have forced more than 1,000 people from their homes, killing at least 13 with another 13 missing, authorities said on Tuesday.

Deaths were reported from landslides and vehicles swept away by waters that disaster officials said inundated more than 5,751 hectares (14,211 acres) of farmland and flooded parts of key highways and bridges in the capital, Seoul.

President Moon Jae-in was set to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday, after he had urged national and regional authorities to ""make all-out efforts to prevent further loss of life"" the previous day.

Work crews also returned to operation by Tuesday most of the flooded roads and bridges along the Han River in central Seoul that had backed up traffic and damaged infrastructure, the Yonhap news agency said.

At least 43 bodies have been recovered after a massive landslide triggered by monsoon rains swept away dozens of tea estate workers in southwestern India, police said Sunday.

The landslide in Idukki district, around 250 kilometers from Kerala state's capital Thiruvananthapuram, occurred Friday but the ongoing search and rescue efforts have been hampered by torrential downpours.

The toll rose to 43 on Sunday afternoon, Idukki district's police chief, R. Karuppasamy, told AFP.

Twenty-six of the bodies were recovered on Friday night, a police official said earlier Sunday.

Local media reported that some 78 people were believed to live in the area, with many still missing.

Kerala has been hit by deadly floods during the annual monsoon.

At least 18 people died in a passenger jet crash in Kerala on Friday when an Air India Express jet overshot the runway while trying to land in a storm and plunged down a bank.

10,10,FF-2020-000179-IDN,Japanese insurers to base premiums on flood risks - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Japanese-insurers-to-base-premiums-on-flood-risks,"TOKYO -- Japan's major nonlife insurers will introduce policies for corporate customers that base premiums on degrees of flood disaster risk as the industry adjusts to weather patterns that are bringing more rain to the country and forcing them to make record high payouts.

Risk will be assessed by consulting government hazard maps. Premiums will be lowered by 2% to 3% in areas unlikely to flood and raised about 10% for those with higher risk.

The insurance industry's total payouts for natural disasters reached an all-time high in the year through March 2019, exceeding 1 trillion yen ($9.45 billion) that year and the next.

The new risk-assessment procedure is aimed at limiting payouts by making corporate customers more conscious about degrees of risk associated with geographical areas and encouraging them to avoid locating their operations in high-risk areas.

The procedure is also meant to make corporate policyholders think carefully about the potential impact of disasters when they plan to build or relocate plants and facilities.

Insurers typically provide coverage for damage from floods and mudslides caused by typhoons and torrential rains in combination with fire insurance policies. Some policyholders in less disaster-prone areas have expressed discontent about blanket premium increases that fail to consider the degree of risk.

The new premiums are due to hit in January.

Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance plans to link premiums to data from hazard maps created by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. There will be three levels of premiums, which will be based on the expected depths of floodwaters when rivers overflow.

This will result in premiums going down 2% for property in areas that are assigned the lowest degree of risk. About 70% of the insurer's existing policies fall into this category. Premiums for areas carrying a high risk of flooding will increase 2%. About 25% of existing policies fall into this category. Premiums for areas where material damage is expected will increase 10%. Over 5% of existing policies fall into this category due to coverage for lowland areas near rivers, for example.

Sompo Japan Insurance will calculate premiums by combining geographical data provided by local governments and the hazard maps. Small to mid-size companies that have plants in areas likely to flood can expect to pay several thousand yen to several tens of thousands of yen more in annual premiums.

The government's hazard maps show where flooding can be expected in the event of torrential rain.

A 2015 amendment to a related law calls on local governments to consider more rainfall when estimating the extent of potential damage in their respective areas. It requires them to assume heavy, once-in-a-thousand-years downpours.

However, revised hazard maps have yet to be completed for many areas. The revisions need to come quickly if the private sector is to make full use of them.

Nonlife insurers are also working out frameworks to base premiums for individual insurance policies on the hazard maps. This may impact how individuals select their homes.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F8%252F2%252F8%252F28608282-6-eng-GB%252FCropped-1596446469RTS3IFJB.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['flood', 'policies', 'risk', 'high', 'hazard', 'insurers', 'premiums', 'areas', 'insurance', 'japanese', 'base', 'yen', 'risks', 'maps']",

The National Meteorological Center has issued a yellow alert, the second-lowest on a four-color scale. The move requires authorities in Shanghai and neighboring provinces such as Zhejiang and Anhui to go into crisis management mode.

Hagupit will be the fourth typhoon to reach China this year. It is packing maximum wind speeds of 72 kph at its center.

The meteorological center is also warning that two to three typhoons will hit in August. The average for this month is 1.9 typhoons, going back to the country's founding in 1949.

Elsewhere, China remains on high alert due to two months of downpours that have inundated cities along the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydropower plant, along the Yangtze, has been put to the test as it deals with the worst flooding to hit China since 1998.

The dam was completed in 2003.

As a precaution, authorities in the southern city of Sanya on Saturday closed all tourist spots. In Fujian Province's coastal cities, all fishing activities are halted as of today.

Fujian, across the strait from Taiwan, is not in Hagupit's path.

The government on Saturday called for ""all-out efforts"" to mitigate flooding and aid post-disaster recovery, acknowledging risks from high water levels in rivers and lakes, and behind dams.

The flooding is affecting 55 million people in 27 of China's 31 provinces. At least 158 people had died or gone missing as of July 28, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Direct economic losses were at 144 billion yuan ($20.6 billion), 14% higher than the five-year average.

Even so, the short-term impact will be moderate and not slow the nation's growth momentum, Haitong Securities said in a research note on Wednesday.

In 2018 alone, India suffered damages worth over Rs. 950 billion due to floods.

Number of urban floods is on the rise mainly due to poor drainage and encroachment of old water bodies of cities and towns.

Despite several agencies involved in flood control, there is a clear lack of coordination among them in the management of floods.

Despite this July being the driest July in the last five years, many parts of India, especially the states of Assam and Bihar, are still reeling under the floods. More than 10 million people are estimated to have been affected and at least 125 people have died due to floods in these two states until the first week of August this year. Besides, hundreds of villages of Uttar Pradesh were inundated, Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai was waterlogged and Kerala has an impending flood.

Flooding is a normal process during monsoon and to some extent, it is needed to carry out some natural processes like bringing alluvial soil to fields, groundwater recharge or replenishment of waterbodies. However, due to erratic weather patterns and an increasing number of intense rainfall events, the floods have become unpredictable and intractable.

In the last few years, the number of incidents and scale of floods has sharply increased and experts believe that effective and structured flood management is urgently required to handle this challenge.

Severe loss due to floods

One of the reasons for the recurring floods in many parts of India is their geographical location. For instance, states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Bihar are situated in the Terai region, the foothill of Himalayas and hundreds of watercourses originate from these mountains. Besides Ganga, the flood-prone river basins like Kosi, Gandak, Damodar, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi are spread across these states. These rivers have scores of mighty tributaries that bring enormous water in the rainy season causing floods.

According to data presented in the Rajya Sabha, in 2018, India lost 1,808 lives and suffered losses worth an estimated Rs. 957 billion (Rs. 95,736 crores) due to floods across the country. Government data shows that between 1953 and 2011, on an average, floods claimed 1,653 lives every year and caused losses – including the house, public property and crop damage – of Rs. 36.12 billion (Rs. 3,612 crores every year). According to the Assam government, since 1947 more than 125,000 (1.25 lakh) families in the state have lost either their residential land or agricultural land due to floods.

Some of the biggest flood disasters in the last 10 years include Uttarakhand in 2013, Kashmir in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Kerala in 2018 and 2019 and Patna in 2019 besides the recurring floods in northeastern India. According to the Central Water Commission, the expenditure on flood management has risen from Rs. 43.44 billion (Rs. 4,344 crores) in tenth five-year plan (2002-07) to Rs 171.30 billion (Rs 17,130 crores) in 11th five-year plan (2007-12).

Multi-agency role in flood management

In India, a vast federal country with 28 states and eight union territories, the responsibility of flood control and management is scattered across many agencies. The water resources ministries of different states oversee the flood control in consultation with the Central Water Commission (CWC). The main job of CWC is to procure the data of hydrology at the national level – like river discharge measurement and water level in dams etcetera – to alert the states about any imminent or potential flood. Besides, there is a Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC), under the Union Jal Shakti Ministry to “deal with flood and its management in Ganga basin states.”

In addition to this, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides rainfall or cyclonic event forecast which is used by all the agencies for preparedness to deal with the floods. For the national-level response to disasters, there is National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) which works under Prime Minister Office (PMO) – and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) – a body under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The job of relief and rescue is carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) with state counterparts.

Despite such a plethora of agencies, flood control and management remains a problem in India. Experts believe “streamlining and coordination” among the vast network of agencies is missing.“It is true that various organisations are working at different levels across the country but the problem is in synchronization, collaboration or coordination among these agencies. It is very weak and institutional management is required for effective flood management. We should focus on developing a platform where all the information comes together that can be used effectively and efficiently.” Prasoon Singh, Associate Fellow with Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) told Mongabay-India.

Changing nature of floods and expanding area

Officially, the total flood-prone area of India is around 40 million hectares which is equivalent to 12 percent of the total area of the country. However, experts note that this figure does not show the actual geographical area vulnerable to floods.

“This figure of the flood-prone area is very old and we have been hearing this figure of 40 to 50 million hectares for at least the last two and a half decades now. Actually, this figure is related to notified riverine flood areas. Now in the last few years, the form and extent of floods have changed a lot and now our towns are also getting inundated. Therefore, we need to map the entire flood-prone area again to get a realistic picture” Anil Gupta, Head of NIDM told Mongabay-India.

Earlier the flood was largely limited to the areas around the basins of rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Gandak, Damodar and Mahanadi. The timing of flood was also limited to rainy seasons and rural populations would deal with the floods in conventional methods. But with the rise of population, new towns and cities rose and old ones expanded. Often this change was poorly executed without any properly thought out master plan. This has resulted in urban flooding events like Mumbai in 2005, Chennai in 2015 and Patna in 2019. Many flood management and weather experts stress the need for identifying the vulnerable “hot-spots” for inundation. They believe mapping of such areas and keeping a meticulous database may provide a micro picture to administrators.

The erection of unnecessary embankments and structures along the banks to “control river flow” has also been questioned by many experts. Rashtriya Barh Aayog (National Flood Commission) set up in the 1970s recommended against such structures unless their “efficacy” is properly assessed.

Dinesh Mishra, a trained engineer and writer who has been monitoring and researching on floods for the past 40 years, stresses the need for proper drainage. He said embankments can only be a temporary solution in some cases.

“In 2007, during the devastating Kosi floods in Bihar, the river had broken the embankments at more than 30 places and at hundreds of places the national highways and state roads were broken. Still, we are erecting the embankments today. This water (of Kosi floods in 2007) had spread all over and remained locked in over in north Bihar for next two and a half months. It means there was no way for the water to get out. The lesson to be learnt is that the embankments are not the solutions and we need proper drainage to deal with floods.” Dinesh Mishra told Mongabay-India.

R.K Jenamani, a senior scientist who is heading the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre at the IMD agreed with Mishra and said the absence of proper drainage is the key reason behind the urban floods. “We provide early warning for floods but that is just a part of (flood) management. Other things also need to be fixed. You see Mumbai was flooded in 2005 and after 15 years it is still flooding. Why is it flooding even today if people know that the proper drainage system is the only solution? The rain can’t stop. The sea can’t stop,” Jenamani told Mongabay-India.

In the past few decades, the extreme rainfall events have increased causing erratic and heavy rain in short intervals, but factors like poor drainage, excessive cementing of ground, the encroachment of waterbodies – like ponds and lakes- and unplanned garbage disposal have aggravated the situation. Shiraz Wajih, a conservationist, is working on civic issues like strengthening solid waste management and reviving the dying water bodies.

“This entire area of terai at the foothills of Himalaya has been abound in waterbodies. These bodies (rivers, lakes and ponds) provided water holding capacity by storing the water when it rained heavily but in the last few years either these places have been encroached for construction or filled with solid waste and garbage. Therefore, the natural cushion or buffer to accommodate the rainwater have been destroyed in urban areas,” Wajih, told Mongabay-India.

Wajih says once the city of Gorakhpur had more than 100 lakes but today two-third of them are dead today. He shows the conservation effort led by citizens that protected one vast Ramgarh taal of Gorakhpur.

“The conservation of Ramgarh taal was possible with community participation and administration’s help. Protecting such water bodies helps to build cushion and storage capacity to accommodate the floods,” Wajih said.

Land-use policy and capacity building

India’s land policy hasn’t been congenial for efficient flood management either. There have been a number of political, social and economic reasons behind it. A report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) clearly underlined the threat of the weaknesses in any country’s land policy.

“Modern land use gradually encroaching on the natural environment has an impact on all three dimensions of flood risk, namely hazard, vulnerability and exposure,” the WMO report had noted.

Anil Gupta, Head of the NIDM said “land is not a dead entity but it is a living entity like humans and we must give it adequate space to breathe.” The report of WMO highlights the same concern and flags the dangers of a degrading landmass. “Removing vegetation and soil, grading land surface and constructing drainage networks disrupts natural drainage patterns and natural watercourses. By changing pervious natural surfaces to less- or non-pervious artificial surfaces, stormwater runoff rate and total runoff volume increase as a result of declining natural land water storage capacity.”

It clearly shows the importance of the natural defense system of the earth. Last year, a study published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science analysed how the land-use change impacts flood in coastal areas. One of the findings of the research established the importance of mangroves on the coastal areas prone to flood.

“Mangroves at the seashore work as a protection wall during any coastal flood. Particularly when the flood is caused by a powerful cyclonic storm. Now we know due to global warming effects the cyclones are getting more frequent and intense so mangrove conservation is extremely important and we should protect them from any destruction or degradation,” TERI’s Prasoon Singh, who was one of the co-authors of that research, told Mongabay-India.

Can an early flood warning system solve the issue?

In the last few years, India has focused on building a robust early flood warning system. Chennai suffered major floods in 2015 and, in 2019, it became the first city in India to get an intelligent flood warning system. Similarly, Mumbai got the integrated flood warning system (IFLOWS) in June 2020. These flood warning systems can give area-wise potential flooding details during monsoon. TERI is now launching a similar flood forecasting system for Assam which has been prepared in collaboration with the IMD and the NDMA. According to the IMD, it is now also using rainfall information to calculate the total expected accumulation of water on any river or sub river basins. Getting such information and its sharing with different agencies may help in better flood management as well.

“Such steps are important. This is moving towards building resilience. We should not always think of conquering nature. We should learn to live with nature and the risks associated with it,” Gupta said.

She lines up dozens of pairs of sodden, mud-caked shoes on the pavement outside, appealing hopefully to a passer-by, ""I will sell at any price.""

The pedestrian moves quickly on and Ms Liu is left to rue a curse that besets China almost every year, costing millions of dollars in damage and, in bad years like this one, hundreds of lives - the failure to prevent its rivers from overflowing.

""None of us expected the flood to be so serious,"" said Ms Liu, 63, who like many Chinese citizens, only gave her family name.

""I was standing at the window of my home not far from here watching the floodwaters rising. There was nothing I could do except worry.""

For centuries, China's response to its unruly rivers has been to try to restrain them with levees, dams and canals to ""make the high mountain bow its head and make the river yield its way"", as Chairman Mao Zedong put it.

China's National Climate Centre has records of natural disasters going back 500 years, and in almost every one of them there was a major flood.

Yet the rivers continue to burst and China's rapid urbanisation is making things worse.

Former flood plains have become houses and factories, protected by ever-higher embankments.

So the government is trying a new approach.

On the northeastern fringe of Chongqing, around the giant new international exhibition centre, the rising district of Yuelai is designed as a ""sponge city"".

China's cities flood partly because most of the water-retaining land that used to absorb rainfall - grassland, woods and lakes - has been paved over, forcing rain to flow directly into poorly built or outdated sewage and drainage systems that can no longer cope.

The ""sponge city"" initiative, launched in 2015, is an attempt to reverse that - soak up heavy precipitation and release it slowly into the river and reservoirs.

Using features such as rooftop gardens, scenic wetland parks, permeable pavements and underground storage tanks, the plan is to eventually absorb or reuse 70 per cent of the rainwater that falls on four-fifths of China's urban land.

""We need to give the space back to the water,"" said professor of landscape architecture Yu Kongjian of Peking University.

""We should treat water as a valuable resource, not our enemy.""

Yuelai is one of the pilot sites approved by the central government. Its Exhibition Centre Park is set lower than the surrounding ground to collect rainwater, which is filtered by layers of aquatic plants.

Rain falling on rooftops is diverted to nearby parks, while sidewalks are made of absorbent materials.

While Ms Liu and her fellow shopkeepers in the old city were cleaning out silt-filled stores, in Yuelai, on the banks of the Jialing River, there was little sign of inundation.

Among tended lawns and newly paved roads, workers place the final touches to buildings that will be part of a new business district.

On the roofs of restaurants and shops behind the exhibition halls, three labourers cut the grass on a rooftop garden that's designed to soak up rain.

It seems like a positive sign for Chongqing, built among mountains where two major rivers meet - the Jialing and the Yangtze, which has had more money spent on preventing flooding than most.

Chongqing is at the top of the 600-kilometre-long reservoir created by the US$24 billion (S$32.95 billion) Three Gorges Dam, China's largest single flood-mitigation project.

Completed in 2006, the dam generates 22.5 gigawatts of power, but its primary role was to regulate the annual flooding of the Yangtze.

A museum in Chongqing commemorates the 1.4 million people who were forced to leave homes that were flooded by the project, ""a witness of Chinese people making personal sacrifices for the good of the motherland"", said the museum's guide.

A picture on the wall shows an old man handing his son a young Huangjue fig tree to plant in his new home, 1,500 kilometres away, to remember his roots.

Each spring, the reservoir's vast lake is lowered to accommodate the summer rains and prevent floodwaters from inundating cities downstream like Wuhan.

Related Story China evacuates thousands after fresh floods threaten villages

The dam was designed to regulate floods so large they only occur once in 10,000 years, but within a decade of its completion, Wuhan, downstream of the barrage, was inundated again as the Yangtze burst its banks.

Wuhan was once known as the ""city of 100 lakes"", a reference to its giant flood plain which used to absorb the river's annual floods. About three-quarters of those lakes were filled in for construction in the past thirty years.

""China has lost most of its natural wetlands along the Yangtze River, so there's no place for the water to go,"" said Dr Jennifer Turner, Director of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Centre based in Washington, DC.

This year, the city that was the genesis of the global coronavirus pandemic was hit again.

Dams ""may be useful for controlling floods in normal years but not years like this"", said professor of environmental studies Darrin Magee of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York, who predicts the flooding will probably get worse due to climate change.

""Three Gorges Dam can hold a lot of water, but not the entire Yangtze.""

The government and the dam's operator have said that the flooding downstream would have been worse without the dam as the volume of water released from the reservoir was less than the amount of water flowing in.

As the floods swept across southern China in July, the National Development and Reform Commission promised to spend another 1.29 trillion yuan (S$254.99 billion) on 150 major ""water projects"" in the next few years - normally a reference to more dams, reservoirs and dikes.

The banks of the Yangtze and its tributaries now have an estimated 34,000 kilometres of levees, more than the length of the Great Wall of China.

While the policy has helped save lives, flooding remains China's biggest natural headache.

Between 1950 and 2018, more than 280,000 people died and 9.6 million hectares of crops were lost due to floods.

Prof Yu at Peking University said the top leadership has realised the need for a greener approach, but it's difficult to change the long-embedded practices at a provincial level.

""It's a long process to change people's belief that bigger means better,"" he said.

Big economic and environmental strategies dictated by Beijing tend to get corrupted as they filter down to local government level, with provincial officials and companies using the political endorsement and government money to pursue their own agendas.

Developers portray potential projects as efforts to implement Beijing's agenda in order to gain rapid approval for new construction.

Near the five-star Wyndham Hotel in Yuelai, bulldozers and cranes flatten land that was previously tree-covered hills, one of dozens of new development projects in the new towns that have sprung up on the edges of Chongqing.

""The developers cut down the forest and destroy the grass, build houses, and then plant decorative trees so it becomes a 'sponge city' and they make a bunch of money,"" said Mr Zuo, a taxi driver in Chongqing who also would only give his family name.

And once the money is spent and the new developments built, there's often little incentive to maintain the original programme.

In one of Yuelai's earliest sponge projects, a rainwater-collecting garden is filled with rubbish and wild grass has overgrown the plants designed to purify the rainwater.

It's also hard to ""green"" cities retroactively. Most of China's sponge city projects are in new suburbs.

Chongqing says they now cover 40 square kilometres of the municipality, but in communities like Old Street, few people have even heard of the term.

""It's much more difficult to fix the existing problems in the old sector of cities that are populous and badly planned,"" said professor of urban planning and architecture Yang Peifeng of Chongqing University.

Yet China's sponge city initiative is a sign that the tide in China is turning and that development at all costs is becoming less acceptable to the nation's citizens.

""I would love to see people just leave the nature alone of course, but it's not realistic to stop development in China right now,"" said Mr Yu Jianfeng, founder of Chongqing-based pressure group the Public Culture Centre of Environmental Protection for Rivers.

""But at least sponge cities give the urbanisation some rules and restrictions.""","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/08/14/nz_chongqing_140853.jpg?itok=LmYQQc3p,"['fatal', 'china', 'trying', 'yangtze', 'chinas', 'river', 'floods', 'water', 'way', 'sponge', 'tame', 'flooding', 'city', '500', 'dam', 'tries']",

A Chinese national who works at a nickel smelter in Indonesia’s Southeast Sulawesi province will stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter after he allegedly drove a truck over and killed a colleague last month, police said Tuesday.

The incident came amid public opposition to the recent arrivals of 500 Chinese workers to the province, where they are employed at China-owned nickel smelters.

Lee Shang Bing, 35, allegedly drove a dump truck over the Indonesian mechanic, who was lying under the vehicle, and killed him while the two were doing repair work on July 18, said the head of the local police’s criminal investigation unit, Husni Abdi.

“We have sent the file to the prosecutor’s office,” Husni told BenarNews, adding that a date for Lee’s trial had not been decided.

Lee could face a maximum of five years in prison if convicted, Husni said.

Lee, who works as a mechanic at PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) in Konawe regency, had been assigned to repair the 10-wheel dump truck along with Yusran, a 30-year-old Indonesian coworker, Husni said.

“Lee asked his subordinate to fix it together. When Yusran was checking a cable under the truck, Lee started the engine and the truck ran over the victim,” Husni said.

“It was a case of negligence, either because of miscommunication or something else,” said Husni, adding that during the investigation, the suspect was accompanied by an interpreter from the company.

The company’s external affairs manager, Indrayanto, declined to comment on the case.

It was the second fatal incident involving Chinese workers in the province this year.

In May, Dong Ming, a Chinese worker at PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS), was charged with manslaughter after his truck allegedly collided with a motorcycle carrying a fellow Chinese and a local colleague, killing them both.

A date for his trial has not been set, a police official said.

500 Chinese workers

Since June, about 500 Chinese workers have arrived at Konawe to work at VDNI and Obsidian, replacing other Chinese staff whose contracts had expired.

VDNI is a subsidiary of Delong Nickel Industry Co. Ltd, based in Jiangsu, China, while Obsidian is a unit of Singapore-based Hongkong Xiangyu Hansheng Co., Ltd.

The two companies are building nickel smelters in a 5,500-hectare (13,590-acre) industrial estate in Konawe.

Their arrivals prompted rallies by students and others who fear that the Chinese will take jobs from locals. They also said the new workers could spread coronavirus at a time when the country is struggling to contain the pandemic.

A director at the Ministry of Manpower, Aris Wahyudi, said the Chinese were skilled workers whose contracts required them to transfer their knowledge to local colleagues, and who would not steal their jobs.

He also said they had passed health examinations and did not have COVID-19.

“When their job is done, they will return to their country,” he told BenarNews.

He declined to comment on the state of work safety at the two projects.

Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has made improving the country’s infrastructure a priority during his second term in office and has been trying to woo Chinese investment.

Prior to his re-election last year, Jokowi attended the 2017 unveiling of Beijing’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, an estimated U.S. $1 trillion-plus initiative to build a network of railways, ports and bridges across 70 countries.

A $6 billion high-speed railway linking Jakarta and Bandung is OBOR’s flagship project in Indonesia.

The perceived influx of Chinese workers into the country in recent years has caused unease among Indonesians, who fear that Chinese workers are stealing jobs from them.

In recent years, local media have reported about foreigners, most of them Chinese nationals, being caught working illegally in parts of the country.

Fears of foreigners taking over jobs from locals are often inflamed by baseless rumors spreading on social media and online messaging platforms that millions of Chinese have flooded the country.

The Manpower Ministry said in February that there were just over 40,000 Chinese workers in Indonesia.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/worker-charged-08042020161225.html/200804-ID-labor-620.jpg/@@images/image,"['fatal', 'truck', 'recent', 'pt', 'local', 'facing', 'chinese', 'accident', 'nickel', 'indonesia', 'worker', 'workers', 'work', 'husni', 'trial']",

The activists and some experts blamed ongoing infrastructure projects like the coastal road project and metro work but the local administration dismissed such claims and emphasised that it was due to an extreme weather event only.

Some experts rued about the lack of open spaces in the city which were able to absorb the extra water during such events.

With ‘unprecedented’ being the mantra for 2020 events, the monsoon floods in India’s commercial capital, Mumbai, too, followed suit and reached areas that were never flooded before. South Mumbai was lashed with its second-highest 24-hour rainfall since 1974 on August 5 and the city witnessed wind speed higher than what was recorded during Cyclone Nisarga, a tropical storm that hit the state in June. Citizens and activists blame infrastructure work including the coastal road project and the Mumbai Metro project and highlight the need for long-term planning to address the impact of increasing extreme weather events in the city.

Prior to August 5, the national weather forecaster, India Meteorological Department (IMD), had issued a red alert for Mumbai and adjoining regions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts for August 4 and 5. On August 5, Mumbai witnessed 294 millimetres rainfall in just 12 hours – the IMD categorises rainfall more than 204 mm (in 24 hours) as ‘extremely heavy’. On August 6 morning, the IMD’s observatory in Colaba (Mumbai) had recorded 331.8 mm rainfall in 24 hours. This was not only the highest August rainfall since 1974 but also the second-highest 24-hour rainfall recorded by Colaba observatory in any month of monsoon since 1974. Colaba observatory is representative of South Mumbai whereas the Santacruz observatory is representative of Mumbai. The other noteworthy characteristic of the August 5 weather was the wind speed was about 106 kilometres per hour (kmph) which is more than 92 kmph recorded when Cyclone Nisarga skirted Mumbai in June.

The rainfall led to flooding in areas of south Mumbai such as Churchgate, Fort, Oval Maidan, Charni Road, Girgaum Chowpatty, Masjid station, J.J. Hospital, Breach Candy, Haji Ali, Hindmata junction among others. While the last location is prone to flooding every monsoon, the rest are never known to flood. Residents of south Mumbai, one of the original seven islands, have not experienced flooding even during the deluge of 2005 when Colaba observatory had recorded only 73.4 mm rainfall.

Atul Kumar, a member of Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens’ Association, said, “In this area, the flooding (on August 5) took everyone by surprise. Nobody could recall a time when there was so much rain, so much flooding and such high-intensity winds. Buildings on Marine Drive have been here now since 1940 and despite being sea facing, this is the first time that we are seeing leakages in buildings. In the past also, Colaba has observed heavy rainfall but there has been no flooding. Some people say that the rain coincided with high tide but then it should have flooded in the past also.” However, Kumar said there is no evidence to directly link the flooding to metro project work or coastal road project work.

The heavy rainfall coupled with intense winds led to around 600 complaints of trees or branches falling in Mumbai within three days (August 4 to 6). They also led to the collapse of the iconic signage of the Bombay Stock Exchange, a landslide at Peddar Road, cracks at the Malabar Hill’s Ridge Road and cancellation of suburban trains. Hundreds had to be rescued from stranded trains using boats.

The IMD attributed the weather event to active monsoon conditions over the country’s west coast. Rainfall abated in Mumbai August 6 onwards but IMD has forecast another wet spell from August 11.

Both natural and man-made factors to be blamed for Mumbai flood

Activists and experts state that what caused the severity of floods this year was a combination of natural and man-made factors. The South Mumbai area has seen work on two important infrastructure projects commence in recent years including the coastal road project and Metro phase-III. Both the projects, together worth billions of rupees, have been staunchly opposed by environmentalists for their ill-impact on local ecology.

Stalin D., director of a non-governmental organisation, Vanashakti, has been at the forefront of the Save Aarey movement, said the August 5 flooding was clearly due to these projects. “If it were only due to heavy rainfall, how did these spots not flood in 2005? I had warned last year itself that Chowpatty will flood (owing to the coastal road work). When you reclaim the sea, the water has to go somewhere. Metro’s phase-III have also altered the underground drainage network.”

In 2016, a report by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-National Institute of Oceanography had said that “the model simulations for the case of reclamation for the coastal road facility resulted in increased water levels, increased flow speeds and consequently increased bed level changes… However, the overall project of the coastal road needs to be planned and executed with minimum interference to the existing coastal environment.” The CSIR-NIO report of 2016 was not commissioned to study the proposed coastal road exclusively but the impact of land reclamation and its influence on Mumbai’s coastline as well as its implications for proposed projects.

Activist Zoru Bhathena who has been vocal against both projects explained, “Historically, reclamation has proven bad for Mumbai which is why Cuffe Parade’s remaining reclamation was dropped, coastal road idea was also dropped after being conceived decades ago for the same reason. Besides, Metro authorities have dug up roads that had British-era stormwater drains underneath and such large scale digging affects groundwater retaining capacity. Metro phase-III have taken over so many open spaces as well that were available to absorb rainwater.”

Shweta Wagh, Assistant Professor at Mumbai-based Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies (KRVIA), who had petitioned the Supreme Court against the coastal road, said, “Reclamation for the coastal road may be vacant but it is equivalent to concretisation.”

“Also, if you look at the profile of the intertidal area (affected by coastal road project), it retains seawater. Even though they say it is barren, it serves the ecological function of holding tidal water during high tide,” Wagh told Mongabay-India.

Is concretisation to be blamed?

After facing criticism year after year for shoddy roads and footpaths, this year, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has infact increased area under concrete. According to its budget for the ongoing financial year, 266 km worth of roads are proposed to be improved using concrete, which is nearly four times the 65-km in 2019-20, and 13 times the 20-km in 2018-19. Besides, the civic body has started concretisation of footpaths using the likes of stencil concrete instead of paver blocks for better durability. Bhathena told Mongabay-India that tar roads allow 30 percent water to seep while paver blocks allow 50 percent water to seep underground but concretisation does not let any, leading to the entire volume of water running into the ill-equipped drains.

Nikhil Anand, a professor from the University of Pennsylvania criticised the BMC over the flooding and rued about eco-systems which used to absorb extra water. “With many of the city’s open spaces – playgrounds, intertidal regions – paved over, there is nowhere, but the city’s stormwater drains and rivers, for this water to go. The rivers have also been narrowed and channelised. After the 2005 floods, the stormwater drain capacity was upgraded in parts of the city under BRIMSTOWAD (Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System, a project to overhaul Mumbai’s water drainage system) from handling a maximum of 25 mm of rain to 50 mm of rain per hour. But this is their maximum capacity at low tide. The city needs to find other ways to accommodate rainwater when it falls. Unfortunately, the BMC is doing the opposite by sanctioning real estate firms to pave over open space, or moving stormwater drains when they are on private land,” Anand told Mongabay-India.

However, urban planner Pankaj Joshi, director of Urban Design Research Institute, disagreed that concretisation of roads and footpaths caused large-scale flooding but instead emphasised on the hazardous concretisation of open space within housing societies compounds. “It is time we create a 20-year climate change mitigation plan for Mumbai that will be linked to the city’s development plan and civic budget. Such extreme weather events are going to happen more frequently now and we need dedicated focus on mitigation,” said Joshi.

P. Velrasu, who is BMC’s additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of the stormwater drain department, disagrees with activists. “We don’t see any correlation between the two projects and flooding. The issue happened due to heavy rainfall and high-speed winds in the island city- the system cannot deal with that sort of downpour. Drainage systems can handle only 60-70 mm downpour. Concretisation happens in any developing city internationally. At other places, they have water holding ponds in their urban design. We also want to develop the same. What has been done in Japan is very expensive, instead, we can develop holding ponds under the city’s open spaces.”

20,20,FF-2020-000179-IDN,A land without farmers: Indonesia's agricultural conundrum - Jakarta Post - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/longform/2020/08/13/a-land-without-farmers-indonesias-agricultural-conundrum.html,"The rate at which the country is losing farmers is a cause for concern. If it continues, Indonesia is likely to have no farmers left in 50 years. What will we eat?

“Well, we will be hungry,” said Adang Parman, 58, a farmer from Ciburial village in West Java. Every day, the father of three heads out to the field at the break of dawn to pull out weeds, water his plants or pluck vegetables from his rows of plants. His sons, meanwhile, plow the land with a handheld walking tractor.

Adang has been working in the fields for more than 40 years. The work is demanding and laborious. This probably explains why fewer and fewer people are taking up the profession.

The country lost 5.1 million farmers between 2003 and 2013, with their numbers falling to 26 million, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS). The trend is expected to continue in the next few years. At this rate, Indonesia would lose all its farmers by 2063.

“A large proportion of young people view agricultural work as low-wage, manual labor that is more suited to those from poor backgrounds who have limited education,” a 2016 SMERU Research Institute report reads.

Agriculture is a huge contributor to Indonesia’s economy. Around 29 percent of the Indonesian workforce works in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector, which contributes nearly 13 percent to the country’s GDP. It is the third-biggest contributor to the economy after manufacturing and trade, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data.

Fewer young people are pursuing farming as a profession compared with previous generations. Only 23 percent of the country’s 14.2 million people aged between 15 and 24 worked in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors in 2019, data from the National Labor Force Survey showed.

Asep, Tisna, Dika – Adang’s three sons – represent the minority of young people venturing into agriculture, following in their father’s footsteps.

With a population of just 12,000 — less than a quarter the capacity of a major football stadium — Ciburial offers vast expanses of lush, fertile land, perfect for farming. This is not the case elsewhere in Indonesia.

Between 2013 and 2019, Indonesia’s agricultural land decreased to 7.46 million hectares from 7.75 million ha, according to data collected by the Agrarian and Spatial Planning Ministry, BPS and several other government institutions.

Problems like increasing production costs, changes in weather and pest attacks have also pushed farmers to change professions, with land owners either converting land to other uses or selling it, the SMERU report states.

So, what went wrong? How can we support more farmers like Adang and his family? The Jakarta Post spoke to farmers, agriculture and food companies, policymakers and experts on the challenges and opportunities for Indonesia’s farmers and the agriculture sector.","Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/11/2020_08_11_102100_1597119285._medium.jpg,"['bps', 'land', 'young', 'indonesias', 'conundrum', 'million', 'indonesia', 'agricultural', 'according', 'work', 'agriculture', 'farmers']",

ISLAMABAD (Xinhua) – At least 64 people were killed and dozens injured in heavy monsoon rain-triggered flash floods and different rain-related incidents, during the last three days in different regions of Pakistan, said a report from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Sunday evening.

According to the report released by the NDMA, at least 19 children and nine women are among those who lost their lives in different rain-related incidents in areas ranging from the north to the south of the country.

The country’s northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst-hit region with 25 deaths followed by southern Sindh with 12 deaths and southwest Balochistan and eastern Punjab provinces which reported eight deaths each. At least 10 people died in the Gilgit-Baltistan region in the north of the country.

The flash flooding destroyed four bridges, three in Balochistan and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, disconnecting road links among hundreds of villages, said the report.

Hundreds of soldiers of Pakistan army backed by helicopters had to rush to affected areas to assist the local rescue and relief services having inadequate resources and expertise to cope with the current emergency situation.","Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/c1t8y3ok.jpg,"['report', 'flash', 'north', 'region', '60', 'monsoon', 'different', 'rainrelated', 'pakistan', 'ndma', 'floods', 'pakhtunkhwa', 'triggers', 'deaths', 'killing']", 
22,22,FF-2020-000179-IDN,250 million coastal dwellers will face rising floods | News - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/250-million-coastal-dwellers-will-face-rising-floods/,"In the next 80 years flooding around the planet’s land masses is likely to rise by almost 50 per cent, endangering many millions of coastal dwellers.

If humans go on burning ever greater volumes of fossil fuels, while destroying ever more natural forest, then another 77 million people could be at risk of flooding, a rise of 52 per cent.

And these floods – increasingly frequent and extending over greater areas – will put at risk cities, homes, resorts and industries valued at more than $14 trillion (£10.7tn).

This sum alone is worth 20 per cent of global gross domestic product, the economist’s preferred indicator of economic health and wealth, according to a new study in the journal Scientific Reports.

The researchers built their argument on historic data from 681 tide-gauge stations around the world to model the growing hazard at 10,000 coastal locations.

They conclude that the land area exposed to extreme flood will increase by more than 250,000 sq kms – an increase of 48 per cent – to 800,000 sq kms, a threat to 252 million people.

“A warming climate is driving sea level rise because water expands as it warms, and glaciers are melting. Climate change is also increasing the frequency of extreme seas, which will further increase the risk of flooding,” said Ebru Kirezci of the University of Melbourne, Australia, who led the study.

“What the data and our model are saying is that compared with now, what we see as a one-in-100-year extreme flood event will be ten times more frequent because of climate change.”

None of this should come as a surprise to civic authorities, governments, hydraulic engineers and oceanographers: researchers have been warning for years that coastal floods driven by global heating will end up costing colossal and seemingly ever increasing sums.

On a global scale, and on regional examination, the story remains the same, and wealthy and developed societies in Europe and the US face the same rising tide of hazard as the world’s poorest in the crowded coastal cities of Africa and Asia.

“ Compared with now, what we see as a one-in-100-year extreme flood event will be ten times more frequent because of climate change. Ebru Kirezci, infrastructure engineering department - ocean engineering, University of Melbourne

Estimate too low?

A mix of more extreme storms and storm surges, combined with ever higher sea levels, will sweep away the world’s beaches and turn millions of comfortable US citizens into climate refugees.

It is even possible that researchers have under-estimated the hazard, simply because satellite-based measurements may have misread precise land elevation: in some cases, too, coasts are sinking independently of sea level rise.

The latest study identifies a series of flood “hotspots” around the world. These include south-eastern China, Australia’s Northern Territory, Bangladesh, West Bengal and Gujarat in India, the US states of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, and north-west Europe including the UK, northern France and northern Germany. The new map of risks takes no account of existing flood defences, but highlights the levels of threat to come.

“This is critical research from a policy point of view, because it provides politicians with a credible estimate of the risks and costs we are facing, and a basis for taking action,” said Ian Young, an engineer at the University of Melbourne, and a co-author.

“This data should act as a wake-up call to inform policy at global and local government levels so that more flood defences can be built to safeguard coastal life and infrastructure.”

Rescuers brought in a crane and lowered the cattle one by one from the rooftops, hoisting them onto a sling.

Dozens of cows were stranded on rooftops by floods in South Korea, leaving rescue crews facing a problem the size of several bovines.

The cattle floated upwards as floodwaters mounted at the weekend in Gurye, a farming town in the country’s south, and scrambled to safety on the roofs of several houses and other buildings.

When the deluge receded, the animals found themselves stranded high and somewhat damp, and on the horns of a dilemma with no way to get down.

Pictures showed as many as nine of them standing on one battered rooftop, looking mildly non-plussed.

“The cows were swimming as the water level surged and made their way up onto the roof and stayed there even after the floodwaters subsided,” one resident told television channel JTBC.

Rescuers brought in a crane and lowered the cattle one by one from the rooftops, hoisting them onto a sling.

But while the cows eventually did come home, many were showing symptoms of pneumonia, according to a veterinarian volunteering with the relief efforts.

More than 150,000 Somalis have been forced to flee their homes since late June, including some 23,000 in the last week alone, due to flash and riverine flooding in the Southern regions of Somalia. Rapid assessments indicate that communities in Hirshabelle and South West States are amongst the worst hit. The year has seen extreme flooding, displacing over 650,000 people across the country since the beginning of the year.

Many of the newly displaced are now living in overcrowded, makeshift shelters constructed from old clothes, plastic bags, cardboard and sticks in already dire IDP sites. Such shelter provides little protection from the harsh weather, and leaves families exposed to increased risk of crimes like robbery and rape.

Food is in short supply and many are going hungry with rising malnutrition in children, leaving them at risk of starvation. In some areas, basic food items, particularly milk and vegetables, have increased in price between 20 and 50 per cent.

Sanitary conditions are poor and access to medical care scarce. Health partners warn of risk of diarrhoea, vector-borne diseases, respiratory-tract infections and other communicable diseases rapidly spreading amongst the displaced population. While there has been no reported major COVID-19 outbreak, testing remains extremely limited and congestion and unsanitary conditions are risks for wide-spread transmission. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has been providing core relief items such as blankets, jerry cans and plastic sheets, as well as shelter and cash to thousands of affected families. Distributions will continue in the coming days and weeks, reaching a total of some 70,000 people facing heightened vulnerabilities, including women, female/child headed households, disabled persons, the elderly and ill, and vulnerable members of the hosting community.

UNHCR’s assistance is reaching some of the worst affected regions across Banaadir, South West, Hirshabelle, Jubbaland, Puntland, Galmaduug. The Federal Government of Somalia has also responded to the floods, including in recent weeks setting aside USD 500,000 to address the floods in South West state. Despite these interventions, however, more humanitarian support is needed to address insecurities in food, water and sanitation, emergency shelter and health services.

More people risk being displaced as flooding is likely to continue in certain regions. According to the latest flood advisory report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the Shabelle River’s water levels will continue to rise due to heavy rains.

The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood.

The surging flooding and displacement take place against the backdrop of Somalia’s ongoing fight to curtail the spread of Covid-19, which has a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable, including the displaced. The Government of Somalia, UNHCR and humanitarian partners continue to work in IDP settlements across the country to provide displaced communities and vulnerable hosting communities with medical equipment, protective personal equipment (PPE), hygiene and sanitation support, and cash assistance. UNHCR urges landlords in the country to uphold a moratorium on evictions in these extremely challenging circumstances.

Urgent support is needed from the international community to support the relief efforts. UNHCR has so far received just 33 per cent of the USD154.4 million needed for its humanitarian efforts in Somalia, including for an estimated 2.6 million IDPs and 30,000 refugees and asylum seekers being hosted in the country.

The expansion of the Jakarta MRT line is under way, building on a successful launch last year. But unlike the first phase of development that resulted in a 15.7-kilometer line connecting South and Central Jakarta, phase 2A offers a bigger and more unlikely challenge.

With the next phase of development set to happen entirely underground, PT MRT Jakarta is wary of accidentally excavating historical artifacts and other archeological findings in the digging process, possibly resulting in delays.

The construction of an underground tunnel along the route, believed to be blanketed in historical value, will require special care so as not to cause any delays for the project, said William Sabandar, president director of the city-owned transportation company.

Furthermore, the planned route will run through Kota Tua, formerly an administrative center of the city under Dutch colonial rule, which experts believe may hold numerous historical riches underneath.

“[The next phase] has a different scale because the level of difficulty is [exceptionally high], with issues like land subsidence and soft soil, the environment and cultural heritage,” William said earlier this week.

Archaeologist Chandrian Attahiyat, a member of the Jakarta Cultural Heritage Experts Team (TACB), acknowledged that the second phase of development would be more challenging.

“The MRT phase 2 route presumably contains many artifacts, especially from Monas [ the National Monument] to Kota Tua. Monas alone was situated within the Weltervreden area, which was once the site of the new capital city that was relocated from Kota Tua or Batavia,” he said on Wednesday.

But Indonesia won’t be the first country to deal with such concerns.

The completion of an 8.5-mile undersea rail tunnel, part of the Marmaray intercontinental railway network in Istanbul, Turkey, was originally scheduled for completion in 2009. But the project was delayed for four years due to the discovery of archaeological artifacts from the fourth century Byzantine Era, the New York Times reported.

The development of MRT phase 2A in Jakarta, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is scheduled to be completed by March 2026. It has been delayed three months from the original plan due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The plan spans 5.8 kilometers from Bundaran HI Station in Central Jakarta to the Kota Tua district in West Jakarta. It will consist of seven underground stations: Thamrin, Monas, Harmoni, Sawah Besar and Mangga Besar stations in Central Jakarta, as well as Glodok and Kota stations in West Jakarta.

In an effort to prevent any more delays, the company put together a team of experts, including archaeologists and cultural heritage experts, before construction commenced on July 15.

The firm, in consultation with the team, has since performed an archaeological test pit, a method which aims to identify heritage remains through small-scale excavation.

“[We did this] because we know it usually takes time to gather experts, conduct examinations and make decisions on whether an object is classified as a piece of cultural heritage,” MRT Jakarta construction director Silvia Halim told journalists on Tuesday.

“The team will investigate and conclude the status of the findings – including where to preserve it – within 21 days. With this approach, we can take action without compromising progress in the project,” she said.

The company is examining several fragments of ceramics that its construction workers and the expert team recently found while digging along Jl. MH Thamrin and through a structural brick near Monas, Silvia said.

In the 19th century, a residential area was once situated on the site where Jl. MH Thamrin runs through, right in the vicinity of Sarinah. Meanwhile, before Monas was erected, a number of large buildings, including a police station and church, were situated there.

The discrepancies in land use have contributed to the historical characteristics of remains that may potentially be found in said areas, Chandrian said.

“[Artifacts] in Monas could probably be found in the form of structures. The soil [in Weltervreden] often gets heightened due to floods,” he said.

Heading toward Kota Tua, the archeologist said there might potentially be a discovery of remains of wooden foundations. He said people in the past would have set up wooden foundations first to distribute strength equally for a building’s structure due to the unstable soil on site.

Depending on the significance of the archeological findings, the company may choose to alter its plan for the MRT line.

“If a significant archaeological finding is discovered, [the expert team] will give its recommendations to MRT Jakarta to change their project plan. This could be done by shifting or deepening the track because artifacts are commonly found 10 meters underground,” Chandrian said.

The significance of the discovery will depend on a number of factors, such as its notable relevance to history and the size of the object found, among other things.

The Jakarta Cultural Agency’s protection department head, Novriandi S. Husodo, said the team of experts was likely to suggest thorough documentation – called preservation by record – even if the findings turned out not to be of significant historical value.

More importantly, he said the establishment of an expert team and its corresponding work procedures would prove to be a good example for future large-scale infrastructure projects and provide a “win-win solution”.

“The findings won’t hinder development and the development won’t erase historical information.. Both aspects can work together,” Novriandi said.","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/12/2020_08_12_102192_1597206713._large.jpg,"['keen', 'development', 'mrt', 'monas', 'jakarta', 'trouble', 'experts', 'phase', 'historical', 'expansion', 'dig', 'team', 'tua', 'route', 'kota', 'developer']",

Bhagawati Nepal, deputy mayor of the affected Melamchi municipality, a small town about 50km (30 miles) to the north of Kathmandu, said all the deceased were workers involved in the construction of a community hall.

She said the workers had been asleep when landslides buried their makeshift shelter at approximately 3am (21:15 GMT on Sunday).

“Some of the deceased workers are believed to be seasonal migrants from India. We are trying to verify their identity,” Nepal said. An Indian worker who was rescued from the site has been airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment.

Nepali government official Murari Wasti told Reuters “rescuers dug through the mud and took out all eight bodies”.

Landslides, floods and lightning have killed at least 193 people across Nepal since the beginning of the monsoon in June, according to Janardan Gautam of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). At least 57 people remain missing.

Weeks of rains have damaged roads, bridges and hydropower plants and have affected hundreds of thousands of people in some 50 districts, NDRRMA said.

Flooding in South Asia

Elsewhere in South Asia, the annual rainy season brought more misery with at least 135 people killed in Bangladesh since late June in the longest-running floods there in more than two decades, while floods have killed nearly 120 people and displaced millions in the Indian states of Assam and Bihar.

The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has also been hit, with four soldiers killed there last month while rescuing villagers trapped in floods, officials said.

The conditions have complicated the poor region’s efforts to fight the novel coronavirus, especially in densely populated Bangladesh, which has reported a total of 240,746 infections and 3,154 deaths.

More than 1 million people are marooned in Bangladesh, and thousands of hectares of land have been submerged, forcing more than 60,000 into crowed shelters, said Enamur Rahman, junior minister of the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry.

“This is really challenging,” he said, while adding that efforts were being made to maintain social distancing.

The runoff from heavy rain across Indian mountains had pushed levels of many of Bangladesh’s rivers into the danger zone, said Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer at the Bangladesh Water Development Board, contributing to the worst flooding since 1998.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1f95cdc0c05747fd9632146e9f3f4f12_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['killed', 'landslides', 'ndrrma', 'nepal', 'indian', 'bury', 'capital', 'near', 'nepals', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'thousands', 'workers', 'construction']",

Korea Warns of More Floods - VOA Asia",https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/hit-historic-monsoon-n-korea-warns-more-floods,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - North Korea continues to see historic levels of rainfall, further threatening an economy already battered by a coronavirus-related lockdown.

Torrential rains have flooded hundreds of North Korean homes and wiped out vast swaths of rice fields in the country’s agricultural heartland, according to state media, intensifying worries about a poor harvest and food supply shortage.

The Korean Peninsula has seen a much longer than usual monsoon seasons this year. The rains are expected to continue for much of the week.

South Korea has seen 49 consecutive days of rain -- the longest streak on record. The downpours have caused landslides and floods in the South that have killed at least 42 people.

In the North, the extent of the damage is not precisely known. State media said Friday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a flood-hit village in North Hwanghae province, where 600 hectares of rice fields and more than 900 homes were inundated or destroyed.

Hwanghae is the North’s most important rice-producing province. North Korean officials appearing on state TV have warned that rivers in both Hwanghae and the nearby province of Gangwon could overflow, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.

The rains are already more intense than in 2007, when North Korea saw some of its worst floods, according to a briefing by South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean relations.

A part of a park near the Han River are flooded due to heavy rain in Seoul, South Korea, Aug. 9, 2020. The safety ministry said the Seoul area and the southern region are expected to receive more heavy rain on Sunday.

“Their agricultural system is fragile, but they have had floods many times before,” says Peter Ward, a specialist in North Korea’s economy and PhD candidate at the University of Vienna. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it had a significant impact on the harvest.”

North Korea is particularly vulnerable to flooding. It lacks adequate infrastructure and suffers from widespread deforestation, which resulted in part from people cutting down trees for fuel or firewood or to clear land for farming.

The floods come as North Korea steps up its anti-coronavirus efforts. Last month, North Korea locked down the southwestern city of Kaesong, after warning that a defector from the South may have brought the virus across the border.

North Korea has reported no confirmed coronavirus cases, even as it carries out strict measures to keep the disease from spreading.

North Korea’s Red Cross has mobilized 43,000 volunteers who “have been working alongside health teams and authorities to prevent Covid-19 as well as helping communities to be prepared to evacuate and reduce disaster risks in their areas, including protecting homes from flooding and landslides,” according to a statement from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

“DPRK Red Cross volunteers are providing relief, including tarpaulins, kitchen sets, quilts, hygiene kits and water containers to support 2,800 of the most at risk families in North Hwanghae and (Gangwon) provinces, as well as Kaesong City, also while keeping people safe and preventing COVID-19,” the statement added.

North Korea formally closed its borders due to coronavirus concerns in late January, shortly after the outbreak was first reported in neighboring China. The lockdown has resulted in plummeting economic activity with China, North Korea’s biggest trading partner. That has put even more strain on an economy already held back by international sanctions.

In a statement last week, research firm Fitch Solutions said it expected North Korea’s economy to contract by at least 8.5% in 2020, “not only due to a suspected domestic outbreak, but also due to the negative impact the disease will have on the external sector.”

North Korea's secretive government does not consistently release its own economic data. Instead, outside organizations try to estimate North Korea’s economic figures, in part based on numbers from South Korea’s central bank or Chinese customs data.","Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/ap-images/2020/08/9da04b1264f2651c2dbc15ecec578085.jpg,"['according', 'north', 'hit', 'korea', 'n', 'warns', 'koreas', 'monsoon', 'economy', 'floods', 'statement', 'korean', 'historic', 'red', 'south']",

SEOUL: Dozens of cows were stranded on rooftops by floods in South Korea, leaving rescue crews facing a problem the size of several bovines. The cattle floated upwards as floodwaters mounted at the weekend in Gurye, a farming town in the country’s south, and scrambled to safety on the roofs of several houses and other buildings. When the deluge receded, the animals found themselves stranded high and somewhat damp, and on the horns of a dilemma with no way to get down.



Pictures showed as many as nine of them standing on one battered rooftop, looking mildly nonplussed. “The cows were swimming as the water level surged and made their way up onto the roof and stayed there even after the floodwaters subsided,” one resident told television channel JTBC. Rescuers brought in a crane and lowered the cattle one by one from the rooftops, hoisting them onto a sling.



But while the cows eventually did come home, many were showing symptoms of pneumonia, according to a veterinarian volunteering with the relief efforts.

Relief materials are adequate, according to the district administration authorities, and yet the fresh disaster is overwhelming them as well as the poor waterlogged families of the districts

Although the flood situation has improved in the Brahmaputra basin, the districts adjacent to the capital have seen another spell of flash floods that has left thousands of people marooned since Wednesday night.

Relief materials are adequate, according to the district administration authorities, and yet the fresh disaster is overwhelming them as well as the poor waterlogged families of the districts.

In Munshiganj, another spell of erosion by the Padma started in the Lohajang Shimulia Ferry Ghat area on Wednesday night, causing the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation Shimulia Ferry Ghat-4 to go under water.

Shafayet , a manager at Shimulia Ghat BIWTC, said that the erosion began at about 11:00pm and in the meantime, the ferry ghat along with the express road and a few roads along the ferry ghat went under water.

Meanwhile, the BWDB authorities have predicted a second spell of floods that might strike the district again next week, taking a destructive turn. The water levels of the Padma and Dhaleshwari have risen above the danger mark while in the other rivers the water level is fluctuating.

At Maowa point, the Padma river is swelling 6.52 cm above the danger mark and Dhaleshwari is flowing 5.20cm above the danger mark, said Rakibul Islam, associate engineer of BWDB.

“About 2,00,000 people in 319 villages are still marooned and even if the flood situation improves, erosion will devastate the district anyway,” said the officer.

In Tangail, although the overall flood situation has improved, five major rivers crossing the district are still flowing above the danger mark, leaving 94,00,000 people in 11 upazilas. waterlogged.

The water levels of the Dhaleshwari, Jamuna and Jhinai Bangshai rivers have declined, but the people are still suffering due to the damaged infrastructure of the area, confirmed Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of BWDB.

In Noakhali, a sudden high tide that entered the area through damaged embankments has left at least 10,000 people waterlogged in 15 villages.

About 40 tonnes of relief have been distributed to the villagers, said UNO Rezaul Karim.

In Gopalganj, at least 3,000 people in 30 villages and 500 infrastructure have been marooned as a second spell of floods has struck the district, confirmed BWDB Executive Engineer Bishwajit Baidya.

In Bhola, high tides since Wednesday night have left 20,000 people of Sadar, Tajmuddin, Char Fashion and Monpura waterlogged.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lifted a three week lockdown in the city of Kaesong and nearby areas, after a man who defected to the South returned to the border town last month showing coronavirus symptoms, state media said on Friday.

Kim made the decision at a politburo meeting convened to discuss the government's efforts to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, as well as the response to heavy rain and flooding, state news agency KCNA reported.

North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but Kim said last month that the virus ""could be said to have entered"" the country and imposed the lockdown after the man was reported to have symptoms. Later test results on the man were ""inconclusive"", according to the World Health Organization.

Coronavirus prevention measures had stabilized the risk in the area, Kim said in a statement carried by KCNA.

While easing the lockdown within the country, Kim said that border controls should remain tight and ordered communities not to accept any external assistance related to the floods caused by weeks of heavy rain.

""The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,"" Kim said in a statement carried out by the KCNA.

The monsoon season caused extensive damage in several provinces, with farmlands inundated with floodwaters, around 16,680 houses and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded, and many roads, bridges and railroads damaged, KCNA reported.","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/06/25/2020_06_25_98669_1593056408._large.jpg,"['case', 'border', 'virus', 'korea', 'n', 'coronavirus', 'town', 'lifts', 'lockdown', 'kim', 'symptoms', 'covid19', 'world', 'man', 'statement', 'state', 'suspected', 'inconclusive']",

One person was still missing and dozens of others were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and cars.

Greece's meteorological service said parts of Evia saw rainfall that reached 300 millimeters (11.8 inches), some 80% of the annual rainfall for the area, which is only about 375 millimeters (14.8 inches), usually with negligible rain during the summer.

The 8-month-old baby was found dead in a house in the village of Politika on Sunday, a fire service spokesman said. The baby's parents were unharmed.

Hours earlier, a man and woman, both in their 80s, were found unconscious by firefighters in two houses in the same village, the spokesman said. They were confirmed as dead at the hospital.

Deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias had earlier said five people had died and two were missing.

Later, one of the missing, an elderly woman, was found floating at sea off the coast, sitting on top of a bureau. She had climbed on it just as the floodwaters burst into her house.

Firefighters later came upon the bodies of a 38-year-old woman and her 42-year-old husband outside their home in the inland village of Amfithea.

Two other people who died, a 74-year-old man and a 73-year-old woman, were from the village of Bourtsi, the agency reported.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis voiced his ""profound pain for the loss of lives"" and said he would visit Evia, Greece's second-largest island after Crete, on Monday.

A river burst through its banks and flooded part of Politika, forcing many residents to climb to the rooftops of their homes. Another river in the village of Bourtzi also burst its banks. Authorities estimated that 3,000 residences had been partially or totally damaged by floodwaters and police said many local roads are impassable.

Heavy rain started falling at about midnight Saturday and firefighters responded to over 50 fires caused by lightning. By late afternoon Sunday, 97 people had been safely evacuated from their homes and cars, 30 of them by helicopter, and over 600 homes had been drained of floodwaters, the fire service said.

Firefighters said they came upon hundreds of dead sparrows after trees were hit by lightning.

""We are experiencing a nightmare, we are using every possible means"" to combat the floods, said Ana Fanis Spanos, a lawmaker from the central Greece region.

""Last year we had fires, this year it's floods,"" one resident of the village of Psachna told ERT television.

Flooded homes are a frequent occurrence in Greece due to a lack of adequate controls over construction and planning.

In November 2017, floods killed 24 people in Mandra, a village in an industrial region 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) west of Athens.

The town of Bout, situated in the southeastern Blue Nile province, was severely hit by heavy rains and floods over the past week. The town of about 100,000 residents saw at least 1,200 houses destroyed, according to statistics provided by the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS). The collapse displaced thousands and left many without access to clean water.

No government in Sudan's history has been able to solve the humanitarian disasters brought on by annual flooding in June and July, which inevitably leads to chronic destruction and loss of life.

More than 120 houses in the nearby town of Wad Abuk were also destroyed. Until now, the field teams are working to help people in Bout and Wad Abuk.

According to SRCS, there were at least four deaths, 75 houses were completely destroyed and 280 houses were partially destroyed in the Abu-Hamad locality in northern Sudan.

The East Nile area, a sub-city within Khartoum, also continues to experience mass flooding. At this time, no cars or people can pass through the area and the only way to save lives is through the use of local boats.

Rescued residents are sleeping beside the highway in tents provided by the civil defense, the Sudanese Red Crescent and a few nongovernmental organizations.

The crisis has been compounded by a lack of city planning from Khartoum's municipal leadership.

Every year in Sudan, heavy rains lead to massive flooding throughout the country including Khartoum, the capital. Citizens suffer as floodwaters destroy property and take lives. Recovery efforts strain Sudan's limited financial and human resources.

Residents are often left on their own to cope and recover:

‘Call to mobilize’

Nafeer, a youth-led initiative, responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis caused by heavy rains and flash floods that struck Sudan. The term nafeer is a Sudanese social tradition that comes from an Arabic word meaning “a call to mobilize” to help people in crises.

On August 2, the group announced a call to all volunteers to a meeting on August 4, to discuss a crisis plan. The governor of Khartoum joined the meeting to support them with government resources.

Abdallah Hamdok, Sudan's prime minister, wrote a thread on Twitter detailing all the ways in which the government is prepared to address the rainy season crisis, highlighting that this rainfall has been the heaviest in 30 years:

He goes on to say in his Twitter thread:

Tweet 2: The meeting decided to provide urgent shelter needs for those affected by the rains of the previous days. We also decided to allocate all machines that have been restored through the empowerment removal committee to work in the treatment of the effects of the rainy season. Tweet 3: We have issued a directive to all states to form committees to deal with rainy season emergencies headed by the governor, provided that the National Council of Civil Defense continues to coordinate centrally and establish a media platform to own information and publish weather forecasts and actions taken by the council. Tweet 4: We also mandated the Ministry of Labor and Social Development to address international agencies and international organizations to coordinate the response to the rainy season emergency, and we also decided to direct the Ministry of Health to prepare for the epidemics accompanying the rainy season and launch an early cholera vaccination campaign to avoid any possible epidemic outbreaks. Tweet 5: Rain forecasts indicate that we will face an unprecedented rainy season during the past 30 years, and there are emergency measures in place to avoid the effects of long-term treatments to fix urban planning problems and ensure the safety of citizens and their property. Tweet 6: I introduce my great thanks and pride for the active role that popular organizations, resistance committees and civil society activities initiated, to move quickly to ward off the effects of the fall as a role that evokes the authentic Sudanese values of social solidarity and the activation of the values of collective action in the journey of building and reconstruction. Tweet 7: We will go hand-in-hand to harness all the capabilities and efforts to take advantage of the bounties of the rainy season and avoid its negative effects on citizens in all parts of the country. May God save Sudan and the people of Sudan.

More than 150,000 flood victims have become homeless since late June, including 23,000 in the past week, according to officials. Weather forecasters warn the worst is not over. They predict the heavy rains and extreme flooding will continue for some time in certain regions and exacerbate the living conditions of the hundreds of thousands of displaced.

U.N. refugee agency spokesman Charlie Yaxley reports many of the newly displaced are living in overcrowded, makeshift shelters with little protection from the harsh weather. He says families are exposed to increased risk of crimes such as robbery and rape.

""Food is in short supply and many are going hungry with rising malnutrition in children, leaving them at risk of starvation,"" he said. ""Sanitary conditions are poor and access to medical care is scarce and health partners warn of a risk of diarrhea, vector-borne diseases, respiratory-tract infections and other communicable diseases rapidly spreading amongst the displaced population.""

Yaxley says there has been no reported major coronavirus outbreak, but he tells VOA the outlook is not good. He says people have little access to clean water, the cramped quarters prevent social distancing, and very little sanitation infrastructure is in place.

""So conditions are ripe for transmission of viruses, including COVID-19, and it is exacerbated even further because in some areas, we are not able to access some of the affected communities. And some areas, particularly in the southern part, are controlled by armed groups and militias.""

COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Yaxley says the UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies are not able to reach those areas and deliver assistance. He says the many people living there are largely left to fend for themselves.

Yaxley says aid agencies are doing their best to deliver medical and personal protective equipment, as well as make people aware of the hygiene measures needed to mitigate COVID-19 and other diseases.

The UNHCR is urgently appealing to the international community to support its relief efforts. The agency has appealed for $154 million to provide for the needs of an estimated 2.6 million internally displaced people and 30,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. The agency says it has received 33 percent of what it needs to carry out its life-saving mission.

Heavy Rains in Kerala and Karnataka Destroys Crop

The lives in several districts of Kerela and Karnataka came to a standstill as rivers breached the banks. The heavy rains caused severe waterlogging in Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Kottayam districts. Also, areas of west Kochi submerged due to continuous rainfall. Besides, the floods damaged several parts of the Thiruvananthapuram district.

On the other hand, with 55.06 mm rainfall on 28th July, Nagapattinam farmers bought 45,512 hectares under paddy cultivation. The timely release of water from the Mettur Dam in the Cauvery River allowed them to surpass the target of 41,000 hectares. However, officials have advised farmers to insure their crops amid the concerns over heavy rainfall. Similarly, heavy rains in northern districts of Karnataka caused havoc in villages and cities.

Fatehabad’s Tohana and Ratia areas of Haryana have witnessed the damage of crops due to heavy rainfall. Several regions of Bhiwani, Jind, and Charkhi Dadri districts have been inundated. However, cotton crop in 6000 acres in Hissar has been the worst affected. Irrigation officials and farmers are working around the clock to drain the water from the fields. Similarly, a cloudburst and heavy rainfall in the Kansari village of Kedarnath valley in Uttarakhand caused damage to crops.

In a statement citing figures from North Korean officials, the IFRC said the floods have also caused widespread crop damage, intensifying economic concerns in a country that already suffers chronic food shortages.

The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Friday that nearly 40,000 hectares of crops have been damaged and 17,000 houses destroyed or inundated.

“Lots of roads, bridges and railway sections (were) broken, a dam of a power station gave way and there was other severe damage in various sectors of the national economy,” the KCNA report said.

The Korean peninsula has seen a much longer than usual monsoon season. Parts of South Korea recently saw 49 consecutive days of rain, causing floods and landslides that killed dozens of people.

North Korea is particularly vulnerable to flooding. It lacks adequate infrastructure and suffers from widespread deforestation, which resulted in part from people cutting down trees for fuel or firewood or to clear land for farming.

The floods come as North Korea tries to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Last month, North Korea locked down an area around the southwestern city of Kaesong after warning that a defector from South Korea might have brought the virus across the border.

On Friday, KCNA reported that the Kaesong lockdown was lifted “based on the scientific verification and guarantee by a professional anti-epidemic organization.”

North Korea has reported no confirmed coronavirus cases, even as it carries out strict measures to keep the disease from spreading.

At a politburo meeting Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un indicated his country would not accept international aid for flood damage, due to coronavirus concerns.

“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” Kim was quoted as saying.

According to the IFRC, North Korea’s Red Cross is providing relief to support 2,800 families, including family tents for people most at risk, tarpaulins, shelter tool kits, kitchen sets and quilts to help people with their urgent needs.

“DPRK Red Cross volunteers are also providing hygiene kits, water containers and water purification tablets, all while engaging in COVID-19 prevention activities,” the IFRC said.

South Korea has also offered help, partly in the hopes that such humanitarian assistance would help lead to renewed diplomatic engagement with North Korea. But Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said that now appears unlikely.

“Kim Jong Un’s public rejection of international aid for flood recovery, and his lifting a COVID-19 quarantine on the border city of Kaesong, are negative indicators for inter-Korean cooperation,” Easley said.

North Korea walked away from nuclear talks with the United States late last year. It has also ended almost every form of engagement with South Korea.

Despite its claim of being coronavirus-free, experts say the disease has likely reached North Korea’s borders. A major outbreak could be disastrous, since many areas of North Korea are impoverished and the country lacks adequate medical supplies and facilities.

North Korea formally closed its borders due to coronavirus concerns in late January, shortly after the outbreak was first reported in neighboring China. The lockdown has resulted in plummeting economic activity with China, North Korea’s biggest trading partner. That has put even more strain on an economy already held back by international sanctions.","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/ap-images/2020/08/f56e6ad0a1eeb34a982861da9e539d0a.jpg,"['red', 'north', 'korea', 'coronavirus', '22', 'reported', 'floods', 'missing', 'international', 'korean', 'damage', 'dead', 'south']",

With scant supplies and underpaid staff, one of India's poorest states is scrambling to prevent a ""blast"" in coronavirus cases that medics say could cripple its precarious health system.

The pandemic has already overwhelmed the medical network in the eastern state of Bihar, which has recorded more than 62,000 infections and nearly 350 deaths.

But locals fear the worst is yet to come.

Fuelling their anxiety - a slew of media reports and images of people struggling to access healthcare, including coronavirus patients languishing on oxygen support in hospital corridors.

The list of patient complaints - worse outside the capital city of Patna - is long: too few beds, faulty oxygen cylinders, no doctors, zero tests and a dearth of effective medicine.

When village pharmacist Om Prakash Gupta became breathless last week, he waded through swirling flood waters to reach a local, district hospital only to wait hours for a coronavirus test - and a whole day for oxygen support.

The 42-year-old tested positive, and got a bed after his family faced initial apathy from hospital staff, threats from doctors and rejection from politicians.

""We got frightened and ... our family members started crying out of helplessness. [Then] hospital authorities called us and - admitted him,"" his brother-in-law Manoj Kumar said by phone from his village in Madhubani town.

But it was too late.

""We were told that he was severely breathless overnight and other patients tried to call the doctor for him but nobody came. Finally he fell from his bed and died due to a lack of oxygen,"" Kumar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Health experts say the death toll is set to rise, especially as annual floods complicate efforts to enforce social distancing and strain resources.

""The floods have decreased mobility. People can't leave ... testing teams are also unable to reach these areas,"" said S.R. Jha, a doctor in impoverished Araria district.

""The cases will spike a lot more. There will be a kind of blast.""

Neither the state's health secretary and health minister nor the federal health ministry responded to repeated phone calls, text messages and emails over a week seeking their comment.

'Missed the boat'

India's coronavirus outbreak is the third worst in the world behind the United States and Brazil, with more than 1.9 million confirmed cases and about 40,700 deaths, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University.

The virus travelled from crowded cities to rural hinterland as millions of workers returned home under a strict lockdown, with Bihar receiving one of the largest migrant influxes.

Bihar lacks good hospitals, with facilities outside Patna woefully short on resources, doctors and medical experts say.

In Darbhanga district - which bore the brunt of floods - a coronavirus patient even staged a protest inside a local hospital, claiming medical negligence.

""No doctor has come to see me for 10 days. The situation is so bad the oxygen cylinder that they gave me ran out of gas ... I asked them for a replacement, but there's no response,"" Shailendra Sinha told local media.

Medical observers say the government failed to prepare.

Sunil Kumar, Bihar secretary of the Indian Medical Association that represents 325,000 doctors, said more than 40% of state healthcare posts were vacant. This, he said, despite doctors' requests to the government to fill the openings.

""The government missed the boat on preparation and planning and now you can see the fallout,"" said Kumar.

Officials had no response after a week of requests for comment. Yet Kumar said medics' pay was pitiful and that staff lacked basic kit such as protective suits, masks and gloves.

""How can you expect medical staff to work for 8,000 or 10,000 rupees ($133) in COVID-19 wards in such conditions – only to risk their lives?,"" he said.

The state government says it will give health workers an ""encouragement incentive"" worth a month's salary.

'Rely on god'

Home to 120 million people, Bihar is testing about 38,000 samples a day - compared to some 100,000 in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.

Kumar said the virus was spreading undetected, with few people wearing masks or keeping a safe distance, despite a lockdown until Aug 16.

State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says the virus is ""definitely a threat to Bihar"" given it has the top population density in the country - three times the national average.

Bihar's principal health secretary, Pratyaya Amrit was not available for comment, but has told local media that his top priority was to ramp up testing to 50,000 a day.

He has vowed to make changes, including increasing the number of beds with oxygen support, ambulance services, round-the-clock availability of doctors and nurses and filling vacancies by appointing 1,000 specialist doctors.

Dr. Shakeel, who goes by one name and heads the People's Health Movement in Bihar, a network of medical and civil society organizations, said private hospitals were out of reach for most people since they could charge up to 15,000 rupees a day - in a state where the daily per capita income is $1.50.

Instead, ordinary people would have to make do with local ""hospitals that are dirty, where beds are very few and any treatment for (the) coronavirus is not even available,"" said Jha, the doctor from Araria.

49,49,FF-2020-000179-IDN,When floods hit the road: Resilience to flood-related traffic disruption in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/32/eaba2423,"Abstract As sea level rises, urban traffic networks in low-lying coastal areas face increasing risks of flood disruptions. Closure of flooded roads causes employee absences and delays, creating cascading impacts to communities. We integrate a traffic model with flood maps that represent potential combinations of storm surges, tides, seasonal cycles, interannual anomalies driven by large-scale climate variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and sea level rise. When identifying inundated roads, we propose corrections for potential biases arising from model integration. Our results for the San Francisco Bay Area show that employee absences are limited to the homes and workplaces within the areas of inundation, while delays propagate far inland. Communities with limited availability of alternate roads experience long delays irrespective of their proximity to the areas of inundation. We show that metric reach, a measure of road network density, is a better proxy for delays than flood exposure.

INTRODUCTION Global climate change is increasing the likelihood of extreme events (1) such as flooding, particularly in low-lying coastal areas (2). Rapid urbanization is further increasing flood risk, given the growing concentration of people and assets in cities and the clustering of cities along coastlines (3). Presently, about 50% of the world’s population lives in cities, and the percentage is projected to rise to 68% by mid-century (4). This unprecedented urbanization is accompanied by rapid increases in the complexity and interconnectedness of physical human systems. Disruption of the highly interdependent socioeconomic networks through flooding and other hazards severely affects urban life, potentially leading to lasting displacement and business interruption (5). The indirect impacts associated with these disruptions could outweigh the direct impacts of flooding, which are defined as the physical damage to buildings and infrastructure. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has emphasized the growing importance of indirect impacts but has also highlighted the challenges of quantifying indirect impacts (5). Challenges include the multitude of potential indirect impacts spanning the social, environmental, and economic spheres; the dependence on the cultural context; and the uncertainty surrounding the behavioral responses of individuals and communities. There also remains an open question of whether indirect impacts are governed primarily by the exposure to a climatic hazard or by the characteristics of the system experiencing disruption. These challenges raise questions about whether there are common themes to indirect climatic impacts that extend beyond the context of a specific hazard or location. In this study, we move beyond a qualitative characterization of indirect impacts: We quantify the far-reaching traffic disruptions associated with coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area over the next two decades, 2020–2040. For the purposes of this study, coastal flooding events are defined as extreme water levels resulting from various potential combinations of storm surges, tides, seasonal cycles, interannual anomalies driven by large-scale climate variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and sea level rise. We do not consider fluvial or pluvial flooding in our analysis but plan to integrate these processes in future work. To represent coastal flooding, we use 1-m resolution flood maps from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission’s Adapting to Rising Tides (ART) program (6). The San Francisco Bay Area, similar to many other coastal regions, has dense urban development concentrated along its coastline. Thus, the region provides a valuable example for studying the indirect impacts of sea level rise and intensifying coastal floods on urban systems. This study is the result of a year-long service-learning course aimed at identifying actionable insights that advance the region’s climate adaptation and planning efforts. We choose the traffic system as a starting point for understanding indirect impacts of climatic hazards since traffic systems connect the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of urban life. As in the San Francisco Bay Area, many urban traffic networks are already heavily congested. With a rising sea level, even relatively minor instances of coastal flooding could inundate major roads and lead to far-reaching, cascading consequences. Traffic is highly nonlinear even under normal conditions, with congestion propagating rapidly from traffic bottlenecks to adjacent areas (7). However, not all traffic systems are equally prone to external disruptions, from flooding or otherwise (8, 9). The varying responses of different traffic systems to disruptions has led to the concept of traffic resilience, which is defined as the ability of the traffic system to either withstand or recover from unexpected changes in traffic flows or road conditions (8). In this study, we define traffic resilience more specifically as the ability of the traffic system to mitigate travel time delays resulting from road closures. Recent studies on traffic resilience explore the role played by the structural and topological characteristics of the road network in reducing travel time delays (9, 10). They suggest a variety of network flow–based metrics (11, 12) and graph theoretic metrics (13, 14) to estimate traffic resilience, but there is no consensus on a single metric (15). While the characteristics of the road network are important, they alone do not dictate traffic resilience. Exposure to climatic hazards (16) and regional commute patterns (17) are important as well. To identify the interplay of factors that govern traffic resilience to coastal flooding, we simulate morning traffic flows in the San Francisco Bay Area under a range of water levels represented by the ART flood maps. We infer the origins and destinations of morning commutes from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) dataset, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau (18), assuming that present-day commute patterns remain approximately indicative of commutes in the near future, defined as 2020–2040. Integrating a traffic model with flood maps, while not without its challenges (13, 19), enables us to quantify how flood exposure, regional commute patterns, and characteristics of the road network affect traffic resilience.

METHODS We integrate a fixed-demand incremental traffic assignment model with the ART flood maps to simulate regional traffic patterns in the San Francisco Bay Area in the presence of coastal flooding. The incremental traffic assignment model represents commuters as agents whose goal is to minimize their origin-destination travel time (20, 21). Individual commuters are partitioned uniformly and proportionally into four sequential batches of sizes 40, 30, 20, and 10%, and commuters within each successive batch are assigned incrementally to their shortest-time origin-destination routes (20). This incremental approach incorporates the effects of the route choices of earlier commuters on the route choices of later commuters within a given time period (20, 21). The collective route choice of commuters creates congestion and leads to increases in travel time on road segments, which are modeled with the widely used Bureau of Public Roads function (20). The traffic assignment model requires two inputs: a road network model, and origin-destination commuter data. For the San Francisco Bay Area (Fig. 1A), we use the regional road network model developed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) (22) as the first input. The MTC road network, shown in Fig. 1B, is the basis of traffic simulations for regional planning in the San Francisco Bay Area (23). The MTC road network is a simplified version of the true road network. While it contains all the primary and secondary roads, it aggregates tertiary and local roads into simplified road segment representations to make traffic simulations computationally tractable. The MTC road network does not represent toll stations, carpool or express lanes, or traffic signals. Fig. 1 The San Francisco Bay Area study site. (A) The nine counties of the San Francisco Bay Area. The cities of Santa Rosa, Napa, San Francisco (labeled SF), Oakland, and San Jose are shown for reference.

(D) The flood map for the 36-inch water level overlying the road network. In both (C) and (D), the areas of inundation are shown in blue, while the roads closed because of flooding are shown in red. The LODES dataset (18) provides the second input to the traffic assignment model. It is an annually updated synthetic dataset that relies on census data, American Community Survey data, and data collected by state governments. The LODES dataset provides the number of employees who reside in a given census block and work in a given census block. We assume that the dataset represents pairs of origins and destinations for weekday morning commutes. We also assume that the present-day travel patterns described in the dataset resemble the travel patterns throughout the 2020–2040 time period. The LODES dataset does not present commute data by mode or time of commute. To match the scope of our study, we process the dataset using estimates from the American Community Survey (24) for the number of morning peak-hour commuters by cars and carpools for each origin-destination pair. The use of the LODES dataset limits the spatial resolution of our model to the scale of census blocks that range from 100 m to 10 km in length (25). Most traffic analyses, on the other hand, are conducted on traffic analysis zones that range from 1 to 50 km in length (19, 23). The smaller sizes of census blocks provide higher spatial resolution than the traffic analysis zones. We assume that any errors in the model at scales smaller than census block lengths, such as the errors resulting from local road aggregation within the simplified road network, are negligible at the spatial scale of census blocks. To identify inundated roads, we overlay the MTC road network with the ART flood maps (6), as shown in Fig. 1 (C and D). The ART flood maps are 1-m resolution maps that represent water levels resulting from potential combinations of storm surges, tides, seasonal cycles, interannual anomalies driven by large-scale climate variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and sea level rise. The flood maps are designed with a “one map, many futures” approach, where the water level in each map represents multiple underlying sea level rise scenarios combined with extreme water level events. For example, the 36-inch water level represents both a 50-year extreme water level event at the present-day sea level and an approximately 20-year extreme water level event with 6 inches of sea level rise (6). By considering water levels rather than specific scenarios of flood intensities and sea level rise, the one map, many futures approach allows us to study a wide range of plausible coastal flooding events despite the uncertainty in projections of near-future sea level rise. We consider four water levels in our analysis: the baseline “no flood,” which represents no flooding at present-day sea level, and the 12-, 24-, and 36-inch water levels. Our choice of water levels is limited to coastal flood events with return periods of up to 50 years and sea level rise of up to 6 inches (see table S1 for more details), which are plausible ranges for the region for the 2020–2040 period (6, 26, 27). We do not consider water levels above 36 inches since the potential commutes under extreme water levels may not represent home-to-workplace commutes as assumed in the model. For example, a substantial number of commuters may change their objectives from work commute to evacuation for sufficiently extreme water levels. The ART flood maps do not consider the presence of buildings, underground spaces, or storm drainage systems and do not include fluvial or pluvial flooding. Additional details about the ART flood mapping methodology are provided in the Supplementary Materials. We assume that road segments are closed to traffic flow if they exceed a certain threshold of inundation depth. The National Weather Service highlights 6 inches of inundation as posing a threat to individuals and 12 inches as sufficient to sweep most cars off the road (28). The decisions for road closures are made by local and regional authorities on the basis of local road conditions, creating a wide range of potential thresholds for road closures. However, our sensitivity tests over the range 1 to 12 inches for the road closure threshold show no noticeable change in our model results for the San Francisco Bay Area (fig. S1). For the purposes of this study, we choose the road closure threshold to be 3 inches. For road segments with less than 3 inches of flooding, the model increases the travel time on those segments according to an empirical relationship between inundation depth and maximum safe driving speed (29). The model then assigns commuters to routes on the altered road network. As a result of road closures, certain home-workplace pairs may not have viable routes. If either the home or the workplace of the commuter is flooded, then the commute is not possible. Even if neither the home nor the workplace is flooded, strategic roads between the home and the workplace may have been closed, making the commute impossible. In the event that there is no accessible home-to-workplace route for a given commuter, that particular commute is classified as impassable. We assume that a commuter with an impassable commute stays at home and is not assigned to any route, leading to employee absences. Correcting model biases when identifying inundated roads Traffic models simplify road networks (23) in ways that introduce potential biases when estimating flood impacts. In Fig. 2, we summarize the impact of three biases, labeled as “geometry,” “elevation,” and “creeks,” on flood-related traffic disruption. The combination of the corrections for geometry, elevation, and creeks reduces travel times by 20 to 30% over the no-correction “naive” approach for all commuters for the 36-inch water level, as seen in Fig. 2D. The percentage of impassable commutes is similarly reduced from 16 to 5%. Fig. 2 The effects of model corrections on estimations of regional travel time delays. Model corrections were introduced during dataset integration to reduce biases in the process of identifying inundated roads. (A) Geometry correction, which represents the correction of the location and curvature of the primary and secondary roads. (A) shows a portion of U.S. 101 curving around the flooded region, in yellow, and the original, simplified straight-line road geometry intersecting the flood map, in red. (B) Elevation correction, which represents the incorporation of the primary and secondary road elevations above the ground. (B) shows the Carquinez Bridge elevated above the inundated region for the 36-inch water level. (C) Creek correction. A road segment is considered flooded if more than 17% of its length is flooded. (C) shows how the creek correction applies to the case of incorrect flooding for the U.S. 101 as it crosses the San Rafael Creek. (D) Cumulative distribution of travel time for commuters across the San Francisco Bay Area for the 36-inch water level computed with the various corrections. The naive approach, shown with a dotted line for easier distinction, represents overlaying the flood map on the road network with no corrections. The data inside the parentheses in the legend indicate the percentage of impassable commutes for a given water level. The first bias arises from the representation of road segments as straight edges (23), which may incorrectly intersect the areas of inundation (Fig. 2A). To correct for this bias, we align the primary and secondary roads in the MTC road network with those of the true road network, where the latter network is obtained from a federal roadway dataset (25). Tertiary and local roads are not realigned in the same way since most of these road segments within the MTC road network are simplified and aggregated versions of the true roads. The lack of elevation data in road networks introduces a second bias arising from the incorrect flooding of bridges and overpasses. We compute the above-ground elevation for primary and secondary roads using a Caltrans Global Positioning System–based elevation dataset (30) and a topography dataset (31) and reassess the inundation of these road segments. The elevation correction notably reduces projected travel time delays, as seen in Fig. 2D. The incorrect flooding of road segments crossing over small creeks leads to a third bias. The topography of creek-road intersections is often simplified in the digital elevation models of flood maps to allow for continuity in the flood mapping upstream of the intersections (6). Since creeks are substantially narrower than road segments, we correct for this bias by assuming that road segments are inundated only if the fraction of the segment length covered by water exceeds a certain threshold, which we call the water-cover threshold. We derive the threshold value as 17% by identifying anomalous peaks in the distribution over all road segments of the fraction of segment length covered by water (fig. S2).

RESULTS Impassable or delayed commutes? Two types of flood-related disruption Our model highlights two ways in which flooding can disrupt traffic flow. The closure of inundated roads makes certain routes impassable. We assume that commuters with impassable commutes stay home and are thus absent from their workplace. Road closures also force some commuters onto alternate roads, thus aggravating congestion on those roads and creating travel time delays. In the interest of simplicity, we assume that commuters with passable commutes continue toward their destination regardless of how long they are delayed. We summarize how commuters throughout the San Francisco Bay Area experience flood-related traffic disruptions for the different water levels in Fig. 3. We consider a travel time delay of more than 30 min a substantial delay because 30 min is the average travel time for the San Francisco Bay Area in our model when there is no flood. As seen in Fig. 3A, the percentage of total commuters delayed by more than 30 min is much larger than the percentage of total commuters having an impassable commute for all water levels. Our model thus projects that travel time delays affect a substantially larger number of commuters than impassibility. Fig. 3 Impassable commutes and travel time delays for all commuters. (A) Bar plot of the percentages of commuters experiencing impassable commutes and travel time delays exceeding 30 min for every water level. (B) The cumulative percentage of all commuters and their projected travel times for every water level. The magnitude of travel time delays also increases with water level, as seen in Fig. 3B, which shows the cumulative percentage of commuters by projected travel time. For example, while travel times are almost identical for the 12- and 24-inch water levels, there is a sharp increase in travel times for the 36-inch water level. These travel time delays are not equally distributed. Commuters with short commutes of 15 min or less experience negligible delays (Fig. 3B). In contrast, commuters who live far from their workplaces may be delayed substantially during coastal flood events. Delays are experienced broadly over the entire region but with varying spatial extents. In Fig. 4, we show the percentage of commuters delayed over 30 min for the 12-inch water level (Fig. 4, A and C) and the 36-inch water level (Fig. 4, B and D). The top two panels (Fig. 4, A and B) aggregate the delayed commuters by their home census tracts, while the bottom two panels (Fig. 4, C and D) aggregate the delayed commuters by their workplace census tracts. We project the largest delays in Marin County, which has high flood exposure (32). However, delays also extend far beyond the areas of inundation, especially as the water level increases (Fig. 4, B and D). Fig. 4 Percentage of commuters experiencing more than 30 min of delays for 12- and 36-inch water levels, aggregated to census tracts. (A) Commuters by home tract for the 12-inch water level. (B) Same as (A), for the 36-inch water level. (C) Commuters by workplace tract for the 12-inch water level. (D) Same as (C), for the 36-inch water level. County borders are shown in black. In contrast, most impassible commutes are a result of either the home (Fig. 5, A and B) or the workplace (Fig. 5, C and D) being located within the areas of inundation. We present the spatial distribution of impassable commutes for the 12- and 36-inch water levels in Fig. 5. Census tracts where more than 50% of commutes are impassable, shown in dark blue, are mostly concentrated along the shoreline of the Bay. Fig. 5 Impassable commutes in the San Francisco Bay Area, aggregated to census tract. A tract with a dark blue color indicates that more than 50% of commuters whose home or workplace is located within the tract are unable to commute to their workplace as a result of flooding. (A) By home tract, 12-inch water level. (B) By home tract, 36-inch water level. (C) By workplace tract, 12-inch water level. (D) By workplace tract, 36-inch water level. County borders are shown in black. Floods aggravate the congestion resulting from regional jobs-housing imbalances Urban areas around the world have experienced sprawl through a confluence of factors such as population growth, land use decisions, and the development of transportation infrastructure (33). In particular, the rise in housing prices around urban centers and the availability of highways have resulted in housing and employment patterns that lead to heavy congestion and long travel times on major traffic routes (34). The potential flooding of these routes may amplify the already long travel times. The San Francisco Bay Area consists of three broad regions: The South Bay and Peninsula, the North Bay, and the East Bay (Fig. 1A). The South Bay and Peninsula region is home to the economically thriving Silicon Valley, which has a robust job market with a surplus of high-paying jobs (35) but is known for its housing shortage (36). The North Bay and East Bay regions, in contrast, have greater availability of affordable housing (36). Consequently, a substantial percentage of residents of both the North Bay (17%; table S2) and the East Bay (33%; table S2) work in the South Bay and Peninsula. The San Francisco Bay Area has strategic traffic corridors that connect the different regions. There are two potential causes of flood-related travel time delays arising along the main traffic corridors. First, the flooding and closure of traffic corridors located close to the Bay diverts commuters onto nearby local roads and highways, thus increasing congestion and associated travel time delays on alternate routes. An example is the U.S. 101, which connects the North Bay with the South Bay and Peninsula and runs along the west shoreline of the Bay. Second, the San Francisco Bay Area has a number of bridges, such as the Dumbarton Bridge and the San Mateo Bridge, which run across the Bay and have low-lying entry roads. Flood-related closures of the entry roads force commuters to either choose a different bridge or drive around the Bay, adding to travel time delays. The residents of the South Bay and Peninsula, the surplus job region, face minimal delays. A high percentage (87%; table S2) of South Bay and Peninsula residents work within the same region. The residents have multiple choices of traffic corridors to commute from home to work, not all of which are exposed to flooding. As seen in Fig. 4 (A and B), this region has a very low percentage (<5%) of residents who face delays of 30 min or more for the 12- and 36-inch water levels. The distribution of projected flood-related travel time delays in Fig. 4 reflects the asymmetry of the jobs-housing imbalance. A large percentage of East Bay residents (33%; table S2) work in the South Bay and Peninsula. East Bay residents face large delays, while the South Bay and Peninsula residents face minimal delays (Fig. 4B). In contrast, East Bay workplaces experience minimal delays, unlike the South Bay and Peninsula workplaces (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that regional jobs-housing imbalances are preexisting vulnerabilities in the traffic system that may trigger additional flood-related travel time delays. Characteristics of the road network govern traffic resilience to flood-related delays Previous studies of traffic resilience (8–10, 13) highlight that redundancy, defined as the availability of alternate roads in a road network, can offset travel time delays resulting from road closures. Current metrics of redundancy are relatively computationally intensive since they use traffic flow simulations to quantify the impact of closing individual road segments (11, 12). Other proposed proxies for traffic resilience include graph theoretic metrics such as betweenness centrality (13, 37, 38), which measures how “central” road segments are for traffic flow. These metrics, however, are not ideal proxies for traffic resilience because they do not capture the possibility of substitution. For example, betweenness centrality does not distinguish between widely used traffic corridors such as U.S. 101 that traverse through dense urban areas and fairly isolated highways with limited alternatives such as State Route 1. Local roads are available in the former case to partially offset a closure of the major traffic corridor but not in the latter. We present an alternate, simple graph theoretic metric, metric reach (39), and demonstrate its negative correlation with travel time delays. The metric reach of a road segment is defined as the number of unique road miles that can be covered starting from that segment within a service radius (39). The average metric reach of a region correlates strongly with road network density, namely, the total street length per square mile, as well as the total number of intersections per square mile (39). These correlations suggest that metric reach has the potential to approximate the availability of alternate roads within a given region. For all metric reach calculations in this study, we set the service radius parameter to 5 miles. Sensitivity tests of metric reach show no noticeable relative change for service radii of 5, 10, 15, and 20 miles. Figure 6 explores the explanatory potential of metric reach for understanding traffic resilience to coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure 6A is a map of the average metric reach for each county in the San Francisco Bay Area. In particular, Fig. 6A shows that counties in the North Bay have lower metric reach than the other counties. In Fig. 6B, we compare the average travel time delay per mile, shown by marker size, with the average metric reach and the percentage of road capacity flooded for each county, for the 36-inch water level. Marin County, in the North Bay, stands out for having both the largest delays and the highest flooded road capacity (14.5%; table S3). The other counties in the North Bay, Napa, Sonoma, and Solano also experience some of the largest delays even with relatively low flooded road capacities. Fig. 6 Metric reach versus travel time delays. (A) The metric reach averaged over the road subnetwork of each county. Metric reach represents the road network density for a given region. It is computed with a service radius of 5 miles. (B) The average delay for the 36-inch water level for every county against its percentage of flooded road capacity and its average metric reach. Colors indicate the different counties, while the sizes of the circles represent the average travel time delay in min/mile. Marin County, shown as the largest red circle, has the highest average delay, the largest flooded road capacity, and the lowest metric reach of all counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. The underlying data for (B) are provided in table S3. To identify the comparative influence of metric reach and percentage of flooded road capacity on the average delays per mile for the nine counties, we perform a log-transformed linear regression of these metrics for the 36-inch water level (table S4). Our analysis shows strong correlation (R2 = 0.86; table S4) with average delay per mile. Assuming a significance threshold of α = 0.05, the regression indicates that the averaged metric reach is statistically significant (P value = 0.003; table S4), while the percentage of flooded road capacity is not significant (P value = 0.259; table S4). Thus, the analysis indicates that the metric reach of a region predicts delays better than flood exposure. Regression analyses of metric reach and travel time delays also yield strong correlations for the 12-inch (R2 = 0.80; table S5) and 24-inch (R2 = 0.86; table S5) water levels. The ART flood maps project that San Mateo County will experience extensive flooding in the near future (6), but this flooding may not translate into travel time delays to the degree that one might expect on the basis of exposure. The county, shown in dark blue in Fig. 6B, has the second largest percentage of road capacity flooded in the 36-inch water level (7%; table S3). However, our model projects low average delay per mile (0.02 min/mile; table S3). Our analysis suggests that high metric reach reduces the projected delays in San Mateo County. However, the county experiences a relatively large percentage of impassable commutes (13%; table S3) as a result of its high flood exposure. Discussion of implications beyond the San Francisco Bay Area Our study of flood-related traffic disruption highlights the far-reaching, indirect impacts of climatic hazards on urban systems. We identify two types of disruption to traffic networks as a result of coastal flooding: (i) the emergence of impassable commutes when origin, destination, or critical road connections fall into the areas of inundation and (ii) travel time delays that spread throughout the entire regional network irrespective of proximity to the areas of inundation. These two disruptions, namely, the absence and delay of employees, have consequences for both the individual employees and businesses and for the broader regional economy. Different factors govern the dynamics of these two types of disruption. Flood exposure of homes and workplaces largely determines impassability. In contrast, flood exposure is a poor predictor of travel time delays. Our model projects the largest delays in regions with low metric reach since these regions have limited availability of alternate roads to offset disrupted traffic. The regions with low metric reach may experience delays irrespective of their proximity to the areas of inundation. Travel time delays hence propagate region-wide, and they affect a much larger percentage of commuters than impassability does (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the common assumption that floods only affect a seemingly small number of communities within the areas of inundation is questionable and could undermine planning efforts dedicated to advancing community well-being and regional competitiveness. The dynamics of flood-related traffic disruption highlighted in this study can provide valuable insights for coastal regions beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Many regions around the world share common characteristics with the San Francisco Bay Area such as dense urban development along the coastline and highly congested traffic networks. However, the San Francisco Bay Area has a unique geography. The traffic patterns that arise from the geography may introduce special vulnerabilities associated with flooding. Many major traffic corridors line the shoreline and two bridges with low-lying entry roads connect the South Bay and Peninsula to the East Bay (Fig. 1B). These particular traffic corridors and bridges act as nexus points for traffic congestion, even in the absence of hazards (23) as also demonstrated in a recent comparison of delays due to road closures in different U.S. cities (9). Apart from differences in geography and traffic patterns, some of the assumptions within our traffic model may not apply in other coastal regions. For example, we assume that commuters have complete knowledge of flood conditions, which enables them to identify their shortest-time viable routes before commencing their journeys. The assumption is reasonable for the San Francisco Bay Area given the prevalence of mobile traffic applications but may not generalize to regions in other parts of the world. Similarly, we do not currently consider public transport or biking in our model, which could be a limitation in urban areas where those modes of transport are common. Even for regions where the assumptions of our model are applicable, performing traffic simulations may prove difficult because of the lack of appropriate datasets. Not all regions have commuter origin-destination datasets, representations of the regional road network suitable for traffic modeling, or the additional datasets of road geometry and elevation needed to correct biases in model integration. To facilitate the analysis of traffic disruption resulting from climatic hazards in other regions, we propose using metric reach as a simple proxy for assessing traffic resilience within sufficiently large regions such as counties (tables S4, S5, and S6). Since metric reach is independent of the hazard that causes the closure of roads, our results suggest that the impact of different climatic hazards on travel time delays might not be as different as the hazards themselves. Accordingly, we suggest that other hazards, such as wildfires or hurricanes, would also primarily cause delays in regions with low metric reach. However, we emphasize that our model does not consider behavioral changes such as evacuations, which may substantially alter traffic patterns under conditions of high hazard severity. While we do not consider behavioral changes specifically, our study implicitly demonstrates the potential value of changes in commute behavior. An ambitious reduction of commutes between homes and workplaces would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also synergistically reduce the adverse impacts of coastal flooding, highlighting the potential cobenefits of climate change mitigation and adaptation. New technologies such as autonomous vehicles or telecommuting in conjunction with policies encouraging urban densification and public transit could help change commute patterns and achieve both adaptation and mitigation goals. Quantitative models that assess the impacts of climatic hazards on urban systems, such as the one in this study, enable an evaluation of the potential benefits of such technological and social transformations.

CONCLUSIONS Our analysis quantifies one of the cascading, indirect consequences of present-day and near-future sea level rise: the disruption of urban traffic flows. We find a spectrum of indirect impacts of coastal flooding on traffic systems, from impassable commutes for communities in the areas of inundation to travel time delays that propagate region-wide. Our model suggests that communities with low metric reach are prone to experiencing long travel time delays since they do not have sufficiently many alternate roads to fully offset road closures. Thus, communities with low flood exposure may have similar or higher vulnerability to delays compared to those with high exposure depending on the nature of the local road network. Our finding demonstrates that the characteristics of an urban system can play a bigger role in the indirect impacts of hazards on the urban system than the exposure to the hazard. Since metric reach, a general characteristic of the traffic network, is independent of the hazard type, we suggest that metric reach may help identify regions prone to delays caused by other hazards.

51,51,FF-2020-000179-IDN,Pandemic job losses and flooding spark fears of hard times in Bangladesh - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/pandemic-job-losses-and-flooding-spark-fears-of-hard-times-in-bangladesh/,"After losing his job at a garment factory in Dhaka in April as the coronavirus pandemic hit, Mohammad Sumon returned to his village in Jamalpur, about 160 kms away, hoping to support his family working as a part-time mechanic.

But severe floods that struck Bangladesh the last week of June, driven by heavy monsoon rains, are now keeping the 22-year-old from that work as well.

Instead, he finds himself stuck at home, one of millions of Bangladeshis affected by the flooding, which has hit nearly half of the country’s 64 districts and killed 41 people so far.

“My wife and I lost our jobs because the factory said they weren’t getting orders due to the coronavirus,” Sumon said.

“At my hometown I managed a job as a mechanic but that did not work because the water had risen and I couldn’t step out,” he said.

Now, with a baby daughter born just nine days ago, “I don’t know how we will manage. I am depending on a loan right now, but if things continue like this, we will be in trouble,” he said.

Low-lying, heavily populated Bangladesh is regularly hit by flooding, but experts fear the impact this year may be worse due to job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic and floods that have lingered for an unusually long time.

Thousands of workers have been sacked from the country’s garment sector - responsible for 80 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports - as European brands cancelled clothing orders worth millions of dollars as their shops shut due to the coronavirus.

Bangladesh, one of the biggest exporters of manpower in the world and heavily dependent on remittance, has also seen the return of thousands of its citizens from abroad as many lose their jobs in the pandemic.

In Bangladesh itself, more than 238,000 people have contracted the virus, and more than 3,100 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Flooding has only made matters worse, government and other experts said.

“Normally, the water begins to recede after a certain point and people start going back to their homes from flood shelters,” said Sajedul Hasan, who works for the humanitarian programme of BRAC, a Bangladesh-based development organisation.

“But this time, the water level increased for a second time in July soon after it began to recede… this was because of excessive rainfall,” he explained.

A major Bangladeshi river, the Jamuna, has been flowing above the danger level for more than 30 days according to data from Bahadurabad station in north Bangladesh.

“This is the highest number of days that we have seen since 1998,” said A.K.M. Saiful Islam, of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

According to the country’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, the water level is now receding and the situation is likely to improve by next month.

But both Islam and Hasan fear that economic hardships due to the pandemic and floods may lead more students to drop out of school, or compel families to migrate to the country’s overburdened cities for jobs, which could lead to exploitation.

Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said he could see the “fingerprint” of climate change in the recent floods.

The country used to see severe floods once every two decades - but in the last 20 years Bangladesh has seen at least four of them, Huq said.

The country now needs to try new strategies to be more prepared to tackle the changes, he said.

One of those, implemented by the United Nations in Bangladesh, is forecast-based funding which gives vulnerable people money in advance of predicted extreme weather so they are better prepared.

Aklima Begum, 40, who lives in Kurigram in North Bangladesh, was one of thousands who received about $50 ahead of the floods this year. She was able to buy food, hire a boat and take shelter in a place the floodwaters didn’t reach.

“The money that I got did help, but I have still been badly affected. My goats and chickens died because of the flood,” she said.

But this past Monday, Sri had to revert to working from home when her office decided the risk of workplace infection became too great.

“We now work in shifts,"" said Sri, who works at a shipping company that abides the strict health protocols enforced in most Jakarta office buildings.

“In our building, every person has to get their temperature checked with a thermal scan, disinfect their hands and shoes, and wear a mask at all times,” she explained.

FILE - Officials take the body temperature reading of worshippers as a precaution against the new coronavirus outbreak, outside a mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 31, 2020.

Spooked by a cluster of new outbreaks, her managers took action.

""The staff comes into the office once a week only for a few hours, but for those who are above 50 years old, including me, we are advised to work only from home.”

Tenfold increase

Indonesia’s COVID-19 Task Force recorded at least 90 new coronavirus clusters in Jakarta office buildings on July 28, comprising a total of 459 confirmed workplace cases — a tenfold increase since large-scale social restrictions concluded in early May.

Of these clusters, 18 were discovered in offices of different Indonesian ministries.

FILE - An employee wearing protective gear as a precaution against the new coronavirus holds a banner displaying information about the virus, at the Harmoni Central Busway station in Jakarta, July 16, 2020.

Task force spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito says these clusters emerged because some businesses are neglecting health protocols.

“Internationally, we are still in a pandemic,"" he told VOA. “It has been advised to work from home, especially for those who are at higher risks. Offices should also limit the working hours and the room capacity should be at 50%.

“If people are not disciplined in maintaining the health and safety guidelines, then of course clusters can happen,” he added.

Elizabeth Selina, who works at an office in West Jakarta, says complacency about workplace safety guidelines have left her constantly worried about contracting the virus.

“At first we had to disinfect our hands when we entered, but after some time, I’ve seen people who just walk in without doing that,” she said. “We also have to wear a mask, but at one point, some of the staff will take it off.”

Selina says some colleagues are confined to close quarters for several hours, sometimes with poor ventilation. She hopes the government will impose stricter enforcement of workplace safety protocols, including regular testing of those who work on site.

Lax oversight

University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono blames the latest outbreak on a lack of supervision and education about workplace protocol enforcement. A lot of offices have opened up their buildings, he said, without properly educating the staff about the importance of cleanliness and maintaining a physical distance.

“I had identified potential clusters that can happen with the easing of [restrictions],"" said Riono, explaining that he had urged government health officials in May to require physical distancing in offices, factories, markets, or any place where crowds gather.

Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist from Australia’s Griffith University, says the government should hold off opening non-essential offices until the end of the year.

“There is no other choice for Indonesia, unless you want to risk a large increase in infection and death,” Budiman told local news outlet Kompas.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has vowed to improve enforcement oversight and expand COVID-19 testing, promising to name companies that fail to comply.

“The Jakarta Government will continue to supervise every business and public activity in Jakarta,"" he said during an online press conference July 30.

""We will formally announce in our website any violations and the consequences,"" he said. ""We will also impose a progressive fine for repeat offenders and companies that have received prior warnings.”

Baswedan says the head of the office must take actions to protect their workers and continue to stress the importance of adhering to the health and safety protocols, as well as continuously supervising the day-to-day activities in the building.

“If a workplace does not care about its workers, the consequence is potential infection,"" he said. ""When that happens, there has to be a closure and, in the end, everyone will lose.”

Indonesia now has more than 116,871 confirmed cases, with 5,452 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.

53,53,FF-2020-000179-IDN,"After massive flood, Offutt looks to build a better base - AirForceTimes.com",https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2020/08/07/after-massive-floods-offutt-looks-to-build-a-better-base/,"In March 2019, the waters of the Missouri River engulfed dozens of buildings and more than half a mile of runway at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, forced nine aircraft to evacuate and displaced thousands of personnel.

But nearly a year and a half later, Offutt is well on the road to recovery from these devastating floods.

And in some ways, according to the officer overseeing the rebuilding effort, the flood has had a “silver lining,” allowing Offutt to rebuild in a better, more thoughtful way for the missions of its future.

“This gives us an opportunity to foundationally rebuild the base for the Air Force’s next generation of warfighting,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Conover, director of the program management office in charge of rebuilding Offutt, in a July 24 interview.

Flooding began to overwhelm Offutt on March 15, 2019, forcing the base to evacuate nine aircraft. About 700 airmen filled 235,000 sandbags in a valiant, but ultimately unsuccessful, effort to hold the waters back. About one-third of the base, including 3,000 feet of runway, was flooded by 720 million gallons of water infested with raw sewage.

About 3,200 personnel were driven out of their workspaces. Those service members and employees are still in temporary workspaces — primarily the 80-year-old Glenn L. Martin-Nebraska Bomber Plant, which produced B-29s during World War II, including the Enola Gay and Bockscar bombers that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan.

Ultimately, 137 facilities — everything from full-fledged buildings to structures as small as generators, hydrants or guard houses — were damaged in the flood. About 60 buildings were deemed unsalvageable and slated for destruction. About 1.2 million square feet of work space — including 118,000 square feet of SCIF, or secure, compartmented information facilities, space for handling highly classified material — was destroyed.

The base’s reconstruction effort — which the Air Force said would cost $420 million, plus another $234 million to replace three destroyed simulators — will likely not be done for six more years.

But, Conover said, work is already well under way — and the base is taking the opportunity to rethink how Offutt is structured and find more efficient ways to do business.

As Offutt plans its reconstruction, it’s aiming for a much more well-thought-out layout, Conover said. The base is planning eight campuses, with 26 new facilities, that will group similar missions together: most importantly, nuclear command and control alert forces, but also satellite communications; multi-domain operations supporting signals intelligence missions; security forces; logistics; flightline operations. including fuels, liquid oxygen and maintenance; and the base lake recreation facilities.

Another campus will handle an emergency power micro-grid, with three interconnected power stations across the base, to provide backup power to critical facilities during power outages. Conover said this is crucial, because all of Offutt’s backup generators were destroyed in the flood.

Offutt began planning these new campuses seven months after the flood. The base has now finished the planning phase, and has moved on to the design phase. Logistics is the easiest to design — using practically an off-the-shelf plan — and is the furthest along, he said.

But others will be more complex and take longer. The multi-domain operations campus, for example, will start being designed this October and will likely take an entire year to finish. Construction on the multi-domain campus is expected to begin in January 2022, and finish in July 2026, he said.

Waters recede from Offutt flightline as flood recovery continues The last waters flooding the 2-mile-long flightline at Offutt receded Wednesday, and engineers have entered the first of 30 flooded buildings.

The earliest any construction will begin will be around April 2021, after the demolition and fill dirt and utility work is done, Conover said. The environmental assessments required before demolition can begin are expected to be finished this September.

But Offutt’s mission had to go on, flood or no flood, and it needed to find space for 3,200 displaced personnel.

The Martin bomber plant, also known as Building D, had office space that hadn’t been used for more than a decade. So Offutt renovated some of that building’s space, and started putting the bulk of the 3,200 people there.

However, that’s just a stopgap solution, not a long-term answer, Conover said. As Offutt has methodically worked through the flood-damaged hangars and offices to refurbish them, it has moved people back, bit by bit.

For example, people have gradually been moving back into the Bennie L. Davis Maintenance Facility, which is the main maintenance hub for Offutt’s RC-135 fleet. Conover hopes the Davis building will be finished by the end of the year.

Offutt is also preparing for the next floods. The Army Corps of Engineers has repaired all the levees that were breached or damaged by last year’s flood, Conover said. And in April, the base began working on raising the levees to the 100-year flood level, or three feet, he said. That $35 million effort — which was originally scheduled to begin last year, a few weeks after the flood struck — should be finished by December, he said.

Work is also under way to line the Missouri River, as well as the Platte River that serves as its tributary, Conover said.

Congress ordered Offutt to build its new facilities above the 100-year floodplain. That will mean trucking in 673,000 cubic yards of fill dirt to bring the new mission-critical facilities up three feet above the 100-year flood level, and non-mission critical facilities two feet above that level.

But Offutt is not expecting a repeat of the massive, unprecedented flooding, which was caused by a a combination of unique conditions, Conover said. Record snow and low temperatures, which froze the ground, rivers and tributaries, quickly gave way to rising temperatures and then a “bomb cyclone” struck, dumping up to eight inches of rain in the region.

“We feel that there were very specific climatic variables that uniquely aligned that caused this 500-year flood,” Conover said. “So a lot of people are worried about flooding [on that scale again]. We’re not.”

Offutt is also working to restore buildings that were flooded, but not so badly damaged that they couldn’t be saved. Contractors are now working to gut and dry salvageable facilities such as some flooded hangars and Tennant Hall — an eight-year-old building that formerly housed the 97th Intelligence Squadron and served as a SCIF.

Congress gave Offutt permission to keep the relatively new building. But because Tennant Hall sits in the flood plain and can’t be raised, the base will make its first floor “sacrificial” and accept that it will be flooded from time to time. However, this means it will no longer be able to be a SCIF.

The contractors are putting in new walls and utilities to allow Tennant Hall to take on its new missions, including the WC-135 Constant Phoenix nuke sniffer program and anti-drug efforts, as well as warehouse space.

Offutt’s runway was given the all-clear after the waters covering 3,000 feet of flightline receded, without causing major damage. But, Conover said, it is still the oldest runway in the Air Force, and already had plenty of problems.

So the base is preparing to shut the runway down, tear it out completely, and replace it, Conover said. Offutt will move its mission operations to Lincoln, Nebraska, while the runway is redone. This was already in the works before the flood happened, he said.

Three RC-135 Rivet Joint simulators — which recreate the entire interior of those signals intelligence aircraft — were also lost in the flood, with a price tag of $234 million.

The Air Force’s program manager running the simulators, Big Safari, salvaged and repurposed what they could from the flood wreckage, but most of it was shot. So Offutt cobbled together one working simulator out of spare parts scrounged from the depot in Texas and forward operating locations worldwide, as well as U.K. partners.

But while that “band-aid solution” worked to get operations back up and running, Conover said, it’s not ideal. Big Safari is designing and building the next generation of simulators, which could start being installed next spring.","Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/z8dzAoJ9IbnWHJdvBmgMblZ65iQ=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mco/HEKNWOZVVNC6BFDU3MRP6V72IE.jfif,"['flood', 'looks', 'base', 'conover', 'feet', 'force', 'runway', 'build', 'flooded', 'air', 'offutt', 'better', 'facilities', 'massive']",

2020 Call for Proposals (Grants out)

UNDRR is the United Nations’ focal point for the coordination of disaster risk reduction, working with countries and a broad range of partners and stakeholders to support the implementation, monitoring and review of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 in coherence with the 2030 Agenda and other instruments, for the multihazard management of disaster risk in development and the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses.

UNDRR issues grants, in line with UN Financial Regulations and Rules, to apolitical and not profit-making organisations to facilitate, implement, or carry out activities related to UNDRR’s and the partner’s mandates and work programmes.

To this end, UNDRR invites not profit-making organisations to submit grant proposals that focus on the project described below.

Project title: Strengthening disaster risk resilience through enhanced coordination mechanisms (Malawi and SADC)

A. Rationale:

Malawi is highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events given its location along the great African Rift Valley, rapid population growth, unsustainable urbanization, climate variability and change, and environmental degradation (Government of Malawi, 2019). The most common weather-related shocks affecting Malawi include floods, drought, stormy rains and hailstorms. Over the past five decades, Malawi has experienced more than 19 major floods and seven droughts, with these events increasing in frequency, magnitude and scope over the years. In early March 2019, heavy rains developed from a Tropical Depression 11 that formed offshore central Mozambique (Government of Malawi, 2019). Heavy rains hit Malawi, causing severe flooding in the Southern and, to a lesser extent, Central Region of the country (Government of Malawi, 2019). These disaster events have had a significant impact on people’s lives, livelihoods and socioeconomic infrastructure in the affected areas, pushing a large number of people into poverty and food insecurity (Government of Malawi, 2019)

With financial support of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), UNDRR will work with the Government of Malawi and the Secretariat of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to enhance coordination mechanisms for policy making, impact-based early warning systems triggering early actions and informing transboundary risk management by contributing to the update and development of common tools and standard operating procedures (SOP) for data and information analysis.

The project builds on the achievements of the ACP-EU Programme “Building resilience to natural hazards of Sub-Saharan African Countries and communities” and on the “peer learning exchange on policy coherence among disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation” held in Lilongwe in 2019.

B. Purpose:

The project aims to work with Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA), the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (DCCMS), Department of water resources (DWR) and other stakeholders involved in early warning for floods in order to establish data sharing platform supporting the update, development, activation of standard operating procedures based on the four components of early warning systems, namely risk knowledge, monitoring and forecasting, communication and dissemination and disaster response.

The project targets the decision making and technical level of the key institutions responsible of issuance warnings floods. The development of SOPs will build on lessons learned from previous experiences (e.g. Idai cyclone), existing baseline assessments, a revision of existing procedures, institutional arrangements and legal frameworks facilitating EWS and transboundary risk management. In addition, the project aims at enhancing linkages and coordination among SADC and the national level.

Anticipated high-level outcomes of the project include:

Revision of institutional and legal frameworks: Support institutions to revise legal frameworks, procedures and key stakeholders for enhanced coordination for early warning, including transboundary risk management

Support institutions to revise legal frameworks, procedures and key stakeholders for enhanced coordination for early warning, including transboundary risk management Update and development of SOP: update and develop SOPs for early warning in the case of floods based on the four components of EWS, namely risk knowledge, monitoring and forecasting, communication and dissemination and disaster response.

Most of Tuesday's damage seemed to be east and north of where the hurricane's eye tore through land in North Carolina, causing floods and fires that displaced dozens of people.

Two people died when Isaias spun off a tornado that struck a mobile home park in Windsor, Bertie County officials said. Twelve people were injured and taken to hospitals.

Bertie County Sheriff John Holley told reporters 10 mobile homes had been destroyed in the area.

Isaias sustained top winds of 65 mph (105 kph)

""It doesn't look real, it looks like something on TV. Nothing is there,'' Holley said. ""All my officers are down there at this time. Pretty much the entire trailer park is gone.''

Chairman of the Bertie County Board of Commissioners Ron Wesson said emergency crews found no other casualties, and several people initially believed missing had all been accounted for. Wesson said 12 people had been hospitalized.

According to North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, three counties along the state's coast were among the hardest hit with aggressive storms, structure fires and reports of tornadoes.

Authorities said a further two people were killed by falling trees in Maryland and New York City as the storm gained speed.

A massive tree toppled and crushed a van in the Briarwood section of Queens, killing a man inside, police said. A woman in Mechanicsville, Maryland, died when a tree crashed onto her car, said Julie Yingling of the St Mary's County sheriff's office.

One person perished in Pennsylvania when their vehicle was swept away by flooding, while in Delaware a person died after being struck by a tree branch, authorities confirmed.

More than 15 hours after coming ashore, Isaias still had sustained top winds of 65 mph (105 km/h).

Strong winds 65 miles west of New York forced authorities to shut down the Staten Island Ferry and outdoor subway lines.



Isaias caused floods and fires that displaced dozens of people

Before it struck the East Coast, Isaias killed two people in the Caribbean and lashed through the Bahamas before brushing past coronavirus-hit Florida.

Forecasters on Tuesday said Isaias was likely to remain a tropical storm as it heads towards New England over the next two days.

60,60,FF-2020-000179-IDN,Explained: How dangerous is the volcanic eruption in Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung? - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-volcanic-eruption-in-indonesias-mount-sinabung-6550530/,"Mount Sinabung spews volcanic materials into the air as it erupts, in Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia, on August 10. (Photo: AP)

Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung volcano erupted on Monday, sending a column of ash and smoke more than 16,000 feet into the air. The volcano became active in 2010, erupting after nearly 400 years of inactivity.

According to the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), USA, generally, there are about 20 volcanoes actively erupting every day. As per the weekly volcanic activity report prepared by The Smithsonian and US Geological Survey’s (USGS) Volcano Hazards program, for the week ending August 4, 2020, there were 17 volcanoes across the world with continuing eruptions. As per USGS, there are about 1,500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide.

Indonesia is home to many active volcanoes, due to its position on the “Ring of Fire”, or the Circum-Pacific Belt, which is an area along the Pacific Ocean characterised by active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. The Ring of Fire is home to about 75 per cent of the world’s volcanoes and about 90 per cent of its earthquakes.

The current eruption

According to a report in the Jakarta Post, Monday’s eruption was the third since Saturday, with the volcano spewing 5000-metre high column of ash and smoke into the air, followed by another eruption that produced a 2000-metre high column.

What are the recent eruptions?

The volcano, which is situated in North Sumatra, has been active since 2010.

Another eruptive phase for the volcano began in September 2013, which continued uninterrupted until June 2018, according to information maintained by the National Museum of Natural History’s Global Volcanism Program. During the 2018 eruption, the volcano released ash 5-7 km into the air, coating villages.

Why do volcanoes erupt?

A volcano can be active, dormant or extinct. An eruption takes place when magma (a thick flowing substance), formed when the earth’s mantle melts, rises to the surface. Because magma is lighter than solid rock, it is able to rise through vents and fissures on the surface of the earth. After it has erupted, it is called lava.

Not all volcanic eruptions are explosive, since explosivity depends on the composition of the magma. When the magma is runny and thin, gases can easily escape it, in which case, the magma will flow out towards the surface. On the other hand, if the magma is thick and dense, gases cannot escape it, which builds up pressure inside until the gases escape in a violent explosion.

When do volcanic eruptions become dangerous?

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common cause of death from a volcano is suffocation, making people with respiratory conditions such as asthma and other chronic lung diseases especially susceptible. People living in areas close to the volcano, or in low-lying areas downwind, are also at higher risk in case of an explosion, since the ash may be gritty and abrasive and small ash particles can scratch the surface of the eyes.

Further, volcanic eruptions can result in additional threats to health such as floods, mudslides, power outages, drinking water contamination and wildfires.

Lava flows, however, rarely kill people, since they move slowly, giving enough time to escape. In a 2018 interview to Stanford News, Stanford geologist Gail Mahood noted that one reason why volcanic eruptions can be dangerous in places such as Indonesia, Guatemala and the Philippines is that in these countries, large populations are packed on and around volcanoes.","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/volcano-1200.jpg,"['magma', 'explained', 'mount', 'sinabung', 'volcano', 'volcanic', 'indonesias', 'ash', 'eruption', 'eruptions', 'active', 'volcanoes', 'dangerous']",

Low pressure zone to make landfall in Odisha on Wednesday night.

The situation may improve in all flood-affected districts of Bangladesh as the water levels of all major rivers of the country is falling, according to the Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC)

As of 9am on Wednesday, 35 out of 101 water level monitoring stations of the country saw water levels rise while 62 saw it decrease. Water levels at the remaining four stations were unchanged.

The water levels of 15 rivers were still flowing above the danger mark at 24 monitoring stations across the country, but the water levels had decreased at 16 of them as of Wednesday morning. The water level at seven out of the 24 stations rose while it remained unchanged at one.

According to the FFWC, the situation may improve in Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Shirajganj, Tangail, Naogaon, Natore, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Chandpur, Rajbari, Shariatpur, Dhaka and Narayanganj in next 24 hours due to the falling water levels.

Water levels of the rivers surrounding Dhaka remain unchanged and are unlikely to change in the next 24 hours, however, the situation at low-land areas of the Dhaka city corporations are still likely to improve, according to the FFWC.

“Water level of the Brahmaputra and Jamuna is decreasing, which will continue in the next 72 hours. Water level of all the rivers of the Meghna basin in the north-eastern region is also falling, and it will continue so in the next 48 hours,” the FFWC forecast said.

The water level of the Ganges has been unchanged for the last few days, but the water level of the Padma started to decrease from Tuesday. The decreasing trend will continue for the next 24 hours, though the Ganges river will remain stable during the period, the forecast added.

Abdul Mannan, a meteorologist of Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told Dhaka Tribune: “There will be more rainfall in the next two-three days compared to the last few days, but we are not forecasting heavy or very heavy rainfall across the country. One or two places in the southern part of the country may face heavy to very heavy rainfall.”

Low pressure zone to make landfall in Odisha Wednesday night

At 9am on Wednesday, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) said a low-pressure zone over the north bay and adjoining area intensified into a well-marked low-pressure zone and now lies over the northwest bay and adjoining North Odisha - West Bengal - Bangladesh coast. Moreover, the monsoon is active over Bangladesh and strong over the North Bay.

The low-pressure zone is expected to make landfall in Odisha, India on Wednesday night.

Under the influence of the low pressure and strong monsoon over the north bay, squally weather may affect maritime ports in coastal areas of Bangladesh.

Maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar, Mongla and Payra have been advised to keep hoisting a local cautionary signal number three.

All fishing boats and trawlers over the north bay have been advised to remain close to the coast and proceed with caution till further notice.

BMD has also warned of some rain across the country. Light to moderate rain or thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds is likely to occur at most places over Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram, Dhaka and Rajshahi divisions, and at a few places over Rangpur, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions, with moderately heavy to very heavy falls at places in the southern part of the country.

Meteorologist Abdul Mannan said: “The low pressure zone will make landfall in Odisha on Wednesday night. Rainfall may increase a little because of this.”","Wed, 05 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/338199/1596636167062untitled-1595864350745.jpg,"['falling', 'levels', 'level', 'major', 'heavy', 'odisha', 'north', 'dhaka', 'hours', 'rivers', 'country', 'water', 'floods', 'zone']",

According to the latest report by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), 58 people have died while 128 houses have been damaged around Pakistan since the beginning of the monsoon last month.

Last week Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the Pakistan Army and the NDMA to help in cleaning up Karachi, where roads are flooded with rainwater mixed with garbage.

Volunteers from Caritas Pakistan Karachi (CPK) disaster management committees (DMCs) showed up to help clear the sludge away from St. Francis Xavier Church.

A Caritas emergency response team visited the flood-affected parish at the weekend.

“The objective of the visit was to see the damage and strengthen coordination between DMCs, Caritas and the Union Council for relief work,” Mansha Noor, executive secretary of CPK, told UCA News.

“This monsoon season has turned into a nightmare for poor people who are forced to stay outside their houses or to spend time on shared roofs. The slum dwellers are forced to deal with it on their own as no concrete steps are taken by the relevant authorities. Women and children are falling ill due to waterborne diseases.”

CPK distributed cooked food and drinking water in St. Michael’s Parish on Aug. 9. Noor also handed over emergency response kits to DMC members in Shahjahanabad.

“DMC members are our frontline heroes in disaster management for saving people and their belongings. They are cleaning churches on a self-help basis and creating awareness regarding evacuation and hygiene,” said Noor.","Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2020/08/-5f311bac01e8e_600.png,"['karachi', 'heavy', 'disaster', 'rainfall', 'management', 'church', 'parish', 'monsoon', 'pakistan', 'noor', 'st', 'flooded', 'churches']",

Rains lashed Jaipur city, state capital of desert Indian state of Rajasthan, on Fridaywith over 100mm rainfall was recorded in just six hours.

Downpours led to severe water-logging bringing life to standstill in many parts of Jaipur with roads submerged with up to three feet of water.

In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, nearly eight million people have been affected by floods and at least 24 deaths have been reported.

Meanwhile more than five million people have been affected by flooding in the north eastern state of Assam.

Mumbai, India’s commercial capital has ground to a halt after heaviest August rainfall in 47 years causing widespread flooding. One woman and two children were swept away in a flooded drain after heavy rain.

Though monsoon flooding in Mumbai is an annual phenomenon, this year the floods reached areas that have never experienced it before.

Mumbai is the worst-affected city in the country. Scores of videos shared on socialmedia show streets and homes in Mumbai deluged by heavy monsoon rains, drivenby high winds.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts active monsoon conditions over large parts of the country leading to ""heavy to very heavy rainfall"" during the next two to three days.

Fairly widespread heavy rainfall at isolated places are very likely over major parts of north India.The heavy rains are likely to continue for the next few weeks before rapidly diminishing in coverage and intensity into September.","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/5zwGwDq3aXO3qPmg0NxLVM/8ae3ef153e8249c7ccab88b4256e6e46/India_rains.jpg,"['cities', 'widespread', 'parts', 'heavy', 'major', 'rainfall', 'standstill', 'jaipur', 'rains', 'indian', 'monsoon', 'country', 'state', 'flooding', 'brings']",

But, in the last eight months, 2020 has proved that it's, quite literally, the worst. Here are some of the worst instances that have happened in less than a year:

1. Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. As of date, it has led to the death of 739,212 people worldwide.

After first being identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, Covid-19 or the novel Coronavirus was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. And, as of August 10, 2020, it has infected over more than 20 million people and led to the death of seven hundred thousand people worldwide.

Covid has put a severe strain on the healthcare infrastructure across developed and developing nation, while severely affecting marginalized communities across the globe.

2. India experienced one of the worst migrant crisis since partition after the countrywide lockdown was announced.

PM Modi announced a countrywide lockdown to help curb the spread of Covid-19. However, due to various circumstances (including misinformation), this resulted in a nationwide migrant crisis and migrant workers took the long walk home, quite literally, to reach their native villages.

Many died due to the heat, exhaustion, and/or starvation. Several households have been left with no earnings, little to no savings, and no income opportunities.

According to the weather gauges at the University of Reading, where I work, Tuesday 11 August was the third hottest night in records that date back to 1908.

But it seems that, as is often the case with summer hot spells, the heatwave is ending with some spectacular thunderstorms. Tragically, downpours in Scotland are even thought to have played a part in a landslide that derailed a train – although it is still too early to say for sure.

At the time of writing, the forecast shows scattered thunderstorms are possible everywhere leading up to the weekend. While parts of the UK have endured nearly a week of stifling heat, much of the country now faces hail, lightning, gusty winds, torrential downpours and flooding.

Mike Egerton/PA

Forecasting which parts of the country will be hit by downpours, and which will miss them, is extremely difficult. But while such an uncertain forecast doesn’t help much if you’re planning a picnic, it is still useful for those who are managing rivers and trying to reduce the risks associated with floods.

Those people should now be doing things like clearing trash screens to aid drainage, putting up protection for individual properties and moving vulnerable possessions, and checking on dams to make sure they are ready to withstand the additional pressure and amount of water coming through caused by heavy rain.

These are low-cost actions that can be taken ahead of any possible outburst which might lead to flooding, and can prevent a lot of damage – and heartache.

Forecasters will be closely monitoring the situation. Thunderstorms are notoriously difficult to predict with a frustratingly stubborn level of uncertainty in how they evolve in our supercomputer weather simulations.

Nevertheless, forecasters will be ensuring that updates are sent to those who need them quickly and preparing for the worst-case scenarios. Even a few hours’ advance warning could be the difference between safety and disaster.

Summer flash floods can affect anyone, anywhere. Even if you don’t live near a river, an extreme and sudden downpour on soil baked hard by days of sunshine can turn your home, your street, or your town into a devastated flood zone in minutes.

Currently, most of the UK has a “yellow” warning. The Met Offices says “Yellow means keep an eye on the latest forecast and be aware that the weather may change or worsen, leading to disruption of your plans in the next few days.”

As the warnings get more serious and turn amber or red, or if the forecast is for severe “danger to life” flooding then this could mean a potential paddling pool depth of water falling everywhere in minutes. Such a battering, as the thunderstorm passes, provides enough force to overturn cars as the water all rushes together.

Power failures and travel disruptions are a given and can happen suddenly. Don’t take chances and keep you, your family and community safe.

We have come a long way in our ability to predict the most intense “convective” rainfall from summer storms driven by summer heat in the UK. But there is still a lot about the science that we don’t understand. Advancements in these areas would help us to better understand when and where sudden, heavy downpours will strike.

The problem comes due to the huge amounts of energy that drive these storms. The heat and humidity in recent days feeds the development of the thunderstorm, but the volatile, unstable air means that it is very tricky to work out exactly where each thunderstorm will be. A few hours ahead we can usually at least say which parts of the country will be affected, but thunderstorms have a very small footprint and can rapidly change.

One thing we do know: as our climate changes, and summer heatwaves become more common, these kinds of sleepless nights – and the incredibly dangerous summer downpours that relieve them – are also going to become more likely.

Even though the disruption and danger they can bring can be significant, it is difficult not to appreciate the majesty of these natural phenomena. Watching a thundercloud develop is mesmerising, as it grows and grows and then towers over you. Lightning strikes are dangerous, but seen from a distance, provide one of the greatest shows the sky can provide. You can check out online lightening trackers to find where lightning is currently active.","Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/352749/original/file-20200813-20-14wivmi.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C533%2C4551%2C2275&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['thunderstorms', 'lethal', 'strike', 'forecast', 'theyll', 'summer', 'water', 'thunderstorm', 'parts', 'weather', 'uk', 'floods', 'downpours', 'predict', 'end', 'spectacular', 'hard', 'lightning', 'heatwaves']",

According to the India Meteorological Department, the state is very likely to receive heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places in the coming two to three days. Besides the IMD, various other agencies have also sounded an alert for flash floods, torrential rainfall in the state for Thursday and the coming days.

Earlier on Wednesday, the State Disaster Management Center had warned about the possibility of heavy and very heavy rains in the state on Thursday. All District Magistrates were also directed to take precautionary measures in order to avoid any untoward incidents.

A video shared on social media showed heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, heavy and incessant rainfall in the state, coupled with landslides, led to the temporary closure of the Gangotri National Highway. The key highway was later closed for nearly 30 hours. Areas near the China border were also disconnected following heavy rains.

The national highway leading to Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines was blocked at several points due to falling of boulders after rain lashed Rishikesh in Uttarakhand's Dehradun district early on Wednesday.

Boulders fell on the road at several points between Neer Gaddu and Shivpuri, the station house officer said, adding that an earth-mover machine got stuck while clearing the road for traffic.

The Ganga was flowing 10-cm above the warning level, and its water level continues to rise, Saklani said.

The water level of Henwal river, a tributary of the Ganga, has also risen and families living close to it have been shifted to safer places, the officer said.

Top officials from Catholic charity Caritas have called for immediate emergency aid from the international community as the Bangladesh government and aid agencies struggle to assist millions of people affected by devastating monsoon flooding.

One of the worst floods in years, triggered by heavy monsoon rain and an onrush of water from transboundary rivers in upstream India, has affected 5.44 million people in 33 districts in northern and central parts of Bangladesh, according to Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, head of the state-run Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.

The flood situation is now static but will take weeks to improve, he noted.

Millions of people in South Asian countries including Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan have been affected by flooding and about 350 people have died so far, Al Jazeera reported on Aug. 1.

To assist victims, the Bangladesh government has distributed 34.45 million taka (US$407,000), 9,421 metric tons of rice and 113,922 packets of dry food as well as cash aid for baby food, cattle fodder and house repairs, according to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry’s latest disaster situation report on Aug. 2.

Caritas Rajshahi and Caritas Dinajpur, covering northern Bangladesh, have geared up to support flood victims.

Caritas Rajshahi intially selected 500 victims to offer food aid including rice, lentils, oil and salt worth about 1,500 taka and wrote to international donor agencies to allocate funds to support more victims.

“This year’s flooding is different in nature. It is not stable and it might be prolonged. It comes at the time of Covid-19 when physical distancing is important but difficult,” Caritas Rajshahi director Sukleash George Costa told UCA News.

Caritas staff and volunteers are in the field to assist people in getting pure drinking water and to advise on maintaining distance in flood shelters, he added.

Jogen Julian Besra, regional director of Caritas Dinajpur, lamented that the condition of people has worsened due to flooding.

“People have lost houses and now they are living under open skies. Many of them desperately need food and better shelter,” Besra told UCA News.

The Caritas national office has allocated 500,000 taka for emergency aid for victims that will be distributed this week, he said.

Chinese diners are being told to order less food as part of a campaign by President Xi Jinping to tackle waste and embrace thrift.

""Operation empty plate"" aims to overturn the ingrained cultural habit of ordering extra food for group meals.

""As for the phenomenon of food waste... Shocking and distressing,"" Xi was quoted as saying Tuesday in state media, adding it was ""necessary to maintain crisis awareness regarding food security"".

""This year's impact of the coronavirus pandemic has further sounded the alarm for us.""

Catering groups responded to Xi's call by embracing a so-called ""N-1 policy"" -- urging groups of customers to order one dish fewer than the number of diners at a table.

The campaign also suggests restaurants serve smaller or half-portions for lone diners.

A 2018 report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences claimed the average restaurant diner wasted 93 grams (3 ounces) of food every meal, contributing to the 18 million tons of food large cities throw away every year.

Public concerns over food security have increased in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which initially saw panic-buying and shortages in locked-down cities.

Worries have been compounded by severe floods that have devastated vast swathes of farmland in the Yangtze river delta -- where around half of China's agricultural production takes place -- disrupting harvests and leading to a rise in food prices.

State media and online platforms have also begun to wage war on food waste.

Popular livestreaming platforms Douyin and Kuaishou said they would shut down accounts of people who gorge themselves on excessive levels of food, sometimes until they vomit -- a viral video practice known as ""mukbang"".

But some social media users were dubious about the food waste drive.

""First of all we should change our national tradition of loving to keep up appearances, we always feel that ordering one dish between two people is shameful,"" wrote one user on Weibo.

""This is insane,"" wrote another. ""In future, do I have to use half a piece of toilet paper when I use the bathroom?""","Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/13/2020_08_13_102293_1597311633._large.jpg,"['platforms', 'ordering', 'cut', 'half', 'order', 'food', 'told', 'chinese', 'waste', 'media', 'wrote', 'diners', 'pandemic', 'xi']",

This eruption was the first to have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic following the one on June 9, 2019, that created a massive column of ash reaching a height of up to some seven thousand meters above the peak, or approximately 9,460 meters above sea level, according to a press statement issued by the Sinabung Volcano Observation Post of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) on Saturday.

The ash column was observed to be gray to brown in color, with moderate to thick intensity, and leaning eastward.

On the seismogram, the eruption was recorded with a maximum amplitude of 120 mm and a duration of approximately 1 hour and 44 seconds.

Currently, the alert status of Mount Sinabung is at Level III. Local residents and visitors are also prohibited from venturing within a three-kilometer (km) radial radius of the summit of Mount Sinabung and a sectoral radius of 5 km for the south-east sectors, and 4 km for the east-north sectors.

In the event of an ash rain, the people are advised to wear masks while venturing outdoors to lower the health impact of the volcanic ash.

Local people living near riverbanks, whose upstream are in the vicinity of Mount Sinabung, are urged to remain vigilant to the dangers of lava floods. After remaining inactive for four centuries, Mount Sinabung has sprung back to life since 2010 and erupted sporadically. The natural disaster has led to the displacement of tens of thousands of people.

The government relocated the displaced people to new permanent settlement areas away from the volcano.

Mount Sinabung's eruption had claimed two lives in 2010 and 15 lives in 2015. The last known eruption, prior to recent times, occurred in the year 1600.

According to Hindustan Times, Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung on North Sumatra Island erupted spewing out black clouds of ash, smoke and other volcanic materials as high as 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky. This is the third time in two days that the volatile volcano has erupted.

According to an official at the Mount Sinabung observation post, Armen Putra, a thick layer of ash covered several villages up to 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) from the crater, reports ABC News. Hence, as a precautionary measure, villagers nearby are advised to stay clear from the crater’s mouth. Horrifying visuals from the volcanic eruption have been widely shared on social media.

The Sinabung volcano is one of two currently erupting in Indonesia. It was dormant for four centuries before exploding in 2010. Another eruption happened in the year 2014 that killed 16 people. Luckily, no injuries or fatalities have been reported from this eruption, said Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center.

Linkedin News Desk (Agence France-Presse) New Delhi, India ● Fri, August 7, 2020 13:30 299 6657ac82168da9fa101c8a4066c4afec 2 World India,coronavirus,COVID-19,COVID-19-infection,pandemic,SARS-CoV-2,virus-corona,novel-coronavirus Free

India's official coronavirus case tally passed two million on Friday after a daily jump of more than 60,000.

The South Asian giant becomes only the third country to reach the figure, after the United States and Brazil.

The rate of spread in the world's second-most populous country also appears to be increasing.

India logged its first one million infections just three weeks ago.

Official figures show the country has now recorded 2.03 million infections and 41,585 deaths.

Many experts say the true numbers may be much higher among its 1.3 billion people, many of whom live in some of the world's most crowded cities.

Spending per capita on health care is feeble by international comparison.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns in late March.

But with Asia's third-largest economy reeling -- tens of millions of migrant workers lost their jobs almost overnight -- the restrictions have been steadily eased.

Individual states and cities have been imposing more localized lockdowns including IT hub Bangalore last month, the eastern state of Bihar and part of Tamil Nadu in the south.

Previously the main hotspots have been the teeming megacities of New Delhi and Mumbai, home to some of the world's biggest slums.

Now smaller cities and rural areas -- where 70 percent of Indians live -- have begun to see case numbers rising sharply.

India has tested around 16,500 people per million, compared to 190,000 in the United States, according to a tally by Worldometer.

A study last week that tested for coronavirus antibodies reported some 57 percent of people in Mumbai's teeming slums have had the infection -- far more than official data suggests.

A similar probe earlier in July indicated that almost a quarter of people in the capital, New Delhi, have had the virus -- almost 40 times the official total.

Fatalities may also be higher than the official numbers. Experts say that even in normal times the cause of death is not properly recorded in large numbers of cases.

Stigma

In smaller cities and in rural areas people also ignore guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks, anecdotal evidence suggests.

Monsoon floods in recent weeks that have affected millions have also hindered efforts to fight the pandemic.

In addition, some of those infected are ostracized by their communities, leading to a stigmatization of the virus that puts people off being tested.

""A new disease with relatively high levels of complications and mortality, with accompanying directives on physical distancing, inevitably leads to fears, apprehensions and... stigma,"" said Rajib Kumar, who heads the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.

""There's both the fear of the disease as well as of isolation and quarantine,"" Kumar told AFP.","Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/05/2020_08_05_101767_1596622138._large.jpg,"['cities', 'india', 'virus', 'worlds', 'numbers', 'states', 'coronavirus', 'cases', 'country', 'weeks', 'pass', 'delhi', 'official', 'million']",

Before working with GrabKios, she only sold staple foods and small household items at her shop, but now Sari is able to offer digital payment services to customers, including phone credit top-ups and bill payments. Her customer base has been increasing ever since, Sari said.

Fintech solutions have showcased their potential to drive financial inclusion, which is a key driver of poverty reduction and greater prosperity. Before Indonesians began to leverage technology’s power to democratize access to financing, Chinese tech firms deployed fintech to reach China’s unbanked population, which remains the largest in the world.

Serving the most mobile payment users in the world, the country’s technology giants, namely Alibaba’s Ant Group and Tencent’s WeBank, have grown sizable businesses, partly due to their technology’s ability to provide financial products to people previously underserved by traditional financial institutions.

China’s fintech industry is reaching maturation following a period of explosive growth, which saw Chinese investment value in fintech comprise 46% of all global fintech deals in 2018.

With the third-largest unbanked population in the world behind China and India, Indonesia has increasingly looked to fintech solutions to increase access to financing.

Chinese investors and firms also see Indonesia as a prime market for fintech to excel, recognizing parallels to the Chinese market such as increasing mobile penetration rates among a digitally native, young generation, as well as rising disposable incomes prompting greater demand for fintech products from a growing middle class.

Encouraging growth in Indonesia

Indonesia’s promising fintech future is illustrated by the increasing number of licensed peer-to-peer (P2P) lending operators under the authority of the Financial Services Authority (OJK), as well as mobile wallet providers that are granted licenses by the central bank of Indonesia (BI).

As of June 2020, OJK has licensed 158 fintech lenders, and the number is expected to grow throughout the year. Meanwhile, BI has issued licenses to 51 e-money operators per May 2020, with major players like GoPay, Ovo, Dana, and LinkAja.

This swell of activity over the past few years in the fintech sector has translated into measurable results for Indonesians in search of greater financial inclusion. According to data compiled by OJK, the aggregate amount for loans in Indonesia from the fintech lending in May 2020 increased 166.03% year-on-year. OJK estimated there were more than 25 million borrower accounts, while there were more than 654,200 entities offering loans.

Meanwhile, for fintech payments, the total number of e-money transactions at the end of 2019 reached 5.2 billion, an increase of 79.3% from the previous year’s 2.9 billion transactions, according to BI’s statistics. The total nominal value of transactions reached IDR 145 trillion (USD 10 billion) last year, which was three times higher than 2018’s total amount of IDR 47 trillion (USD 3.2 billion).

This surge can largely be attributed to an influx of players exploring various fintech verticals in Indonesia. In addition to lending and payment companies, who currently dominate the country’s fintech landscape, more players from other segments like remittance, investment, and insurance have emerged in the last two years.

Investment in Indonesian fintech startups in 2020 remains healthy despite the COVID-19 crisis that has gripped the globe since the beginning of the year. Some of the companies that received new funding this year are P2P lender Investree (USD 23.5 million), SME-focused lender Akselaran (USD 8.5 million), and insurtech platform Qoala (USD 13.5 million).

The crisis could be a catalyst for fintech development in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, just as the SARS epidemic in 2003 hastened China’s launching of digital payments and e-commerce. Since Indonesia’s government forced people to limit physical interactions and remain confined in their residences for around three months, mobile wallet platforms like Ovo and GoPay saw an increase in traffic and new users.

The Indonesian fintech lending association (AFPI) also recorded surging demand for productive financing, especially from SMEs that need to keep their businesses afloat as the pandemic rages on.

Chinese entrance into the Indonesian market

Indonesia’s burgeoning fintech industry is attracting Chinese investors and fintech companies alike. Alibaba’s financial arm Ant Financial backs one of the country’s biggest mobile wallet platforms, Dana. In Alibaba-like fashion, Dana rapidly acquired market share in part thanks to partnerships with major e-commerce players Bukalapak and Lazada.

Moreover, Jakarta-headquartered lending firm Akulaku told KrASIA that it has raised USD 89 million from Ant Financial in 2018. Akulaku itself was founded by Chinese entrepreneur William Li, who is a former investment manager at Ping An Insurance Company, one of China’s largest insurers.

Another startup founded by a Chinese technopreneur is Oriente. Headquartered in Hong Kong, Oriente was founded by Hubert Tai, former CEO and CTO of Chinese financial product marketplace Lufax, along with co-founders Geoff Prentice and Lawrence Chu.

Oriente has a presence in three Southeast Asian markets—Finmas in Indonesia, a joint venture with Sinar Mas; Cashalo in collaboration with JG Summit Holdings in the Philippines; and Finizi in Vietnam. The firm is taking a leaf from Lufax’s playbook by teaming up with established businesses instead of entering the market solo.

The firm works with several Southeast Asian conglomerates such as Berjaya Group, JG Summit Holdings, and Sinar Mas to boost penetration by providing affordable financial products to the growing middle class in the markets they operate.

Meanwhile, Alibaba’s archival Tencent, as well as Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, invested in GoPay’s parent company Gojek in 2017.

A number of Chinese tech giants also have fintech subsidiaries in Indonesia. This includes Xiaomi’s financial division, Mi Credit; JD finance from JD.id; and OneConnect Indonesia, which is a subsidiary of Ping An Group, a Chinese insurance company and consumer financing provider.

Chinese companies’ influence on Indonesia’s fintech landscape goes beyond investment. According to a 2019 fintech lending report conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Indonesia, fintech lending in Indonesia is often compared to China. Indonesia has similar macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions that are comparable to the widespread popularization of China’s fintech industry which began in earnest in 2013.

Nonetheless, there are always a few bad apples in every bunch. After Chinese regulators clamped down on a host of irresponsible online P2P platforms in 2017, many of these malicious firms were forced to explore new markets to find users. Quickly identifying Indonesia as an optimal expansion destination targeting a growing digital-native and mobile-first generation of young urban Indonesians with growing incomes, these unlicensed Chinese P2P players flooded the Indonesian market. In 2018, OJK revealed the existence of more than 100 unlicensed Chinese P2P providers in Indonesia.

Underserved populations, especially in rural areas where financial literacy rates are low, are particularly more susceptible to fraud and false advertising from bad actors.

To curb the mushrooming of illegal lenders, the OJK is collaborating with national police, cyber patrol, and the communication ministry to identify illegal lenders and warn people about them. As a result, the authority has blocked nearly 2,600 illegal fintech lenders in the past three years.

Similar fintech futures?

Even though the Chinese and Indonesian markets share numerous similarities, fintech companies in these countries have different approaches and business models. Chinese fintech firms focus more on short-term consumer loans, targeting hundreds of millions of low-income individuals who do not have credit cards. On the other hand, Indonesia fintech has a more balanced mix, as it focuses on both underserved individuals and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

Given its head start, China’s fintech sector is significantly more developed than Indonesia’s, providing a glimpse into trends and consumer preferences that may materialize in Southeast Asia in the future. China’s current status in fintech development is defined by a prevalence of mutual aid products, growing adoption of wealth management products, and microloans.

To differing degrees, Indonesian fintech players have taken some inspiration from China but have also localized their services to fit the Indonesian market.

Mutual aid

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand in China for mutual aid programs, viewed as a more affordable alternative to conventional healthcare insurance, has soared. Indonesia is also no stranger to the concept of mutual aid, or gotong-royong. Self-organized mutual aid groups are common in Indonesia, particularly in neighborhood communities and workers’ unions in the informal sector.

This propensity toward mutual aid also helped drive the rapid growth and popularity of digital crowdfunding platforms like Kitabisa, demonstrating the spirit of solidarity shared by Indonesians. According to an insurance tech report by CB Insights, more insurance business models from the US and China will land in Indonesia, and this may lead to the development of new mutual aid platforms.

Insurance penetration in Indonesia is very low, running at less than 3% of the total population. Digital insurance is still in its infancy, but has a promising future as more big tech companies like Gojek and Ovo are making moves in this segment too.

height=""278"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" data-ytbridge=""vidSurrogate2""> ﻿

Wealth management

Indonesia has a robust middle class that is accumulating disposable income, leading to booming demand for wealth management products. In China, Ant Group’s Yu’e Bao money market fund and Ant Fortune’s various wealth management products offer Chinese users convenient access to financial options and have gained huge popularity.

Many of these wealth management platforms utilize robo-advisory services to make data-driven lending decisions and streamline the investment management process.

While this segment is still relatively immature in Indonesia, some firms successfully raised capital from big-name investors last year. Among them is Ajaib, which bagged USD 2.1 million from several investors including SoftBank Ventures, and Halofina that raised seed investment from Mandiri Capital, a corporate venture capital firm of state-owned Bank Mandiri. Other startups offering wealth management services are Ant Group-backed Akulaku and Moduit.

As the mass-affluent class in Indonesia is expected to increase by 8% per year from 2017 through 2030, more fintech companies are expected to tap the Indonesian wealth management market in years to come.

Consumer credit

Chinese fintech giant Ant Group’s Huabei Credit program allows users up to USD 7 in monthly credit, enabling them to purchase slightly beyond their means with no-interest installment repayments. Indonesia too has a burgeoning e-commerce sector that has increased the adoption of accompanying financial products, including business loans for MSMEs.

Indonesia’s fintech also has a similar product called “pay-later” that gives customers credit up to a limit, allowing them to shop or make transactions and pay down their balance over time. Pay-later functions as a substitute for credit cards, which are often seen as a luxury among Indonesian consumers.

The product started to take off last year, as it gained popularity quickly due to its flexibility, smaller installments, and affordable interest rates. According to Daily Social’s Indonesian Fintech Report 2019, it was the third most popular fintech product in Indonesia last year after mobile wallets and online investments. Today, nearly all major mobile wallets and their e-commerce partners, as well as online travel agency apps, have this feature on their platforms.

Despite the potential of Indonesia’s developing fintech ecosystem, the availability of these products is still concentrated in the country’s more urban and developed centers. To truly unleash the democratizing power of fintech in Indonesia, companies, and regulators must work together to reach underpenetrated rural areas.

In the second part of this series, we will look at fintech’s role in driving financial inclusion in Indonesia, particularly in the country’s rural areas.

Shops and cafes that are still showing considerable bruises from the Covid-19 lockdown have been forced to close once again to repair the damage.

This is the third time in almost 11 years the town has been hit by major flooding, with it also being badly affected in 2009 and 2012.

I estimate we’ve lost about £15,000. We still haven’t got flood cover as no one will cover us.”

Lorraine Watson, Carron Fish Bar

Lorraine Watson, owner of the Carron Fish Bar on Allardice Street, said the premises would be closed for at least two weeks due to damage caused by flooding.

She said: “I think the flooding has been bad as no one was informed, no flood defences were up and flood volunteers weren’t contacted.

“There was all these people coming down to the river to have a look, the police closed the area and said it was an emergency zone.

“I estimate we’ve lost about £15,000. We still haven’t got flood cover as no one will cover us.

“It’s just dreadful. It’s just myself and my husband and our manager until we get the basement cleared.

“Everything’s had to be chucked out, we had freezers floating in the water.

“The water was right up to the bridge on the River Carron.

“I’m probably looking at two weeks being closed. We had orders booked in that we had to phone and cancel.”

Suzanne MacLeod, who works at the Farmfoods on the corner of Barclay Street and Cameron Street, said even arriving to work in the morning was a challenge.

She said: “As you were coming down the road, it was almost like a tide – you could feel that strong current coming down. It was really strong, it got to the point where I had to hold onto the side.

“Once I got down in front of the shop, on the road it was about thigh high. Outside the shop, it was about waist high once you step onto the steps.”

She added: “We’re in the process of mopping up.

“Some of our roof tiles came in, but the back was a lot worse.

“We’ve had to get guys out to look at the freezers, and some of the freezers have actually been condemned because the water’s got in and broken them.”

Phil Mills-Bishop, chairperson of the Stonehaven Twinning Group and former chairperson of the local community council, said: “The initial downpour in the early morning was a nightmare, a lot of flash flooding around.

“A lot of the shops are closed because of water damage, but there’s a resilience there, although people are really fed up.

“I’ve been speaking to one or two people – it’s not just Covid, now it’s natural disasters and we’ve got the lockdown in Aberdeen.

“If you’re given hard times, if you get through it, you come out stronger at the other end. I think there is a resilience in Stonehaven, but it’s just a pity that we have to continue to go through these experiences.”

West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie visited the town this morning alongside local councillor Wendy Agnew.

They surveyed the damage caused, to both businesses and properties as well as the River Carron’s flood defences.

Mr Bowie said: “I’m here speaking to the local teams involved in responding to a dangerous situation.

“Thankfully the water is receding but it was a grim sight this morning.

“It’s been a number of years since we saw Stonehaven so badly hit by flooding, possibly as far back as Storm Frank.

“This is the last thing residents need. It’s imperative local businesses get the help they need to get back on their feet.”

The Stonehaven Flood Protection Scheme (FPS) is currently in the process of being constructed, as the town has historically suffered from flooding which has affected residents and businesses in the lower reach of the River Carron.

Major flooding events have occurred in the area over the years, however most notably in 1988, 1995, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2012, which have seen residents evacuated.

The FPS is aimed to reduce flood risk to 372 residential properties, two public utility sites, a school and an emergency service site, and is being carried out by contractors McLaughlin and Harvey Ltd.

Once completed, it will provide a 0.5% chance of occurrence standard of protection.

It involves removing, replacing and raising the Red Bridge and Green Bridge, repositioning the Green Bridge, removing, refurbishing and replacing the White Bridge in a raised position, replacing the Bridgefield Bridge parapet with reinforced glass, raising and widening the Beach Bridge, constructing flood walls between the Red Bridge and the river mouth and removing the island downstream of the Green Bridge.

It will also install two higher capacity culverts on the Glaslaw Burn, a new culvert under the gardens of Cameron Street as well as a new pedestrian walkway from Bridgefield Bridge to the Beach Bridge.

Work was temporarily stopped earlier this year due to coronavirus. It was originally due to be finished by spring, however due to Covid-19 and other issues, no new date has been set.

A statement from contractors McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd, said: “In response to the significant flood events on the River Carron this morning, the project team are working closely with the emergency services and assisting where possible.

“A site-wide clear up will commence once the situation improves and to ensure security. All affected residents have been contacted and assistance offered by the Project Community Liaison Officer.”

Meanwhile, up the coast in Newtonhill, local councillor Ian Mollison spent the day surveying the damage.

He said: “I’ve never seen rain like it. It was, to use a Scottish word, stoating down.

“I heard from some villagers that there had been landslides on the cliffs above Newtonhill beach, so I went down to have a look and two gardens have lost a bit of ground, it’s all slipped down towards the beach.

“Two landslides there, across the main path which goes from the village down to the beach, quite remarkable.

“Plus, the Elsick Burn which feeds into Newtonhill Bay – I’ve never seen it so high, and I’ve been here forty-odd years.

“It was hard enough for school kids going back to school for the first time today since March, all geared up for it, and then it’s a washout – literally.”

Across Aberdeenshire, a number of schools were closed due to flooding either in the school or around the area.

These included Portlethen Academy, Dunnottar School, Mill O’Forest School, Mearns Academy, Rothienorman School, Mackie Academy, Glenbervie School, Carronhill School, Hillside School, Banchory-Devenick School, Peterhead Central School, Johnshaven School, Lairhillock School and Laurencekirk School.

Portlethen School was also shut due to internal water supply failure.

Bervie School delayed its opening time to 9.30am to allow staff to travel to school, with no school transport operating, while Buchanhaven Primary School delayed all its opening times by an hour and Fishermoss School postponed its opening until 10am.

Transport was also delayed at Alford Academy and The Gordon Schools due to faults, meanwhile Catterline School’s transport was not running although the school was open, pupils were asked only to travel in if it was safe to do so.","Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/08/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-12-at-10.17.40-2.jpeg,"['street', 'school', 'flood', 'local', 'coronavirus', 'closed', 'bridge', 'lockdown', 'left', 'stonehaven', 'water', 'shaken', 'devastated', 'northeast', 'flooding', 'businesses', 'river']",

Linkedin Dylan Collins and Maya Gebeily (Agence France-Presse) Beirut, Lebanon ● Thu, August 6, 2020 13:15 300 6657ac82168da9fa101c8a4066bff28d 2 World Lebanon,Lebanese,Beirut,blast,explosion,anti-government Free

In Beirut's beloved bar districts, hundreds of young Lebanese ditched beers for brooms on Wednesday to sweep debris in the absence of a state-sponsored cleanup operation following a deadly blast.

""What state?"" scoffed 42-year-old Melissa Fadlallah, a volunteer cleaning up the hard-hit Mar Mikhail district of the Lebanese capital.

The explosion, which hit just a few hundred meters away at Beirut's port, blew all the windows and doors off Mar Mikhail's pubs, restaurants and apartment homes on Tuesday.

By Wednesday, a spontaneous cleanup operation was underway there, a glimmer of youthful solidarity and hope after a devastating night.

Wearing plastic gloves and a mask, Fadlallah tossed a shard of glass as long as her arm at the door of the state electricity company's administrative building that looms over the district.

""For me, this state is a dump -- and on behalf of yesterday's victims, the dump that killed them is going to stay a dump,"" she told AFP.

The blast killed more than 110 people, wounded thousands and compounded public anger that erupted in protests last year against a government seen as corrupt and inefficient.

""We're trying to fix this country. We've been trying to fix it for nine months but now we're going to do it our way,"" said Fadlallah.

""If we had a real state, it would have been in the street since last night cleaning and working. Where are they?""

'Even a smile'

A few civil defense workers could be seen examining building structures but they were vastly outnumbered by young volunteers flooding the streets to help.

In small groups, they energetically swept up glass beneath blown-out buildings, dragging them into plastic bags.

Others clambered up debris-strewn stairwells to offer their homes to residents who had spent the previous night in the open air.

""We're sending people into the damaged homes of the elderly and handicapped to help them find a home for tonight,"" said Husam Abu Nasr, a 30-year-old volunteer.

""We don't have a state to take these steps, so we took matters into our own hands,"" he said.

Towns across the country have offered to host Beirut families with damaged homes and the Maronite Catholic patriarchate announced it would open its monasteries and religious schools to those needing shelter.

Food was quickly taken care of, too: plastic tables loaded with donated water bottles, sandwiches and snacks were set up within hours.

""I can't help by carrying things, so we brought food, water, chocolate and moral support,"" said Rita Ferzli, 26.

""I think everyone should be here helping, especially young people. No one should be sitting at home -- even a smile is helping right now.""

'This is it'

Business owners swiftly took to social media, posting offers to repair doors, paint damaged walls or replace shattered windows for free.

Abdo Amer, who owns window company Curtain Glass, said he was moved to make such an offer after narrowly surviving the blast.

""I had driven by the port just three minutes earlier,"" the 37-year-old said.

He offered to replace windows for half the price, but said he was fixing some for free given the devastating situation for many families following the Lebanese currency's staggering devaluation in recent months.

""I've gotten more than 7,000 phone calls today and I can't keep up,"" said the father of four.

""You think the state will take up this work? Actually, let them step down and leave.""

Outrage at the government was palpable among volunteers, many of whom blamed government officials for failing to remove explosive materials left at the port for years.

""They're all sitting in their chairs in the AC while people are wearing themselves out in the street,"" said Mohammad Suyur, 30, as he helped sweep on Wednesday.

""The last thing in the world they care about is this country and the people who live in it.""

He said activists were preparing to reignite the protest movement that launched in October.

""We can't bear more than this. This is it. The whole system has got to go,"" he said.","Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/05/2020_08_05_101757_1596610524._large.jpg,"['plastic', 'windows', 'lebanese', 'rage', 'young', 'dump', 'solidarity', 'glass', 'homes', 'state', 'damaged', 'port']",

Flood remains in Natore, Manikganj, Rajbari and Faridpur although the situation may improve in the next 24 hours

The Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) has said that the flood situation remains unchanged in four districts as of Tuesday morning.

According to the flood forecast of 9am, flood remains in Natore, Manikganj, Rajbari and Faridpur although the situation may improve in the next 24 hours.

However, many structures and roads of the districts of the central region including Munshiganj and Gopalganj still remain under water.

Ariffuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of FFWC said they are the result of water logging.

“Flood water and water logging is a different issue. Flood water has been cleared away from 99% of the country. The places where people are suffering are from water logging, not from flood water,” he said.

“Most probably from tomorrow (Wednesday) we will not forecast flood considering river water level, thus the forecast will be more concise,” he said.

Currently, water levels of six rivers and canals are flowing above the danger line at seven different points across the country. The Gur river is flowing above the danger level at Singra point, Dhaleswari at Elasin and at Jagir, Turag at Mirpur, Tongi Khal at Tongi, Kaliganga at Taraghat, and Padma at Goalundo.

These rivers were flowing 4cm to 27cm above the danger line at 9am Tuesday and water levels are decreasing at all points.

“We consider areas where big rivers flow above the danger mark as flood affected. Small rivers do not have much influence. That is why we are not identifying Dhaka and Tangail as flood affected districts.

According to the forecast of 9am, water level of Ganges and Padma rivers are falling, and that will continue for the next 48 hours. Water levels of the rivers surrounding Dhaka are also in a decreasing trend, and that will continue for the next 24 hours.

Water level of all the rivers of the Meghna basin except Kushiara is falling , which will continue for the next 24 hours.

Meanwhile, water levels of the Brahmaputra are rising while that of the Jamuna are falling. The rising trend of the Brahmaputra may continue for 48 hours while the Jamuna may keep stable in the next 24 hours.

7 die in 5 districts

The Health Directorate (DGHS) said the floods claimed the lives of seven people in five districts in 24 hours till Tuesday noon, UNB reports.

With the latest ones, the death toll from the flood reached 198.

Seven people drowned in floodwaters in Kishoreganj, Gazipur, Dhaka, Lalmonirhat, and Tangail districts on Tuesday.

Three people drowned in floodwaters in Kishoreganj district alone while one each in the rest four districts, according to the DGHS.

Flood Situation

In Rajshahi, the flood situation has improved. However, a block was dislocated from under the Shaharraksha Dam in front of the police line, resulting in part of the dam to collapse.

Asif Ahmed, sub-divisional engineer of the Water Development Board, said geo-bags are being dumped directly into the Padma river to strengthen the bottom of the dam.

In Munshiganj, the flood situation has improved as water levels continue to fall in both the Padma and the Dhaleshwari rivers.

On Tuesday morning, the water levels at Mawa point was 5.93 metres which was 17cm below the danger level and at Vaggokul point it was 6.18 metres which was 12cm below the danger level. On the other side, the water level of Dhaleshwari river at Rikabibazar point was 4.53 metres which was 65cm under the danger level.

So far, 200,000 people of 319 villages of the district have been marooned by flood.

In Jessore, crops of about 400 hectares of land in six unions in the southern part of Sharsha upazila have been submerged in the upper reaches of the Indian Ichamati river.

The beel areas of Kayaba, Goga, Bagamchara, Ulshi and Putkhali Union in the south have been submerged and the crops have been washed away.

In Tangail, the flood situation has improved further. However, the water of two rivers in the district is still flowing over the danger line.

The floods have so far affected more than 600,000 people in the district, inundating 18,000 hectares of cropland.

According to local sources, 18 people, including children, have drowned in the flood waters in different parts of the district so far.

In Gopalganj, 17,308 families from 313 villages of 5 upazilas have been trapped in the floods. So far, 3,360 people from 657 families have taken shelter in 103 shelters.

Gopalganj district Fisheries Officer Biswajit Bairagi said at least Tk16 crore worth of fish had been washed away from enclosures in the district, affecting some 5,000 fish farmers.

In Madaripur, flood waters of Shibchar, Rajoir, Madaripur Sadar and Kalkini upazilas have been decreasing consistently for the last four to five days.

At least 48 unions and one municipality of the district have been inundated by the flood waters.

Water levels of different rivers in the district have been decreasing by an average of 6cm to 8cm per day.

In Kurigram, although water has receded in most areas, the residents are in dire straits with their houses destroyed by mud and flood waters. They are also suffering from a shortage of food due to insufficient relief distribution.

The district is also undergoing a crisis in medical services. Although the health department has claimed to form 85 medical teams to combat the crisis, the public has complained that they are not receiving enough healthcare services.

In Narayanganj, the water of Buriganga and Dhaleshwari rivers saw a sharp rise and flooded different low-lying areas along the riverbanks in Fatulla, UNB reports.

Houses, roads and business establishments in Boktaboli, Kashipur and Enayetnagar Unions have been damaged by floodwater, causing untold sufferings to thousands of people.

Besides, the DND Dam area in Fatulla goes under water even after a moderate rain. People have to commute through knee-to-waist deep water, said locals.

According to the Upazila administration, around 350 dwellings have been inundated in Enayetnagar while 300 in Kashipur and 200 houses in Boktaboli unions.

Nahida Barik, Narayanganj Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer, said the water in the Buriganga and Dhaleshwari rivers started surging from Wednesday last.

“We’ve talked to the affected families. They’ve provided with food items,” she said, adding that a shelter centre has been opened at a primary school for the flood victims.

Meanwhile, a declining trend of water was recorded at all the four points of the Ganges River and at many other points of Padma River this morning, superintending engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Mukhlesur Rahman said, reports BSS.

The Ganges River was flowing 173 cm, 188 cm, 113 cm, and 105 cm below the danger levels at Pankha, Rajshahi, Hardinge Bridge, and Talbaria points respectively, while the Padma River was flowing four cm above the danger mark with a four cm fall at Goalundo point, he added.

Water levels of the Korotoa River and the Jamuna River under the Brahmaputra basin flowing through Bogra and Sirajganj were reported a falling trend at all five points of the two rivers this morning.

Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, FFWC executive engineer, said a stable situation is expected within 10 to 12 days since there is no possibility of any new flooding during the current monsoon.

Of the total 101 river points monitored in the country, water levels went up at 27 stations, while decreased at 72 stations and remained stable at two points.","Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/08/watermarked/338826/1597165851899kurigram-flood-aftermath-1597142636128.jpg,"['flood', 'die', 'levels', 'level', '24', 'hrs', 'points', 'rivers', 'danger', 'water', 'district', 'districts', 'situation', 'remains', 'river']",

MANILA: The Philippines is inoculating the highest number of people against COVID-19 every day, topping the list of major ASEAN nations with its vaccination program, Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr., the country’s vaccine chief, has said.

In his presentation, made during President Rodrigo Duterte’s address to the nation late on Monday night, Galvez added that the Philippines had crossed the five million mark of COVID-19 vaccines administered on Friday, in line with the government’s ambitious mass immunization program.

“We’ve tripled our outputs in March and April, where we vaccinated only one million in 40 days. Now . . . even before May ended, we have vaccinated three million (people),” Galvez said, adding that the Philippines had posted a one-million-per-week vaccination rate for two consecutive weeks.

As of May 30, a total of 5,180,721 doses had been administered. Of these, 3,974,350 people have received the first dose, while 1,206,371 have been vaccinated with both doses.

This equates to more than one million people who had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, he said.

“The Philippines has achieved the highest output . . . among the five largest ASEAN countries,” he said, referring in part to Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

“That means we have the most number of jabs given each day . . . We have surpassed Thailand and Indonesia in terms of jabs per day,” he said.

According to official data, he said, the government now administers up to 150,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine daily.

Galvez said they also “expect the country’s vaccine supply to stabilize by July,” as the COVAX facility — a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines — has committed to providing a steady supply of more than two million doses every month.

He also discussed US President Joe Biden’s decision to share 80 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with other countries, with the Philippines marked as one of its top-priority recipients.

The business sector, Galvez said, was also ready and committed to manufacturing more vaccines.

“The number of operational vaccination sites is based on the current supply of vaccines in the country. Once additional supplies arrive, the number of active sites will increase, and our vaccination pace will ramp up,” Galvez said.

He said that the government aimed to increase its daily vaccinations to 500,000 a day in the third quarter of 2021 and then to 740,000 vaccine shots daily by the fourth quarter to reach herd immunity targets.

On Tuesday, Galvez said in a forum that the Philippine government continues to recalibrate its strategies to address vaccine hesitancy among Filipinos and is working closely with the private sector in developing a post-COVID-19 strategy to protect more lives and fast-track the nation’s economic recovery.

“From targeting individuals, we are now shifting our focus to families, which is the foundation of our society. We believe that word-of-mouth from trusted family members could help to positively influence the general public’s perception about our vaccination program,” he said.","Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2020/08/06/2219236-1974201367.jpg,"['foreign', 'doses', 'vaccinated', 'hits', 'dirty', 'vaccination', 'number', 'covid19', 'floods', 'philippines', 'president', 'opposition', 'vaccines', 'tricks', 'capital', 'belarus', 'vaccine', 'galvez', 'million']",

Bengaluru, Aug 06: Battered by torrential rains, several parts of Karnataka are facing a flood-like situation for the third consecutive year, putting lives and property at risk.

Several districts of the state's coastal, Malnad and north interior regions are receiving heavy rains and the showers are expected to continue, while there are reports of landslides in hilly areas of Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru districts.

With flood-like situation in several parts of the state, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, who is currently undergoing treatment for COVID-19 infection at a private hospital here, has ordered immediate release of Rs 50 crore for emergency relief.

""In wake of heavy rains in several parts of the state, I have instructed the Chief Secretary to review the situation and issued instructions to DCs (Deputy Commissioners) to closely monitor the situation & take necessary measures. Also ordered immediate release of Rs 50 crores for emergency relief purposes,"" he tweeted last night.

A statement released by the CMO on Thursday said, Yediyurappa has directed the district in-charge Ministers to take precautionary measures in the wake of heavy rainfall across the state.

He instructed the ministers to remain in their constituencies and tour the damaged areas and also directed them to undertake relief distribution and other necessary measures.

""Rs 50 crore has already been released and if necessary more funds would be released. The ministers can take decisions regarding emergency works,"" he added.

Revenue Minister R Ashoka said he had spoken to Deputy Commissioners of all the districts and given them necessary instructions to respond immediately to the situation.

He has called for a meeting of the disaster management authority later today.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said he will be holding a meeting with the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) regarding relief and rescue measures to be taken.

Parts of districts in coastal and Malnad regions are currently under red alert and rains are likely to continue there.

Officials said, ""... depending on the situation we will downgrade the alerts, it (rains) is likely to reduce during the next couple of days...wind speed is also high some parts, it may also reduce.""

In Kodagu district along with widespread rains, landslides have also occurred.

There have been landslides at Brahmagiri, near Talacauvery, the origin of river Cauvery.

""At least four to five people- including the Talacauvery temple priest and family are currently missing...

rescue teams have reached the spot,"" officials said, adding that sensing danger the priest had been asked to vacate the house earlier but he did not.

This is the third consecutive year that Kodagu is facing floods and landslides.

Several parts of north Karnataka, especially the border district of Belagavi are also facing flood situation as inflow has increased in Krishna river and its tributaries due to heavy rains in neighboring Maharashtra and also in the district.

With inflow increasing in Tungabhadra river, there is flood like situation in parts of Ballari district also.

There is a similar situation in Uttara Kannada district that is battered by rains and heavy winds.

The swollen Gangavali river has caused flood like situation in parts of the district.

Due to continuous rains in coastal and Malnad region several rivers including Netravati are swollen and gates of the dams have been opened.

There are also reports of heavy rains and wind causing destruction to crops in parts of Dharwad and Haveri among other districts.

The Karnataka government had recently said it has identified 1,989 villages and over 51 lakh people in 19 districts as flood prone.

As a temporary arrangement for those who will be affected by floods, as many as 1,747 relief centres have been identified- they are schools, anganwadi centres, community centres among others, Minister Ashoka had said recently.

In August 2019, Karnataka witnessed one of its worst natural calamities when heavy floods affected 103 taluks in 22 districts, killing more than 80 people and displacing nearly seven lakh people.

91,91,FF-2020-000179-IDN,Vietnam approves $9 billion development within mangrove reserve - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/08/vietnam-approves-9-billion-development-within-mangrove-reserve/,"Vietnam’s $9.3 billion Can Gio Tourist City was recently approved for construction within the buffer zone of a UNESCO Mangrove Biosphere Reserve in Ho Chi Minh City.

Developed by Vingroup, Vietnam’s largest private company, the project will require the reclamation of a huge amount of land along Can Gio’s coast.

Environmentalists and activists have petitioned the government to reconsider the project, but Vingroup is a key part of the country’s drive toward industrialization and home-grown world-class companies.

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — A $9.3 billion residential and tourism development has been approved within the buffer zone of the Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve here in this city of 13 million, Vietnam’s largest urban area. The project was proposed by the Can Gio Tourism Urban Area Joint Stock Company, a subsidiary of Vinhomes, the real estate arm of Vingroup, the country’s largest private company. The Can Gio Tourist City would span 2,870 hectares (7,100 acres), largely on land that would be filled in along the South China Sea coast using sand.

The 75,740-hectare (187,200-acre) reserve was established in 2000 and is overseen by a local management board. Home to one of the world’s largest rehabilitated mangrove forests, it protects the area from storm surges while also acting as a “green lung” for a heavily industrialized region.

The projected completion date for the Vinhomes development is 2031, when planners expect 230,000 people will live there long-term, and about 9 million tourists will come and go annually. In comparison, just over 70,000 people currently live in Can Gio (pronounced similarly to ‘yo’), the largest of Ho Chi Minh City’s 24 districts by area.

Tourism development in Can Gio has been relatively slow, as the region can only be reached by ferry, but construction of a huge bridge linking the district to the rest of Ho Chi Minh City is expected to begin in 2022, making it easier to reach.

The response to the approval of the “tourist city,” which was first proposed in 2000 but was stalled until Vinhomes took over the project, has been largely negative. The company increased its original planned size from 821 hectares (2,030 acres) to 2,870 hectares.

In early July, 23 prominent environmentalists, academics and researchers sent a petition calling for an independent assessment of the project to Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, the legislative National Assembly, and other government bodies. It is rare for Vingroup to be publicly criticized in Vietnam, as the company is known to react aggressively to such complaints.

An English-language version of the petition shared with Mongabay says the planned development “poses a serious threat on the Can Gio mangrove forest, which in turn may lead to a series of harm to the urban regions of HCMC, whose population and authority are already facing major environmental challenges such as pollution, floods and land collapses.”

The petition is now online, in both English and Vietnamese, and had been signed by more than 5,900 people at the time of writing. It adds that the project poses huge threats related to erosion, flooding and water stagnation, all of which could have serious environmental and social impacts, while also threatening the integrity of Can Gio’s unique, important mangrove ecosystem.

The Nikkei Asia Review reports that 138 million cubic meters (4.9 billion cubic feet) of sand would be needed to reclaim land for the project. Some media reports have said this sand would be dredged from the nearby Mekong Delta, which is already facing serious subsidence due to sand mining and a loss of sediment caused by upstream dams. None of the activists contacted for this story would speak on the record, even anonymously, for fear of retaliation from Vingroup or the police. One environmentalist said they had been repeatedly harassed by the police for their outspoken criticism of the project on Facebook.

Vocal activists can face serious consequences for their actions here. In 2017, an environmental blogger known as Mother Mushroom was sentenced to 10 years in prison for “conducting propaganda against the state” following a major environmental disaster. She was eventually released early and now lives in exile in Houston.

Vingroup did not respond to requests for comment on the project.

While detailed plans of Can Gio Tourist City aren’t public, one satellite rendering shared widely on social media shows a huge stretch of land, including a large artificial lake, tacked on to the southern end of Can Gio, where the district meets the East Sea, as the South China Sea is known here.

This means there would not be construction within the heavily restricted core area of the mangrove biosphere reserve.

However, it is a delicate ecosystem.

“Mangroves in general are highly sensitive to changes in hydrology and sedimentation,” said Marie Arnaud, a research fellow at the University of Birmingham who has conducted extensive research on Can Gio. “For example, if you decrease sediment supply, then you might have erosion of the mangrove’s land, which can cause mangrove loss. It has been observed in many parts of the world, mostly due to upstream sand mining, but it has also been observed from areas which have been dredged.”

The Vinhomes development would be downstream from the mangroves, but it is not clear where the sand used to reclaim land will come from. Adding thousands of hectares of land just a few miles from the reserve will have an impact.

“If they dredge sand to create land or build, they’ll hurt the sedimentation and the hydrology of the mangroves,” Arnaud said. “Then, those buildings are static, while normally this area is quite dynamic. This means that there will be sand accumulation in some spots, but also places where the soil will be eroded because the dynamic is moving.”

Some supporters of the plan have noted that it will not be located within the mangrove reserve’s core, but Marc Goichot, WWF freshwater lead for Asia Pacific, says this doesn’t mean it makes sense.

“If it’s closer to the coast, it’s not necessarily better because again, it’s dynamic,” he said. “If the area is a marsh or partially or completely on the water, then they’re going to dredge material out from the riverbed, which will starve the coast of its replacement sediment and put at risk the entire existing system.”

He went on: “Even if they bring material in from far away, which they probably won’t because it would be expensive, then you’re burying the area and changing the ecosystem completely, and the dynamic of currents and the movement of nutrients.”

This would impact fisheries and aquatic life in the area. The huge number of people that the Can Gio Tourist City would attract, meanwhile, will also create problems.

“This might induce pressure on local fish, crabs and bivalves,” Arnaud said. “People from [central] Ho Chi Minh City like to go to Can Gio to eat seafood because it’s cheaper, but if so many come it might really decrease the density of the fauna. And if people are not sensible, you’ll have a lot of plastic pollution, and possibly sewage runoff as well.”

Then there is the placement of the development, directly on the coast.

“This project will be high-risk,” Arnaud added. “With climate change, you have storms that are becoming more frequent and stronger, you have sea level rise, and this touristic spot will be at the front of all of this.”

The resulting landslide buried homes of several workers in the hillside's debris – several children were among the victims.

It was the latest monsoon-related disaster that has taken at least 150 lives in India, where environmentalists say climate change has altered the pattern of the monsoon season – it now brings short, intense bursts of rain instead of the steady showers that historically rejuvenated soil from June to September.

Rescuers work at the site of a mudslide triggered by heavy monsoon rain in Idukki district, in the southern Indian state of Kerala, Aug. 7, 2020.

In the north and east of the country, an estimated 8 million grappled with a trail of destruction as swollen rivers inundated vast swaths of farmland and villages, destroying thatched homes and crops in two of India's poorest states, Assam and Bihar.

Among those who saw their land disappear under water was Raj Kumar, who travels every summer from New Delhi, where he works as a driver, to sow his fields in a village in Bihar. His 1-hectare plot of land that he planted with rice in early July was flooded with 6 feet of water after the nearby river overran its banks.

""My entire crop is lost. It is the second year this has happened,"" the distraught Kumar said, blaming a nearby road that he said was built on land that had acted as a buffer between his fields and the river.

The devastation did not spare neighboring countries. In Bangladesh, nearly one-fourth of the low-lying country was inundated last month, while mountainous Nepal is coping with landslides and flash floods. Along with India, the toll from flooding in the three countries is more than 400.

Wildlife was not spared. In India's northeastern state of Assam, eight rare one-horned rhinos were among the 100 wild animals that drowned as overflowing rivers raced through the famed Kaziranga wildlife sanctuary last month.

Environmentalists say large-scale flooding has become a regular feature in South Asia in recent years as rising temperatures increase the number of ""extreme rainfall events.""

""If you have more than 100 millimeters of rainfall within 24 hours, it is called an extreme rainfall event, but the problem is that we are getting 100 millimeters of rainfall within an hour now,"" said Chandra Bhushan, who heads the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology in New Delhi.

""Even the definition of extreme rainfall events will have to change considering the quantity of rain, the intensity of rainfall we are experiencing now,"" he said.

Although the floods affected or displaced millions, in a country badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic it was not easy to provide relief.

""It is a crisis within a crisis,"" according to Tritha Prasad Saikia, the joint director of the Assam-based North East Area Affected Development Society, a voluntary group that helps vulnerable communities.

""This year due to the lockdown transportation, communication, accessing markets to procure relief items, and gathering funds from big organizations, have all been difficult,"" Saikia said.

People drive through a flooded street during heavy rains in Mumbai, India, August 4, 2020.

India's mega cities have not been spared the consequences of the changing monsoon pattern. Vehicles in Mumbai were submerged and people waded through knee-deep water when the heaviest rain in a single day in 15 years lashed the city earlier this month. It did not take its 12 million residents by surprise – streets turning into rivulets has become a familiar pattern every monsoon.

Experts say unsustainable development has intensified the problem caused by heavy deluges. A huge influx of people into cities during the last three decades has led to unregulated construction – buildings have mushroomed along wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainfall.

""In cities like in Mumbai there are a number of streams or small rivers called the 'nullahs.' But all these have been heavily encroached,"" said T.I. Eldho who heads the Civil Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai.

""So what happens is that all the traditional outlets for water have been drastically decreased,"" he said.

Eldho, who has studied urban flooding, cites a prime commercial and residential complex in the Bandra-Kurla, built in the Mumbai neighborhood by reclaiming low-lying land on either side of a river. Environmentalists say it has worsened the city's drainage woes.

Environmentalists say much of India's urbanization is happening on areas unsuitable for construction, such as flood plains.

The floods are costly catastrophes – they have caused $50 billion in economic losses in the last three decades, according to an Asian Development Bank study.

""If you account for total natural disasters that have happened and extent of loss and damage, then floods rank on top,"" said Abinash Mohanty at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in New Delhi.

He points to a World Bank study that concluded that between 1970 and 2009, floods were responsible for two-thirds of losses from natural disasters in India.

Experts say in the short term, India must ensure timely warnings to allow people to prepare for flooding.

In the long run, though, it must quickly implement measures to protect traditional drainage areas along riverfronts and rejuvenate lakes and swamps that have been built over in cities.

""The amount of money that we require to protect the environment is far lesser than the money we are losing because of these incidents,"" Bhushan said.

The starting point, he said, is ""recognizing that there is a problem.""

""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""governments and people have got too used to this.""

Environmentalists warn that if calls for more sustainable development are not heeded, scenes of large-scale inundation and loss of lives could recur with depressing regularity extracting their heaviest toll on the poorest communities.

On Sunday, although Jamuna has been swelling, the water level of the Brahmaputra showed a declining trend.

The overall flood situation worsened in Jamalpur, as heavy showers on hilly terrain, upstream of Bangladesh, led the Jamuna to swell once again from Sunday.

Currently 1,000,000 people remain marooned in seven upazilas of the district. Food and drinking water shortages continue to be a problem for locals amid the one month and six day long flood.

The five main rivers and their estuaries continued to flow above the danger line until Sunday afternoon and market places, cattle grazing fields, and houses have remained inundated.

The flood-affected people continued to remain unemployed. Their domestic animals became leaner, and they were unable to operate their shops, and the farmed fishes were also washed away.

On Sunday, although Jamuna has been swelling, the water level of the Brahmaputra showed a declining trend.

Md Abu Sayeed, executive engineer of Jamalpur Water Development Board (WDB) said Jamuna had been flowing 56cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad ghat point, while the Brahmaputra had been flowing 41cm below the danger mark until 5pm on Sunday.

Hilly terrain, upstream of Bangladesh, may face another heavy shower due to which the flood situation may worsen further in the district, engineer Abu added.

The district's relief and rehabilitation officer Nayeb Ali said Tk8 lakh in cash, 200 tons of rice, and 4,000 packets of dry food were newly allocated for the flood affected people. Since the beginning of the flood a total of 1284 tons of rice, Tk3,450,000 in cash, and 11,000 packets of dry food were distributed among the victims.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/06/watermarked/338004/1596461612923jamalpur-flood-pic-2-28-6-1593445404091.jpg,"['flood', 'worsens', 'jamuna', 'food', 'danger', 'brahmaputra', 'water', 'upstream', 'jamalpur', 'situation', 'tons']",

Mangroves absorb excess water but they are being destroyed in Mumbai in the guise of infrastructure development, city-based environmentalist Debi Goenka told PTI.

""Destruction of mangroves has definitely been one of the major causes of flooding, since the land reclaimed from mangroves is now blocking the rain water from flowing out into the sea. The capacity of mangroves to absorb flood water has also reduced,"" he said.

The biggest problem today is that government agencies which are responsible for the protection of mangroves are busy ""destroying them in the guise of infrastructure development"", he claimed.

""To construct a road, transmission lines, or a freight corridor, the natural infrastructure - mangroves - provided to us free of cost by nature is being destroyed,"" he rued.

""We need to seriously review our priorities in this era of climate change, global warming and sea level rise. Do we need more roads or do we need to keep the mangroves intact?"" Goenka said.

Similar concerns have also been raised by agencies like the Mangrove Society of India (MSI), which in its 2019 report stated that 75 cases of mangrove destruction have been reported on Maharashtras coast line, of which the maximum share is of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

The society has been documenting and conducting various researches on mangroves since 1990 across the country.

""When it comes to destroying mangroves in the name of some development work, there is never an alternative or any plan to compensate it. The approach of the government or other agencies is- it's a waste land,"" an official from MSI said.

They completely ignore the fact that destruction of such land or the vegetation will have some consequences on our lives, the official said.

Town planner Sulakshana Mahajan said Mumbai does receive excess rains, but with some use of technology, solutions can be sought.

""Mangroves play a vital role in reducing floods and the corrosion of land from sea waves. But, someone needs to understand it and work accordingly, she said.

She said there is technology available which can simulate the impact of a proposed construction at a particular site and help in understanding possible problems it may lead to.

But, the government and political forces choose to ignore such approach and simply go ahead with constructions, she said.

Mangroves sequester carbon, provide oxygen, clean the sewage, absorb heavy metals, provide breeding grounds for fish and other biodiversity, and also protect the land from extreme climatic events. Can we afford to keep cutting our mangroves? I think not, Goenka said.

He said the damage being caused to the natural drainage systems, and ""ill-planned"" projects such as BRIMSTOWAD (Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal) are actually making the flood situation worse.

""The Bandra Kurla Complex is a classic example of what should never have been allowed,"" he added.

So much has happened in just eight months of 2020 that it’s become near impossible to keep track! Amidst battling a global pandemic, the world witnessed World War 3 scares, worldwide national disasters, and even Kanye running as president. In case you forgot what a rollercoaster this year was, here’s a summary of what’s happened in 2020 so far:

1. Australian Bushfires

Multiple states in Australia declared a state of emergency as the country was faced with one of the worst fires in history at the end of 2019. According to FOX10 Phoenix, the bushfires burned a record 47 million acres, displaced thousands of people and killed at least 34. Researchers said the fires also razed rare habitats and killed more than a billion animals.

2. World War 3 Fears

On 2 January, Iranian General, Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a US drone strike, sparking fears about World War 3 as tensions began to rise between Iran and America. Just a few days after the drone strike, US officials estimated that more than a dozen missiles were launched from Iran on two military bases in Iraq housing American soldiers, which only aggravated war suspicions.

3. Covid-19 declared a worldwide pandemic

When the virus broke out in December 2019, no one anticipated the impact it would have on the world. But when Covid-19 was officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March, people started getting a clearer picture of how severe this virus was here to stay. Back then, there were only 125,796 confirmed cases, 4,615 deaths, and 67,002 recoveries. As of now, there are over 20 million recorded coronavirus cases with 746,639 deaths.

4. Disasterous floods in Indonesia

On New Years Day, Jakarta faced devastating floods that wiped out 182 neighborhoods in the city’s greater area. The tragedy killed 66 people and forced almost 400,000 to flee their homes. Thousands of homes and buildings were submerged or wrecked, including the presidential palace. Even the city’s transport networks were paralysed. Sadly, many of the victims drowned or were buried by landslides. Others died of electric shocks and hypothermia.

5. Locust Swarms in Africa and Asia

Hundreds of billions of desert locusts attacked East Africa and South Asia in February 2020. BBC called it, “the worst infestation for a quarter of a century, threatening crops and livelihoods”. Just to so you know how devastating the impact of these locusts can be, a swarm containing 200 billion locusts was recorded in Kenya engulfed as much food as 84 million can eat in a day!

6. Volcano eruptions in Indonesia and the Philippines

On 13th January, red-hot lava gushed out of a volcano in the Philippines after a sudden eruption caused villagers to evacuate. Manilla’s international airport, schools and offices were ordered to close as clouds of ash blew more than 100 kilometers north.

Just two months after the incident, Mount Merapi, Indonesia’s most active volcano, erupted and caused authorities to go on high alert. The eruption spewed ash plumes as high as 6,000 meters above its peak, coating nearby communities with grey dust.

7. Kanye West Runs for President

Kanye West, rapper, millionaire, fashion designer, husband to Kim Kardashian, officially ran for President of The United States in July. The public figure took to Twitter to announce his plans to toss his hat in the ring for the 2020 election despite missing several key deadlines for election candidates. However, his emotional campaign rally in South Carolina that was held later that week prompted many to question his mental health and legitimacy as a running candidate.

8. Beirut Blast In Lebanon

A massive explosion took place on 4 August in Beirut, capital of Lebanon that has killed over 200 people so far. According to BBC, officials say highly explosive materials stored in a warehouse for six years could be the cause of the explosion. President Michel Aoun said in a Tweet that it was “unacceptable” that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored unsafely.

2020 is still far from over. Did we miss anything? Let us know what you think we should include in this list!

UPDATE: The Lehigh County Coroner has identified the woman who died in Tuesday’s flooding in Upper Saucon Township.

The flooding that resulted from Tropical Storm Isaias has claimed the life of a 44-year-old woman, authorities announced Tuesday evening.

According to published media reports, the woman was driving when she entered high water in the 6300 block of North Main Street in Upper Saucon Township and was swept downstream.

Lehigh Valley Live reported that the woman’s name is being withheld by the Lehigh County coroner’s office pending notification of her next of kin.

It was not immediately clear if the woman was alone in her vehicle at the time of the accident.

An autopsy has been scheduled to determine the cause of the woman’s death, and the Upper Saucon Township police department is also investigating what happened, Lehigh Valley Live’s reporting indicated.

The 6300 block of North Main Street is in between Passer and Liberty roads, about a quarter of a mile north of Coopersburg borough.

A bridge carries the road across the Laurel Run in that block, which is just west and south of Rt. 309.

It was not immediately clear when the woman’s vehicle entered the water, but Channel 69 News reported that she was pronounced dead shortly before 4:30 p.m.

Both Channel 69 News and Lehigh Valley Live cited a news release from the Lehigh County Coroner in their reporting about the woman’s death.

As much as seven inches of rain fell in a matter of a few hours and caused significant flash flooding on many roads throughout the Lehigh Valley Tuesday.

Parts of Main Street (Rt. 412) in Hellertown were submerged by the flood waters, and many roads were temporarily closed by police due to flooding.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://sauconsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Lehigh-County-Coroner-Southern-Lehigh-COVID-19.png,"['street', 'lehigh', 'flooding', 'north', 'roads', 'floodwaters', '44', 'dies', 'valley', 'saucon', 'upper', 'womans', 'woman']",
