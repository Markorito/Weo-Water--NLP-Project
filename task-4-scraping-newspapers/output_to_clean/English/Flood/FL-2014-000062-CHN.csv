Circle of Blue

Ten months after a brutal flood killed thousands of people, leveled riverbank communities, and battered hydroelectric projects across the northern state of Uttarakhand in India’s Himalayan region, a panel of experts has concluded that hydropower development significantly amplified the damage.

The committee found that existing oversight practices do not adequately account for how significantly power dams affect the Himalayan gorges where they are being built, and called on India to overhaul its policies and practices for approving new hydropower projects. The 11-member committee recommended the cancellation of 23 hydroelectric projects proposed in Uttarakhand because of the ecological damage they would cause.

The report, ‘Assessment of Environmental Degradation and Impact of Hydroelectric Projects During the June 2013 Disaster in Uttarakhand’, was submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forests on April 16, and made public on April 29. The expert panel was appointed in October 2013 at the direction of the Indian Supreme Court to determine whether Uttarakhand’s hydropower projects influenced the causes and consequences of the flooding that occurred on June 16 and June 17, 2013. Last summer, weeks after the flood, the Supreme Court also ordered a stay on construction and other activities to brng new hydropower projects on line in Uttarakhand.

“It is an honest report prepared by expert professionals wherein even the voices of dissent are recorded in a democratic way,” said Dr. Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, a non-profit public interest research organization based in Dehradun, Uttarkhand’s capital, and the committee’s chairman. “We hope that the court will accept the report in its entirety with all its recommendations.”

The committee’s findings this week prompted a flurry of legal and political responses. The Court ordered work to stop on 23 of the 24 hydropower projects identified in Uttarakhand in a study two years ago for the Ministry of Environment and Forests. That study recommended cancelling those projects due to the excessive damage to rivers, fish, and land they would cause.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests, on May 7, asked the Supreme Court to appoint a new study committee on hydropower and the Uttarakhand flood. The Court responded that they needed more information from the Environment Ministry on why such an appointment was necessary.

Government Agencies Oppose Report Findings

The findings of Dr. Chopra’s committee also were condemned by the Central Electric Authority and the Central Water Commission, two influential energy development agencies that have helped lead India’s ambitious program to develop hydropower in Uttarakhand and four other Himalayan states.

The two agencies issued a joint report that criticized the methodology and science of the report and said “hydro projects had no role in the Uttarakhand flash floods.”

The two agencies added that accepting the study commission’s findings would grievously hamper Indian hydropower development. India is counting on hydropower to produce 150,000 megawatts of electrical generating capacity – comparable to 150 big coal-fired power plants. Only 40,000 megawatts of hydropower generating capacity exists in India today.

“Blaming hydro projects for an unprecedented catastrophe and halting construction without any technical or scientific basis will seriously impact energy security,” the agencies said.

Since 2003, when India launched a national program to develop more megawatts of electrical generating capacity from hydropower, Uttarakhand has been the most active Indian state for building big and small hydro projects. Fifteen big hydropower projects have been commissioned in the state, 14 others are under construction. Some 39 projects, big and small, are proposed in just two river basins, the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi, according to the Central Electric Authority.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013, following days of torrential monsoon rains, a torrent of water, mud, and boulders roared down the narrow gorges of both river basins. More than 6,000 people died, according to the Indian government, though unofficial estimates put the death toll much higher. The damage to roads, buildings, water systems and hydroelectric infrastructure was so extensive much of it has still not been adequately repaired. The flood washed away 25 small hydro projects, and seriously damaged 10 big projects in both river basins.

Dams Amplify Damage

The Supreme Court-sanctioned study commission concluded that existing hydropower projects aggravated the damage. The major reasons, said the commission, were the mountains of silt, sand, and boulders that construction crews excavated to make room for at least 30 big and small hydropower projects, and left unmanaged along the riverbanks. The rushing high water scoured the banks, dissolved the mountains of construction spoils, and pushed the mud and boulders downstream, burying low lying communities.

Over the years, community leaders and environmental organizations have worried about the proximity of the spoils piles to Himalayan rivers, warning about the catastrophic consequences of a big flood. This study is the first official Indian government assessment to confirm that spoils piles are hazardous in high water.

“The damage was due to a combination of the quantity of flood water and the sediment loads carried by the rivers,” the report said.

The authors added, “Muck (sediment) management is a crucial issue. Current practices need to be reviewed and technically sound and ecologically sustainable ways of muck management in Uttarakhand have to be proposed to protect the people and the terrain from a June 2013 type of situation.”

The study commission also scrutinized and confirmed other serious risks from Himalayan hydropower construction. Such dams, said the commission, change river flows, damage fisheries, and can ruin riverine ecosystems. The panel also noted, as did a United Nations climate change study seven years ago, that ponds and lakes formed behind big dams are important sources of methane, a climate-changing air pollutant.

New Problems for India’s Energy Development

The committee recommended that India take a much more comprehensive approach to evaluating hydropower projects.

“The cumulative impact of multiple hydroelectric projects along the same river basin and the threat of a cascading chain of catastrophes in the case of structural failure or even from purely natural causes such as the floods of June 2013 suggest that there is an urgent need for a region or entire basin-based strategic environment assessment rather than individual project-oriented environmental impact assessments that neglect the summation effect,” said the report’s authors.

The committee’s report has raised new challenges for India’s hydropower development program, which has slowed dramatically in recent years. Many of the 23 projects that the committee recommended for permanent dismissal have already been awarded permits and developed contracts for construction with the Uttarakhand government. A senior executive at Jindal Power, a private hydro development company, told The Economic Times, an Indian daily newspaper, that the committee’s recommendations would significantly affect many companies, banks and “the nation’s dream of self-sufficiency.”

India’s insurance companies also are responding to the June 2013 flood. Insurers earlier this year raised the premium for hydropower plants across the Himalayas and other regions of the country. Companies like National Insurance Co. Ltd., United India Insurance Co Ltd., and Oriental Insurance Co. raised premium rates two to fourfold for hydroelectric projects after receiving huge damage claims from hydropower companies like NHPC and Jaiprakash Associates, which operate power plants in Uttarakhand that were seriously damaged by the floods.

“Last year’s Uttarakhand tragedy completely changed the risk perception of hydro power plants for insurance companies. In response to tenders of power companies seeking quotation for re-insurance, insurers have asked for double or triple the earlier rates for power projects,” a senior power ministry official told Indian reporters.

Higher Insurance Rates a New Barrier to Hydro Development

An executive with National Insurance Co. said it was forced to hike premium rates because building and operating hydro projects in the Himalayas has become riskier. “The projects get damaged every year during monsoons. But damage claims during last two years have risen sharply. Last year’s Uttarakhand episode has compelled us to change our assessment,” a company executive told reporters.

One of the projects, NHPC’s 280-megawatt Dhualiganga hydro station, suffered $US 50 million in damage when its turbines and other equipment in the project’s powerhouse were submerged by the flood. The company recovered a major chunk of the loss through insurance claims. Other hydropower projects sustained higher levels of damage.

The study commission’s report received generally high marks from the South Asia Network on Dams, River, and People, an Indian environmental organization. “The lessons from Uttarakhand are relevant for all Himalayan states of India from Kashmir to all the North East states,” wrote Himanshu Thakkar, the group’s coordinator, on the SANDRP Web site. “We hope the Supreme Court will ask the follow up committee to ensure that these lessons are taken note of, and necessary steps flowing from there are implemented in these Himalayan states. These will also provide guidance to our Himalayan neighboring countries.”

5,5,FL-2014-000062-CHN,A bigger rice bowl - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2014/05/10/a-bigger-rice-bowl,"A SEED of rice that could transform the developing world saved Asha Ram Pal’s farm in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in the summer of 2008. Mr Pal had planted rice on his small plot, not much bigger than a football field. Floods are an ever-present threat in the state, making it one of the poorest places in the world. And that year the monsoon was particularly heavy, remembers Bob Zeigler, director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Mr Pal’s fields flooded for two weeks after he planted the rice seedlings; a few weeks later, they were inundated again. He thought his crop was lost. His neighbours advised him to do what they have always done when the floods come: prepare for hunger. But this time Mr Pal had planted an experimental seed developed by scientists from IRRI in the Philippines. The seed has a genetic sequence bred into it which puts it into a sort of suspended animation when submerged. Instead of drowning, Mr Pal’s rice sprang back when the water receded. In a normal year he gets a tonne or so from his 1-hectare (2.5-acre) plot; in a bad year nothing. In that terrible flooded season, he harvested 4.5 tonnes—as good a yield as on any rain-fed paddy in the world.

Flood-resistant rice is now spreading as fast as the waters themselves. Five years after the first field trials, 5m farmers across the world are planting more than a dozen varieties of rice with flood-resistant genes, collectively called “Sub 1”. They are proliferating even faster than new rice varieties during the heady early days of the first green revolution in the 1960s. “And Sub 1 is the first of a new generation of seeds,” says Mr Zeigler. If all goes well, over the next few years plants that tolerate drought, salinity and extreme heat will revolutionise the cultivation of mankind’s most important source of calories. But that will depend on the technology working as promised and, in particular, on public policies that support a second green revolution. Neither is guaranteed.

The first green revolution helped save the developing world from disaster. Two plant breeders, Norman Borlaug with wheat and M.S. Swaminathan with rice, persuaded governments in Asia and elsewhere to encourage the planting of higher-yielding varieties, especially of rice; 3.5 billion people, half of mankind, get a fifth of their calories or more from the stuff. When the men started work in the early 1960s, China was suffering the famine of the Great Leap Forward. And India was widely thought to be on the brink of starvation.

Today in Asia, famines are things of the past. One reason is the spread of democracy. Another is the green revolution, which has ensured that there is plenty of rice—India even exports it. And demand seems to be shrinking: the richest Asian countries, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, are eating less rice. This has led governments which once supported the green revolution to think that a new one would be unnecessary. Rice, they reason, is a problem that has been solved. Better to improve the diets that are causing obesity or change the intensive-farming practices that are damaging the environment.

But it is not clear that the mission has been accomplished. In Asia as a whole, consumption per person is flat, not falling. The population is still growing, so demand for rice is rising on the continent where 90% of the crop is raised. In Africa, where a third of the population depends on rice, demand is rising by almost 20% a year. At that rate rice will surpass maize as Africa’s main source of calories within 20 years.

Seeds of stagnation

As a rule of thumb, if the world’s population grows by 1 billion, an extra 100m tonnes of rice is required to feed them. Given current world-population forecasts, total rice consumption, now under 450m tonnes, is likely to grow to 500m tonnes a year by 2020 and to 555m by 2035—an increase of 1.2-1.5% a year. That would be manageable if rice yields were also growing at that rate. But they are not. They are rising at barely half that pace.

The first green revolution almost doubled yields from 1.9 tonnes a hectare in 1950-64 to 3.5 tonnes in 1985-98. Even that was only enough to keep pace with population growth: yields and population rose at the same rate (1.75% a year) in the half century after the green revolution started.

Now the gains seem to have levelled off. Plant breeders fear that, with current technology, ten tonnes a hectare for rice in intensive-farming systems may be the limit, though it is not clear why. What is clear is that, out in the fields, output per hectare is stalling, and in some places falling.

For 25 years, IRRI has been planting a field using its best seeds. The field itself has remained much the same: the bugs and microbes that live in the roots of the rice plant mean that soil fertility is maintained even if three crops are grown each year. But output from the plot has fallen from nine to ten tonnes a hectare in the early 1990s to seven to eight tonnes now, as pests and diseases have taken their toll. Rice yields were rising at 2.5% a year between 1962 and 1982. But between 1992 and 2012 growth fell to just 0.8% a year (see chart 1).

The facts of rice

Without new seeds, yields will decline further. Global warming will tend to push harvests down: higher night-time temperatures are associated with lower yields. The richest rice-growing areas in the world are the deltas of Asia’s great rivers, such as the Mekong, Brahmaputra and Irawaddy; they are vulnerable to rising sea levels and increased salinity, which kills rice. The plant uses two to three times as much water as other cereals (largely for levelling the paddies; the plant itself consumes no more than wheat or maize), but water is scarce everywhere. And each year the spread of Asian—especially Chinese—cities converts millions of acres of good rice-growing land into buildings and roads.

The consequences could be momentous. Rice plays a role in Asian societies that is hard for outsiders to appreciate. (A small example: Toyota means “bountiful rice field” and Honda means “main rice field”.) In the river basins that are the world’s rice bowls, nothing else will grow with the same productivity. It is rice or nothing, and if there are problems with rice, there are problems with everything. A rice shortage would have geopolitical implications. No Indian or Chinese government could contemplate the possibility with equanimity. They would do whatever it takes to ensure they have enough rice. If this pushes up world food prices, so be it. If they must twist the arms of exporting countries, they will. If Asia’s giants feel insecure, their neighbours will tremble.

So a lot is riding on boosting rice yields. But how likely is it that a second green revolution will take off?

The first was a relatively simple affair, technologically at least. Conventional rice varieties were long and leggy. If you gave them fertiliser, they grew too tall and fell over. That changed in 1962, when IRRI released a dwarf variety called IR8. Because its stem was short, it was able to absorb fertiliser without collapsing. So now farmers had a crop they could feed. And with stem growth restricted, more of the increase in plant size went into the head of seeds (called a panicle). IR8 spread from the Punjab to the Philippines, transforming farming wherever water could be controlled and fertiliser delivered.

The second revolution will be different. Farmers will not adopt a single miracle variety. Instead, researchers will tailor seeds for particular environments (dry, flooded, salty and so on). And they are also trying to boost the nutritional quality of rice, not just the number of calories. As a result, the second revolution will be felt most profoundly in the poorest areas and among the poorest farmers. In contrast, the first had the biggest impact in the richest fields, with the most water and fertiliser.

The flood-resistant trait that rescued Mr Pal’s crop was first identified in the 1980s, in a few old-fashioned varieties native to Odisha, another flood-prone state in eastern India. After more than a decade of false starts, plant scientists identified the genes that make the Odisha varieties flood-tolerant. They went back to IR8’s descendants, spliced these genes into them and bred from the result. Having spent years getting nowhere with traditional plant-breeding methods, scientists went from marking the genetic sequence to producing flood-resistant seeds in four short years.

Abdelbagi Ismail, IRRI’s principal scientist, hopes to do the same for other traits that have so far eluded breeders, such as drought resistance and heat tolerance. High temperatures during rice flowering can lead to sterility. If it is too hot, the anthers of the plant, which contain the pollen, do not open properly; the pollen is not released, the stigma are not pollinated and the crop is lost. The problem occurs during the hour or so when the plant flowers. It could be overcome if it were possible to encourage rice to flower in the cool of the early morning—as opposed to scorching midday, its usual hour. Tom Ishimaru, who works at IRRI and the Japan International Research Centre for Agricultural Sciences, has found a gene which codes for early-morning flowering, raising hopes of solving the problem.

Such breeding programmes will not have the same dramatic impact that IR8 did. But developing miracle seeds is not the only way to boost yields. During the 1990s China did it by improving hybrids: crossing different lines to combine the advantages of both. This is the usual way of improving maize, but it is less common with rice. Unlike maize, rice breeds true in successive generations, so farmers can retain seeds from one harvest and plant them for the next. Farmers will switch if a new variety gives them a big one-off boost, but not just to get the small increments offered through hybrid improvements. Hence, it takes a long time to boost yields using hybrids—unless the government forces farmers to use new seeds. China’s rulers could do that; less authoritarian regimes cannot.

Cereal killers

China’s experience shows that a series of small improvements can add up to something large. This will be true of the second revolution on the poorest lands. The first green revolution had most impact on irrigated land and, thanks to it, the 80m hectares which are irrigated (an area equivalent to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia put together) now have yields of five to six tonnes a hectare; they produce three-quarters of the world’s rice. But there is nearly as much rice land which depends on rainwater. Yields there are far lower—between one and two and a half tonnes a hectare—and rain-fed lands produce only a quarter of the world’s rice. Yields are low because almost half this land is prone to drought and a third to floods. Most African paddies fall into this category, which is why the first green revolution passed Africa by.

Drought- and flood-tolerant seeds could double yields from these areas. That would boost harvests from 110m tonnes to 220m, and push global output to 550m tonnes—enough to meet expected demand in 2035. In short, all the extra rice could come from rain-fed areas alone.

Because yields on rain-fed lands are low, even a doubling would not increase total production by as much as the first green revolution did. But the impact on poverty would be greater. More than 500m of the absolute poor (those with $1.25 a day or less) depend on rice, far more than on any other food (see chart 2). A disproportionate number of them live in north-east India, Bangladesh and the Irrawaddy delta of Myanmar. In these areas the lowest castes and tribes have been forced onto the worst lands. Those are the very places where the second green revolution would make the biggest impact. Flood-resistant rice “differentially benefits [India’s] scheduled castes and tribes”, a recent study of one of the early field trials concludes. If these improvements were combined with another programme to boost the nutritional quality of rice—the so-called Golden Rice project which genetically modifies rice to include additional vitamin A—then the benefits to some of the poorest people in the world would be vast. The first green revolution did not improve people’s livelihoods just by providing technological fixes. It did so because the new seeds attracted new capital into farming, encouraged mechanisation, credit markets, new management techniques and so on. The second revolution will also do this. Already, rice farming is changing faster than for generations. Age-old habits of raising seedlings, transplanting them into the fields and threshing, drying and storing the plant are being rejected. Now, seeds are planted directly into the field by machine and everything from threshing to milling is done by specialist firms. For such changes to become more widespread, though, incentives and policies need to push in the right direction. Alas, they don’t all do so. On the face of it, the second revolution is subsidised. Not only do governments finance the basic research. In many Asian countries, from rice importers such as Indonesia to exporters such as Thailand, they also pay farmers above the world price. Thailand’s scheme is so generous that it ran out of money this year. Such price distortions artificially boost demand for green-revolution seeds in the short run.

But high domestic prices are also bad for the economy. They impose heavy costs on consumers. And they undermine incentives to export, making world prices more volatile and international markets thinner. This hurts farmers who stand to gain from the shift of comparative advantage in rice-growing towards India and Bangladesh thanks to the second green revolution. If world trade becomes even more marginal, any advantage those countries gain will be muted.

High domestic prices also tend to drive up local wages, reducing the competitiveness of manufacturing and making rural labour dearer. And by making rice farming a safe bet, the policies blunt entrepreneurship in agriculture too, reducing farmers’ incentives to invest in new machinery and new ways of farming. On balance, therefore, artificially high rice prices make the new generation of seeds attractive, but by less than one might expect.

Land-use policy is equally messed up. In America and Europe technological change has tended to make farms bigger. The bigger the operation, the greater the gains from technology. That has not happened in Asia. In the most productive irrigated areas, farms are often smaller than two hectares and, despite mass migration from the countryside, have been getting even smaller during the past three decades. Governments have intervened to prevent farm consolidation partly because they want to slow down urbanisation, fearing that it could drive up unemployment in cities. Such policies have only not done considerable harm because of an extraordinary proliferation of efficient rental markets (see article).

The original green revolution transformed Asia from a continent stalked by hunger into one that could think and plan beyond the next harvest. It helped lay the foundation for the continent’s economic miracle and made possible Asia’s demographic transition from high fertility and high mortality to smaller, richer families. The second green revolution will not do that. But it should complete the first one, mainly by bringing benefits to the poorest, who missed out first time round. It will help mechanise and move more people off farms and into more productive labour. And it should prevent Asia slipping back under the shadow of hunger and all the political and social disruptions that such misery causes. Few other things can promise as much.","Sat, 10 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140510_FBP006_0.jpg,"['bigger', 'seeds', 'tonnes', 'second', 'farmers', 'green', 'revolution', 'plant', 'yields', 'bowl', 'world', 'rice']",

Jeb Bush and the current governor, Rick Scott — declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the subject. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush are viewed as potential presidential candidates. Political analysts say the reluctance of the three men to speak publicly on the issue reflects an increasingly difficult political reality for Republicans grappling with the issue of climate change, particularly for the party’s lawmakers from Florida. In acknowledging the problem, politicians must endorse a solution, but the only major policy solutions to climate change — taxing or regulating the oil, gas and coal industries — are anathema to the base of the Republican Party. Thus, many Republicans, especially in Florida, appear to be dealing with the issue by keeping silent.

“Jeb likes to take positions on hot-button issues, the same with Rubio,” said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. “On immigration they are further mainstream on that than the rest of the G.O.P. But on this, Republicans are dead set against taking action on climate change on the national level. If you have political aspirations, this is not something you should talk about if you want to win a Republican primary.”

Over the past year, Mr. Rubio has signaled his skepticism about the established science that fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change. When asked in a 2013 Buzzfeed webcast interview if climate change posed a threat to Florida, Mr. Rubio responded: “The climate is always changing. The question is, is manmade activity what’s contributing most to it?” He added that “I’ve seen reasonable debate on that principle” and “if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy it would have a devastating impact.”

But in 2008, while serving in the Florida State Legislature, Mr. Rubio supported a bill directing the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit carbon emissions.

As governor from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Bush pushed several environmental initiatives, particularly efforts to protect Everglades National Park, which scientists say is highly vulnerable to encroaching seawaters. Political scientists say that Mr. Rubio’s shift and Mr. Bush’s current silence on the issue appear to reflect the position of lawmakers who are mulling transitions from the state to the national stage and the realities of satisfying their party’s base in the 2016 primaries.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/08/us/JPCLIMATE/JPCLIMATE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=47c54f06bb8cd26529da36084395a508f0044a51d83a9717c802ee93b5572bdf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['miami', 'rubio', 'political', 'issue', 'florida', 'change', 'mr', 'finds', 'say', 'state', 'ankledeep', 'climate', 'republicans', 'debate']",

New research indicates that climate change has already triggered an unstoppable decay of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The projected decay will lead to at least 4 feet of accelerating global sea level rise within the next two-plus centuries, and at least 10 feet of rise in the end.

What does the U.S. look like with an ocean that is 10 feet higher? The radically transformed map would lose 28,800 square miles of land, home today to 12.3 million people.

Click on the image above to check for threats from sea level rise and storm surge.



These figures come from Climate Central research published in 2012, analyzing and mapping every coastal city, county and state in the lower 48 states. (A next generation of research is currently under way.)

More than half of the area of 40 large cities (population over 50,000) is less than 10 feet above the high tide line, from Virginia Beach and Miami (the largest affected), down to Hoboken, N.J. (smallest). Twenty-seven of the cities are in Florida, where one-third of all current housing sits below the critical line — including 85 percent in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Each of these counties is more threatened than any whole state outside of Florida – and each sits on bedrock filled with holes, rendering defense by seawalls or levees almost impossible.

By the metric of most people living on land less than 10 ft above the high tide line, New York City is most threatened in the long run, with a low-lying population count of more than 700,000. Sixteen other cities, including New Orleans, La.; Norfolk, Va.; Stockton, Calif.; Boston, Mass.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Jacksonville, Fla.; are on the list of places with more than 100,000 people below the line. (Much of New Orleans is already below sea level, but is protected at today’s level by levees.)

Climate Central’s enhanced analysis paints a much more detailed pictured for completed states. For example, more than 32,000 miles of road and $950 billion of property currently sit on affected land in Florida. Threatened property in New York and New Jersey totals more than $300 billion. And New England states all face important risks.

The predicted sea level rise will take a long time to unfold. The numbers listed here do not represent immediate or literal threats. Under any circumstances, coastal populations and economies will reshape themselves over time. But the new research on West Antarctic Ice Sheet decay — and the amount of humanity in the restless ocean’s way — point to unrelenting centuries of defense, retreat, and reimagination of life along our coasts.

In the face of luxury push-back from China’s government and hyper competition for luxury car consumers, how is Ferrari tuning its China message?

2013 was not luxury’s finest year in China. The government shamed any and all ostentatious displays of wealth and decadence, and Chinese con­sumers are now backing off the luxury buying frenzy that shaped the decade following the country’s ascension to the World Trade Organization, proving to be increasingly selective as time passes.

So how does an iconic luxury car brand navigate such a climate?

Named the world’s most powerful brand in the 2014 Brand Finance Global 500 report on brand valuation, Ferrari brings Chinese consumers into “the fam­ily”, favoring scarcity and exclusivity over chasing easily available sales, deliberately dropping the number of cars delivered to their global network by 5.4% to 6,922 cars in 2013. The tactic has paid off hand­somely. Revenues rose by 5%, reaching €2.3 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2013 and net profits rose 5.4%, exceeding €246 million ($341 million).

Overseeing Ferrari’s current China od­yssey is Edwin Fenech, Ferrari’s Greater China President and CEO since 2010. Within three years, the French-Italian Fenech tripled Ferrari’s dealer network in China, introduced the Ferrari Pirelli Cup Challenge to Asia—running races in Zhu­hai and Shanghai—and launched a drag­on-striped limited edition vehicle just for the China market.

Fenech shares with CKGSB Knowledge the thinking behind Ferrari’s branding strategy in China, the logistical challenges of delivering autos from factories in Italy to buyers in the world’s second-largest econo­my, the major international brand’s surviv­al guide to negative press, and how they go about establishing and strengthening racing culture in a country that has traditionally shrugged at international events like For­mula One. Along the way, he recounts take aways from his time overseeing the Euro­pean, Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) region and dismisses the notion that China is anything less than the most important growth market for luxury cars.

Q. In January 2011, Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa said: “For Ferrari, China repre­sents the present and the future.” And then this year Marco Mattiacci, the Ferrari North America CEO, said that “Mexico is the new China.” How has Ferrari’s China game plan evolved since 2011? How would you describe the importance of China currently to Ferrari?

A.China now is the second-biggest econ­omy in the world. China is the number one market for automotive in the world. And I think now we are just scratching the surface, especially when we are talking luxury.

In terms of the market, I think we dou­bled [our] market’s [size] in the last three to four years. This is something you’re not seeing anywhere else in the world. This is the market that has all the potential to re­ally grow. What we’re going to see in automo­tive, especially in luxury automotive, is there are a lot of Chinese travelling abroad, also moving abroad. We are monitoring a clear trend that Chinese are buying Fer­raris abroad.

But this does not mean we will stop investing here in the country. This is the opposite [of] everything the other luxury manufacturers are doing. We are in the country where we absolutely need to dis­close our DNA, our brand values, to edu­cate people [on] the market, who we are, and why we are so peculiar.

Q. Ferrari Chairman Luca di Monteze­molo said this year: “A Ferrari is not a luxury product. To buy Ferrari is to obtain a piece of art, a piece of technology.” In light of the official reprimand of opulence here, how is Ferrari in China integrating that into its identity and strategy?

A.Really the anti-corruption didn’t have any effect on us. In fact, since they bring this anti-corruption [crack down], we’ve grown. I can easily state it. I think no peo­ple under the government will ever try to be seen with a Ferrari, it’s just too visible. For the rest, we have to acknowledge one thing, it’s the young people who are buy­ing. Here it’s a chauffeur-driven market. People who are a certain age and wealthy they will go for [a] chauffeur, like [with] a sedan. You just have to look at the re­sults of Rolls-Royce [Motor Cars] here in China. They are amazing. They are selling more than us. But when you come to the sports segments, it’s dedicated to a smaller number of people which are generally the young guys. The average age of our cus­tomers is the lowest in the world, by far. But this is normal because in the mature countries, you’ve had the time to establish your brand, and also to be part of history. People now who are 60 years old [in ma­ture markets], they’ve known Ferrari since they were born, they grew up in this cul­ture of racing.

Here, the first car we sold was rough­ly 20 years ago, but the real implication of Ferrari in the country [came] more or less 10 years ago. In these 10 years, every single competitor came at the same time. It has created a little bit of, I wouldn’t say confusion, but imagine a customer that 10 years ago never approached the sports segments, now all of the sudden, he has a huge shopping list with everybody trying to pull him aside, saying, ‘I’ll give you the best,’. This is one of the reasons we are doing a lot of branding. This branding serves in two ways: one, to educate the customers, but the other side is to create loyalty. What we are seeing is that now, these young guys [have] evolved, they are evolving very fast. What’s interesting is that the more they age, the more they [are] loyal to the brand. From this point here we can be very proud. We are a company that’s also very able to make people loyal.

Q. How is that loyalty achieved?

A.It’s like Ferraristi; you’re part of a fam­ily. That’s what’s interesting. We have no ‘customers’. We have people who live their dream which is to buy a Ferrari and they’re part of the family. In China we are selling 500 cars. We have 500 new cus­tomers or repeat customers that come to us every year. We should know everybody by name.

When they start to become loyal, it’s true loyalty, because they really partici­pate in every single event. They start on racing, they buy every single model, it’s amazing.

This market is in constant evolution. It’s normal in this country [that] we have more first time buyers than in any other country in the world.

What is interesting to us is that the sec­ond and third tier cities are the ones that are growing faster than the rest of China, and we are taking advantage of that. When I came here in 2010, we had 10 dealers. From 2011-2013 we grew to 30 dealers. Then we tripled the distribution in only two years. Obviously, by entering new cit­ies, [this] brought us new customers. Now I can tell you that we are approaching first time customers. But we [also] have a very big chunk of our customers that are repeat, loyal customers. Come more than one time to our events and you will see many famil­iar faces. We are like a family, we are to­gether, we drink together, we go to watch Formula One together and things like this. It’s very important.

Q. How would you describe the impact of Formula One in Shanghai on the Ferrari brand in China?

A.First of all, racing is not that popular in China. Obviously for us from a commer­cial point of view, from a media point of view, it’s something that’s very important. But we have to face the fact that racing is not a big interest. We cannot compare with basketball, with Yao Ming and that’s really the point because there are really no Chinese drivers in racing. And that’s maybe one of the reasons for the lack of interest, but this does not mean we are not doing anything.

From our side we have the duty to pro­mote racing, and I think we are the best ones to do it because it’s really part of our DNA. We started by introducing the [Pirelli] Challenge four years ago. The Challenge means huge investment. Why? Because normally how the challenge is structured is you create teams which are generally managed by our dealers, which is what’s happening in Europe and US. Here, no, because you don’t really have any racing culture. Racing is a serious thing. You cannot mess around with rac­ing because it can be very dangerous. To organize the best service with the highest level of quality and safety, we decided to manage everything by ourselves, the lo­gistics, the cars and rental of the circuit, [the] technicians, we fly 50 people from Italy for every single race all over Asia. This has a huge cost.

We are working on scouting the next Chinese pilot, and we really would like to be the first one to be really involved, to be the first to have a Chinese pilot represent­ing [us] in different series and one day at Formula One.

Q. Is this the first time you’ve had to really develop the racing culture to this extent in a new market, or have you been through this before?

A.No, because even in the Middle East F1 is very popular. You can see there are al­ready races in Abu Dhabi, in Bahrain and this is very highly followed locally. Here, we start from scratch. But through media, we are promoting what F1 is, what our racing is.

Q. How would you describe your media strategy and general marketing ecosys­tem?

A.First of all just to understand when we say media, we never pay for advertising, this is all about creating news. We are tar­geting the national [media] but also work­ing with the most important local media.

For instance, I travel a lot and most of the time we have interviews with local media. I think there is a strange apprecia­tion of Ferrari, love of Ferrari and passion for Ferrari. There are some journalists who are crazy about Ferrari. It’s funny, every time when they come to see me, they dressing only Ferrari gear.

But above all is the new media. New media is the one that really gives you the highest coverage by far. I don’t know how it is in the other countries but for us, for Ferrari, the management of new media is very important, we have a dedicated team because it’s so important.

Q. Along with other international brands, Ferrari had some unfortunate press expo­sure earlier in 2013. Could you outline a quick survival guide for large brands on how to deal with negative press in China?

A.First of all, clearly understand the context. Second you also have to be very quick in reacting, otherwise things can re­ally take a dimension that can be very dif­ficult to manage. Be very quick in releas­ing your statement, there can be different kinds of statements, but absolutely show your voice, tell your point of view. In China it’s very important because Chinese pay attention to what the brand is saying. Afterward, you can be rejected, but at least you have your statement, and from your statement you can work on it. But it’s very important, the context and being quick. I think the “wait and see” [approach], it doesn’t work here, it goes [from] worse to worst, you have to raise your point. [Also], have only one voice, not a bunch of differ­ent people talking.

Q. Distribution is a challenge for any manufacturer in China. How does Ferrari cope with post-sale services and the lo­gistics of shipment and delivery given the cars are manufactured in Italy?

A.Since we are [in] a growing market, we are growing in terms of network, ob­viously finding the people—the mechan­ics—it’s always a challenge. There’s very fierce competition on that front. But for us and this is one of my strong requests to our network and to those who are managing our network, I want stability. When I was in Paris I was also managing one of the biggest dealerships we have in the world. And there we were seeing the customer come in by themselves. Before, even if you owned a Ferrari, generally it was the chauffeur who brought the car for repairs. Now people come in because it’s part of the experience of understanding, speak­ing, creating the relationship. This is very important.

Q. And in terms of logistics?

A.We used to have a lot of logistical problems.

The problem with Ferrari is that the cars are sports cars, they are not normal cars. They cannot go on normal trucks es­pecially when you load it. The most common issues we had [were] scratches on the front bumpers or also another one that is really annoying is when you scratch the rims, which are very costly. We overcame in two ways: in the beginning when we had to face it, but could not solve it, we had to order a lot of bumpers and a lot of rims. But we could not sustain this for long. Then my sales team started to scout [for] best practices, talking with people in the same field, with other manufactures, and we came to identify one [local] group, but even with this group, obviously no one had the real tools to manage Ferrari, be­cause we need very specific trucks. So we made a deal with the company, according to the volume of cars per year, they will make the investment up front to have ded­icated trucks [just] for us. Obviously it’s costly, but it’s less costly than to change the bumper [every] time.

The difference between then and now is night to day. Now we have much [few­er] problems. We have really improved the transportation issues.

Q. Do you envision a time when you will manufacture the cars here in China?

A.First of all, in order to build an addi­tional plant you need significant additional volume and this is not our strategy. Our strategy is completely the opposite, be­cause we’re a very exclusive brand we want to limit our volume, even if we have huge potential to sell more, we really want to maintain the scarcity and the exclusiv­ity. If you flood the market with too many new cars, the value drops. If you have scar­city, people want to buy a Ferrari. [If] they don’t want to wait, they can easily have very good cars on the market, which are used cars. Like this, you maintain a very healthy circle of people buying first used cars, then selling back, which is a huge benefit for the customer that’s driving one of the best cars in the world without losing too much money. And this has been one of the successes of Ferrari.

For us it’s absolutely key to be the owner of our pre-owned car market. We are working to create a process that in­volves our dealers buying back the cars [from] our customers to have a pool of pre-owned cars, to [then] be offered to the market from our dealers. This has ad­ditional benefits. First of all you maintain the price of the car as you want. If you control the market then you decide how much this car is worth. Second, you pro­pose additional business to your dealers, and when it’s well done it can bring a lot of money. The only issue we have here in China is the stocking price of the car. Pric­es are very expensive. We have an average price of RMB 4 million. At this price level people want to buy a new car. If you want to reach the price for people that want a used car, you have to drop quite a lot.

Q. Your partner, Poly Group Corp, is not exactly an auto maker, what does each side bring to the table that benefits the other? How do you negotiate that relationship?

A. First of all we started to work together when this market was not that big. When you enter for the first time into such an unknown market, it was like stepping on the moon. When you step on the moon, you want to be very well prepared and to be sure that you will be successful. In this part of the discovery we prefer to be covered by a very important group, which is a group that’s a state-owned company, very influential, and that can give us the right direction. Because in China it’s not a normal market, because you’re in a coun­try that’s governed by different rules than what you can understand, from the culture [and] from the political side [and] from the expectation of the customers. We want to build in the proper way, assuring the right direction. And definitely this is what Poly gets.

And we also have inside [knowledge of] exactly where the government goes, the influence of the government can have a huge impact on every single business.

Q. You’ve also supervised the Middle East and Africa branch of Ferrari, meaning you’ve covered a significant part of the globe for the company. Would you say there is a formula for integrating the Fer­rari brand and products into a local mar­ket? Or does each place demand its own special process?

A. With emerging countries you are enter­ing a market where people are discover­ing. To discover you have to make them understand who you are, be present where you need to be present, which means dis­tribution with the right service. And face the competition, which means you need to do branding activities. You have to understand where you have to be present and with whom, because partners are very important. Especially when you are talk­ing about Ferrari, we are [of a] different mindset than others. You have to explain to someone who’s investing in your brand, if the guy can sell 100 cars I’m going to give [him] 50, that’s a mindset that can frustrate some people. You have to find the right one that understands what luxury business is.

Then above all I think that you have to refrain from being too aggressive. We are a brand that has to be the same everywhere in the world. It’s non-negotiable. We’ll re­frain from entering in this race of dis­counts. Here [in China] we never sold out. Here we have a long-term vision. The ob­jective in the long term is to be the best brand in the country.","Wed, 14 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ferrari-china.gif,"['customers', 'car', 'ferrari', 'brand', 'racing', 'cars', 'turbo', 'thats', 'really', 'market', 'china']",

Ask Americans to describe themselves, and chances are you'll get adjectives like ""energetic,"" ""friendly"" or ""hard-working.""

In Japan, the responses would likely be much different. ""Dependent on others"" and ""considerate"" might pop up, studies have found.

Psychologists have known for a long time that people in East Asia think differently, on average, than do those in the U.S. and Europe. Easterners indeed tend to be more cooperative and intuitive, while Westerners lean toward individualism and analytical thinking.

Now psychologists have evidence that our ancestors planted some of these cultural differences hundreds of years ago when they chose which grains to sow.

""We call it the rice theory,"" says Thomas Talhelm, a graduate student at the University of Virginia who led the study. ""Rice is a really special kind of farming.""

The idea is simple. Growing rice tends to foster cultures that are more cooperative and interconnected, Talhelm and his colleagues explain Thursday in the journal Science.

Why? Because farming rice paddies requires collaboration with your neighbors, Talhelm tells The Salt. Self-reliance is dangerous.

""Families have to flood and drain their field at the same time,"" he says. "" So there are punishments for being too individualistic. If you flood too early, you would really piss off your neighbors.""

Rice paddies also require irrigation systems. ""That cost falls on the village, not just one family,"" he says. ""So villages have to figure out a way to coordinate and pay for and maintain this system. It makes people cooperate.""

Wheat, on the other hand, as well as barley and corn, doesn't generally require irrigation — or much collaboration. One family alone can plant, grow and harvest a field of wheat, without the help of others.

So wheat farming fosters cultures with more individualism, independence and innovation, Talhelm and his colleagues say. Self-reliance and innovation are rewarded.

Of course, proposing this rice theory is easy. Demonstrating that farming styles actually drive cultural changes is much harder.

To start to do that, Talhelm and his colleagues turned to a country that historically farmed both wheat and rice: China.

For generations, the people in the northern half of China have generally grown wheat, while those in the southern half have focused on rice.

And guess which people people tend to think more like Westerners? The northerners whose ancestors farmed wheat.

Talhelm and his colleagues gave simple psychological tests to about a thousand college students from both parts of China. Students in the north answered the questions more like Americans and Europeans: They tended to be more individualistic and use more analytical thinking. Those in the south aligned more with the cultures in Japan and Korea.

One test, for instance, asked a person to draw his social network, with circles representing himself and his friends. Americans tend to draw themselves bigger than their friends, about a quarter of an inch bigger. But Japanese draw themselves, on average, a bit smaller than their friends, a previous study found.

""America is No. 1 when it comes to self-inflation,"" Telhelm says. ""We draw ourselves much larger than friends. We take that as a measure of self-inflation.""

When Talhelm gave the same social network test to Chinese students, the amount of self-inflation depended on where the students lived. People from wheat-growing regions drew themselves slightly larger than their friends, on average. Students from the rice-growing regions drew themselves smaller than their friends. Like Westerners, people whose ancestors farmed wheat tend to inflate their own importance more.

Of course, the rice theory isn't the only hypothesis for why Easterners and Westerners tend to think differently.

Some scientists have chalked up these differences to wealth and modernization: As societies get richer and more educated, people become more individualistic and analytical.

But that idea doesn't explain the cooperative cultures in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea — which, in some ways, are richer than the U.S.

And the studies supporting this modernization idea, so far, haven't been as strong as the current study in Science, says psychologist Joseph Henrich, of the University of British Columbia, who wasn't involved in the work.

""The [rice theory] idea has been out there for a while,"" he tells The Salt. ""This is really the first study that I know of with systematic data supporting it. Other theories mostly stem from very small studies across nationalities. The quality of this study is better than those.""

But there's still much more work to be done before the hypothesis is accepted, Heinrich says. ""This is only the first study and we would want much more evidence before we declare victory.""

And the rice theory doesn't explain all the psychological differences observed in the students from the north and south of China.

""Lots of other things in the environment [besides rice farming] can create the same pattern,"" Henrich says. ""These things can last for generations. They become the right way to do things. And it takes a while to get a way from them.""","Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/05/08/150441091_wide-7627fb775b49a941c4c4971aa279657b6dd98a7c.jpg?s=1400,"['students', 'tend', 'study', 'friends', 'talhelm', 'wheat', 'cultures', 'eastern', 'theory', 'westerners', 'cooperative', 'rice']", 
11,11,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Chinese Fishermen Apprehended with 350 Dead Sea Turtles Off Philippines – gCaptain - GCaptain,https://gcaptain.com/chinese-fishermen-apprehended-350-dead-sea-turtles-philippines/,"MANILA, May 10 (Reuters) – The Philippines has jailed 11 Chinese fishermen caught with endangered sea turtles off a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, officials said on Saturday, rejecting demands from China to free the men.

China has claims on the South China Sea, an area rich in energy deposits and an important passageway traversed each year by $5 trillion worth of ship-borne goods. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the area.

The Philippine National Police on Tuesday intercepted a Chinese fishing boat carrying about 350 marine turtles off Half Moon Shoal in the Spratlys, arrested its crew and took them to the southwestern province of Palawan to face charges of violating wildlife protection laws.

If found guilty, the fishermen, who were transferred to a provincial jail late on Friday, face prison terms ranging from 12 to 20 years. But each can post bail of 150,000 pesos ($3,400) to secure temporary liberty while facing trial.

“They will remain in detention until the office of the provincial prosecutor has determined whether there is probable cause for the filing of formal charges,” said Allen Ross Rodriguez, a government lawyer.

China’s embassy in Manila on Thursday sent a diplomat to Palawan to interview the fishermen and work for their early release. But authorities said they must go through the judicial process.

A panel of Philippine officials has to decide separately on charges of illegal entry after the fishermen were caught about 60 miles (95 km) off Palawan, but within the country’s exclusive economic zone.

China has demanded the release of the vessel and its crew, saying it has undisputed sovereignty over the area and adjacent waters in the South China Sea.

Tension is also rising in the Paracel islands after China parked its biggest mobile oil rig 120 miles (193 km) off the coast of Vietnam, with each country accusing the other of ramming its ships in the area, in the worst setback for Sino-Vietnamese ties in years.

The incidents in the Paracel and Spratlys islands are likely to be taken up by Southeast Asian leaders who are due to hold an annual summit in Myanmar’s capital on Sunday. ($1=44.1825 Philippine Pesos) (Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)

12,12,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Family stuck in Chinese drywall nightmare waits on courts to rule - FOX 8 News WVUE-TV,https://www.fox8live.com/story/25497515/family-stuck-in-chinese-drywall-nightmare-wait-on-court-to-rule,"A north shore family loves the house they live in, but hate what it's doing to them. They're living with toxic Chinese drywall, shut out of settlements to fix the problem, and holding out for financial help that may never come.

""We don't know where to start, who to blame, what to do with it,"" said homeowner Joey Fatta. ""We're sitting in our own prison here.""

Joey and Tracy Fatta bought the fixer-upper in January 2005. A few months later, Katrina wrecked it.

""It put trees through the house and we had about 4 feet of water in the house,"" Fatta said.

Their passion for the old house motivated them to keep working, but Gulf hurricanes and a housing boom made things like drywall hard to find.

""There was no drywall,"" said attorney Becnel. The U.S. manufacturers produced everything they could because it wasn't enough,"" said attorney Danny Becnel.

Joey Fatta said building materials were so scarce he didn't care where the drywall came from. He just needed drywall.

""You can do a lot of things in an old home,"" said Tracy Fatta.

They finally got their drywall in 2007 and the north shore teacher, her husband and son, Gabe, moved in. Over the next few months, strange things started to happen.

""We've had to replace the panel in the microwave four times. The dishwasher doesn't work, and the air-conditioner keeps going out,"" Joey Fatta said.

Copper tubing in the central air unit is black. The same issues were happening to other people, too.

""Everything has to come out, back down to the studs,"" said Tracy Fatta with tears in her eyes.

Thousands of Katrina victims along the Gulf Coast discovered they also had toxic Chinese drywall made by Taishun Gypsum or the German company Knauf that manufactured drywall in China.

The Fattas had Taishun drywall, and that made a bad situation worse.

""With Taishun, it's a Chinese company,"" said Joey Fatta. ""Taishun says they don't recognize any U.S. court jurisdictions. They aren't paying out anything. It's not their problem.""

Becnel is a member of the plaintiff's steering committee.

""Right now, the Chinese government, since they own the company Taishun, is saying 'sorry guys, you can't do anything against us because we're immune.'""

That leaves the Fattas in a drywall no man's land. They're still living in their beautiful - but toxic - home.

""We can't sell it, because we have to disclose issues with the house like Chinese drywall. That devalues it to the shell of the house. We can't put $150,000 into renovating it because we may never get that back. We have nowhere to go,"" Joey Fatta said.

The only hope is in the courts.

The plaintiff's steering committee said the Fattas and other victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida look to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals for relief. In January, the 5th Circuit upheld U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon's decision that Taishun can be sued by victims in the state of Virginia. Rulings on whether Taishun is liable in Louisiana are expected soon.

""I would think in the next month or two we would have an opinion out of the 5th Circuit,"" Becnel said. ""If we lose, that's the end of it.""""

The Fattas worry about the dangers they can't see.

""The drywall's in the air. People have complained about asthma-type symptoms. We've been fortunate that we haven't had that yet, but you never know,"" Joey Fatta said.

Tracy worries something will surface as her son grows. She looks at her son's bathroom with drywall covered in beautiful paintings that will all have to be ripped apart.

""It's still my home,"" she said. I don't want it to be just a house. I want it to be a home.""

But while the northeast faces heavier rain and greater flooding, hotter and drier weather ups the risk of wildfires in the West. Since climate change’s impacts vary dramatically from place to place, so should the responses, the report notes. As it happens, two more papers this week make a similar point for different parts of the world.

Assessing the climate

Yesterday, the United States government released a brand new National Climate Assessment for 2014 – a detailed look at climate change impacts across the country.

Source: The 2014 US National Climate Assessment

The report warns that climate change’s ecological, economic and social impacts are already being seen across the country and in all sectors. But as well as talking about country-wide trends in temperature and precipitation, it focuses on smaller-scale climatic effects. It says:

“Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, rising temperatures are not evenly distributed across the country or over time”

Regional rainfall

Globally, a warmer atmosphere means a shift towards heavier downpours. The map below from the new report highlights how different regions have seen different increases in the frequency of extremely heavy rainfall, however.

Northeast and midwest states have seen the largest changes, with more than a 30 per cent increase in precipitation falling as very heavy rain (dark blue). There, heavy downpours frequently exceed the capacity of storm drains leading to flooding, the report notes.

In the southwest, however, the biggest concern is the projected increase in heatwaves, leading to a higher risk of drought, wildfires and pressure on water resources. The table below summarises the major impacts in each of the eight regions the report covers.

Patchy warming

Staying with rising temperatures for a minute, another new paper highlights how different parts of the world have been warming up at very different speeds over the past century.

The team of Chinese and US scientists, who examined monthly land surface air temperatures between January 1901 to December 2009, published their findings in the journal Nature Climate Change on Sunday.

Before 1950, the data show a few areas of both moderate warming and weak cooling, mainly scattered around the subtropics either side of the equator. The top left panel of the graph below shows these warming and cooling patches.

By 1980, except for the weak cooling in the northern tip of Greenland and in the vicinity of the Andes, almost all the global land was warming. The paper says:

“The cooling regions shrank and most of them turned into warming regions with an accelerated pace of warming over the next three decades [from 1950].”

At over 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade, the fastest warming in recent decades has occurred in northern mid-latitudes, where the UK and the US sit. Parts of western Africa, near the edge of the Sahara desert, have also warmed noticeably quicker than other areas.

This study differs from previous ones, which have looked at average warming over the last century in a given area but not whether warming has sped up or slowed down, according to the paper.

The authors do not have an explanation for the quicker and more widespread warming in the northern hemisphere. But they say it’s likely to be tied to atmospheric circulations and more area covered by land.

Climate impact hotspots

A third paper out this week also makes the point that dealing with climate change isn’t a one-size-fits all situation.

Published today in the journal Global Change Biology, the study highlights how overlapping impacts of climate change – such as drought or flooding, declining crop yields or ecosystem damages – create climate risk “hotspots” in parts of Africa. Lead author Christoph MÃ¼ller from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, says:

“We found three regions to be amongst those most at risk in a couple of decades: parts of Sudan and Ethiopia, the countries surrounding lake Victoria in central Africa, and the very southeast of the continent, including most notably parts of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe”.

Map showing projected hotspots of climate change impacts in Africa by the 2080s. Scale goes from no impact (white) to the most severe (dark red). Source: Muller et al., ( 2014).

Many of these regions have relatively high populations and high poverty rates, which further raises their vulnerability, says the paper. In contrast, Nigeria and the tropical forests of the Congo are likely to be much less affected.

In each location, the likelihood and severity of impacts can be weighed to decide on appropriate adaptation measures, the paper adds.

A global problem, a local solution

Climate change is a global challenge, and it’ll take a global effort to bring emissions down. But the impacts vary greatly over space and time. So whether it’s new ways to manage water supplies or building bigger flood defences, coping with the consequences of climate change will need to be targeted towards changes happening at much smaller scales.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/292641/nca_frontpage_250x323.jpg,"['approach', 'calls', 'global', 'paper', 'local', 'report', 'regions', 'research', 'change', 'parts', 'shows', 'adapting', 'climate', 'different', 'impacts', 'warming']", 
17,17,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Noah: the SFX blockbuster that led to a flood of old-fashioned books - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/08/noah-and-novels-after-film-books,"If anyone tells you films, television, video games and the internet are sounding the death knell for the printed book, take them to any US bookshop and show them the three tomes spawned by Darren Aronofsky's Noah. One, Noah the graphic novel, by Niko Henrichon (art), Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel, which can be found in the comic book section. Two, lurking on the young adult shelves, Noah: Ila's Story, by Susan Korman. And finally, Noah the old-fashioned ""official screenplay novelisation"", by veteran of the genre Mark Morris, and most likely to be found in sci-fi/fantasy rather than religion.

Meanwhile, over among the hardbacks, and prominently displayed, as befits a product with a lot of corporate heft behind it, we discover that pop culture's high priest of the lowbrow, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, has published his novelisation of the screenplay for his forthcoming comedy-western A Million Ways to Die in the West, several months before the movie's release. Notwithstanding Kindle downloads and ebooks, that's a lot of dead trees – the Noah graphic novel alone clocks in at more than 250 pages of sumptuous full-colour illustrations. This is higher-end stuff than the usual paperback throwaway film tie-in – who publishes a movie-novelisation in hardback?

The three-prong lit-push from the Noah team, unlike the MacFarlane book, is something of fairly recent vintage. The comics section will, depending on the season, feature graphic novels derived from movies such as X-Men, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Rises and the Star Trek franchise (for which this is well-trodden turf).

Noah, however, had the potential to draw in a whole other audience that often avoids the movies – American Christians. And $99m (£58.4m) in box‑office receipts thus far virtually guarantees knock-on successes in other media (there is no official Noah video game, but the 1994 religious-themed Noah's Ark game has just been re-released to cash in). The three books cunningly slice and dice that audience, with Ila's Story being told from the perspective of Noah's daughter (played in the film by Emma Watson, so every little girl can be Hermione all over again), and the pincer-movement of the novelisation and graphic novel (that is, from screenplay to printed page, and from storyboards to cartoon panels) snags both the teenage fanboy-geek crowd and an older readership that reads novelisations for an additional experience to the film, or for extra clarity or storytelling flourishes. (Less charitably, of this readership, one might agree with a scornful Pauline Kael, talking of a mid-60s movie tie-in edition that was not, in fact, a novelisation: ""Teenage girls are reading Pasternak's Dr Zhivago to find out more about Omar Sharif …"")

And that sounds weird, doesn't it? That there's an established audience for what is often depicted as the waste run-off of a larger cultural endeavour? But there has been for decades. Think of all those Star Trek and Star Wars tie-ins and off-lore storylines. In the UK alone, one lost count of all the Doctor Who tie-in novels in the 70s. In that context, the MacFarlane book is very much in an established tradition of milking a last few bucks from your project, and never mind the quality (and the consensus seems to be that his book is no good, not funny, and boring). It is less a novel to be read than an object to be held, a foothold on a new frontier for the MacFarlane name-brand.

Many of us grew up on novelisations. For me, the three seminal examples of my adolescence were Arthur C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Robert Weverka's The Sting and Christopher Wood's The Spy Who Loved Me. Clarke's outstanding novelisation, rooted in his story The Sentinel as well as in the screenplay he had co-written with Stanley Kubrick, lent some clarity and explication to 2001's almost abstract storyline, and it was still selling briskly a decade after the movie was released. The Sting had a whole lot more swearing and racism than the movie. Of an entirely different order of merit was one special case, Michael Thelwell's densely literary novelisation of Perry Henzell's epoch-making reggae movie The Harder They Come. That was certainly the only novelisation I was ever required to read in college.

The Wood novelisation was different, indicative of an emerging phenomenon. Until that point in the James Bond franchise, each film had been accompanied by a movie tie-in reissue of the original Ian Fleming novel, emblazoned with the movie poster on the cover. But Fleming's The Spy Who Loved Me had been an oddball entry in the series, half kitchen-sink grunge and bad sex, half absurd American hostage melodrama, told from the perspective of a woman who only encounters 007 in the book's final third. Plainly any filmgoer picking that up after seeing the You Only Live Twice rehash that was the filmed The Spy Who Loved Me would have demanded their money back pronto.

Thus was born Wood's novelisation of his own screenplay, with Roger Moore and the sultry Barbara Bach on the cover. Pubescent fogey that I was in 1977, I decried the besmirching of this proud brand with the scuzzy imprimatur of the ad-man who had written Confessions of a Window Cleaner. It sold a zillion copies, of course. (One fleeting irony is that Fleming's 1961 novel Thunderball, which had started life as a co-written 1957 screen treatment that couldn't find backing, was essentially the novelisation of an existing screenplay.)

You might say Aronofsky was faced with the same problem as Wood: dodgy source material. Noah's story takes up no more than chapters six to 11 of the Book of Genesis and is contradictory and confounding, though it does have a hell of a villain in – of all people – God himself. Nothing you can slap a picture of a shirtless Russell Crowe on to, however, though it would be a pleasure to see a copy of the Bible with an orange banner shrieking, ""The Book Behind The Russell Crowe Movie!""

Although the literary establishment has always treated the novelisation as the red-headed stepchild of commercial publishing, working writers have been far less dismissive. The literary nobs may wrinkle their noses, but writers and hacks of the plaid-shirt, kitchen-table, blue-collar school of writing – those boiler-stokers in the engine room of the postwar mass-market paperback revolution who nourished the then-renegade pulp genres of crime fiction, sci-fi, fantasy and cheesecake soft-core porn – knew that writing is writing and money is money. Sci-fi writers – in particular those who came of age before their genre became respectable – have always been especially eager to jump in with both feet: Isaac Asimov novelised the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage; Vonda McIntyre did the same for Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, while Norman Spinrad has done other Trek novels; William Kotzwinkle, not quite sci-fi, novelised ET: The Extra-Terrestrial, and Orson Scott Card did it for The Abyss, all of them to massive sales that adroitly surfed the wake of their film's gargantuan ad-budgets.

Others are more hands-on. Samuel Fuller became a free-agent director in 1962 and, suddenly finding himself without major studio backing, he knew his movies would now need to be more provocative and shocking to garner attention in the absence of large ad spends. He was so disappointed by a tame and slipshod novelisation by Michael Avallone of his 1963 snake-pit masterpiece Shock Corridor that he undertook the novelisation of his subsequent paedophilia-and-prostitution melodrama The Naked Kiss by himself, and later did the same for The Big Red One, Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street, and others. One might position McFarlane's slapdash effort in the Avallone column of the ledger, while Aronofsky's byproducts – finely calibrated though they are for maximum moneymaking impact – belong alongside Fuller's novels, which, like Noah: Graphic Novel, have the distinct advantage of being told in their original creator's vivid and unmistakable voice.

Over at the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers, the default position is still a defensive crouch – that their work is ""often overlooked and under-appreciated by existing organisations such as the Mystery Writers of America, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and the Romance Writers of America"" is the poignant reason behind their establishment of the annual Scribe award for best media tie-in.

The movie novelisation will abide as long as people want more of the movie than they have seen on screen. But while crooked politicians, ugly old buildings and retired brothel madams may all ripen one day into respectability, let's hope that movie tie-in novelisations never let something that terrible happen to them.","Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399563228702/Novelizations-composite-i-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e61f9ca062efa4ce2a169ddaad19bfd7,"['books', 'led', 'flood', 'book', 'trek', 'novelisation', 'star', 'movie', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'oldfashioned', 'writers', 'sfx', 'tiein', 'blockbuster', 'noah']",

This news comes in the wake of actions taken by banks against them which forced most of them to shutdown accounts related to bitcoin activity.

OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, BtcTrade, and CHBTC, the five exchanges affected by this made a detailed joint statement on Weibo, Tuesday night, stating that they would not participate in large bitcoin meetings or events any longer. They will also,

“Curb excessive speculation and protect investors, comply with all state policies and regulations, promote transparency in exchange processes, pay a flat fee for high-frequency trades, and report the latest industry developments to authorities,” the statement read.

Star Xu of OKCoin, Bobby Lee of BTC China, and Leon Li of Huobi were due to speak at the Global Bitcoin Summit taking place in Beijing.

Global Bitcoin Summit Must Continue On

Regardless of the People’s Bank of China’s aka PBOC censure of bitcoin, the two-day conference seems to be picking up steam and doing just fine. The ticket sales for the conference are said to be “stellar” and there is still a great selection of topic lineup. The PBOC announced in December last year its view for banks not to take part in business with bitcoin exchanges. This position of the PBOC has not been altered since.

Li Xiaolai is the president of the Global Bitcoin Summit and his company bitfund.pe is from the main organizers of the event. UBM China is the organizer of the event. The Global Bitcoin Summit speakers will discuss a host of issues related to bitcoin in China and abroad. For example, new innovations in bitcoin, startup advice, future of bitcoin in China and communication with markets at large will be some of the issues targeted at the conference.

Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, director of Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, Anthody di Iorio, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin are still scheduled to attend and speak at the conference. The list of speakers consists of both international and speakers from the host country. Representative from Chinese bitcoin startups and institutions consist of BitAngels, Bitfubao, BTC123, and Peat.io.

Recycling and reusing can reduce costs and up efficiencies

Buy an energy efficient vehicle

Climate change isn't something in the far-off future: It's a potentially disastrous reality that's already starting to have effects that are expected to worsen, experts say.

Longer summers and heavier rainfalls are some of the impacts Americans are already seeing, according to the National Climate Assessment . We should expect more flooding, wildfires and drought.

The report, a new White House update released Tuesday, calls for urgent action on climate change.

So what can you do at home to take action?

1. Become informed

The most powerful way that the average person can combat climate change is to become informed about it, says J. Marshall Shepherd , former president of the American Meteorological Society and professor at the University of Georgia.

""Obviously, it makes sense for people to be as efficient and green as possible in their thinking on a day-to-day basis,"" he said. ""But where I think the biggest impact that individuals can have is: Becoming climate literate.""

If you educate yourself about what's going on with climate change and what can be done about it, you can make more informed choices when it comes time to vote for the people with the power to make big decisions.

""Where the biggest impacts on our planet will be, will come from large-scale policy changes and solutions that are influenced by who's in office,"" he said.

Only read trusted and verified sources of information about climate change, Shepherd said. He recommends the websites climate.gov and Climate Central (of which he is a board member) for essential facts and resources.

Learn about various responses to climate change that policy makers are discussing:

-- Mitigation means lowering carbon dioxide levels -- for instance, by instituting carbon taxes or taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

-- Adaptation means responding to the consequences of climate change -- for instance, building seawalls to prepare for rising sea levels around vulnerable cities.

-- Geoengineering means changing the Earth itself to counteract climate change -- which would include hypothetical technological interventions such as putting large mirrors in space or changing our oceans to absorb more carbon dioxide, Shepherd said.

Beyond reading up on the issues, you can still do a small part to influence the big environmental picture.

2. Make changes at home

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists steps to limiting your greenhouse gas emissions, which would also save you money. These include:

-- Changing your five most-used light fixtures or bulbs to products that have the EPA's Energy Star label;

-- Heat and cool more efficiently, such as by using a programmable thermostat, changing air filters and replacing old equipment with Energy Star products;

-- Seal and insulate your home;

-- Make use of recycling programs, and compost food and yard waste;

--Reduce water waste;

--Use green power, such as solar panels;

--Estimate how much greenhouse gas you emit with the EPA's calculator

Check out clean energy resources and financial incentives in your area through the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficienc y.

3. Be greener at the office

If you have a desk job, there are plenty of things you can do to reduce your emissions while at work. The EPA advises:

-- Set computers and other office equipment to power down during periods when you're not using them;

-- Use Energy Star equipment;

-- Recycle and reuse whenever possible;

The David Suzuki Foundation , an environmental nonprofit organization, additionally recommends using video conferencing to reduce air travel for business.

4. Reduce emissions in transit

Whether it's taking a vacation or doing your daily commute, you can reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that also save money. The EPA's recommendations include:

-- Rely on public transportation, biking, walking, carpooling or telecommuting instead of driving;

-- Use the EPA's Green Vehicle Guide to help you make an informed choice about buying a car;

-- While driving, try not to do hard accelerations, don't spend more than 30 seconds idling, and go easy on the gas pedal and brakes;

-- Make sure to regularly check your tire pressure.

When you have to take an airplane, the David Suzuki Foundation recommends:

-- When flying, consider packing lighter because less fuel is consumed with less weight on the plane;

-- Fly during the day because night flights have a bigger impact on climate;

-- Buy carbon offsets -- or credits -- to compensate for the emissions on your flight .

5. Get involved and educate others about the big picture

Your green strategies in your daily life can have a small impact, but the whole planet has to be on board for dealing with climate change in order to instigate global effects. Even if everyone in the United States reduced their emissions, other countries that continue to dump carbon dioxide into the air would still contribute to warming temperatures and rising sea levels.

Spread the word about climate change and educating people. The EPA recommends that students give presentations on climate change and encourage their institutions to increase energy efficiency.

Find out if your community has a climate action plan. There may be ways you can contribute to local efforts to be greener and adapt to potential changes that a warming world would bring.","Tue, 06 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['videos', 'energy', 'reduce', 'emissions', 'change', 'carbon', 'watched', 'climate', 'watch', 'things', 'warming']",

Themes include infrastructure risks from rising oceans, to changing energy needs

Forecasts are included for six U.S. regions

A number of themes emerge from the regional reports included in the National Climate Assessment -- things like risks to infrastructure due to rising oceans both benefits and harm to agricultural production because of changing temperature, and new realities for cooling and heating costs.

Find your geographic region below and see how these issues specifically affect where you live, according to the report.

NORTHWEST

If you live in the Northwest, you can appreciate how vital the snow accumulation in the mountains is. It melts in spring to provide water for hydropower plants and irrigation for crops. But as seasonal water patterns change, caused in part by changes in snowmelt, the region's diverse ecology and geography can face challenges.

The impacts of climate change will be strongly felt along the coast -- an area important for the region's economy. People's livelihoods, recreational areas and infrastructure could be affected by rising sea levels. At the same time, wildfires are expected to increase.

Examples from report:

-- ""Since around 1950, area-averaged snowpack on April 1 in the Cascade Mountains decreased about 20%, spring snowmelt occurred 0 to 30 days earlier depending on location, late winter/early spring streamflow increases ranged from 0% to greater than 20% as a fraction of annual flow, and summer flow decreased 0% to 15% as a fraction of annual flow, with exceptions in smaller areas and shorter time periods.""

-- As sea levels rise, coastal areas of Washington and Oregon will flood more often. Beaches and habitats will probably decline in these areas.

-- ""Climate change will alter Northwest forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks, and by forcing longer-term shifts in forest types and species.""

-- Wildfires are a natural part of the forest ecosystem in the Northwest, but warmer and drier conditions have increased the number and extent of such fires.

-- ""Projected warming will reduce the availability of irrigation water in snowmelt-fed basins and increase the probability of heat stress to field crops and tree fruit.""

-- In the short term, some crops will benefit from a longer growing season, but the long-term consequences are uncertain.

SOUTHWEST

Those in the Southwest, especially in California, have already seen what changes in sea levels and temperature can do. Wildfires have ravaged some communities, and there has been damage along the coast due to waves encroaching further and further inland. Residents in this region count on a reliable supply of water. Imagine if that supply becomes less reliable as snowpack and streamflow amounts decrease?

Examples from the report:

-- ""Over the past 50 years across most of the Southwest, there has been less late-winter precipitation falling as snow, earlier snowmelt, and earlier arrival of most of the year's streamflow.""

-- Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased the burned area in the western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650%.

-- The sea level along the California coast has risen anywhere between 6.7 to 7.9 inches over the past 100 years.

--""If adaptive action is not taken, coastal highways, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure (such as the San Francisco and Oakland airports) are at increased risk of flooding with a 16-inch rise in sea level in the next 50 years.""

-- ""The effects of heat stress are greatest during heat waves lasting several days or more, and heat waves are projected to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity,,,,, become more humid, and cause a greater number of deaths.""

GREAT PLAINS

A large chunk of the middle United States, from Texas to Montana and the Dakotas, falls into this category in the report. What do Texans and Montanans have in common when it comes to climate? Well, the entire region will see increased demand for water and energy, and temperatures rise. Changes in how much you have to cool or warm your house has large impacts on the efficiency of energy use.

Climate change doesn't have just negative effects. For example, increased rainfall in the Northern Plains could increase agricultural productivity. But in the Central and Southern Plains, declines in rainfall means crop yields will be reduced.

Examples from report:

-- In the Northern Plains, warmer winters mean that there may be a reduction in heating demand, but it might be outweighed by greater demand for air conditioning during warmer summers.

-- In the Central and Southern Plains, ""the climate impacts of shifting from irrigated to dryland agriculture would reduce crop yields by about a factor of two.""

-- Plants and animals adjust to rising temperatures by adjusting their ranges, but that is becoming more difficult. For example: ""The historic bison herds migrated to adapt to climate, disturbance, and associated habitat variability, but modern land-use patterns, roads, agriculture, and structures inhibit similar large-scale migration.""

-- Native American communities face physical and political constraints as the climate changes: ""Tribal members have reported the decline or disappearance of culturally important animal species, changes in the timing of cultural ceremonies due to earlier onset of spring, and the inability to locate certain types of ceremonial wild plants.""

MIDWEST

The Midwest is home to one of the country's treasures, the Great Lakes. Climate change, however, means that the ecosystem might see changes such as increased invasive species and harmful algae, and declining beach health. On the flipside, less ice on the lake could increase the shipping season.

As in other regions, the growing season stands to be lengthened because of the climate change, but again, it risks being offset by extreme weather events such as freezes that ruin crops.

Examples from report:

-- The Midwest growing season lengthened by almost two weeks since 1950.

-- The longer growing season can be offset by extreme weather, such as freezes and springtime cold outbreaks.

-- The frequency of major heat waves in the Midwest has increased over the past 60 years.

-- ""One study projected an increase of between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year from heat wave-related mortality in Chicago alone by 2081-2100.""

-- ""The Great Lakes, North America's largest freshwater feature, have recently recorded higher water temperatures and less ice cover as a result of changes in regional climate.""

SOUTHEAST

The Southeast -- known for its beaches, its seafood and ports, and as home to two of the nation's major cities -- Atlanta and Miami -- could face risks due to climate change. Sea-level, rise, especially, can affect the region, as well as extreme weather such as hurricanes and heat spells. The risk is intensified in that so many cities, roads, energy facilities and water supplies are on the coast.

The hot weather is only going to get hotter, though the increases for this region are smaller than for some others.

Examples from report:

--North Carolina is raising the roadbed of U.S. Highway 64 across the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula on the coast by four feet, which includes 18 inches to allow for higher future sea levels.

-- ""Louisiana State Highway 1, heavily used for delivering critical oil and gas resources from Port Fourchon, is literally sinking, resulting in more frequent and more severe flooding during high tides and storms.""

-- Utilities will be under more pressure as rising seas means saltwater can contaminate freshwater supplies.

-- The summer heat will continue to reduce crop productively and damage crops, as happened in Georgia in 2007, when a drought cost $339 million in losses.

NORTHEAST

New York. Washington. Some of the country's most important cities are categorized together in the climate report under the Northeast region. The governmental and financial hubs of the United States will have to withstand heat waves, downpours, and a rising sea level.

The Northeast is a highly-urbanized region, where the heat and other climate factors can take a toll on the population.

Already, there are examples of cities in this region incorporating the risk into their planning. Industries such as agriculture and fishing will be tested, and farmers can choose to explore alternate crops, but this is not easy or cheap.

Examples from report:

-- ""One recent study projected that temperature changes alone would lead to a 50% to 91% increase in heat-related deaths in Manhattan by the 2080s.""

-- Don't forget about rural areas. Places where air conditioning is not prevalent because heat waves are rare suddenly become vulnerable when such heat events become more frequent.

-- ""In New York State, two feet of sea level rise is estimated (absent adaptation investment) to flood or render unusable 212 miles of roads, 77 miles of rail, 3,647 acres of airport facilities, and 539 acres of runways.""

-- Higher ocean temperatures mean that commercially important fish will be pushed northward. This means fisheries that depend on cod and lobster face significant declines.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['report', 'vulnerable', 'heat', 'region', 'change', 'countries', 'photos', 'risk', 'climate', 'breaking', 'hide', 'caption']", 
21,21,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Extinction stalks Myanmar's forests - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2014-05-extinction-stalks-myanmar-forests.html,"A worker carries a saw where teak trees once grew in the Bago Region of Myanmar after the land was scorched ahead of replanting, April 5, 2014

Ashen earth strewn with the limbs of once-mighty trees is all that is left of the fearsome forest in central Myanmar that Wa Tote remembers from her youth.

""We would only dare enter in a big group. The forest was deep and had many wild animals. Now we cannot even find a tree's shadow to shelter under when we are tired,"" the 72-year-old told AFP.

At one point tigers were so common in the area that their bones were traded cheaply. Now they have vanished into memory.

Large swathes of the undulating landscape of the Bago mountains have been stripped bare by logging firms over recent years and the last remnants of wood are being burnt.

Locals say there are plans to replant the area with valuable teak trees—though even if they do, these will take up to 80 years to reach maturity.

Logging in Myanmar exploded under the former junta, as the generals tossed aside sustainable forestry practices in their thirst to cash in on vast natural resources.

Experts say an insatiable world appetite for precious hardwoods is threatening rare species and helping to drive deforestation in one of the last major areas of tropical forest in Asia.

The country lost almost 20 percent of its forest cover between 1990 and 2010, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Widespread degradation of the most densely wooded areas means that so-called ""closed forest"" more than halved in size, from 30.9 million to 13.4 million hectares.

Experts say corruption and poor protection have enabled rampant illegal logging that lines the pockets of crony businessmen, soldiers and rebels groups alike.

A quasi-civilian government that replaced outright military rule in 2011 has sought to stem the flood of timber from the country with a ban on the export of raw logs which took effect on April 1.

""Our ban will be very effective. There will be cutting, distribution and finishing of timber products locally, so that we can also increase employment opportunities,"" said the director general of the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry, Tin Tun.

Wildlife group WWF said the biggest driver of forest loss has been large-scale conversion for agriculture, often after woodland is degraded by logging or the collection of wood for fuel.

A worker clears the area where teak trees once grew in the Bago Region of Myanmar after the land was scorched ahead of replanting, April 5, 2014

It welcomed the export ban and said the government has also slashed quotas for teak and other hardwoods by 60 percent and 50 percent respectively for the coming fiscal year compared to 2012/13.

""But given the high volume of illegal logging and exports in Myanmar, it will take a long time before we see how effective the ban will be,"" said WWF's Myanmar conservation programme manager Michelle Owen.

Appetite for destruction

In mountainous northern Myanmar close to the Chinese border, logging roads score the landscape as firms drive ever deeper into pristine forests.

""Stopping logging has to happen now,"" said Frank Momberg of conservation group Flora and Fauna International, which is struggling to protect the newly discovered and critically endangered Myanmar snub nosed monkey.

There are thought to be barely 300 of the flat-faced primates left in the dense forests of Kachin state at the eastern tip of the Himalayas.

Large scale mechanical felling is stripping even steep hillsides, with the loss of tree cover causing landslides and further environmental destruction, conservationists warn.

Chinese workers have flooded into the area, fuelling demand for the monkeys to be hunted for food and traditional medicine, Momberg said.

Other species also inhabit the threatened forests, including the red panda, Blyth's Tragopan pheasant and the Takin, known as a goat antelope.

""A complete ecosystem is being destroyed by this radical logging,"" Momberg said.

He said the loggers are supplying rare woods for a furniture industry in Tengchong, in China's Yunnan province, using maple trees to make delicate carved tables and protected Taiwania conifers for ""luxurious coffins"".

Flora and Fauna is setting up the approximately 250,000 hectare Imawbum national park with Myanmar's forestry department and have created hunting-free zones with the support of local villages.

'Extinction frontier'

China recorded importing 10 million cubic meters of round logs from its impoverished neighbour between 2000 and 2013—almost twice Myanmar's officially registered global export trade of 6.4 million cubic meters for the period, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) campaign group.

Some 84 percent of logs imported into China went by land, despite longstanding rules barring exports from any other route than through Myanmar's Yangon and Dawei ports, making them ""legally questionable at best and downright illegal at worst,"" the EIA said.

In a recent report based on Myanmar forestry documents and global trade data, the EIA said the country was believed to have exported up to 3.5 times more logs than the volumes officially recorded between 2000 and 2014.

""Such a gap is indicative of widespread criminality and corruption in Myanmar's timber sector,"" the report said, estimating this vast shadow industry was worth up to $5.7 billion.

And despite the export ban, trucks loaded with logs were seen around the Yangon port after April 1, while more than 60 tonnes of illegal timber were recently found in trucks disguised as anti-logging festival floats.

Tony Neil, forest governance advisor at Myanmar environmental group EcoDev, said the current dry season has seen an ""unprecedented"" amount of timber crossing the China-Myanmar border, with several hundred trucks a day making the journey.

Demand is driven from all over the world, with timber ""laundered"" through ports in Malaysia and Singapore and the price of prized logs such as rosewood shooting up.

""It's like an extinction frontier,"" he said.

Community leaders in the remote community of 2,000 asked the federal and Ontario governments to help move all those residents who haven't already been relocated said Andrew Morrison, a spokesman for Ontario's Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services.

""All the residents of Kashechewan will be moved in the course of the next day or so,"" Morrison said in a phone interview late Sunday.

""We going to continue with more flights (Monday)"" he said, adding flights were to resume ""first thing"" in the morning.

The federal and Ontario governments were involved in the efforts to move the remaining residents from the community located on the shores of James Bay, he said.

Community leaders in Kashechewan declared a state of emergency this weekend due to rising waters on the Albany River.

Roughly 600 people were relocated to Thunder Bay and Greenstone on Saturday and Sunday despite poor weather on Sunday that hampered evacuation efforts.

The community has faced rising flood waters for several days. Last week some residents were forced from their homes and moved to communities further south but were allowed to return as the situation eased.

The situation, however, was expected to get worse, prompting the expanded evacuation, Morrison said.

23,23,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Reading Noah's Flood and other ancient near-Eastern literature - Jamaica Observer,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/reading-noah-s-flood-and-other-ancient-near-eastern-literature_16633044,"





ONE of Dr Michael Abraham's clients called my attention to his recent column on Noah and the flood, and based on her testimony I regard Dr Abraham as a sincere seeker-after-truth.







It needs to be hammered home to everyone (Christian and critic alike) that we cannot use our likes or dislikes, our belief or disbelief in the content of a text to decide on the genre of that piece of ancient literature. The advice of world-renowned specialists should be useful.







Kenneth Kitchen is professor emeritus of egyptology and honorary research fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics, and Oriental Studies, University of Liverpool, England. After providing a summary comment on the lengths of the various flood accounts from the ancient near-East, he informs ""...the Sumerians and Babylonians of c 2000/1800 BC believed so firmly in the former historical occurrence of such a flood — in a land plagued by floods until modern times — that they inserted it into the Sumerian King list, and not merely in their epic tales. In the second and final form of that list, the flood was a benchmark between kings before, and kings after, the flood. Thus...it is not surprising to find authorities in Mesopotamian archaeology and history such as [Sir Max] Mallowan or [William] Hallo seriously essaying to date the flood of tradition. Pure fiction hardly seems likely, as a solution."" (In his 1977 book The Bible In Its World, p 30)







In a similar vein, Walter C Kaiser Jr, distinguished professor of Old Testament, advises concerning Genesis 1-11: ""The bulk of Genesis 1-11 is in narrative form; not poetic narrative, such as some of the OT [Old Testament] prophets exhibit, but prose narrative. Poetic narrative would provide for forms such as myths, sagas, legends, anecdotes, and various other types of tales, but Genesis 1-11 does not give any of the indicia that would allow for these types of narratives."" (In his 2001 book The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable & Relevant? p 81)







Dr Abrahams' piece was quite interesting and humourous but, though he may not know it, every single one of his queries has been plausibly answered ages ago. If the goodly doctor would oblige with his mailing details I would send him a gift copy of the 1996 delightful book Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study by J Woodmorappe.







Rather than treat Noah as 'fool-fool', we should attribute basic common sense to him and read the biblical texts carefully and many puzzles disappear. As I urged in a media dialogue donkey's years ago ""the Ark was not a canoe..."". As researcher Jonathan Sarfati observed: ""The Ark measured 300 x 50 x 30 cubits (Genesis 6: 15), which is about 450 x 75 x 45 feet...so its volume was 1.54 million cubic feet. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent volume of 522 standard American railroad stock cars, each of which can hold 240 sheep. Most vertebrates are actually rather small (rodents, lizards, birds), and the median size would have been that of a rat. If the animals were kept in cages with an average size as large as 1 cubic metre, the 16,000 animals would only have occupied 16,000m3, a little over one entire deck."" (In his very commendable 2004 book Refuting Compromise, p 275).



If you are wondering about Sarfati's number of animals, bear in mind that even we proud moderns do not know for sure how many species of land vertebrates (the only kind brought by God to Noah, see Genesis 6: 20) there are, or were at any time in history. Even if Noah selected the animals he would be sensible enough to choose the infants of species or families plus; even dinosaurs are not all huge and they all grow over time. Taking care of waste and smell could possibly be dealt with by ""sloped floors or slatted cages, where the manure could fall away from the animals and be flushed away — plenty of water around! — or be destroyed by vermicomposting (...by worms), which would also provide earthworms as a food source...absorbent material (for example, sawdust, softwood shavings, and especially peat moss) could have reduced the moisture content and hence the odor."" (Sarfati, p 276)







The post-flood spread of certain animals can be adequately explained by an appeal to plate tectonics (catastrophic or uniformitarian) as the once connected earth separated into continents (see J Beard, 'How a Supercontinent Went to Pieces', New Scientist 137: 19 (January 16, 1993).







The modern critic's rejection of the historicity of biblical accounts that contain divine intervention may be understandable, but not excusable. The Merneptah stele, like the Bible, provides evidence of divine intervention in a historical narrative. British egyptologist and linguist Kenneth Kitchen says: ""The support of deity is repeatedly invoked in what are otherwise straightforward historical accounts, because that is simply how the ancients saw their world. Again, the Ten-Year Annals of Mursil II are a good example among very many. This feature does not imply non-historicity, either outside the Hebrew Bible or inside it."" (On the Reliability of the Old Testament, 2003, 175) — This book is a goldmine of information.

China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Americas is ramping up its hiring of locals in the Caribbean, as work on a number of infrastructure development projects across the region are now in high gear. To this end, hundreds of Grenadians will soon be employed by CHEC as the company has been engaged by the Grenadian Government to expand and upgrade the Lauriston Airport in Carriacou, and the Maurice Bishop International Airport (MBIA) in St George's.

Similarly, in the Bahamas, CHEC will be partnering with the Bahamian Government to host a job fair to hire local workers for the ground breaking of the $39 million North Abaco Port project scheduled to begin in two months.

geotechnical surveys

CHEC has already mobilised its engineers, who are on the ground in Grenada doing the required geotechnical surveys. These studies aim to answer questions related to the length and direction of the runway, the placement of aircraft aprons, the terminal building and the fire station, among other features of the airport.

This follows the soon-to-be-completed flood-mitigation project, one which received raving reviews from the Grenadian Ministry of Communication, Works and ICT. Aeronautical studies are being conducted to determine whether the runway will be able to accommodate aircrafts that are the size of a LIAT 72 seater. These aeronautical studies will take into consideration wind direction and speed, elements which will have direct impact on flight landing and take-off.

Hon Elvin Nimrod, deputy prime minister and parliamentary representative for Carriacou and Petit Martinique, remarked that ""this project will provide easier access for travel to and from Grenada, it will allow aircrafts to land at night, and passengers arriving on international flights to come to Carriacou immediately, and very importantly, it will open up the door for investment and expansion in the tourism and agricultural industry"".

26,26,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Flirting with disaster - Sydney Morning Herald,https://www.smh.com.au/national/flirting-with-disaster-20140511-383ju.html,"Yet last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released two new reports. The first details the impacts of global warming. Among the biggest risks for Australia are more deaths and damage caused by heatwaves and bushfires, and increasing frequency and intensity of floods. The report warns of diminishing agricultural production, less fresh water and increasing threats to coastal infrastructure caused by rising seas. A 1.1-metre sea level rise - possible by the end of the century - ''would affect over $226 billion of assets'' including nearly 300,000 homes. The IPCC's other new report says global greenhouse gas emissions rose nearly twice as fast in the past decade than during the 30 years before, and current reduction targets aren't enough: we're still on course for 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century. The World Bank has warned that, if the worst comes to pass, ''there is no certainty that adaptation to a 4-degree world is possible''. The Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Research was established by the state Labor government in 2009. In this week's budget, the Napthine government did not extend its funding. It will close at the end of next month. State Environment Minister Ryan Smith declined to be interviewed for this article.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott's controversial response to the recent IPCC report, meanwhile, was this: ''Australia is a land of droughts and flooding rains,'' he said. ''Always has been, always will be.'' Earlier this year, the federal Attorney-General's Department sounded a similar alarm to the business roundtable. ''Existing funding arrangements for natural disasters present a significant fiscal risk for the Commonwealth,'' it told an inquiry into public infrastructure. Those warnings have now been heeded, in part. On April 28, the federal government issued the terms of reference for an inquiry into the way we spend money on natural disasters. It will be conducted by the Productivity Commission, with a final report by the end of the year. However, there's no mention of climate change in the terms of reference for the inquiry. The risks are not just borne by the Commonwealth. In Victoria, the state Treasury estimates that the government has spent $4 billion in the past decade responding to bushfires, floods and droughts. A recent report by Friends of the Earth suggested an even higher figure, at more than $6.7 billion, as well as private insurance payouts of more than $13 billion over that decade.

The biggest challenges lie within existing neighbourhoods, according to the disaster roundtable's research. It says our existing buildings must be retrofitted or, if necessary, relocated, with monitoring done by councils. In a worst-case scenario, it says, a bushfire could hit the suburbs of Melbourne's northern fringe, cutting critical electricity lines and contaminating some of the city's drinking water supplies. We should, it says, be equipping those homes for bushfire resilience - sealing gaps and vents, installing sprinkler systems, clearing around houses - and electricity wires should be buried. For now, however, it seems we're only making things worse. When disasters do strike, we build back the way things were. Reconstruction to a higher standard is known as ''betterment''. The term has been included in the national disaster relief program since 2007. But according to the Attorney-General's Department, only one betterment project has been funded since then. Meanwhile, the federal government poured $5.6 billion into reconstruction after the Queensland floods. ''Those billions of dollars have largely been wasted because there was no requirement to spend in a way to reduce the risk of those impacts happening again,'' says Dr Jamie Pittock, a flooding and climate change expert from Australian National University.

In comparison, the federal government's spending on preventing disaster - through the National Disaster Resilience Fund - totals only $52.2 million over two years. Pittock says the mistakes of early settlers are being repeated. ''Across Australia we're seeing poor state government regulations allowing local governments to develop land that should never be developed,'' he says. Climate change makes this problem much, much worse: many of these threats are beginning to come harder and faster. We've built homes, towns and suburbs in locations at risk of disaster and those risks are rising. The outgoing director of the Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Research , Professor Rod Keenan, says we have made progress adapting to some aspects of the climate threat. The long drought and the scorching Black Saturday summer prompted gains in water efficiency, along with better heatwave warnings and bushfire responses. But overall, we're still beset by the ''notion that 'she'll be right, we've always had disasters and we'll deal with them when the time comes','' Keenan says, ''rather than anticipating and planning to avoid the worst impacts.''

Even when we do consider the threat of floods and fires, we're neglecting to account for the way global warming alters the risks. When Pittock and his colleagues analysed four major reviews commissioned after the 2010-11 floods, they found that the documents ''virtually ignored the issue of climate change and its impact on flooding; some reports didn't refer to it at all''. Pittock says our estimates of flood frequencies are already unreliable and climate change makes them even less certain. This matters because it makes hard defences such as levees, which are often favoured by governments and insurers, more risky. ''If you miscalculate or are over-optimistic about flood frequency, you can make the situation far worse,'' he says. The better alternative is to allow rivers room to flood, while relocating or raising infrastructure and homes. ''Countries like the US, the Netherlands and China are pulling down levee banks,'' he says. ''It's about time Australia learnt from that. There's an upfront cost, but once you've invested in a more resilient strategy, the benefits accrue over decades or longer.'' Professor Keenan says he would like to see communities holding informed discussions to pinpoint local risks and responses. Governments could fund their adaptation ideas by bringing forward recovery spending. ''This matters because we can save lives,'' he says. ''We can reduce the impact of disasters on people's livelihoods. And we can reduce the financial impact on the state government, so it can continue to spend money on hospitals and schools and public transport services.

''It's far more sensible to invest a smaller amount of money now, rather than pay out more down the track when disasters happen.'' Keenan says while it's disappointing that the state government hasn't allocated funding to his centre, he's hopeful it might have a change of heart. But Professor Jean Palutikof, the head of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, funded by the federal government and based at Griffith University, cautions that it is very hard to put money into preparation for a disaster, ''because no government can easily justify the expenditure on something that hasn't happened''. Her words are borne out by the state government's Climate Change Adaptation Plan, released just over 12 months ago. It allocated only $6 million in new spending, mostly grants to local councils. The plan also failed to impose any requirement that climate change be taken into account in planning or infrastructure decisions. It won't be revised until 2016. Creswick flooded three times in the disastrous summer of 2010 and 2011. The deluge took the small town, north-east of Ballarat, by surprise. But its predicament - both before and afterwards - illustrates the challenges replicated around the country. In the 1850s, settlers had diverted the creek so they could extend the main street.

''The lower end of town is built just about entirely on the flood plain, and no one realised,'' says Don Henderson, the mayor of Hepburn Shire and a Creswick builder. The council was ''totally unprepared'' for the floods, he says, as were the catchment management authority and emergency services. Years on, the floods' consequences have lingered. Some insurers no longer offer policies for low-lying homes. A council flood recovery office, opened on the main street, has only just closed its doors. It guided reconstruction works worth $30 million across the shire, including levee banks along the Creswick Creek, only just completed. For the council, the influx of federal cash has seemed like an act of God. Although only required to rebuild as things were, it has made a point of lifting its standards, Henderson says. For instance, it could have never have afforded to rip out the drains under local roads and replace them with bigger ones. ''With the recovery funding, we were able to say, 'Yes, this caught us with our pants down, but into the future we're designing this town to be resilient'.'' Even so, the new level of flood protection - decided in consultation with the community - leaves some townsfolk exposed. Like so many of our disaster inquiries, the new Creswick flood modelling and mitigation plan doesn't mention climate change, or take the increasing risk of extreme weather into its rainfall predictions or cost-benefit analysis.

Russell Castley lives at Semmens Village, a pocket of 32 public housing units across the creek from the main street. They're vulnerable to rising waters from three directions. During floods, the road becomes submerged, blocking both ways out. ''Really, these units should never have been built here,'' Castley says. He climbs the low mound near his home and points at the gaps. The levee system is designed to guard against a one-in-50 year flood, without accounting for the shifting climate. ''I'm 74 now,'' he says. ''I don't know whether we'll have another flood here in my lifetime. But I think the floods will become more frequent and possibly more violent, and I don't believe this levee bank will protect this complex.'' After consultation on the town's flood plan finished, a team from the Victorian Eco-Innovation Lab, at Melbourne University, arrived with a different approach: scenario planning.

They presented locals with three stories outlining the livelihoods of different people in Creswick in 25 years' time, based on plausible but severe climate projections. Then, they asked how residents wanted to adapt. The responses were distilled into a series of future visions, and displayed online and in shop windows on the main street. In one, the creek is returned to its original course by 2025. Low-lying land becomes a commons and flood-prone houses and businesses are moved uphill to the railway station. In others, the town converts its historic post office to a ''Resilience Centre'' and constructs a water storage network to guard against drought. ''When you've got an uncertain climate and radical changes in the pipeline, our old planning standards become a liability,'' says Che Biggs, who led the research project. ''We don't know the exact likelihood of extreme events in the future and we never will. It's time to stop asking for certainty before we begin to adapt.","Mon, 12 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_620%2C$height_414/t_crop_fill/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_social_wm/l_text:PT%20Sans_41_bold_italic:%20from%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_84%2Cx_288%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/l_text:PT%20Sans_41_bold:%20%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_90%2Cx_375%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/l_text:AbrilTitling-Bold.ttf_83:%202014%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_15%2Cx_274%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/0ab5dff3124f2fa2cfba79342100c57b46bc78fb,"['flood', 'floods', 'risks', 'change', 'disasters', 'adaptation', 'federal', 'state', 'disaster', 'climate', 'flirting']",

The public interest in the state of the natural world stimulated by the winter floods receded almost as quickly as the waters did.

A YouGov poll showed that the number of respondents placing the environment among their top three issues of concern rose from 6% in mid-January to 23% in mid-February. By early April – though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had just published two massive and horrifying reports – the proportion had fallen back to 11%.

Sustaining interest in this great but slow-burning crisis is a challenge no one seems to have mastered. Only when the crisis causes or exacerbates an acute disaster – such as the floods – is there a flicker of anxiety, but that quickly dies away.

Why is it so difficult to persuade people to care about our wonderful planet, the world that gave rise to us and upon which we wholly depend?

And why do you encounter a barrage of hostility and denial whenever you attempt it (and not only from the professional liars who are paid by coal and oil and timber companies to sow confusion and channel hatred)?

The first thing to note, in trying to answer this question, is that the rich anglophone countries are anomalous. In this bar chart (from the New York Times) you can see how atypical the attitudes of people in the US and the UK are. Because almost everything we read in this country is published in rich, English-speaking nations, we might get the false impression that the world doesn't care very much.

Attitudes to climate change. Photograph: NYT/Pew Photograph: NYT

This belief is likely to be reinforced by the cherished notion that we lead the world in knowledge, sophistication and compassion. The bar chart puts me in mind of the famous quote perhaps mistakenly attributed to Gandhi. When asked by a journalist during a visit to Britain, ""What do you think of western civilization?"", he's reputed to have replied, ""I think it would be a good idea.""

Our erroneous belief that we are more concerned about manmade climate change than the people of other nations informs the sentiment, often voiced by the press and politicians, that there's no point in acting if the rest of the world won't play its part. For example, last year the chancellor, George Osborne, remarked:

I don't want us to be the only people out there in front of the rest of the world. I certainly think we shouldn't be further ahead of our partners in Europe.

But we're not ""the only people out there in front of the rest of the world."" In fact we're not in front at all. As this map produced by Oxford University's Smith School suggests, we are some way behind not only some other rich nations but also a number of countries much poorer than ours.

As for the US, Australia and Canada, they are ranked among the worst of all: comprehensively failing to limit their massive contribution to a global problem. We justify our foot-dragging with a mistaken premise. Our refusal to stop pumping so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pure selfishness.

Both the map and the bar chart overlap to some degree with the fascinating results of the Greendex survey of consumer attitudes.

For years we've been told that people cannot afford to care about the natural world until they become rich; that only economic growth can save the biosphere, that civilisation marches towards enlightenment about our impacts on the living planet. The results suggest the opposite.

As you can see from the following graph, the people consulted in poorer countries feel, on average, much guiltier about their impacts on the natural world than people in rich countries, even though those impacts tend to be smaller. Of the nations surveyed, the people of Germany, the US, Australia and Britain feel the least consumer guilt; the people of India, China, Mexico and Brazil the most.

The more we consume, the less we feel. And maybe that doesn't just apply to guilt.

Perhaps that's the point of our otherwise-pointless hyperconsumption: it smothers feeling. It might also be the effect of the constant bombardment of advertising and marketing. They seek to replace our attachments to people and place with attachments to objects: attachments which the next round of advertising then breaks in the hope of attaching us to a different set of objects.

The richer we are and the more we consume, the more self-centred and careless of the lives of others we appear to become. Even if you somehow put aside the direct, physical impacts of rising consumption, it's hard to understand how anyone could imagine that economic growth is a formula for protecting the planet.

So what we seem to see here is the turning of a vicious circle. The more harm we do, the less concerned about it we become. And the more hyperconsumerism destroys relationships, communities and the physical fabric of the Earth, the more we try to fill the void in our lives by buying more stuff.

All this is accompanied in the rich anglophone nations with the extreme neoliberalism promoted by both press and politicians, and a great concentration of power in the hands of the financial and fossil fuel sectors, which lobby hard, in the public sphere and in private, to prevent change.

So the perennially low level of concern, which flickers upwards momentarily when disaster strikes, then slumps back into the customary stupor, is an almost inevitable result of a society that has become restructured around shopping, fashion, celebrity and an obsession with money.

How we break the circle and wake people out of this dreamworld is the question that all those who love the living planet should address. There will be no easy answers.

28,28,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Adapting Agriculture in Disaster-Prone Areas of Bangladesh - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/05/05/adapting-agriculture-in-disaster-prone-areas-of-bangladesh,"Bangladesh has come a long way since the early 1970s, when attaining food security was a distant dream. Now, the country is able to feed its own population. Pockets of extreme poverty still persist though, especially in areas with unfavorable agricultural environments. The Bangladesh Integrated Agricultural Productivity Project (IAPP) aims to enhance the productivity of agriculture, including livestock and fisheries, in pilot areas, which are particularly prone to adverse seasonal weather conditions such as droughts and flash floods.

Challenge

Agriculture provides livelihoods for over 60% of the population of Bangladesh. However, people living in the flash flood and drought prone districts in the northwest and the saline affected tidal surge areas in the south struggle to produce enough food to eat or earn a decent living.

Development indicators show that these regions suffer from higher poverty than the national average. The latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES, 2008) indicates that poverty rate in the northwest is 57% and in the south is 52% against the national average of 40%.

The link between unfavorable agricultural environments, where farmers lack technology, and chronic poverty coupled with food insecurity is abundantly clear in these areas.

Approach

IAPP aims to use technology and training to enhance agricultural production in the flash-flood and drought prone northern districts of Rangpur, Kurigram, Nilfamari, and Lalmonirhat and saline-affected tidal surge areas in the southern districts of Barisal, Patuakhali, Barguna and Jhalokhati. IAPP is expected to benefit about 175,000 crop farmers, 60,000 livestock farmers and 60,000 fish farmers in the selected districts. The intervention is expected to increase rice production from 2,200 kg/ha to 2,700 kg/ha, increase fish harvest from 2,700 kg/ha to 3,400 kg/ha, and increase the yield of milk from 1 liter/cow/day to 2 liters/cow/day.

The project focuses on alleviating poverty and increasing food security through intensification of major crops such as cereals, diversification of high value non-cereal crops such as fruit and vegetables, and development of non-crop agriculture such as fishery, poultry and livestock.

Livelihood field schools improve farmers’ understanding and skills base as well as demonstrate the use of new technologies for those wishing to adapt current technology or adopt new technology to intensify and diversify agricultural yield. IAPP also aims to release new and improved crop varieties and more productive fish species. Finally, by conserving and utilizing surface water, and improving the availability and efficient use of irrigation water, farmers will be able to increase cropping intensity.

In April, the State Duma passed legislation that would require non-Russian tech companies to store all domestic data within Russia for at least six months. And ""Kommersant,"" a well-regarded newspaper,set up by Russian President Vladimir Putin is recommending a system that would allow the government to filter and access all content passing through Russian servers.It is still unclear whether major companies like Google and Facebook will agree to the expensive task of placing servers and data-storage centers inside Russia -- or if Moscow will follow through with blocking access to the sites if they do not.Whatever he decides to do, Putin is representative of an accelerated push by autocratic leaders worldwide to reign in the unwieldy Internet space. But doing so once populations have already experienced the value and convenience of open access can be difficult.RFE/RL takes a look below at some case studies of web censorship -- ranging from the most extreme version of a truly ""sovereign"" web to one of evolving ad-hoc efforts to chip away at Internet freedom.All of these censorship regimes exist with varying degrees of coerced self-censorship brought about by threats of punishment for posting content deemed immoral or harmful to the state. Users and companies are aware that their online activity may be monitored at any time and themselves become players in creating a censorship environment.Operating as a nationwide intranet, a truly sovereign system can only be accessed from within the state. The one standout ""success"" in this complete censorship regime is North Korea's Kwangmyong (Bright) network. There is little information about the network because few people outside the so-called ""hermit kingdom"" have been able to access it. Butby the AP news agency, the system contains up to 5,500 websites that are mostly associated with universities and government-run entities.This type of network is one that can really only work in places where there is a virtual blockade on information from the outside world, such as North Korea or Cuba, which has a similar system.This type of domestic intranet environment is difficult to establish in all but the most oppressive societies because experience with the free-wheeling way the Internet works already exists.China's ""Golden Shield"" project, which blocks and filters content deemed harmful by the ruling Communist Party, has been largely successful because the government decided early on that the Internet was something that needed to be controlled. As Internet use grew rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century, homegrown sites that accepted the authorities' censorship rules -- and assisted in blocking content -- became the norm. While Western companies have struggled to or refused to adapt to the rules governing content-filtering, domestic companies like Baidu, the country's largest search engine, have thrived.Chinese users wishing to access blocked sites can use proxies, which provide access to third-party servers to avoid censors, but because the web already caters to the domestic audiences, most users will not go through the effort of doing so.Iran's censorship of the Internet increased markedly following disputed elections in 2009 that saw thousands of antigovernment protesters flood the streets of Tehran. Access to Western sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube were cut off and in 2011 Iran began work on a ""halal"" network that would exist only within the country. The plan,, was that users would only be able to access content that maintained the appropriate ""ethical and moral level.""Although Tehran says it's still working on this intranet, three years later the country is still relying on censors to blacklist and filter websites deemed threatening to the Islamic republic. Creating an entirely new system without an already existing infrastructure, like in China, has proven to be difficult. And many users still manage to access Western social- networking sites through proxies.Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in an ongoing battle against the ""dark forces"" of the Internet since antigovernment protests swept the country last June. He went on the attack in early 2014 when secret audio recordings were posted online that appeared to incriminate his family in corruption. His government ordered Twitter and YouTube blocked in March. Despite a court order to reverse Erdogan's edict, YouTube is reportedly still inaccessible.Erdogan has viewed the recent success of his party in municipal elections as a mandate to continue the Internet crackdown. Turkey's spy agency was given increased power to access users' data and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have begun to use technology similar to that being used in China to scan and log online activity.At first glance, Russia might seem an appropriate candidate for a Chinese-style firewall. Homegrown Russian sites like the Yandex search engine and Vkontakte, a social network, have larger shares of the Russian market than their Western competitors. But these same companies owe some of their success to foreign practices and investment.Yandex is registered in the Netherlands and is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York. VKontakte's founder fled Russia in April after he said he was forced into giving up his shares in the company to figures close to the Kremlin. Leaders at both companies have complained about the new Internet legislation in Russia potentially harming their businesses.Up until now, Russia has largely targeted individual websites and bloggers, like opposition figure Aleksei Navalny, with shutdowns or punishments. But it seems clear the Kremlin wants to do more.Although a ""sovereign Internet"" may be the Kremlin's ideal, a layered approach -- similar to that seen in Turkey -- where Internet freedoms are slowly stripped away, may be the most likely scenario.","Tue, 06 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/9F8C22EA-EE45-49C4-90E2-824A7844831B_w1200_r1.jpg,"['domestic', 'censorship', 'network', 'russia', 'cheburashka', 'users', 'internet', 'probably', 'russias', 'content', 'access', 'companies', 'options', 'sites']", 
31,31,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Marchionne magic - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/schumpeter/2014/05/07/marchionne-magic,"THE news came almost as an afterthought at the end of a very long day of presentations to investors and journalists. Sergio Marchionne, the boss of Fiat Chrysler (pictured), said that he had extended his contract for two years and will remain at the wheel of the newly merged carmaker until at least 2018. So he will be around to oversee a broad strategic plan that is supposed to deliver a massive boost in sales and match the profitability of the best manufacturers in the business while eliminating the company’s debt. To get there, FCA (as the carmaker wants to be known henceforth) plans to sharpen its brands, unleash a wave of new products and expand its presence in markets both established and emerging, China and India in particular. The plans disabuse those who thought that it was the Italian business that had subsumed Chrysler after its 2009 bankruptcy. Mr Marchionne has high hopes for Alfa-Romeo, Maserati, Fiat and, of course, Ferrari, but it is the American side of the company that is projected to deliver most of the growth. Jeep, in particular, is forecast to grow from last year’s record sales of 731,565 to a full 1.9m by 2018, as FCA aims to sell 7m vehicles compared with 4.4m last year. If it hits that ambitious target the world’s seventh-largest carmaker could move up “one step higher in that ranking” according to Mr Marchionne.

In many ways, Jeep underscores both the firm’s strengths and problems. The carmaker is credited with creating the original sport-utility vehicle and, in the 1980s, moving it from a niche product to mainstream. But a flood of copycats means that Jeep is no longer the leader in the fast-growing SUV segment. Competitors are faring better in China, even though Jeep was the first foreign firm to build vehicles in the country. But Jeeps’ factory in Beijing was kept by the Germans after the break-up of the ill-fated DaimlerChrysler merger in 2007. Last month FCA completed negotiations to start production again in China.

FCA’s new strategic plan has something for every one of its brands. Chrysler will give up any pretence of luxury and concentrate primarily on North American market’s mainstream. The Dodge brand will build on the muscle cars it is primarily known for, even if that means a short-term dip in volumes. Across the Atlantic, Mr Marchionne envisions a massive growth spurt for both Alfa and Maserati. Alfa’s long promised return to the American will start small with the little 4C sports car. But a E5 billion investment will bring eight new Alfas starting in late 2015.

As for the marque that comes first on the corporate masthead, Fiat’s brand boss, Olivier Francois, suggests that it suffers from a “dissociative identity disorder”. It not only attempts to appeal to the mainstream of the European market, but also produces vehicles, such as versions of the pint-sized 500, for which consumers are willing to pay more. With Europe still struggling, and with little sign of a sustained recovery, Fiat will downplay the low-margin mainstream side of its business, at least in the home market.

The breadth of the FCA strategy had come as something of a surprise. Mr Marchionne’s grand vision is expected to propel net earnings from E900m last year to E5 billion by 2018. He himself acknowledged it will be a challenge to fulfil, though even getting close to the target would be a significant achievement.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['magic', 'fiat', 'chrysler', 'business', 'vehicles', 'mr', 'fca', 'carmaker', 'jeep', 'marchionne', 'mainstream']",

In the days and weeks following the floods, volunteers have played an important role in World Vision Solomon Islands emergency response, including packing relief items for affected communities.

ANZ staff in Honiara volunteered with World Vision, packing family kits and shelter kits. Family kits, including items such as buckets, kitchen utensils, soap, mosquito nets and cooking pots, will help people who lost their possessions in the flood. Shelter kits, including items such as a shovel, axe, crowbar, hammer and bush knife, will help families whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged.

“Having staff volunteer with World Vision is a great opportunity to give something back to communities,” said

Geoffrey Buchanan, ANZ Bank Solomon Islands Chief Executive Officer.

ANZ staff were not immune to the effects of the flood. “A number of staff were affected by the flood and didn’t have water. Some ANZ staff lost relatives, homes and food gardens,” said Mr Buchanan. ANZ Panatina branch manager, Barbara Kingsley, one of the volunteers who packed relief kits, recounts her story of the day the floods hit.

“I was very worried that my children would be in danger from the flooding so I drove home. I parked my car on the main road and swam toward my house. The current was so strong that I couldn’t make it. I saw some boys who offered to go to my house and rescue my children. I found a safe place to wait for them. It was a great relief to see the boys carrying my children on their shoulders.

I thought about others who lost their loved ones and how lucky I was. I know there are lots of people out there who are in dire need of food, water and other essential items so I wanted to help,” said Barbara.

Some ANZ volunteers, including John Niuman, helped distribute relief items. “I feel really sad for what is happening. By volunteering I can feel a part of helping people in need,” said John.

“It’s wonderful to have ANZ Bank staff working side-by-side with World Vision staff packing relief items and helping with relief distributions. I extend a big thank you to ANZ Solomon Islands for donating to World Vision’s emergency relief efforts,” said Dr Andrew Catford, World Vision Solomon Islands Country Director.

World Vision is providing relief assistance through a multi-sector response co-ordinated by the Honiara City Council and Guadalcanal Provincial Government, under the guidance of the National Disaster Management Office.

33,33,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Managing the monsoon | Opinion - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/managing-monsoon/,"Forecasts by the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum and the India Meteorological Department indicate that the south-west monsoon rainfall may be deficient. Also, there is a possibility of the evolution of an El Niño event during June to September. There is a 45 per cent probability that central, west, north-west and south India will receive below normal rainfall. There is also a 40 per cent chance that eastern States like Odisha, West Bengal, the north-east, and most of Jammu and Kashmir may get normal rains during the south-west monsoon period. Paddy arrivals in the market are also sluggish, indicating that actual production is either lower than the estimated production of 107 million tonnes of rice, or that some of the stocks is being held back in the anticipation of a higher price.

Enhancing water security

In the current scenario of climate change, predictions of extreme weather events are becoming difficult. In March to April this year, we had unexpected hailstorms and heavy rainfall in parts of central and north-west India. Outside India also, most of California is experiencing extreme drought with storage levels in the major reservoirs as well as lakes well below historic levels. Australia experienced what has been described as the Millennium drought which led to the growth of water markets and to renewed emphasis on water security measures.

In India, unlike in the United States and Australia, agriculture is not just a food producing enterprise but also the backbone of the livelihood security of nearly 60 per cent of the population. Therefore, there is no time to relax in the area of taking anticipatory steps to safeguard food, water, energy and livelihood security in rural India, in the event of an erratic monsoon. We should initiate proactive steps immediately to ensure food and drinking water security for not only people but also for the over one billion farm animal population. Aberrations in monsoon behaviour are not uncommon, having been with us throughout our agricultural history. What is new is the difficulty in forecasting caused by factors coming under the generic title, “Climate change.”

The recent report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of higher mean temperatures and a rise in sea level if we do not take action on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The low carbon pathway of development still remains a topic for academic discussion rather than for political and practical action. International prices of food and other agricultural commodities tend to remain volatile. The right to food enshrined in the National Food Security Act can be implemented only with the help of our farmers, unlike the right to information which can be implemented with the help of files. Right now, the government has enough stock to fulfil the legal obligation of providing 5 kg of wheat, rice or millets per month to nearly 75 per cent of our population. With one widespread drought, the current food stocks may disappear. Even this year, market arrivals of paddy have been as low as 42 per cent in West Bengal, 34 per cent in Bihar and 23 per cent in Odisha. Hence, there is no time to relax in the areas of food production and safe storage

Need for a grain storage policy

Fortunately, we still have a large untapped production reservoir in most foodgrains even with technologies available on the shelf. What is important is the mobilisation of group endeavour among farm families with small holdings in areas such as plant protection, water harvesting and post-harvest technologies. The new government must accord priority to both water security and water use efficiency. Water harvesting in homes, farms and factories must become mandatory. Tamil Nadu has already initiated steps in this direction. The rain-cum-solar energy centre functioning in Chennai is a source of credible public information on rainwater harvesting and solar energy use. Such centres need to be replicated in all our cities, towns and block headquarters.

“ Besides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage

The latest technologies for using the available water in the most efficient manner possible should be adopted. On fertilizer use efficiency, there are technologies such as those developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) in the US which can help improve the efficiency of urea use by about 50 per cent. Methods of managing the triple alliance of pests, pathogens and weeds must be popularised.

Besides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage. In every calamity lies an opportunity for progress. Harvesting of the sun in homes, offices, fields and factories should also become mandatory; it can help increase energy supply in rural and urban areas. At the post-harvest stage, a national grain storage policy with these three components must be adopted — we should promote the use of small storage bins, like the Pusa Bin, at the farm level. Second, we should implement the rural godown scheme for safe storage of foodgrains and perishable commodities at the village level. Such a rural godown scheme was introduced as early as 1979, but the programme has yet to take off in a manner that can make a difference to preventing the loss of food items at the village/block levels. Third, we should establish a national grid of ultramodern foodgrain silos in at least 50 locations in the country, each capable of storing about a million tonnes. Unfortunately, there is still a mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies, with producers and consumers unable to get the full benefit of higher production.

For the food and water security of farm animals, we need to earmark potential areas for establishing cattle camps where the animals can be looked after during a drought emergency. These camps should have access to water. A suggestion I had made over three decades ago that we should identify and establish groundwater sanctuaries at appropriate places is yet to be implemented. These are concealed aquifers which should be tapped only when absolutely essential. Like a wildlife sanctuary, they should be protected from exploitation. The establishment of such sanctuaries — at least one each in the 130 agroclimatic zones generally identified in our country — will help us to save precious cattle and other farm animals, both from distress sale and starvation deaths.

Coarse cereals and food security

As the speaker in the “Sardar Patel Memorial lecture” series on All India Radio, which I delivered in 1973, I had suggested that we should develop drought, flood and good weather codes to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable monsoons and to maximise production in a good monsoon year. The drought code consists of a series of dos and don’ts during deficient rainfall. As in the case of drought and flood codes, seed banks consisting of seeds of alternative crops should be maintained. Seed reserves are as important for crop security as grain reserves are important for food security. For example, during the recent and severe drought in California, it was found that some of the earlier crops like millets had survived with a reasonable yield, while wheat or rice could not withstand the severe drought.

Fortunately in our National Food Security Act, there is provision to procure and supply under the Public Distribution System, local grains like ragi, bajra, jowar and a whole series of minor millets. Since such crops require milling, they have been referred to as coarse cereals. They should be referred to as climate smart nutri cereals. They are now being provided at Rs.1 per kg — an extremely attractive price from the point of view of resource poor consumers. Such underutilised crops are now known to be rich in macro and micronutrients and could help in the fight against protein hunger caused by the deficiency of protein in diets and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B. If the Food Security Act is backed by a nutrition literacy movement, the demand for climate smart nutri-cereals will grow. This will help in promoting the cultivation of crops which may do better under drought conditions.

Toward climate smart farming

In each of the major agroclimatic zones, at least two members (a woman and a man) of every panchayat or local body should be trained to be climate risk managers. They can help the rest of the community in implementing the provisions of the proposed drought, flood and good weather codes. The government has recently introduced a national policy on agroforestry. Agroforestry combines the benefits of carbon sequestration and local food security. The inclusion of fertilizer trees in agroforestry systems can help build soil carbon banks.

This year is the International Year of Family Farming. Family farming is both a way of life and a means to livelihood. India has probably the largest number of family farmers. Our aim should be to make every family farm a climate smart farm, equipped with the knowledge and technologies essential to manage the expected El Niño triggered adverse rainfall conditions.

35,35,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Burning Obama In Effigy Won’t Change US Foreign Policy - VICE News,https://www.vice.com/en/article/j54ad3/burning-obama-in-effigy-wont-change-us-foreign-policy,"On Monday, just a week after President Obama’s visit to the Philippines was marked by protestors burning him in effigy, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines launched two weeks of joint military exercises.

A ceremony at the Philippines military headquarters formally kicked off of Exercise Balikatan 2014 (also known as BK 14), the 30th iteration of the annual collaboration. BK 14 involves some 2,500 US soldiers and 3,000 Philippine personnel, and is scheduled to continue through May 16. As in previous years, it will include joint humanitarian civic assistance (medical, dental, veterinary and engineering civic action projects) and field exercises to promote force interoperability.

While not as large as last year’s record-setting operation, this year’s exercises and ongoing discussions about the US military presence in the Philippines highlight the complex historical relationship between the two countries, particularly on matters related to defense and security.

Counterinsurgency has been and continues to be a key focus for the Philippine military. Although an agreement was signed in January to bring an end to the 40-year Islamic insurgency in the southern Philippines, the success of that agreement is far from assured. One of the biggest elements of BK 14 involves humanitarian missions — which is generally unusual for an annual military exercise. While joint military humanitarian programs have obvious intrinsic benefits and are valuable training for disaster relief, they also help strengthen a country’s unconventional warfare capability. In the case of the Philippines, the humanitarian element helps the government erode support for insurgencies by addressing critical grievances and needs.

In an interview with the Philippine media last year, Brian Goldbeck, the US Deputy Chief of Mission, said that the joint activities included building typhoon- and flood-resistant classrooms. Last year’s exercises also provided free medical services to some 2,700 Filipinos, while another 650 received free dental services. Even the country’s beasts benefited — 2,000 farm animals and household pets were vaccinated.

Since 9/11, the US has provided a great deal of direct support for Philippine counterinsurgency activities. But as the US continues its Asia pivot and the Philippine government embarks on the second year of its military modernization effort, this year’s interoperability exercises also have the important (if unspoken) goal of redirecting the focus to threats outside of the Philippines.

Following the drawdown of US forces in the Pacific after the end of the Cold War — particularly the 1992 ejection of the US from its massive naval and air bases in the Philippines — China has become increasingly assertive about its territorial claims in the South China sea, including claims on some small Philippine islands. In a sign of the escalating tension, the Philippines Maritime Police seized a Chinese fishing boat in a disputed area of the South China Sea on Tuesday.

For more than 50 years, Philippine security planning has relied on partnerships, mainly with the US, to deter the few external threats the country faces. Consequently, the Philippine military never really focused on developing a strong conventional capability. However, rising Chinese influence and activity throughout the Pacific has prompted renewed debates in a number of countries about the future of defense in the region.

The Philippine government attempted to boost its own military immediately following the US withdrawal from Philippine bases. Its first military modernization effort, which began in 1995, was abruptly stopped short by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which took a toll on the balance sheets of many governments. Modernization efforts didn’t resume in the aftermath of the crisis, and the subsequent post-9/11 focus on terrorism — which was pushed by the US in the Philippines and elsewhere — did little to address the country’s conventional military weakness.

A 2012 rearmament effort that began as counterinsurgency operations began to taper off has had some success. The Phillipines recently agreed to purchase 12 FA-50 light attack jets from South Korea as well as upgraded M-113 armored personnel carriers from BAE Systems.

Despite these efforts, China has increased its pressure on Philippine islands in the South China sea, prompting some worry about a potential conflict between China and the Philippines that would implicate the US. The US is sensitive to the need of reassuring allies without inflaming its relationship with China. During his visit, President Obama recently downplayed concerns about defense ties between the US and Philippines, claiming that they weren’t aimed at trying to contain China. This less overtly confrontational position has elicited criticism from some Filipino politicians, who take this less aggressive stance as a sign that the US is wavering in its willingness to fight on behalf of the Philippines.

While some Filipinos continue to be very critical of their country’s relationship with the US, overall attitudes in the country towards the US are quite favorable. A 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project showed that a whopping 85 percent of respondents in the Philippines viewed the US more favorably than those of any other country in the world. A similar question about whether the respondent had favorable attitudes about Americans yielded the same result: 85 percent of Filipinos responded yes, compared with 84 percent of Americans. One area where Filipinos and Americans displayed considerably different opinions was their confidence in the US President; 84 percent of Filipinos had confidence in Obama, versus 57 percent of Americans.

So while demonstrators burning Obama in effigy achieved their proximate goal of getting headlines — something essential in both politics and information warfare — it’s unlikely to affect policy on US-Philippine defense cooperation. Both the security posture of the US in the Pacific and the Philippine defense establishment have and will continue to be too closely aligned to entertain much divergence, especially considering the strong pro-US sentiment in the Philippines.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2014/05/07/hero-original-1399476242.jpg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDI1Nzk3NTAzNDY3NDA2eGg7Y2VudGVyLGNlbnRlciZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoqJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOio,"['policy', 'filipinos', 'china', 'effigy', 'obama', 'philippines', 'south', 'humanitarian', 'joint', 'wont', 'change', 'burning', 'military', 'defense', 'president', 'foreign']",

There is no issue where educated ignorance is on more perfect display than watching the conservative movement confront scientific evidence of climate change. Educated ignorance is not the same thing as the regular kind of ignorance. It takes real talent to master. George F. Will and Charles Krauthammer are two of the intellectual giants of the right, former winners of the Bradley Foundation’s $250,000 annual prize, Washington Post columnists, and Fox News All-Star panelists. They numbered among the select conservative intellectuals chosen to dine with newly elected president Barack Obama in 2009.

On their Fox News All-Star Panel appearance this week, both men discussed the U.S. National Climate Assessment, which they dismissed with various irritable mental gestures. Their evasions and misstatements, clothed in faux-erudition, offer a useful entrance point to study the current state of the right-wing mind.

What follows is an annotated analysis of Will and Krauthammer’s remarks, the intellectual quality of which starts off low, and grows increasingly and even frighteningly so as the program progresses. After a brief introduction of the climate report, we begin with Krauthammer:

What they tell you is that you should be scared about what’s happening today. Of course, if it’s very cold in the winter, they blame it, here in the northeast, they blame it on global warming, and the report says that global warming makes summers hotter and winters are generally shorter and warmer.

In one sentence, Krauthammer claims “they” blame every cold winter on climate change, but does not identify who “they” is. In the next sentence, he correctly says that the climate assessment links climate change with shorter, warmer winters in the United States, negating his previous point.

Any scientific theory that explains everything explains nothing, and no matter what happens in climate is unpleasant, the word for that is weather, it’s attributed to global warming. If we continue global warming up here in the northeast, we’re going to freeze to death.

It is not clear what Krauthammer means when he says climate science “explains everything.” Climate science is an attempt to model the complex impact of heat-trapping gasses in the atmosphere. It does not attempt to explain “everything” more than, say, the Theory of Gravity does. (In fact, it attempts to explain less, as it contains more room for unpredictability.) It is also impossible to understand exactly what Krauthammer’s line about freezing to death even means. The report does in fact describe dangerous and costly impacts in the Northeast:

“Heat waves, coastal flooding, and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region’s environmental, social, and economic systems. This will increase the vulnerability of the region’s residents, especially its most disadvantaged populations. Infrastructure will be increasingly compromised by climate-related hazards, including sea level rise, coastal flooding, and intense precipitation events. Agriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised over the next century by climate change impacts. Farmers can explore new crop options, but these adaptations are not cost- or risk-free. Moreover, inequities exist in adaptive capacity, which could be overwhelmed by changing climate.”

Krauthammer goes on to endorse comments by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:

But the most important element is what McConnell was talking about, the negligible gains. Assume they are right about global warming, assume that it is all caused by man. The United States has reduced carbon emissions since 2006 more than any other country on earth. We are right now at 1992 levels, according to the International Energy Agency, and yet carbon emissions have gone up globally. Why? We don’t control the emissions of the other 96 percent of humanity, especially China and India. As we dismantle the coal plants in our country, China and India together are adding one coal-fired plant every week. The net effect is to shift the U.S. coal energy generating industry from here to India and China. It will have zero effect. If we could have a pact with other countries in which everybody would reduce their emissions, I would sign on. In the absence of it, all that we’re doing is committing economic suicide in the name of do-goodism that will not do an iota of good.

Krauthammer asserts, with an air of unassailable confidence, that reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will have no significant impact on worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, because “we don’t control the emissions of the other 96 percent of humanity.” Krauthammer’s implication that 96 percent of the greenhouse gas problem lies beyond the direct control of the United States is untrue, since, while the United States may only account for 4 percent of the world’s population, it emits 16 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions:

The strategy to limit climate change does not assume that limiting American emissions is a sufficient step to mitigate catastrophic climate change. It assumes it is a necessary step to mitigate catastrophic climate change. Countries like India and China have, in fact, taken steps to reduce their energy intensiveness. Given that those countries’ per capita greenhouse gas emissions are a small fraction of ours, there is no plausible or defensible path to securing an international agreement without a commitment by the countries with the highest per-capita emissions, like the U.S., to participate.

After an interlude from others on the panel, George Will jumps in:

There is, however, no evidence for the increase in extreme weather.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found otherwise in 2011:

There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is likely that anthropogenic influences have led to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. There is medium confidence that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in mean sea level.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded, somewhat more conclusively, “Human influences are having an impact on some extreme weather and climate events.”

Will continues:

I own a home on an island in South Carolina looking south in the direction of hurricanes, and after Katrina I was really interested when they said this is a harbinger of increased hurricane activity, which since then has plummeted.

The chance of a hurricane striking a given location is extremely variable. The lack of major hurricanes striking the United States since 2005 is attributable to luck. It does not contradict any major scientific conclusions about climate change.

Now, Mr. Holdren, who introduced this report, has his own record of very interesting failed forecasts, not to mention Al Gore, who in 2008 said by 2013, for those of you keeping score at home, that’s last year, the ice cap in the North Pole would be gone. It’s not.

It is not clear what failed Holdgren forecasts Will is referencing. Al Gore, in his 2007 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, said, “One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years.” As implied by Gore’s remarks, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding the pace of polar ice melting. There is agreement about the general trend, which is clearly in the direction of more melting:

Gore has, at times, highlighted the more pessimistic studies, which predict ice-free summers in “five to seven years.” One time he paraphrased the prediction as “five years,” leaving out the “to seven,” and this has become a major talking point among climate-science skeptics.

Will continues:

Now, there is, as Charles says, the policy question is how much wealth do we want to spend directly or in lost production in order to have no discernible measurable effect on the climate? People say, well, what about this report? There is a sociology of science. Scientists are not saints in white laboratory smocks. They have got interests like everybody else. If you want a tenure-track position in academia, don’t question the reigning orthodoxy on climate change. If you want money from the biggest source of direct research in this country, the federal government, don’t question its orthodoxy. If you want to get along with your peers, conform to peer pressure. This is what’s happening.

Will is arguing that climate scientists have been massively corrupted by federal funding and peer pressure. (“They have got interests like everybody else.”) He does not consider the countervailing power of opposing financial interests that might lure scientists to question of the scientific consensus, such as the lucrative funding made available in the right-wing think-tank world. He likewise discounts the possibility that scientists would find the lure of being proven eventually correct to be a powerful reputational incentive, let alone that they would actually care enough about being right to disregard social and financial pressure. If Will has any specific sense of how these social pressures survived the rigors of the scientific method and peer review, he does not explicate them.

Will is then asked about the 97 percent of climate scientists who share the consensus analysis, and replies:

Who measured it? Where did that figure come from? They pluck these things from the ether. I do not.

It comes from a peer-reviewed study which found that 97.1 percent of scientific papers taking a position on anthropogenic climate change “endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.” Will continues:

The New Yorker magazine, which is impeccably upset about climate change, recently spoke about the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as “the last word on climate change.” Now, try that phrase, “the last word on microbiology, quantum mechanics, physics, chemistry.” Since when does science come to the end? The New Yorker has discovered the end of this. Who else has?

Will is referring to a blog post that appeared in The New Yorker last October, and hinging a great deal of his argument on a pedantic argument over what “the last word” means. Nothing in the post states or implies that the field of climate science will cease to grow and evolve. It does imply that, like microbiology, quantum mechanics, physics, and chemistry, its basic findings are a matter of consensus.

A-ha — we knew science was biased! Photo: Aude Guerrucci-Pool/GettyImages

At this point, the host asks Krauthammer if he, too, scoffs at the 97 percent figure. Krauthammer indeed scoffs:

99 percent of physicists [were] convinced that space and time were fixed until Einstein working in a patent office wrote a paper in which he showed that they are not. I’m not impressed by numbers. I’m not impressed by consensus. When I was a psychiatrist, I participated in consensus conferences on how to define depression and mania. These are things that people negotiate in the way you would negotiate a bill, because the science is unstable, because in the case of climate, the models are changeable, and because climate is so complicated.

It is hard to dispute this except to note that Krauthammer here has taken a radically skeptical position not merely on climate science, but on all science. His argument implies that no scientific argument merits respect. Given the provisional and socially constructed peer pressure driving the consensus theory of aerodynamics, it is amazing that he is willing to travel in an airplane.

Krauthammer continues:

The idea that we who have trouble forecasting what’s going to happen on Saturday in the climate could pretend to be predicting what’s going to happen in 30, 40 years, is absurd.

Krauthammer is confusing the difference between modeling the long-term impact of heat-trapping gasses with short-term atmospheric fluctuations. Scientists are not forecasting precise daily temperatures decades in advance.

Krauthammer proceeds to make his most radical argument against science:

And you always see that no matter what happens, whether it’s a flood or it’s a drought, whether it’s one — it’s warming or cooling, it’s always a result of what is ultimately what we’re talking about here, human sin with the pollution of carbon. It’s the oldest superstition around. It was in the Old Testament. It’s in the rain dance of the Native Americans. If you sin, the skies will not cooperate. This is quite superstitious, and I’m waiting for science which doesn’t declare itself definitive but is otherwise convincing.

Now climate science is not merely corrupt, but akin to superstition. Both he and Will return to this astonishing claim.



Our scientific inquiry has reached very different results. Photo: Andrew Burton/2013 Getty Images

At this point, Will returns to his argument that climate science is fundamentally corrupt:

A moment ago, we had a report here on our crumbling infrastructure, gave it a D, emergency. Who wrote it? As we said on there, it was written by civil engineers, who said, by golly, we need more of what civil engineers do and are paid to do. Again, there is a sociology of science, there is a sociology in all of this, and engaging the politics of this, we have to understand the enormous interests now invested in climate change.

Will here does not specifically extend his critique of climate science to all sciences, but it surely applies. All fields of sciences have a “sociology”; all receive government grants. If those things can induce climate scientists to manufacture a false consensus, the same effect can work just as well in any other scientific field.

To watch Will and Krauthammer grasp for rationales to cast doubt on an established scientific field merely because its findings pose a challenge to their ideological priors is a depressing, and even harrowing, study in the poisonous effects of dogma upon a once-healthy brain. They have amassed an impressive array of sound bites and factoids, and can render them with convincing gravitas, and yet their underlying reasoning is absolutely bonkers. The analogy Krauthammer suggests of the rain man — an authority figure possessed of commanding prestige despite lacking even rudimentary analytic powers — turns out to be apt; only he is describing himself.","Fri, 09 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5cd/0a4/eadf44f32d72ce9af7a2aeadcfe2b58ab7-20-fox-news-hq.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,"['wrong', 'panel', 'global', 'does', 'scientific', 'krauthammer', 'science', 'emissions', 'fox', 'scientists', 'change', 'esteemed', 'climate', 'warming', 'concludes']",

38,38,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Our lonely home in nature | Opinion - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/our-lonely-home-nature/,"The tornadoes that have been devastating parts of the South and Midwest, just weeks after a deadly mudslide in Washington, demonstrate once again the unimaginable power of nature.

After each disaster, we grieve over the human lives lost, the innocent people drowned or crushed without warning as they slept in their beds, worked in their fields or sat at their office desks. We feel angry at the scientists and policy makers who didn’t foresee the impending calamity or, if forewarned, failed to protect us. Beyond the grieving and anger is a more subtle emotion. We feel betrayed. We feel betrayed by nature.

Aren’t we a part of nature, born in nature, sustained by the food brought forth by nature, warmed by the natural sun? Don’t we have a deep spiritual connection with the wind and the water and the land that Emerson and Wordsworth so lovingly described, that Turner and Constable painted in scenes of serenity and grandeur? How could Mother Nature do this to us, her children?

Yet despite our strongly felt kinship and oneness with nature, all the evidence suggests that nature doesn’t care one whit about us. Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen without the slightest consideration for human inhabitants.

I first encountered the insensible power of nature during a two-week sailing trip with my wife in the Greek isles. It was just the two of us on a small boat. For the first few days of the voyage, traveling south along the coast from Piraeus to Cape Sounion, we were within sight of land. Then we turned west, toward Hydra. Soon, the land and other boats vanished. All we could see was ocean.

“ Nature is purposeless. Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or terrible, but those feelings are human constructions. Such utter and complete mindlessness is hard for us to accept. We feel such a strong connection to nature. But the relationship between nature and us is one-sided

At first, I felt elation. Then I felt fear. Because during the summer season, the Aegean Sea is plagued by a fierce, dry wind called the meltemi, which can appear without warning in clear air and be upon you in minutes with great waves and gales. At any moment, a wall of water and wind could have lunged from the horizon, washed over the boat, and drowned my wife and me. I realized that there was no compassionate overseer or oceanic consciousness to prevent that from happening. To the vast expanse of water, my wife and I were just additional pieces of flotsam and jetsam.

Our comfort with nature is an illusion. Here on earth, even with our earthquakes and storms, we have no conception of the range and the power of nature. In many other parts of the cosmos, conditions are far more extreme than on earth and quite inhospitable to life. On the planet Mercury, for example, the temperature reaches 800 degrees. On Neptune, it is minus 370. On Uranus, the winds exceed 350 miles per hour. With the recent work of the Kepler spacecraft, searching for planets favorable for life, we can estimate that only about one millionth of one billionth of one per cent of the material of the visible universe exists in living form. From a cosmic perspective, we and all life are the exception to the rule.

For all of recorded history, humankind has had a conflicted view of nature. In ancient times, we made awesome and frightening gods of the natural elements. The Babylonian-Assyrian god of storms, Adad, brought rain to the crops but also caused havoc and death on land and sea. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, both created and destroyed and was sometimes invoked to annihilate one’s enemies. So close to nature are we in some mythologies that human beings are regularly transformed into other animals and even inanimate matter. In Aztec mythology, the twin volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl were once human lovers, later turned into mountains by the gods.

In the other direction, nature is constantly given human qualities. Wordsworth wrote that “nature never did betray the heart that loved her.” Mother Nature has comforted us in every culture on earth. In the 20th and 21st centuries, some environmentalists claimed that the entire earth is a single ecosystem, a “superorganism” in the language of Gaia.

I would argue that we have been fooling ourselves. Nature, in fact, is mindless. Nature is neither friend nor foe, neither malevolent nor benevolent.

Nature is purposeless. Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or terrible, but those feelings are human constructions. Such utter and complete mindlessness is hard for us to accept. We feel such a strong connection to nature. But the relationship between nature and us is one-sided. There is no reciprocity. There is no mind on the other side of the wall. That absence of mind, coupled with so much power, is what so frightened me on the sailboat in Greece.

The recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documents the damage now being done by human-created greenhouse gases and global warming. In reacting to the report, we should not be concerned about protecting our planet. Nature can survive far more than what we can do to it and is totally oblivious to whether homo sapiens lives or dies in the next hundred years. Our concern should be about protecting ourselves — because we have only ourselves to protect us.

Tweets Beat Official Quake Alerts - LiveScience.com,https://www.livescience.com/45385-earthquake-alerts-from-twitter.html,"The fastest earthquake alerts come from social media networks, not the U.S Geological Survey's seismic underground sensors, ongoing research finds.

As soon as the Earth starts rumbling, Twitter users flood the network with pithy, publicly available tweets that the USGS uses to pinpoint an earthquake's source in less than a minute, according to findings presented May 2 at the Seismological Society of America's annual meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. Without Twitter, it takes the USGS anywhere from two to 20 minutes to precisely locate an earthquake and judge its size with seismometers, which are instruments that monitor ground motion.

Twitter has 255 million active users worldwide, and the USGS, using a software tool, tracks the word ""earthquake"" in languages ranging from Tagalog to Spanish. The Twitter conversation ranged from 600 tweets per minute following a magnitude-5.8 earthquake offshore of Java to 4,000 tweets per minute after the 2011 Virginia earthquake to more than 10,000 tweets per minute after the massive 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.

""Frequently, it's the first indication of a widely felt event,"" said Paul Earle, director of operations for the USGS National Earthquake Information Center, who presented the findings. ""People like to talk about earthquakes."" [Image Gallery: This Millennium's Destructive Earthquakes]

Holy $*#&, earthquake!

On average, in the past 10 months, the USGS software tool detected 19 earthquakes a week, or about two to three per day, Earle told Live Science. About half were detected in less than a minute, and 90 percent in less than 2 minutes, he said. The weakest was a magnitude-1.4 quake, and the strongest was a magnitude 8.2. Anyone can see the number of tweets per minute for a recent earthquake by following the USGS Twitter account @USGSted.

However, with a 10 percent error rate, a Twitter app won't replace official earthquake instruments anytime soon. Location accuracy is a major hurdle — just 1 to 2 percent of users tag their tweets with a GPS location, and only 30 to 40 percent add their hometown. And the global seismometer network detects thousands of quakes that would otherwise go unnoticed, such as those on the seafloor. So, what's the point of tracking these tweets?

With Twitter, Earle said, seismologists can guess the size and impact of an earthquake, sometimes even before seismic waves finish rolling through a populated region. Tweets help fill the data gap in regions with a sparse seismic network. The software tool also gives seismologists a head start in manually processing quakes that were widely felt, but might be slow to show up, or too small for the automated network to detect.

Here are some examples:

When a magnitude-4 earthquake shook Maine in October 2012, Earle got the news through Twitter before some New England residents felt the shaking, he said.

Earle said he knew that Chile had just been struck by a powerful earthquake last month because of tweets. Chileans — Twitter's most prolific earthquake tweeters — employ two different words for earthquake: temblor and terremoto. A temblor is an average earthquake, unlikely to cause major damage, whereas terremoto is reserved for really big quakes. And on April 2, when a magnitude-8.2 earthquake hit, the number of people tweeting ""terremoto"" instead of ""temblor"" spiked.

Tweets from Japan immediately after the Tohoku earthquake spanned all of the island of Honshu and southern Hokkaido. The wide coverage prompted the USGS to bring in more staff to analyze the 2011 earthquake — expecting a large impact — because the quake was seismically detected with a location, but no size, after 3.8 minutes. [In Photos: Tohoku Japan Earthquake & Tsunami]

""Twitter provides earthquake detection from an independent source, which is important in a response situation, when you're trying to see if all the observations make sense,"" Earle said. ""We generally get these detections before we have actual magnitudes, so it gives you an idea of what you're looking at.""

Earthquake!

Expanding the network

The USGS is now exploring whether tweets can be used to estimate the intensity of shaking and the extent of earthquake damage, to help first responders. Separately, a team of Stanford University researchers will present a study exploring how analyzing tweets could improve the accuracy of real-time shaking maps at the annual meeting of the National Conference on Earthquake Engineering in July.

The USGS first started testing Twitter earthquake detection in 2008, after Twitter users beat traditional media outlets in reporting the Wenchuan earthquake in China. Researchers built the software with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The tool plucks relevant tweets from the stream of chatter in a manner similar to how automated software picks earthquake waves from seismograms, the graphical output of a seismometer.

To limit false positives, the software discards tweets with links (which are likely to be from someone who wasn't there and is sharing a news story) and tweets longer than seven words. ""In the initial stages, people are tweeting fast and not saying much,"" Earle said. And there's one tired gag involving simultaneous car alarms that apparently never gets old. ""I've collected over 22 million tweets, and one thing I've learned is that people use the same joke about earthquakes over and over again,"" he said.

Three different car alarms are going off outside my building all at once. Did I miss an earthquake?

40,40,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Supreme Court favors environmentalists in urban runoff case - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-supreme-court-water-20140506-story.html,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to review a long-running Los Angeles County case, handing a victory to environmentalists in a battle over polluted urban runoff that fouls Southern California’s coastal waters.

The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling that held the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the county liable for storm water pollution flowing into the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers from the region’s sprawling storm drain system.

The high court’s action does not end the case, however, which will now go back to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for further proceedings.

Despite the lack of finality, environmental attorney Steve Fleischli called the Supreme Court action “hugely significant.”

“The county can no longer deny these violations.... That conversation should now end and we can move toward actually solving this problem,” said Fleischli, water program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Urban runoff is the leading cause of water pollution in Southern California. Water from winter storms and sprinkler runoff picks up a stew of contaminants as it washes over streets, yards and industrial sites into storm drains.

Bacteria from pet waste, copper from auto brake pads and pesticides all spike the runoff, which eventually flows into the ocean.

The NRDC and the environmental group Los Angeles Waterkeeper sued the county in 2008, arguing that it was violating water-quality standards in its storm water permit.

The county countered that it was not the source of pollution, which originates from thousands of sources all over the Los Angeles Basin.

The lawsuit has had a convoluted journey through the court system, including a previous decision by the Supreme Court that reversed a ruling against the county by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The 9th Circuit took the case up a second time, using a different legal theory to once again rule against the county. It was that opinion that the high court let stand Monday.

The U.S. District Court must now decide a remedy in the case, including which entities are legally responsible for the tainted runoff.

“There has been no finding” that the county and flood control district “are responsible for the contamination,” said Howard Gest, outside counsel for the county. He also pointed out that the lawsuit involves a 2001 storm water permit that was updated two years ago with a number of new conditions.

The 2012 permit, which applies to most cities in the county as well as the flood control district, set limits on 33 contaminants, including coliform bacteria, hydrocarbons and lead.

“We’re already working on that,” said Gary Hildebrand, assistant deputy director in the L.A. County Department of Public Works.

For instance, he said cities are adopting low-impact development rules that require large new projects to retain runoff on-site and let it seep into ground.

The county and cities are considering construction of regional infiltration basins to collect runoff to recharge aquifers. They also will encourage the use of green infrastructure, such as using permeable paving in parking lots at schools and other public facilities.

41,41,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Fresh Fatal Accidents Hit North Korean Power Plant Construction - Radio Free Asia,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/baekdusan-songun-05022014175240.html,"More than 20 North Korean workers have died since the end of March while carrying out construction on an accident-ridden hydropower project that has claimed hundreds of lives since work began two decades ago, according to sources in the country.



They were killed in two accidents at the Baekdusan Songun Youth Power Station in Yanggang province, where workers face hazardous conditions and are kept under strict watch to prevent escape, sources said.



Nineteen workers from a special brigade from North Pyongan province died when a spillway tunnel collapsed on March 29, and four from the Nak Won Union Cooperation Regiment died and one was injured in a second collapse more recently, according to a source in the province.



“A spillway tunnel collapsed again,” the source told RFA’s Korean Service on April 26 after the latest accident, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is fortunate that not many lives were lost this time.”



The latest accident was the seventh this year related to tunnel collapses at the site, he said.



The collapses were believed to be linked to nuclear tests in recent years at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility in Yanggang’s neighboring North Hamgyong province that has caused cracks in the bedrock, he said.



Local sources have reported since last year that the nuclear tests had caused collapses that were slowing down progress on the hydropower project, which was started in 1995.



Construction work at the site is a dangerous business, with workers living in fear of accidents after more than 200 deaths at the site in the past six years, sources said.



Dangerous work



“So many lives were lost during the ten years I worked at the Baekdusan Songun Youth Power Station,” said one worker who quit in December last year.



In the worst incident, 226 workers died in 2008 when a spillway tunnel caved in. The area was closed off and their bodies were never retrieved, he said.



A year later, 66 people died and others were injured while repairing a collapsed area in the aftermath of reported February 2009 nuclear tests, he said.



At the construction site, which is led by a youth brigade, two battalions are assigned to watch the sites day and night to prevent workers from escaping, other sources said.



The spillway tunnel areas and workers’ living quarters are fenced in by barbed wire, they said.



“There are no safety measures at the dangerous construction sites, and troops are trying to escape desperately to avoid death,” one said.



Progress on the hydroelectric project, which consists of three power stations in the upper reaches of the Sodu stream, has been slowed by repairs required to the water tunnels.



North Korean state media has lauded the project's construction as a heroic effort, praising workers for their bravery.



In one report, the Korean Central News Agency said the dam’s first power station was completed in December 2010 following a “do-or-die battle” in which workers stayed underwater for more than 70 hours at a time to fight water pouring into a tunnel.



North Korean state media reported in August last year that a dam and surge tank for the second power station had been completed and work was continuing on the third.

Earlier this week, two teams of scientists reported that the Thwaites Glacier, a keystone holding the massive West Antarctic Ice Sheet together, is starting to collapse. In the long run, they say, the entire ice sheet is doomed, which would release enough meltwater to raise sea levels by more than 3 meters.

One team combined data on the recent retreat of the 182,000-square-kilometer Thwaites Glacier with a model of the glacier’s dynamics to forecast its future. In a paper published online today in Science, they report that in as few as 2 centuries Thwaites Glacier’s outermost edge will recede past an underwater ridge now stalling its retreat. Their modeling suggests that the glacier will then cascade into rapid collapse. The second team, writing in Geophysical Research Letters (GRL), describes recent radar mapping of West Antarctica’s glaciers and confirms that the 600-meter-deep ridge is the final obstacle before the bedrock underlying the glacier dips into a deep basin.

Because inland basins connect Thwaites Glacier to other major glaciers in the region, both research teams say its collapse would flood West Antarctica with seawater, prompting a near-complete loss of ice in the area. “The next stable state for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might be no ice sheet at all,” says the Science paper’s lead author, glaciologist Ian Joughin of the University of Washington (UW), Seattle.

“Very crudely, we are now committed to global sea level rise equivalent to a permanent Hurricane Sandy storm surge,” says glaciologist Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, University Park, referring to the storm that ravaged the Caribbean and the U.S. East Coast in 2012. Alley was not involved in either study.

Where Thwaites Glacier meets the Amundsen Sea, deep warm water burrows under the ice sheet’s base, forming an ice shelf from which icebergs break off. When melt and iceberg creation outpace fresh snowfall farther inland, the glacier shrinks. According to the radar mapping released today in GRL from the European Remote Sensing satellite, from 1992 to 2011 the Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 kilometers at its core. “Nowhere else in Antarctica is changing this fast,” says UW Seattle glaciologist Benjamin Smith, co-author of the Science paper.

To forecast Thwaites Glacier’s fate, the team plugged satellite and aircraft radar maps of the glacier’s ice and underlying bedrock into a computer model. In simulations that assumed various melting trends, the model accurately reproduced recent ice-loss measurements and churned out a disturbing result: In all but the most conservative melt scenarios, a glacial collapse has already started and will accelerate rapidly once the glacier’s “grounding line”—the point at which the ice begins to float—retreats past the ridge.

At that point, the glacier’s face will become taller and, like a towering sand pile, more prone to collapse. The retreat will then accelerate to more than 5 kilometers per year, the team says. “On a glacial timescale, 200 to 500 years is the blink of an eye,” Joughin says.

And once Thwaites is gone, the rest of West Antarctica would be at risk.

Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and the lead author of the GRL radar mapping study, is skeptical of Joughin’s timeline because the computer model used estimates of future melting rates instead of calculations based on physical processes such as changing sea temperatures. “These simulations ought to go to the next stage and include realistic ocean forcing,” he says. If they do, he says, they might predict an even more rapid retreat.

Antarctic history confirms the danger, Alley says: Core samples drilled into the inland basins that connect Thwaites Glacier with its neighbors have revealed algae preserved beneath the ice sheet, a hint that seawater has filled the basins within the past 750,000 years. That past flooding shows that modest climate warming can cause the entire ice sheet to collapse. “The possibility that we have already committed to 3 or more meters of sea level rise from West Antarctica will be disquieting to many people, even if the rise waits centuries before arriving.”","Mon, 12 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-icesheet.jpg?itok=ox2YEkGx,"['glaciers', 'glacier', 'thwaites', 'collapsing', 'collapse', 'sheet', 'sea', 'team', 'west', 'ice', 'antarctic', 'university']",

Cagayan de Oro City has been handpicked by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), which spearheaded the world’s premiere conference on cities, as among the nine global intermediate cities.

The other eight cities are Johor Bahru on the straits of Johor separating Malaysia and Singapore; Tetouan in northern Morocco; Uberlandia in the state of Minas Gerais of Brazil; Hunchun in Jilin province of northeast China; Onitsha on the eastern bank of Niger River in Nigeria; Nampula, the third-largest city in Mozambique; Malmo, part of the Oresund region in the south of Sweden; and Santa Marta in the northern Colombian department of Magdalena.

According to Andrew Rudd, urban environment officer of UN-Habitat, the cities were chosen based on their size, fast growth, significance as part of an urban cluster linked to cross-border exchange and geographical variety.

“In short,” he said, “these are the emerging cities of tomorrow.”

‘Edge Cities’

A unique photographic exhibition featuring the nine cities—“Edge Cities”—was showcased at the entrance foyer of the main exhibition hall in Plaza Mayor, an impressive state-of-the-art complex of convention halls, theaters, museums, parks, cafes and restaurants.

The photographs were taken by prize-winning Italian photographer Alessandro Scotti, who organized them in a stop-motion video shown on large flat-screen monitors.

The Cagayan de Oro video begins with shots of people thronging the Bolonsiri cemetery in Camaman-an district during All Souls’ Day last year: families as if on a picnic; a man carrying a shovel; children lost in a sea of tombstones and candle lights.

Onslaught of ‘Yolanda’

Without cheesy sentimentality, the photographs establish at first glance that this is a city grounded in its past, seeking comfort in the rituals not merely of religion but in the cozy embrace of community, and hence can bounce back from its mishaps due to its homegrown resilience. (In the whirl of talks, workshops and presentations at the WUF, it seems “resilience” is the new “sustainability.”)

Scotti told this reporter: “I wanted to explore the dynamics of these cities by investigating their spatial configurations—the way, for instance, public and private spaces are utilized—and, by so doing, capture the spatial relationships that are revealed as well as the stories that they tell of the cities’ density, diversity and opportunity in this critical and interesting phase of their development.”

Scotti’s stay in Cagayan de Oro coincided with the onslaught of Super Typhoon Yolanda, and he documented how the residents of riverside communities were evacuated to higher ground.

In memory

In fact, Scotti did not hesitate to venture into the riverbed, where some people continue to reside.

In the Cala-Cala district, so called because of the way the onrush of water sounds, the photographer found a life-size crucifix guarded by life-size angels. This was a marker in memory of the many residents in the district who were swept away during the Tropical Storm “Sendong” flash flood.

“It was a good thing our house was made of concrete,” said a survivor who made the marker. “A number of our neighbors survived by clambering on up to our third floor.”

The house still stands today, the only domicile in the riverbed.

Christopher Rollo, country program director of UN-Habitat Philippines, said the WUF was established to examine the most pressing issues facing the world today in the area of human settlements, in particular “rapid urbanization and its impact on cities, communities, economies, climate change and policies.”

‘Cities for Life’

Dr. Joan Clos, UN undersecretary general and executive director of UN-Habitat, said the forum, now on its seventh session (hence dubbed WUF7) since it kicked off in 2002 and carrying the theme “Urban Equity for Development—Cities for Life,” seeks “a new global urban agenda” that would ensure that cities “can become places of economic growth, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.”

At the booth of a Rockefeller Foundation project were illustrations indicating that “in 1913, 10 percent of the world’s population lived in cities; in 2014, 50 percent of the world’s population lives in cities; and in 2050, 75 percent of the world’s population will live in cities.”

“The battle for sustainable change will be won or lost in cities,” posits UN-Habitat.

Now a tourist haven

The choice of Medellin as the venue for WUF7 was itself a message on the power of cities to transform themselves into “liveable centers of growth.”

Once feared as the base of drug lord Pedro Escobar, Medellin has transformed into a tourist haven, capitalizing on its crisp spring weather and its residents’ penchant for partying.

Said Clos: “Medellin provides us with a living example of a city in transition; a city that has faced the challenges that lie before it and, in addressing them, has created opportunities to reshape its future for the better.”

Focus on Philippines

The proceedings of WUF7, featuring over 350 speakers, will help shape the agenda of the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, also known as Habitat III, in 2016.

Cagayan de Oro was also in the spotlight in WUF7 because it was the site of one of the pilot projects of UN-Habitat’s Urban Planning and Design Lab, whose launch was a highlight of the festivities.

“There is special focus on the Philippines as we are facilitating the planning and design of city extension projects in Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo City, and Silay City,” Rollo said.

When the disease is found in its later stages, the survival rate is just 10 percent but improvements in treatment and early detection are giving patients hope.

Carole Prigioniero, 56, was diagnosed with stage two ovarian cancer three years ago.

""I think my world stopped. I don't remember, it's like a blur to me. It's like 'this can't be happening,'"" said Prigioniero.

The Climate Prediction Center, an agency that is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, announced Wednesday in their monthly report that chances for an El Niño weather system have reached 65 percent, up from a 50 percent chance in April.

El Niño is characterized by unusually warm temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. Normal upwellings of deep, cold water stop as a result, and ocean surface temperatures can rise as much as 8 degrees warmer in certain parts of the Pacific. These warmer waters create large changes to typical atmospheric circulation, which can alter weather in regions far from the tropical Pacific.

The weather pattern can trigger drought in some regions and flooding in others. Apart from potential wildfire or flood dangers, the largest effect could be hits to global crop yields. A strong El Niño pattern can wither crops in Australia, Southeast Asia, India and Africa and drown crops in the Midwest and Brazil.

“Production estimates for several crops which are already under stress will have to be revised downwards,” said Vanessa Tan, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures. Without monsoon rains that are critical for agriculture, crops in India, for example, — especially sugar, rice and wheat — could suffer and cause prices to dramatically increase.

However, if El Niño does hit in 2014, the National Weather Service’s Jon Gottschalck predicts the effects will be minimal to the Midwest.

“Even if we see El Niño conditions develop, some of the stronger impacts would be in the fall and winter,” Gottschalck told Farm Futures in February. “The odds of having much impact on the Midwest’s growing season are pretty low this summer.”","Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2014/05/7666020592_919c8cfc13_b.jpg,"['pacific', 'global', 'higher', 'crop', 'niño', 'temperatures', 'pattern', 'el', 'reduced', 'warmer', 'regions', 'yields', 'fear', 'weather', 'odds', 'crops', 'flame']", 
48,48,FL-2014-000062-CHN,The Reason Why Hollywood Makes So Many Boring Superhero Movies - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/05/hollywoods-real-superhero-problem/370785/,"The six major studios (MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Twentieth Century–Fox, and RKO) could basically do whatever they wanted and be sure to make money. Owning their own theater chains (which accounted for half their total revenue), they controlled the means and distribution of a product that was as essential to mid-century life as grilled chicken. Surprise, surprise: Virtually all their films made money.

But in the next 20 years, two Ts—Television and Trust-busting—broke up the studios and scattered audience attention. The typical American used to buy 20-30 tickets a year. Today, she buys about four. Fittingly, studios make fewer movies today, and they have to spend more money marketing them (about $35 million per film), since they've lost their guaranteed weekly audience. At the same time, the box office has globalized. U.S. and Canadian box office grosses are large but flat. The future of ticket growth is overseas.

What does all that mean? Fewer movies, bigger movies, louder movies, and safer movies.

Now that the studios are making fewer, more expensive films, there is much more risk riding on each project. Hollywood mitigates that risk in two ways: safer subjects and more testing. First, it relies on sequels and adaptations that it knows have a built-in audience, not only at home, but also abroad, where explosions translate easier than wit. The formula works, too. Thirteen of the 14 biggest movies of 2013 were adaptations and sequels. Zoller Seitz nails it:

The marketplace rewards each new superhero movie with a reflexive paroxysm of spending, guaranteeing each $200 million tentpole a boffo US opening that follows a boffo international opening (the new release pattern flips the old one). It's an entertainment factory in which the audience is both consumer and product. Its purpose is not just to please consumers but to condition and create them.

For critics, the problem with Hollywood's superhero movies (and, perhaps, with its blockbusters in general) is that they are just fine. They are average. But they are average on purpose. They are the product of Hollywood's exquisitely designed factory of average-ness, which has evolved as the industry has transitioned from a monopoly to a competitive industry that can no longer afford to consistently value art over commerce. Hollywood needs to know what its fragile audience wants, and when it asks us, we tell them: Make something like the last average thing I saw!

Hollywood, like other entertainment industries in the era of big data, is better than ever at figuring out how to give audiences exactly what we say we want. Scripts are revised by teams of editors and are studied by analytics companies to tell studios if the plot lines fit with audiences' expectations of horror movies or superhero dramas. When enough scenes have been aligned to approximate a first draft of a movie, screening companies arrange private viewings for Orange County moms and dads to watch undeveloped versions of the films and give their feedback.

Photo via Flickr / Creative Commons user abstractstv Fresno, California has a plan to reduce its reliance on groundwater. The current path is unsustainable. Click image to enlarge.

In the Great Drought of 2014, aquifers – the saturated soil and rock layers that are California’s largest stock of fresh water – are an object of ardent and exhausting affection.

Farmers love groundwater because recently it has been more reliable than the boom-and-bust river flows that pour off the Sierra Nevada come spring. Policy wonks are infatuated because aquifers are increasingly unreliable. Groundwater levels across the state are at record lows, thanks to decades of ravenous pumping, particularly in drought years. Groundwater reform is a top issue in Sacramento this legislative session.

Agriculture’s use of groundwater garners the most attention, but cities are pinched by dry wells too. Today, the biggest city in the Central Valley is breaking up with its aquifers.

“We’re actually now having to buy homes and demolish homes to construct new well sites.” –Martin Querin, water division manager

Fresno, California

Fresno, a farm hub of 505,000 people, is moving from a system reliant on groundwater to a river-fed supply. Doing so requires a $US 1.1 billion investment over 10 years, said Martin Querin, water division manager.

After five years without an increase, the Fresno city council voted 5 to 2 last August to double water rates by 2017. The revenue will provide the capital for a new water treatment plant, an expansion of an existing plant, and new large-diameter water mains to replumb the grid.

The transition is necessary, Querin said, because the old system was failing.

“Groundwater beneath the city lowered 80 feet over the last 100 years,” Querin told Circle of Blue. “That caused our energy costs to skyrocket and we were having to constantly construct new wells, which became more difficult as the city filled in. We’re actually now having to buy homes and demolish homes to construct new well sites.”

As recently as 2005, Fresno sourced 100 percent of its water from aquifers. Once built, the new facilities will use water from the Kings River and from the federal Central Valley Project canals for 80 percent of the city’s demand in a wet or average year. Though not a complete break up, the shift will give the aquifer a chance to revive.

Fresno’s rate increase is the most striking example of a national trend. Of the 30 U.S. cities in Circle of Blue’s water pricing index, none had a larger rate increase than Fresno this year.

Yet not all has gone smoothly in Fresno. A group of politically active residents is gathering signatures to put a repeal of the rate increase on the November ballot.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Fresno.jpg?fit=1000%2C662&ssl=1,"['rate', 'system', 'fresno', 'dropping', 'weans', 'groundwater', 'city', 'homes', 'querin', 'water', 'valley', 'levels', 'increase']",

Zhuhai border police recently uncovered a smuggling ring that was attempting to transport 956 frozen pangolins, weighing four tons, in Guangdong. Pangolins, for those who aren’t up to speed on their nocturnal ant-eater relatives, are like large, scale-covered sloths whose armor is thought to cure cancer and asthma as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine. (Spoiler alert, it definitely doesn’t.)



An investigation is ongoing but according to Directory of National Key Protected Wild Animals, pangolins are a “second-class” national protected animal. For severe rare animal smuggling cases, criminals can be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.

52,52,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Why Turkey Wants Russell Crowe's Ark - Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-turkey-wants-russell-crowes-ark,"ISTANBUL—Ravaged by decades of fighting between Kurdish rebels and the Turkish military, an impoverished region in remote southeastern Anatolia is hoping for a boost from Hollywood.

Authorities in Sirnak province say they want to bring the wooden structure representing the biblical ark in Russell Crowe’s recent movie Noah to Turkey and install it on the slopes of the local Mount Cudi to attract tourists. According to Islamic tradition, Noah’s ark came to rest on Mount Cudi, and not on Mount Ararat on today’s border between Turkey and Armenia, about 160 miles to the north-east of Sirnak.

The plan raised hopes of lifting the region out of poverty, but suffered a potentially fatal setback this week as officials from Paramount, the maker of Noah, said the ark from the film had been taken apart after shooting was done. “I’m pretty sure it’s been disassembled,” said Ari Handel, who was a producer and co-writer of the movie.

Still, authorities in Sirnak said they were determined to go ahead with the project, even if it meant to import just a few wooden parts from the set. “We will do everything we can to make it happen despite this,” Osman Gelis, the head of Sirnak’s Chamber of Trade and Industry, told The Daily Beast on Saturday. “Maybe the government can do something.”

The plan by Sirnak is a sign of a growing confidence by people in Turkey’s Kurdish region that the bloody conflict between rebels and the army may finally come to an end. Since the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), seen as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, took up arms to fight for Kurdish self-rule in 1984, more than 40,000 people have died.

“This is very important for us, and we help where we can,” Gelis about the project. “It will be a big plus for our economy. He said he would try to go all the way to the top and get Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan involved. “We will tell him how big this is for us and for religious tourism. We can’t wait” to have the ark, he said.

Years of fighting cut off Turkey’s Kurdish region in the southeast of the country from the economic development in the rest of the country. Sirnak has a per capita income of around $2,600 a year, which makes it the poorest of all of Turkey’s 81 provinces. The countrywide average stands at roughly $11,000 a year.

Now Sirnak is hoping that Crowe’s ark will generate some income for the province of around 85,000 people, which sits on Turkey’s borders with Syria and Iraq. Locals believe that Noah was buried in the town of Cizre, which lies in the province. An image of the ark is the province’s official symbol.

A spokesman for Sirnak’s tourism and culture board confirmed the project was underway. “We just don’t know yet where to put the ark exactly,” said the spokesman, who identified himself by his first name Sabri. “But it will be somewhere on Mount Cudi. The aim is to attract tourists.”

Cihan Birlik, head of Sirnak’s Cultural, Tourism and Development Association, told Turkish media the Tourism Ministry in Ankara had promised to try and get the movie ark to Turkey.

Birlik said the idea was to create a national park on the slopes of Mount Cudi and put the Hollywood ark in the middle of it. A zoo, recalling Noah’s biblical mission to save animals from the flood, was also part of the project. “Thousands of tourists will flood into Sirnak and Cudi,” Birlik said.

In offering to provide a home for central pieces of a Hollywood set, Sirnak is following the example of the northwestern Turkish province of Canakkale, home to the ancient city of Troy. Following the 2004 movie Troy, starring Brad Pitt, Canakkale bought the Trojan Horse used in the film and put it in a public park.

In the Kurdish area, tourism offers a glimmer of hope in a region crippled by decades of violence. Thousands of villages in south-eastern Anatolia were destroyed as hundreds of thousands of people fled into Turkey’s big cities and to Europe to escape the fighting.

Hopes for peace rose when the Erdogan government decided in late 2012 to start negotiations with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence on the prison island of Imrali near Istanbul. In the ongoing talks, Ocalan is asking for more regional autonomy for Kurdish provinces but is no longer seeking an independent Kurdish state separate from Turkey.

Ever since Ocalan ordered a cease-fire and a withdrawal of PKK fighters from Turkey to bases in northern Iraq as a sign of goodwill in spring last year, the fighting has largely stopped, even though a final settlement to end the conflict once and for all remains elusive. This week, Turkish media reported a major breakthrough in Ocalan’s talks with Ankara’s representatives on Imrali, but the reports were denied by both the government and Turkey’s biggest pro-Kurdish party, the People’s Democracy Party (HDP).

Still, there is new optimism in the region. With stunning natural beauty and several important biblical and cultural sites, ranging from the birthplace of the prophet Abraham to spectacular Roman mosaics, the Kurdish provinces have started to attract tourists since the fighting died down. The number of visitors touring Turkey’s Kurdish region rose by 23 per cent last year to 1.5 million visitors, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.

A modernization programme for the region’s infrastructure also helps. Since last year, Sirnak province has its own airport, which offers daily flights to and from the capital Ankara and Turkey’s metropolis Istanbul.

In another sign of a newly-found enthusiasm, Sirnak recently organised a bicycle tour around Mount Cudi—something unthinkable even a few years ago, as the mountain was a military no-go zone for three decades. Gelis, the head of the trade chamber in Sirnak, said the region had seen a slight increase in the number of visitors. “But with the ark, numbers will explode.”","Sun, 11 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492199514/articles/2014/05/11/why-turkey-wants-russell-crowe-s-ark/140509-seibert-arc-tease_zz3tbv","['mount', 'cudi', 'sirnak', 'ark', 'wants', 'region', 'tourism', 'province', 'turkish', 'turkeys', 'russell', 'crowes', 'turkey', 'kurdish']",

Furnishing a bad habit

Endangered Siamese rosewood has been logged to the brink of extinction in the Mekong region, including in the remote forests of Cambodia, fuelled by China’s demand for faux antique furniture, according to a report released yesterday by an environmental monitoring group.

The report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which is the culmination of a decadelong undercover investigation, describes how the desire for luxury Ming and Qing dynasty reproductions and artwork, known as hongmu, has left “a bloody trail of death, violence and corruption in its wake”.

“Siamese rosewood has become so rare and valuable that the practice of logging it is now more akin to wildlife poaching,” the report says.

The rosewood is logged in remote jungles, such as those in Cambodia’s Ratanakkiri, Stung Treng and Preah Vihear provinces, and funnelled through a host of laundering operations in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam operated by “a web of traders, middlemen and corrupt officials [who] make their fortunes by channeling rosewood . . . to the glitzy furniture showrooms of China”.

Faith Doherty, EIA’s forest campaign team leader, said in an email yesterday that the demand for the highly prized timber perpetuated illegal logging.

“The rosewood industry is extremely lucrative – millions and millions of dollars are earned – plus the more difficult Siam[ese] rosewood is to get, the higher the price, the more valuable Siam[ese] rosewood becomes,” she said.

Doherty added that the numerous deaths of Cambodian loggers at the hands of Thai security forces were directly linked to the Chinese trade.

In Cambodia, Siamese rosewood is protected under the 2002 Forestry Law. But a combination of weak enforcement and corruption, coupled with soaring Chinese demand, has “turned forests into conflict zones”, according to the report.

Under the cover of darkness, loggers flood into Thailand’s national parks across Cambodia’s porous border, carrying the tools of the trade: chainsaws, guns and even rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

“When loggers are confronted by enforcement officers, violence often ensues,” the report, titled Routes of Extinction, states. “Methamphetamines … are regularly used as a stimulant to overcome fatigue and as a form of payment for loggers from border communities blighted by drug addiction,” it adds.

At least 69 Cambodians were shot dead by Thai security forces last year. In a single day in March this year, 12 illegal loggers were reported to have been shot dead by Thai forces near the border with Preah Vihear province. Thailand denied the killings took place.

In one example of the cross-border trade, undercover EIA investigators posing as buyers met Thai trader Promphan Suttisaragorn, a representative of a company claiming to source Siamese rosewood from high-level officials in Cambodia.

He told the investigators that “rosewood logged in Thailand was often smuggled into Cambodia and re-exported into Thailand to obscure its origin”.

The cost of rosewood has spiked in recent years, the report notes, with traders often warehousing timber until prices rise. Suttisaragorn, whose company the Post could not reach yesterday, allegedly offered to sell the EIA team 10,000 cubic metres for $50 million.

“Logging tycoons with links to high-ranking officials are plundering Cambodia’s natural resources at an alarming rate,” Neil Loughlin, technical adviser at rights group Adhoc, said yesterday. “Cambodia’s rich natural resources, lax enforcement and culture of corruption means it is ideal for exploitation to fuel China’s voracious appetite for luxury timber.”

Thon Sarath, chief of administration at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said the government was cooperating with neighbouring countries to try to end the flow of rosewood to China.

He added that if evidence of connections between high-level officials and illegal logging syndicates were discovered, they should be reported to the authorities.

“We tried to do a lot of things already to act against the [illegal] timber trade,” he said.

Forestry Administration director Chheng Kimsun and Ung Samath, its deputy director, could not be reached.

Cheng Hongbo, chief of the Chinese embassy’s political section, said that Beijing had policies in place to tackle environmental degradation and organised crime.

“China has made enviromental protection one of its basic national policies, [and regards] the realization of sustainable development as an important strategy and carried out measures for ... ecological environment protection,” he said in an email.

“The Chinese government will surely crack down [on] any illegal trade and organized crime networks.”

China's efforts to curb the border trade since the species was listed as protected last year have led to prices as high as $80,000 per tonne for logs cut from the 33 species China defines as suitable for hongmu, the report says.

The Chinese government has also “provided considerable financial incentives to promote the hongmu industry. The rationale behind investment and state backing for an industry which is systematically destroying its own supply chain is unclear,” it adds.

But wealthy elites in China continue to drive the trade and expand into new species as old ones are depleted, while a “venerable cultural tradition serves as a cover for rampant speculation”.

“As species deplete, the industry will want to expand their definition and . . . deplete their own supply chain. This is not an industry that looks long term, but at what they can get now,” EIA’s Doherty said.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

UNIVERSITY CITY, MO (KTVI) – Adam Long’s life is a list of numbers, two tornadoes, 36 years as a firefighter and one award-winning photo taken by Ron Olshwanger. It all added up to being the very first African-American chief in the University City Fire Department.

Just after dawn on April 3, 2014, Long looked over the huge tree lying across McKnight Road at Spoon Drive. The smell of noxious fumes was finally gone after an uprooted tree broke a natural-gas line. Trees and limbs had to be cleared from Spoon Drive to make way for repairs to a water main. A first-responder’s life is often a time of witnessing wreckage.

“It looks like the tornado may have just popped down here and jumped back up and is gone.”

That wreckage can give way to a cycle that includes periods of recovery.

“No one was really injured.”

He led firefighters scrambling to reassemble a University City neighborhood after a tornado strike that day. A month later, Long looked at over a dozen roofs covered with tarps. He stepped over a fallen streetlight. But, he could cross the street at Spoon Drive and McKnight Road.

“It’s a vast improvement from that day.”

Long said the storm moved so quickly that morning, he never expected to face a disaster response effort.

“But, I was the airport fire chief when the tornado hit on Good Friday there,” he laughed nervously.

He remembered the tornado that hit Lambert International Airport on April 22, 2011. No one was killed, but several people were injured by flying glass and debris.

“Tornadoes seem to be following me.”

He seemed less impressed about what happened one year and six days before the University City twister. On March 28, 2013, his wife pinned a new badge on his lapel. He became the first African-American fire chief in University City’s century-long history.

“I just never really gave it a lot of thought, because it’s something I’ve been doing for 36 years.”

He spent the first 35 years with St. Louis City, which also covers the airport. But, December 30, 1988 stands out in his mind. That was the day he ran into a burning home on Boyle Avenue and Sarpy Avenue.

“I prayed, ‘God. If there is anyone to be found in here, let me find them,’” he remembered. “Then, things got really quiet. All I could hear was running water, like I was next to a brook. I looked over the bed, just as some of the smoke started to lift, and I see what appears to be a doll.’”

After he scooped up the child, unresponsive and her curly locks covered in soot, he ran out the door. Freelance photographer Ron Olschwanger snapped a Pulitzer-winning photo of Long breathing into the little girl. The firefighter ran a block to an ambulance.

“Her name was Patricia Pettis, and it was her 2nd birthday that day.”

He said something in his mind told him to go to see Patricia at the hospital.

“Gave her a little kiss on the cheek and I walked out.”

The photo was published in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the very next day. And, Long started getting letters of admiration from around the world, even Communist China. But, all the admiration could not save little Patricia. She died six days after the fire. This time, Long faced the wreckage on the inside.

“I really second-guessed myself. I was asking myself, ‘Did I really do enough?

Could I have done more?’ I had friends and family tell me, ‘You did all that you could. You did the best that you could.”

That triggered the internal recovery, as well. Now, Long helps make sure others can handle that vicious cycle, even if for the first time.

“Diversify as often as we can, and not let a person’s skin color or religious preference or sexual orientation limit you or keep you from hiring somebody.”

He had a much simpler explanation for his place in history.

“I was just blessed to be in the right place at the right time.”

Olschwanger now sits on the Creve Coeur Fire Protection District Board of Directors. He was unable to join us for this interview. But in 2008, he told our partners at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that little Patricia did not die in vain since people saw her final picture and then purchased new smoke detectors.

Thousands of farmers across Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands are set to benefit from a new SBD320,000 partnership between the Australian aid program and Solo Enviro Beautification (SEB).

As part of the Australian Government’s support to flood recovery efforts, SEB will grow 214, 000 vegetable seedlings for distribution to farmers affected by the recent disaster.

The seedlings will include tomatoes, eggplant, papaya, slippery cabbage, cucumber, capsicum and Chinese cabbage.

Australia’s High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Andrew Byrne, said the assistance will help farmers and their families replant food gardens and rebuild their livelihoods.

“This assistance will also help to alleviate food shortages due to crop damage and spoilage during the recent flooding on Guadalcanal”.

“Australia is proud to partner with SEB in this project, a local NGO which provides disadvantaged youth and women with employment and education opportunities”.

Tiffany Tena Tuhaika, SEB Executive Officer, said the partnership will provide skill development opportunities for the program’s trainee horticulturalists as well as local jobs.

“SEB’s 45 trainees will benefit from learning about mass propagation of seedlings”.

“The project will also provide full-time job opportunities for 5 female Solomon Islanders who have already graduated from the horticulture training program”.

The first of the seedlings will be ready for distribution next month. The Australian High Commission will coordinate delivery of the seedlings with Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, Kastom Gaden Association and other NGO partners who are participating in the flood response. Rotary New Zealand have also donated AUD5000 towards costs for freight.

SEB currently hosts a Horticultural Advisor and Training Officer, though the Australian Volunteers for International Development program. The adviser is helping build the skills of SEB’s staff and improve their training programs and business operations.

Some have even called Shakespeare the original rapper, his use of iambic pentameter the first dropped beat.

So, it seems fitting that when comparing the range of vocabulary among hip hop artists, data scientist Matt Daniels would also incorporate the Bard himself — whose entire collection of work included a total of 28,829 unique words forms, with 12,493 appearing only once.

In order to include younger rappers in the data, Daniels compared the first 35,000 lyrics — or in Shakespeare’s case, the first 5,000 words of seven of his works — of 85 different rappers from Salt-n-Pepa to Drake. He then counted each unique word to determine the extent of a rapper’s vocabulary.



Where did Shakespeare place? That is the question.

Rapper Aesop Rock held the top spot with the use of 7,392 unique words. The Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA — whose “Dark Matter” album inspired a flood of science rap submissions from PBS NewsHour viewers last year — wasn’t too far behind with 6,426 unique words. DMX ended up in the last slot with a total of 3,214 unique words.

The Centre has already approved Rs 116 crore for installing the latest weather system in the state, where the mid-June deluge claimed over 5,000 lives and rendered hundreds of others homeless.

Top officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the state government discussed the issue at a meeting.

The IMD Director-General L S Rathore said his department would set up three Doppler radars in the state which would help in accurately forecasting weather in specific regions.

Besides, 75 rain-gauge meters, five micro rain radars, four compact radars, 75 weather stations and helicopter weather support system would also be installed in the flood-hit state.

Chief Secretary Subhash Kumar told the IMD officials all the places should be identified immediately in the state where such weather equipments were to be installed. Kumar sought the cooperation of the Met department in this regard.

He's one of America's most famous designers, but on this day, the business of fashion was not on his mind, although he did admire the red Zara jeans I was wearing.

""I'm just shopping,"" he said.

When Hilfiger and Ocleppo married in 2008, they vowed to travel together at all times. ""If we didn't we probably wouldn't see each other,"" she said with a laugh.

""It's fun for me because it's a major learning curve, but it also brings Tommy back to his beginning days. I benefit from all the mistakes he made along the way.""

Now that commitment has taken an unexpected turn as Ocleppo touts her unique luxury handbag line and Hilfiger is along for the ride.

Until fairly recently, getting involved in the fashion business was the farthest thing from her mind. But when she came up with the idea for a ""convertible"" handbag with a detachable, reversible cover in a different color or skin that changes the look — it's like having three different handbags-in-one — her husband was so impressed that he encouraged her to pursue the unique idea.

The result, which she recently launched at the Saks Galleria store, features handbags in five styles, ranging from $595 to $12,000.

CultureMap: How did this handbag line come about?

Dee Ocleppo: Tommy was doing a preppy collection about three years ago, and I was describing this bag that I (carried in) high school. It was at the height of the preppy movement and there were these little cotton twill bags; you could unbutton them and they would change from pink to green. And I said, ""We should do a grown-up version of these bags.""

He thought it was a great concept but he said it would probably be just a one-season thing and get lost in the mix of everything going on with Tommy Hilfiger. He said, ""Why don't you do it?""

CM: What did you think when he said that?

DO: I had never thought of doing it. He introduced me to Mindy Grossman from HSN and I described this concept. I had made some pretty bad prototypes but she loved the idea and I sold them on HSN, but made in China with simpler materials. Always in the back of my mind I wanted to do them beautiful and luxe, using nicer materials and have them made in a certain way.

I experimented with the concept in Italy and picked some beautiful skins and leathers and showed them to Marigay McKee at Harrods and she thought they were great and said she would take them. I literally didn't have any kind of setup. I walked out of the room and had to call the factory and say, ""Can you actually make these, because Harrods wants to buy them?"" And that's really how we started.

""All the bags have this beautiful pink satin lining. I've found if the linings are black I can never find anything. It's like a big bottomless pit.""

CM: What has the reaction been?

DO: I've had great response. Women react first of all to the craftsmanship. They want something with great quality and they're willing to pay for it. And when they see they can wear the bag three ways, that's just an extra kicker.

CM: How hard were they to design?

DO: There were a lot of technical and engineering challenges to get the bag to actually work. But I think that we worked through everything and now we offer something that's really beautiful, really practical and different.

And all the bags have this beautiful pink satin lining. I've found if the linings are black I can never find anything. It's like a big bottomless pit. If you do them too light they get dirty. So I thought this was the perfect color, not too dark and not too light. And it's hopefully going to be seen almost like the Christian Louboutin red sole, so you open the bag and get a little look of the hot pink and it will be identified as my bag.

CM: Has it been a blessing or curse to be the wife of Tommy Hilfiger in the fashion business?

DO: It's a blessing for many reasons. I have the best free advisor money can't buy. And it's fun for me because it's a major learning curve, but it also brings Tommy back to his beginning days. I benefit from all the mistakes he made along the way. I think that perhaps having him as my husband might open some doors, but like anything else, you can open the door but if you don't deliver, the door closes very quickly.

CM: His name is so well-known. Why didn't you take his name for the bags?

DO: I legally cannot. His company is owned by PVH Phillips-Van Heusen. They own Hilfiger as a name. So I cannot use it on anything.

""As you know, in this business you can never rest on your laurels. So you just keep in motion and keep moving. Otherwise you'll get trampled.""

CM: Is it something you would have considered?

DO: It might have been a blessing in disguise (not to use it) because that would just confuse the consumer. I'm hoping that they buy the bag because they love the bag and not because I'm somebody's wife.

CM: What do you do for exercise?

DO: I pack and unpack and don't get a lot of sleep. I would love to exercise but I am on constant jet lag.

CM: You go back and forth to Italy a lot for the handbag line.

DO: On this and on things Tommy. We're always together. I travel with him. He travels with me. We've got kids all over the place. He's got not only the Tommy Hilfiger business but he's got a lot of balls in the air, so to speak. He's — we're — constantly on the go.

CM: He seems to be in a good place and you probably have something to do with it.

DO: I hope so. I'm proud of the last show he did. You have to constantly reinvent yourself in the fashion business; otherwise you get stale. And he has been around a long time. I think as far as Tommy Hilfiger goes, he's keeping the brand relevant and fresh. As you know, in this business you can never rest on your laurels. So you just keep in motion and keep moving. Otherwise you'll get trampled.

61,61,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Amnesty: 141 countries still torture - Al Jazeera America,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/12/torture-report-amnesty.html,"And yet, in police headquarters, secret prisons and CIA black sites , detainees across the globe report being subjected to torture as a means of extracting information or confessions, silencing dissent or simply as punishment. The Amnesty report details 27 categories of torture reported in the past year, including electric shocks, mock executions, water torture, rape and sexual violence and the pulling of teeth.

According to the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” That agreement, as well as the various Geneva Conventions and the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, have all dictated an absolute ban on torture for any purpose — even in times of war.

Three decades after the U.N. Convention Against Torture imposed measures to eradicate the practice, torture still happens in 141 countries — many of which are signatories to that convention — according to Amnesty International’s annual report on torture released Tuesday.

Though President Barack Obama scaled back the most controversial of these CIA programs in 2009 and has promised to shut down the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention center, he has been criticized for not offering any form of reparation to detainees who were tortured there. Those who carried out illegal torture of terror suspects have not been brought to justice either, rights groups say.

Former CIA director George Tenet said in 2007 that the agency's rendition program had prevented terror plots against the U.S. and saved countless lives, concluding that the ""enhanced interrogation"" of suspects at secret CIA facilities was ""worth more than the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency put together have been able to tell us.""

Manfred Nowak, the former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, told Al Jazeera that the U.S. — once viewed as a vanguard in the fight for human rights worldwide — has opened the door for other countries to engage in torture under the auspices of fighting terrorism. In the post-9/11 world, Nowak and others say many countries have followed the U.S.' lead and cited national security interests and the “ticking time bomb” rationale to justify the use of any means necessary to extract information from suspected terror suspects.

That number was 32 percent in the United States, where details of the CIA’s now-terminated “enhanced interrogation” practices and rendition programs are soon to be revealed in a Senate Intelligence report.

Despite overwhelming opposition to torture in most of the world’s countries and the litany of international conventions expressly forbidding the practice, an Amnesty poll found that 44 percent of people worldwide still are not confident they would be safe from torture if taken into custody by authorities in their country.

The findings point to what Michael Bochenek, Amnesty’s senior director for International Law and Policy, called a “disconnect” between policy and practice and between public condemnation of torture and the pervading misconception that “this is the way it has to be” for states to be kept secure.

Though many point to U.S. influence, it is difficult to identify correlations among states that do torture; they are not all authoritarian and many are signatories to every international convention prohibiting torture.

One factor Amnesty observed in some countries was inadequate training for police and intelligence officers, who resort to torture as a shortcut to proper investigation when they know there won't be repercussions for their actions. Brazil and Mexico, two states where police enjoy frequent impunity for their transgressions behind closed doors, had the highest percent of respondents say they did not feel safe from torture if arrested.

In other countries, the use of torture is part and parcel of broader state-sponsored discrimination against minorities — including religious groups, ethnic groups and LGBTQ communities.

“Take China, where we have a situation where the state reacts with suspicion or outright hostility towards ethnic and religious minorities,"" said Bochenek. ""There are consistent reports of harassment, arbitrary detention and torture of Uighurs or Tibetan Buddhists — anybody who does not belong to the official recognized religious group.”

National security has been cited in Nigeria, where Amnesty received a flood of reports accusing security forces of unwarranted detention and brutal torture amid the state's campaign to crush the Boko Haram insurgency, which has killed more than 4,000 people in five years.

Fifteen-year-old Suleiman Ali told Amnesty he and 50 others, mostly teenagers, were accused in March 2013 of having ties to the radical rebel group and taken to a security facility in Yobe State nicknamed ""Guantanamo."" There, Ali said he was beaten and had plastic melted on his body. Ali was released a month later and survived after emergency medical treatment, but most of the other 30 prisoners who were released died.

As international condemnation and U.N. conventions have not proven sufficient deterrents against the use of torture in extenuating circumstances, arguments that torture can be an unreliable interrogation tool — torture victims will often say whatever the interrogator wants to hear in order to make the pain stop — or that it can even be counterproductive to national security might hold more sway.

Many say the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques used at CIA detention facilities like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, which included waterboarding until 2009, fueled anti-American sentiment and undermined U.S. credibility on human rights issues.

""The U.S. has incurred tremendous damage to its ability to conduct foreign policy,"" said Bochenek. “It also means the U.S. might have had more ability to persuade other states to change their torture practices. Now they’ve lost that.”","Mon, 12 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/5/12/torture-report-amnesty/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.guantanamo_torture_051214.1399985605960.jpg,"['states', 'interrogation', '141', 'amnesty', 'international', 'countries', 'torture', 'say', 'cia', 'rights', 'security']",

(Photo: AP)

Pakistan:Twelve militants were killed in fighting between factions of the Pakistani Taliban near the Afghan border on Tuesday, Taliban and security officials said, the first such clash since the two feuding groups agreed to abide by a ceasefire two weeks ago.

The government hopes to exploit the divisions within the Pakistani Taliban, a loose alliance of dozens of militant groups. It is separate to but allied with the Afghan Taliban, who have a far clearer command structure.

The two feuding Pakistani Taliban factions are led by rival commanders from the Mehsud tribe, who provide the bulk of the Pakistani Taliban's men and money.

Commander Khan ""Sajna"" Said supports peace talks with the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but his rival Shehryar Mehsud does not.

Peace talks have been going since February but recently stalled again.

Taliban sources said that Tuesday's fighting began when Sajna's men attacked militants affiliated with Mehsud.

”We have been told that 12 people from both sides were killed and some others wounded,” a senior member of the Pakistani Taliban said.

The rivalry between the two men has existed for many years, but spilled into violence last month when both claimed leadership of the Mehsud tribe.

The dispute followed the death of Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, and his deputy in drone strikes last year.","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/sites/default/files/pakistani-talibans.jpg,"['fighting', 'infighting', 'militants', 'talks', 'rival', 'mehsud', '12', 'factional', 'men', 'taliban', 'killed', 'groups', 'pakistani']",

Keith Crisco, the North Carolina congressional candidate running in a Democratic primary election against Clay Aiken, was found dead in his home Monday. Crisco, 71, died from injuries sustained from a fall, WRAL reports.

The textile entrepreneur was running against the former American Idol star for the Democratic nomination in North Carolina's 2nd district. Crisco and Aiken both garnered about 40 percent of the vote in last Tuesday's primary. Aiken won just a 369-vote lead, leaving open the possibility of a recount or a runoff election. The winner of the primary would face off against Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C.

Aiken said in a statement that is ""stunned and deeply saddened"" by Crisco's death and will suspend all campaign activities ""as we pray for his family and friends.""

""Keith came from humble beginnings,"" Aiken said. ""No matter how high he rose - to Harvard, to the White House and to the Governor's Cabinet - he never forgot where he came from. He was a gentleman, a good and honorable man and an extraordinary public servant. I was honored to know him.""

Democratic strategist Brad Crone said that he spoke with Crisco earlier in the day and that the candidate planned to concede the race Tuesday.

""This is a shocking day,"" Crone said in a statement to CBS News. ""At Keith's instructions, I called Gary Pearce, an advisor to Mr. Aiken, to convey that Keith was going to concede the election tomorrow morning and would be calling Mr. Aiken to congratulate him.""

By 2052, the control of the energy economy by a very few large megacorporations, a characteristic of the fossil-fuel age, will be over. Solar power generation will be as close to the consumers as possible, sustainable, and stable for decades, freely exchanged at real-time market prices through the interconnection of micro-grids and national grids.

What will our future on earth look like? In 2052, (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2012) Jorgen Randers tries to predict what the world will actually be like in forty years, based on global forecasting tools, his own experience in sustainability and predictions of leading scientific and sustainable minds. The following excerpt, from William W. Behrens, explains the predicted shift from the current dependency on fossil-based energy to the dominance of solar power and electrical energy in 2052.

Bright Solar Future

Between now and 2052, the world of energy will evolve more positively than many other aspects of human culture. And in that world, electrical energy will stand out, not just for replacing fuel energy in all sectors of the United States and the world, but also for doing it much more quickly than expected. The reason for this is simple: electrical energy will be produced with much less capital intensity than fuel energy.

Already, all fossil-based energy production requires heavy capital infrastructure. As the quality and quantity of fuel resources decline, the capital required to extract a gallon of fuel will increase dramatically (witness the intensity of capital required to develop the tar sands reserves). Yet, eventually, suppliers worldwide will be able to produce electricity with relatively small and modular hardware. As this trend develops, both transportation and space conditioning will turn toward increasingly efficient electricity-based hardware. By 2040, in the United States, electricity-supported transportation systems will be common in densely populated areas, and many homes and businesses will have been converted to air- and water-sourced heat pumps that operate on electricity from renewable sources, and will no longer rely on fuel-based boilers. The primary renewable electrical energy source will be solar.

The Rise of PV and Decentralized Energy

From 2012 to 2022, centralized utilities and corporations will still control the means of electricity production and will develop large-scale renewable energy plants to meet an increasing fraction of the electricity load. These plants will utilize all forms of renewable energy—whether produced by large-scale wind farms, photovoltaic (PV) farms, very large solar-thermal turbines, or even ocean energy. But as the second decade dawns, three influences will combine to create a rapid shift away from centralized electricity production and toward distributed production by micro-grids.

One driver will be political. In the United States, democratic political institutions will finally recognize the stranglehold that fossil-energy companies exert on public decision making. After public and governmental backlash, lawmakers will enact legislation that levels the playing field, removing the financial and regulatory advantages currently extended to these huge players. The government will require fossil fuels to carry their full cost of production, including their waste stream, and will redirect the resulting revenues into balancing the government budgets (a necessary response to the economic collapses of the United States in the 2010s).","Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://opimedia.azureedge.net/-/media/images/men/editorial/articles/online-articles/2014/05-01/the-lighted-path-to-solar-power-and-electrical-energy-dominance/solar-power-electrical-energy-s-jpg.jpg,"['production', 'states', 'solar', 'lighted', '2052', 'electricity', 'fuel', 'energy', 'renewable', 'united', 'path', 'electrical', 'world', 'power']", 
65,65,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Scared but alive: Video purports to show abducted Nigerian girls - fox2now.com,https://fox2now.com/news/scared-but-alive-video-purports-to-show-abducted-nigerian-girls/,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

(CNN) — The girls sit quietly on the ground, dressed in traditional Islamic garb, barely moving, clearly scared.

“Praise be to Allah, the lord of the world,” they chant.

The video, released by French news agency Agence France-Presse, purports to show about 100 of the 276 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram fighters nearly a month ago. It’s the first time they’ve been seen since their abduction April 14.

In separate shots included in the 27-minute video, a man says he will release the girls only after imprisoned members of Boko Haram are freed, according to AFP.

The man identifies himself as Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau. Nigerian officials disputed that claim on Monday, arguing that Shekau is dead. Other experts say the notorious terror group leader is still alive.

Whoever the man in the video is, Nigeria’s interior minister said, the country isn’t interested in negotiating a swap anyway, according to AFP.

But at a later briefing, the director of the National Orientation Agency, a government information ministry, said negotiations could be an option when it comes to rescuing the kidnapped girls.

When asked whether all options were on the table, agency Director Mike Omeri said yes.

“The government of Nigeria will continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their respective homes,” Omeri told CNN.

Experts reviewing video

If authentic, the video released Monday is the first glimpse of the girls since Boko Haram fighters snatched them from a boarding school in the northern Nigerian town of Chibok.

A senior administration official told CNN that U.S. officials have no reason to question its authenticity.

“Our intelligence experts are combing over every detail of the video for clues that might help in the ongoing efforts (to) secure the release of the girls,” the official said.

The abductions have resulted in worldwide outrage directed at the terror group and an influx of Western counterterrorism and law enforcement experts to help Nigeria fight it.

Filmed in a nondescript clearing surrounded by scrub and trees, the girls appear dressed in gray or black veils. Many look nervous or under duress. In one shot, a girl almost whispers a line from the Quran.

In separate shots filmed against a green backdrop, the man who claims to be Shekau says the girls — who come from a Christian stronghold — have converted to Islam.

He appears to open a window to the possibility of negotiating a swap: the girls for Boko Haram prisoners held by Nigeria.

“By Allah, these girls will not leave our hands until you release our brothers in your prison,” he said. “You took our brothers four or five years ago, and now they are in your prisons. You do many things, and now you talk of these girls. We will not let them go until you release our brothers.”

But he also says he still plans to sell them into slavery.

A reason for optimism?

Some observers took the video as encouraging.

Not only would it prove that at least some girls are alive and unharmed, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James “Spider” Marks, a CNN military analyst, it also gives intelligence analysts something with which to work.

Nigerian government officials also took notice. The governor of the state where Chibok is located, Borno, ordered officials to distribute the video to parents to help identify the girls.

Gov. Kashim Shettima “views the development as encouraging, especially given the fact that some of the girls said they were not harmed,” his office said in a statement. “The governor hopes that the girls did not speak under duress.”

Despite the optimism, Marks said it will still be painfully difficult to find and rescue the girls after a month in the terror group’s custody.

“We have to lower our expectations, sadly, as to what we think this result and outcome is going to look like,” he told CNN’s “New Day.”

A daring escape

A CNN team made the dangerous journey to Chibok to gather firsthand accounts of the abductions.

Before the gun-wielding Islamist militants rode into town, residents said they got cell phone calls that the feared extremist group was on the way. Family and friends from surrounding villages told them of a convoy of cargo trucks, pickups and motorcycles.

Residents said they passed along warnings to local authorities that night. Police called for reinforcements, but none came. Everyone, including police, fled into the bush. But the girls remained asleep in their dorms.

CNN’s Nima Elbagir toured the school, gutted by militants as they fled, and spoke with one of the girls who managed to escape Boko Haram fighters that night.

The girl told Elbagir how she made a dash for freedom after militants loaded them into trucks and drove them into the nearby Sambisa Forest.

“We ran into the bush,” she said of her escape with two others. “We ran and we ran.” Lost and terrified, she said, they later ran toward flames they presumed were rising from a building set ablaze by the militants in their hometown.

The escapees were lucky. The missing girls probably have been separated and taken out of the country by now, officials said.

“The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,” said Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister and a U.N. special envoy for global education.

But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said he believes the girls are still in the forest where the militants disappeared shortly after their capture.

Who’s the man in the video?

Government officials disputed Monday that the man in the video with the girls is Shekau.

Security forces have confirmed and are sure Shekau is dead, said Marilyn Ogar, deputy director of State Security Services in Nigeria. “So whoever is speaking as Abubakar Shekau is not Abubakar Shekau.”

The same man appears in Boko Haram videos claiming to be Shekau at least as far back as August. And at least one expert doubted Ogar’s claim.

Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram at the Jamestown Foundation, a policy center based in Washington, said he is skeptical of the Nigerian claim unless it can be backed up with hard evidence.

He said Nigerian authorities have said Shekau was dead several times, only for him to resurface and for the Nigerian military subsequently to acknowledge that he was alive.

“The two recent videos after the abduction of the girls look similar to most of the images, voice and mannerisms of Shekau in almost all Boko Haram videos, including videos when he was a local imam in northeastern Nigeria before 2010,” Zenn said.

If the government’s assertion turns out to be untrue, it wouldn’t be the first time it has been wrong about the terror group since the girls’ abductions. Early in their disappearance, government officials said many of the girls had been recovered — news that, sadly, turned out to be incorrect.

Global search effort

While experts analyze the video, the international effort to find the girls is gaining steam.

U.S. and British officials are in the capital of Abuja to help look for the girls, plan rescue missions and advise on ways to quash the terror group.

The United States is providing manned Defense Department aerial surveillance planes over Nigerian territory and sharing commercial satellite images with Nigeria as part of efforts to find the girls, two senior Obama administration officials told CNN’s Elise Labott on Monday.

China and France are also helping in the search. Israel plans to send a team of counterterrorism experts to help, Jonathan’s office said Sunday.

The United States has said it has no plans to send combat troops.

The U.S. team is working to help the Nigerian military plan operations and boost its capacity, providing investigation and intelligence support, advising on hostage negotiations and other issues, a senior State Department official told Labott.

Why did help arrive so late?

The United States offered assistance immediately after the mass abductions, but Nigeria turned it down until it became apparent that the situation needed a greater response, senior U.S. State Department officials told CNN.

Last week Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States has been engaged since Day One.

An explosive report Friday accused military commanders of knowing the terror group was headed to the school at least four hours in advance. However, the report said, they were unable to raise enough troops to respond.

The findings by human rights group Amnesty International mirror accounts by parents and villagers, who described to CNN an ineffective military response in the days and weeks after the abductions.

Nigeria’s information and defense ministries disputed the report.

The moment the Nigerian government heard of the kidnappings, “we went in to action,” Information Minister Labaran Maku said.

A Filipino radio journalist has been gunned down in an ambush in the town of Bongao, in Mindanao’s Tawi-Tawi province.

Richard Najid, 35, also known as ""DJ Troy"", became the fourth broadcaster to be killed in Mindanao in the last six months and the 27th journalist murdered since President Benigno Aquino came to power in 2010.

Najid, who was also the manager of radio DXNN PowerMix FM, was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle on Sunday evening as he was returning home from a basketball game, police said on Monday. The motive behind the killing remains unclear.

The murder was later condemned by media groups and the presidential palace.

National press club President Joel Egco said the killing of journalists in the country is ""meant to silence us"" and was ""a direct assault on our constitutionally enshrined rights to protect democracy"".

He accused the government of ignoring the dangers that journalists face despite the high number of deadly attacks that have taken place over the past few years.

""The killing of Najid is an indication of [the government’s] lack of real concern or plain disregard for the deadly plight of Filipino journalists,"" said Egco.

He said the government’s ""apparent apathy toward the unabated killing of journalists is a contributory factor to the culture of impunity that threatens press freedom"".

The government denied the accusation and said police were investigating Najid’s murder and all will be done to bring his killers to justice.

""We have tasked the Philippine National Police to identify, apprehend, and prosecute the people behind the crime,"" presidential spokesman Herminio Coloma said.

The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism reported in November 2013 that 23 journalists were killed during Aquino’s first 40 months in office.

In 2013 alone, 12 Filipino journalists were slain.

The Committee to Protect Journalists’ 2014 impunity index, which ""spotlights countries where journalists are slain and the killers go free"", ranks the Philippines as the world’s third most dangerous country after Iraq and Somalia.

Aquino defends his government’s failure to bring the killers of journalists to justice by saying that ""investigations are ongoing"".","Tue, 06 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2014/05/1399365261.jpg,"['press', 'shot', 'broadcaster', 'filipino', 'killers', 'philippines', 'journalists', 'protect', 'radio', 'killing', 'presidential', 'president', 'dead', 'governments']", 
67,67,FL-2014-000062-CHN,New Simon Armitage poem fights pollution – literally - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/new-simon-armitage-poem-fights-pollution-roadside,"A new poem from Simon Armitage is setting out to do more than merely tug at the emotions and expand the horizons of its readers: this particular piece of verse from the award-winning poet is intended to purify the air.

Armitage's In Praise of Air has been printed on a 10m by 20m piece of material which has been coated with microscopic pollution-eating particles of titanium dioxide. These use sunlight and oxygen to react with nitrogen oxide pollutants and purify the air, with the material said by the University of Sheffield, which devised it, to be capable of absorbing the pollution from 20 cars every day.

The poem has been attached to a building at the university, where it will be on display for one year. ""I write in praise of air. I was six or five / When a conjurer opened my knotted fist / and I held in my palm the whole of the sky. / I've carried it with me ever since,"" writes Armitage. ""Let air be a major god, its being / and touch, its breast-milk always tilted / to the lips. Both dragonfly and Boeing / dangle in its see-through nothingness.""

It ends: ""My first word, everyone's first word, was air.""

The bestselling author said he had ""enjoyed working with the scientists and the science, trying to weave the message into the words, wanting to collaborate both conceptually and with the physical manifestation of the work"".

""I wanted to write a poem that was approachable, that might catch the attention of the passer-by and the wandering mind, and one that had some local relevance too,"" said Armitage. ""But I also hope it's robust and intricate enough to sustain deeper enquiries … Poetry often comes out with the intimate and the personal, so it's strange to think of a piece in such an exposed place, written so large and so bold.""

Professor Tony Ryan, pro-vice-chancellor for science at Sheffield University, called the project ""a fun collaboration between science and the arts to highlight a very serious issue of poor air quality in our towns and cities"".

""The science behind this is an additive which delivers a real environmental benefit that could actually help cut disease and save lives,"" he said. ""This poem alone will eradicate the nitrogen oxide pollution created by about 20 cars every day. If every banner, flag or advertising poster in the country did this, we'd have much better air quality. It would add less than £100 to the cost of a poster and would turn advertisements into catalysts in more ways than one. The countless thousands of poster sites that are selling us cars beside our roads could be cleaning up emissions at the same time.""

The poem in full:

In Praise of Air by Simon Armitage

I write in praise of air. I was six or five

when a conjurer opened my knotted fist

and I held in my palm the whole of the sky.

I've carried it with me ever since.

Let air be a major god, its being

and touch, its breast-milk always tilted

to the lips. Both dragonfly and Boeing

dangle in its see-through nothingness…

Among the jumbled bric-a-brac I keep

a padlocked treasure-chest of empty space,

and on days when thoughts are fuddled with smog

or civilization crosses the street

with a white handkerchief over its mouth

and cars blow kisses to our lips from theirs

I turn the key, throw back the lid, breathe deep.

My first word, everyone's first word, was air.","Wed, 14 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400066334702/Simon-Armitage-poem-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f9e504b96e57d3e03cd2280712f44199,"['armitage', 'university', 'poem', 'piece', 'pollution', 'simon', 'science', 'word', 'poster', 'cars', 'praise', 'literally', 'write', 'air', 'fights']", 
68,68,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Is Beyonce Trolling Us on Instagram? - Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-beyonce-trolling-us-on-instagram,"Leave it to Beyoncé to address rumors in a way that is, at the same time, calculated and pointed, vague and prone to speculation, and, most of all, sassy. Proving that Queen Bey has her pulse on exactly how to swiftly grab the attention of today’s culture of web gossipers, both getting them talking and shutting them up at the same time, she did it all on Instagram.

On Wednesday morning, Beyoncé posted four photos in a row of her smiling and looking happy with her sister, Solange. The first was captioned, simply, “Good Morning.” The rest were posted captionless—as was a photo of Beyoncé at the Met Gala with Rihanna—for all of us to apply our own context to them. And we have.

It can’t be coincidence—as in, there’s no way it’s coincidence—that Beyoncé posted the series of pictures just 48 hours after video surfaced of Solange attacking her husband, Jay Z, in an elevator at a Met Gala after-party while she looked on. A torrent of unsubstantiated theories promptly popped all over the gossip sites and social media as to what caused the fight, including one that Solange was mad that Jay Z was ditching Beyoncé to go to another party with Rihanna.

Because Beyoncé appeared to be so passive during the video, standing in a corner and hardly intervening while her sister slapped, punched, and kicked her husband, the community of rampant anonymous speculators began wondering out loud if Beyoncé was on Jay’s side during whatever argument might have happened in the family.

That theory was bolstered after websites did some digging Tuesday and discovered that Solange had appeared to have deleted all photos of Beyoncé from her Instagram following the Met Gala, except for—inexplicably—one photo, on which commenters were promptly snide to point out, “You forgot to delete this one.” (Buzzfeed dug a little deeper and found more than just the one example of photos of Beyoncé that Solange “forgot” to delete.) Meanwhile, after the Met Ball Beyoncé posted a prayer on her own Instagram account about casting out “anyone who is not a good influence.”

Coincidence? You be the judge. Well, actually, the Internet already judged. And they ruled that these sisters must hate each other.

Now, no one expected Beysus to come to the altar (press conference podium) and deliver a sermon (statement) about what really happened that night, or to confirm whether or not she and Solange were on the outs after the incident. But the fact that she seems to slyly—or, rather, quite obviously—be sending a message to us all through her Instagram is an incredibly shrewd PR move. She’s managing to avoid acknowledging or giving legitimacy to the internet vultures feasting on rumors of trouble of the Knowles family, but also is shooting down the vultures completely.

She’s both going on record and not going on the record at the same time. It’s brilliant.

Posting four photos in a row looking happy with her sister? Surely that means that two are on good terms. (Though there is still room for the theory that the series of Instagram photos is Bey’s way of throwing epic amounts of shade at Solange for removing photos of her from her own Instagram. You’re taking down photos of me? I’m going to flood my account with photos of you.) And including the photo of herself with Rihanna is the cherry on top of a rumor-squashing sundae.

For almost three days, we’ve been wondering how or if Beyoncé would respond to this whole controversy. And, with this Instagram stunt, she seems to have perfected the art of crisis management. But of course she has. She’s perfect.","Wed, 14 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492199495/articles/2014/05/14/is-beyonce-trolling-us-on-instagram/140514-beyonce-instagram-fallon-tease_km3umf","['beyoncé', 'met', 'way', 'instagram', 'going', 'sister', 'solange', 'photos', 'trolling', 'posted', 'beyonce', 'good']",

Where To Learn Mysterious Plucked Instruments In London

Londonist loves a good learn, and musical instruments are right up there with languages as far as getting your head around a new non-work skill is concerned. But why stick with a boring old piano or guitar when there are so many other crazy implements to make sound to scare the neighbours with?

Following our pointers on where to learn various types of drumming, different styles of singing and the best places to get your head around music programming, here we round up a selection of weird and wonderful plucked instruments that make the guitar look about as exciting as a cheese sandwich.

Note: the ukulele is too ubiquitous to include here. Whoever thought we'd end up saying that? Strange place, London.

Sitar

India's most famous instrument, producing the music you'll hear on many a Bollywood soundtrack and between Virender Sehwag square cuts on TV. The sitar looks terrifyingly tough to the uninitiated, with seven main strings and a whole load of others used to add rhythmic effects.

For such a famed instrument it's no surprise there is a school devoted to it — the London Sitar Academy offers monthly lessons with teacher Dharambir Singh, typically of four hours in length. They welcome beginners and advanced pupils looking to displace Ravi Shankar at the top of the world sitar league.

Oud

An oud is a type of classical lute, played mostly in the Middle East and as part of Muslim ceremonies and celebrations around the world. With its neck bent back it's one of the stranger-looking instruments in our list, as you can see.

The instrument is pear-shaped, but your playing doesn't have to be with lessons at the Taqasim Music School in Leyton. They offer separate beginner, intermediate and advanced courses in the oud itself, and in the art of taqasim, a form of musical improvisation in the Middle East.

Cavaquinho

The cavaquinho is a small member of the European guitar family with four or eight strings, also known by various other names (machimbo, braguinha, cavaco and others). Gaio de Lima from Rio de Janeiro is a London-based teacher of the cavaquinho and other plucked instruments, who usually holds his classes in the Westbourne Rehearsal Studios in Kensal Town. He also gets folks together in a 'Roda de Choro', students and teachers playing together in a big circle, celebrating the joy of playing strange instruments.

A cavaquinho player is called a cavaquista. For a mid-article treat, here is an entertaining video of such a cavaquista named Eduardo.

Pipa

The pipa is a style of lute most popular in China, where it has been played for well over 2,000 years according to people who know about that type of thing. If a movie has scenes set in China and the guy doing the soundtrack opens his box of stereotypical Chinese instruments, chances are you'll hear a pipa alongside the inevitable flute.

One of London's foremost pipa experts is the internationally renowned Cheng Yu (pictured right), who teaches in the Department of Music at the School of Oriental and African Studies when she's not globetrotting to perform a fine pipa set. She offers tutoring via the UK Chinese Ensemble, a dedicated professional Chinese music organisation who perform all over the UK.

Ngoni / Ramkie / Gunbri

Now here, we're sorry to say, London has let us down. These are a selection of the more popular plucked instruments played in Africa — pictured here is a ramkie, a southern African instrument most often constructed out of a metal can. We can't find anywhere in London that explicitly teaches the more unusual instruments from the African continent, so if you're a master in the art of the things listed here, drop your details in the comments below and expect a flood of eager pupils!

Banjo

We feel a bit sorry for the good old banjo, supplanted as the anti-guitar instrument of choice by the rampant ukulele. It's up to us as Londoners to pull Dixieland's famous stringed instrument back into the hearts of everyday folk, without constant references to Deliverance. And one man who can definitely help us out with that is Banjo Smith, a 5-string banjo player who provides one-to-one tutoring in either Walthamstow or Tooting. Banjo (aka Dick) has played with the likes of Sid Griffin and Lisa Knapp, and if you know who they are you may just have found yourself a new banjo teacher.

President of Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Akihiko Tanaka paid a courtesy call to Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo where they held discussions on various subjects ranging from grant aid to JICA volunteer programs in Solomon Islands.

Mr Tanaka is on a two-day visit to Solomon Islands where he will meet with JICA officials, volunteers and government officials.

During a joint press conference, Mr Lilo said he was pleased with the outcome of the meeting, and greatly encouraged by the commitment that the government of Japan has towards developing the infrastructure and assisted in education in Solomon Islands.

The Prime Minister acknowledge the commitment of the government of Japan through JICA as the implementing agency in developing the national port in Honiara, the road highway in the city and the rehabilitation of the two Mataniko bridges after the recent flash floods that left at least 22 people dead and hundreds homeless.

Mr Lilo also acknowledged the JICA volunteers program in Solomon Islands which he noted as greatly contributing to improving lives in the rural areas.

Mr Lilo applauded the success of the partnership between the government of Solomon Islands and JICA which continuous to grow in strength.

“Our sincere appreciation goes to the government and people of Japan for their continuous assistance towards our development aspirations and the encouragement given by JICA in our ongoing development cooperation in the future” he said.

In response, Mr Tanaka expressed his regret at the loss of lives during the April rainstorm and the subsequent flush floods.

He said JICA has provided emergency supplies during the flush floods including blankets, jerry cans and water purifiers as part of the restoration activities.



Mr Tanaka said a mission was dispatched by the government of Japan after the floods which assessed the post-flood situation of the Mataniko River that would enable them to design the two new bridges.

“JICA would like to continuously extend cooperation in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction and Management. We are ready to further contribute to Solomon’s early recovery and reconstruction and to help Solomon Islands be more resilient to disaster”, he said.

Mr Tanaka will also visit the Kukum clinic and the Henderson SIBC Transmitter site during his brief visit. Mr Tanaka and three other members of his visiting delegation will visit the Japanese war memorial monument in Honiara before their departure on Thursday afternoon.

Shocking Brazil: Six Games that Shook the World Cup, by Fernando Duarte, Arena Sport, RRP£12.99, 240 pages

In 1958 a Brazilian team starring the black teenager Pelé and several other dark-skinned players won the country’s first World Cup. After the victory, wrote the playwright Nelson Rodrigues, “I saw a small black woman. She was the typical slum dweller. But the Brazilian triumph transformed her. She walked down the sidewalk with the charm of Joan of Arc. The same was true for black men, who – attractive, brilliant, luxurious – seemed like fabulous Ethiopian princes.” Brazil, said Rodrigues, “was no longer a mongrel among nations”.

Football has helped Brazil construct its national identity. The game also functions as a lens on to this poorly understood country. Football helps us see Brazil’s beauty, its ugliness and the usually ignored lives of the Brazilian poor. Admittedly, most accounts of Brazilian football omit women but so, for much of history, did Brazil’s public sphere. So what does football reveal about Brazil?

We’ve never been better placed to answer this question. Though Brazil has won an unmatched five World Cups, very little of note has previously been written about its football in English beyond Janet Lever’s groundbreaking sociological study Soccer Madness (1983) and Alex Bellos’s excellent, journalistic Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life (initially published in 2002 and updated this year). Now, with Brazil about to host the World Cup, we suddenly have a flood of books.

¡Golazo!, Andreas Campomar’s effort, is the most comprehensive – too comprehensive, in fact. A Uruguayan who works in London publishing, Campomar has put in his hours at the library. His thick history of Latin American football offers flashes of insight. But most of it reads like a boys’ almanac from the pre-internet era, full of blow-by-blow accounts of long-forgotten matches, seasons and tournaments. No fact is left behind. A truth of football literature: there is nothing deader, for a writer, than a dead football match.

Still, Campomar provides the Brazilian story with useful continental context. The British, dominant figures in 19th-century South American economies, were slower to spread football in Brazil than in more urban Argentina and Uruguay. Only in the late 1920s did Brazil start catching up. Even then, in a country built on genocide and slavery, the white elite was reluctant to let black people play. The Seleção (the national team), in particular, had to stay mostly white, to impress foreigners with Brazil’s racial purity. (As late as 1989, the Chilean admiral José Merino, an instigator of General Augusto Pinochet’s 1973 coup, ranted during a footballing contretemps: “The Brazilians have only recently come down from the tree.”) In 1950, after Brazil traumatically lost to Uruguay in the de facto World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro’s Maracanã stadium, the black goalkeeper Barbosa was anointed scapegoat.

The “Maracanazo”, as Uruguayans dubbed their victory, probably scarcely registered with most illiterate rural Brazilians at the time. Regardless, Brazilian writers have called it their country’s “Waterloo” or “Hiroshima”. Humiliated again, Brazil hadn’t been able to shed what Rodrigues described as its “stray-dog complex”.

Yet by 1962, Brazil had become the “futebol nation” – not just the world’s best football country but a country whose sense of self and international image derived largely from football. This story is told best by David Goldblatt, British author of the game’s landmark history The Ball Is Round. Now he has written a history of Brazilian football because, he explains, “someone had to write it”. Nothing similar exists, perhaps not even in Portuguese. Goldblatt graciously admits: “This book ought to have been written by someone else, preferably someone Brazilian, at the very least a person with a good command of the Portuguese language.” His heavy reliance on sources in English is, indeed, a weakness. However, Goldblatt has a knack for putting football into its socio-economic context, a gift for synthesis, and frightening eloquence. After a stodgy beginning, the book soars from 1950 onwards.

Goldblatt shows how football helped Brazil accept itself as a mixed nation. In the 1930s the social scientist Gilberto Freyre began to spin a national story in which Brazil’s mixed heritage became a source of pride, not shame. In his book about life on a northeastern sugar plantation, Freyre celebrated sex between white masters and black slaves. That, he said, created a unique Brazilian race. Later, Freyre argued that Brazil’s “mulattoism” brought dance, trickery and artistry to its football. This made Brazil potentially a better, more beautiful football nation than white countries such as England or Argentina. Other Brazilian writers took up the theme. Across Latin America, intellectuals were trying to celebrate their local heritage rather than sell their countries as just lesser versions of Europe.

Finally, players such as Pelé and Garrincha arrived to embody Freyre’s racial theories. After Brazil beat hosts Sweden in the World Cup final in 1958, writes Goldblatt, “the King of Sweden actually came down to the pitch to join the celebratory melee”. The world was falling for Brazilian football. In 1962 Brazil were world champions again.

With hindsight, those years were a golden age, and not just in football. Brazil then was a less violent country, with fast economic growth. The military coup of 1964 was yet to come. The best Brazilian players still played for Brazilian clubs rather than in Europe. Children had ample open spaces to learn football. (Brazil’s population in 1960 was just 70m; today it is 200m, and few poor Brazilian kids now ever see a beach, let alone get to play on one.)

By 1970, when a “Beautiful Team” won Brazil its third World Cup – the country’s peak moment of global esteem, its equivalent of the American moon landing – the military regime was crawling all over the Seleção. In a country with poor literacy and no modern wars to solidify national identity, dictators needed football to build the nation. Campomar argues that something similar happened across Latin America: football helped the new Spanish-speaking nations differentiate themselves from each other, and gain European respect.

Football was the one arena in which Latin America led the world, at least until about 1994. No wonder former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was desperate to host this year’s World Cup: only football has ever given Brazil a place on the global stage commensurate with the country’s size. As Bellos wrote, whereas “Britain marks out the twentieth century in blocks divided by the world wars”, Brazil measures the century in World Cups.

Yet though Brazil won the tournament in 1994 and 2002, it has never matched the glory of 1970. In fact, every Brazilian team now has to play against the memory of 1970. The task is twofold: to win the World Cup, and to do it while playing “jogo bonito”, the “beautiful game”. Brazil almost certainly won’t manage it this year either.

Gradually a national argument has developed pitting “futebol-força” against “futebol-arte” – should Brazil play more with force or art? The military regime and the Seleção’s coaches tended to prefer force and discipline; most fans favoured art. This echoed a broader Brazilian debate: should Brazil emulate organised countries, or did it have its own more creative route to development? The argument crystallised around Brazil’s beautiful defeat against Italy in the World Cup of 1982, which had Brazilians weeping in the streets and then welcoming the returning team home as heroes. Many Brazilians still prefer their losers of 1982 to their dour winners of 1994.

These arguments about national style are nicely recounted in Fernando Duarte’s Shocking Brazil. A Brazilian journalist living in London, Duarte offers something unique: a rollicking account of the country’s World Cup history in English by an insider. He’s longer on description than analysis, and the strain of writing in a foreign language shows, but he tells good stories, and the great players he interviews actually say interesting things.

The “beautiful game” is often taken to reflect Brazil’s gift for sensuous beauty. But after 1970, modern Brazilian football has more often reflected Brazil’s ugliness. Take the country’s mistreatment of its poor: fans packed into decaying stands, players overworked in unending league seasons (FC São Paulo once played two games in a day). Most Brazilian footballers today earn the minimum wage – if they get their salaries at all.

Brazilian football also reflects Brazilian violence: fans frequently get killed, occasionally live on TV. Then there’s Brazil’s economic reliance on exports of raw materials: all the leading Brazilian players now play abroad, where many grow estranged from the fans back home. Duarte quotes the great left-back Roberto Carlos gloating about his expensive Rolex: “I carry a whole flat on my wrist.”

And there’s Brazil’s corruption. The directors who traditionally run Brazilian football – “cartolas”, or “top hats” – make European clubs look like models of good governance. One family – João Havelange and later his son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira– ruled Brazil’s dreadful football association, the CBF, for most of the era from 1958 to 2012. Teixeira recently briefly decamped to Miami after some embarrassing revelations but he has left his mark. The initial organising committee for Brazil’s World Cup, writes Goldblatt, consisted of Teixeira, his daughter, “his lawyer, his press secretary, his personal secretary and factotum, and the man who had advised him during the 2001 congressional investigation into football”. Also on the committee was an ex-president of the Bank of Brazil from the military era – but nobody from government. In important respects, the coming World Cup is Teixeira’s baby. His successor, José Maria Marin, a relic of the military years, is best known for stealthily pocketing a winners’ medal during an awards ceremony after a youth match. You can see why, in a recent survey by research group Datafolha, most Brazilians said that the World Cup would bring “more losses than benefits”.

Still, things may be improving. Partly thanks to the magnifying lens of football, Brazil’s horrors are coming into full view. The mostly peaceful, mostly middle-class demonstrations during last year’s Confederations Cup were among the largest protests in Brazilian history. People were protesting against everything from bus fares to gay-bashing but, as Goldblatt notes, it was the wasteful spending on the World Cup that helped galvanise anger. Teixeira is gone, average attendances at domestic games have been creeping up, Brazil’s recent economic rise means that fewer players are leaving to play abroad and, although about half the country’s 12 new stadiums will probably become white elephants the moment the World Cup ends, the other half may finally allow Brazilians to watch football in safety and comfort.

For now the Brazilian game remains mostly ugly. These books help us see the coming tournament clearly, stripped of the unrelenting “beautiful game”/samba/1970 hype.

The long journey is filled with action and familiar characters, but ultimately falls short of success. All the brains, heart and courage in the world can't save a movie that doesn't have a third act.

The animated film is based on ""Dorothy of Oz,"" by Frank L. Baum's great-grandson Roger S. Baum. It never approaches the subtle beauty or emotional pull of the 1939 film, despite attempts to repeat some of the magic with musical numbers. It's possible that someone will some day write or perform a better song for a film than ""Over the Rainbow."" It's less likely Bryan Adams or Lea Michele will be part of that equation.

The sequel begins with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion panicking about the state of Emerald City, where beloved Oz figures have been turned into puppets. They send a rainbow to Kansas that can teleport Dorothy, who is dealing with a post-tornado eviction. The animation in this scene, and several others after it, looks like something from a cereal commercial.

""Legends of Oz"" isn't completely without merit, or effort. The art direction and production design are solid, creating an imaginative landscape that is often worthy of the Oz label. Chivalrous marshmallow soldier Marshal Mallow (voiced by Hugh Dancy) and the high-maintenance China Princess (Megan Hilty) offer some pleasantly trippy Baum-style weirdness.

But the familiar heroes and primary villain display little depth. The most grating newcomer is antagonist the Jester, voiced by Martin Short, who must have been paid in cases of Rockstar energy drink. He isn't particularly menacing, and there's no pathos accompanying the character, either. The Jester is just another obstacle. A shouting, hyper, unpleasantly manic obstacle.

The animation is disappointing in ""Legends of Oz,"" with filmmakers often choosing dull contrast-free tones. Repetitive action inspires the lazy feeling one gets while watching someone else play a video game. The bland visual depiction does Michele no favors, capturing almost none of the spunky or compassionate qualities of Dorothy. Even Toto seems lacking in depth, as if he'd just jumped off a ""Legends of Oz"" lunch box.

After a few entertaining diversions along the way, the ending is a disaster, piling on visual distractions before wrapping everything up in a too-tidy bow. There was sadness and hope when Dorothy returned to tornado-ravaged Kansas at the finish of the original ""Wizard,"" to face a possibly bleak future surrounded by loved ones. ""Legend of Oz"" drops a house on that perfect ending, with an oversimplified and painfully scripted fight against con men trying to condemn Dorothy's family home.

""Legends of Oz"" may have some deeply hidden charms. We still haven't watched it cued up to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon."" Mostly, the film reaffirms how hard it is to make a movie as unforgettable and enduring as ""The Wizard of Oz."" Good chance you'll forget this one on the way home from the theater.","Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/27/74/16/6275987/6/rawImage.jpg,"['oz', 'return', 'way', 'dorothy', 'review', 'rainbow', 'film', 'dorothys', 'legends', 'act', 'short', 'visual', 'missing', 'wizard', 'voiced']", 
75,75,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Joint Restaurant Experiment Ends as Palm Coast's Red Lobster Closes and Olive Garden Grows Larger - FlaglerLive.com,https://flaglerlive.com/66172/olive-garden-darden/,"Three years ago Darden Restaurants opened a Red Lobster and an Olive Garden in Palm Coast’s Target shopping center. The restaurants had separate dining rooms but a joint kitchen, and were designed to give Darden a competitive advantage by more efficiently providing different brands under the same roof.

That joint operation is ending.

The Orlando Sentinel on Tuesday reported that Orlando-Based Darden, whose shareholders have been chafing with management, has already closed two similar joint operations over the weekend (in Georgia and South Carolina) and will convert the Palm Coast restaurant and three others like it into stand-alone Olive Gardens in the near future. The time of the change-over is not precisely known, but it will not affect the Olive Garden side of the operation. Darden plans to sell or spin off its Red Lobsters.

“That was like a prototype of a combined store format, which I thought made sense, because you only have one set of rest rooms, you only have one bar and one kitchen,” said Toby Tobin, the Realtor and publisher GoToby.com, the real estate website covering Palm Coast and Flagler County. “I wouldn’t read that the format was unsuccessful as much as I would read that for whatever reason, Red Lobsters are not as successful as they once were.”

For the Target shopping center, Red Lobster’s closure is the second blow in six weeks: in late March, Books-A-Million announced that it was closing its store there, eliminating Palm Coast’s only general interest bookstore. But the elimination of Red Lobster is not equivalent to a restaurant closing outright so much as the loss of some choice for restaurant-goers. The restaurant space itself will simply convert to Olive Garden’s uses, preserving some—but by no means all—of the jobs that would have otherwise been lost had the restaurant closed outright.

Aside from Red Lobster and Olive Garden, Darden owns Longhorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, the Capital Grill, Eddie V’s, the Yard House chain and Seasons 52. Combined, the company runs more than 2,000 restaurants, including—as of the end of 2013– 822 Olive Gardens and 678 Red Lobsters. Three weeks ago, when the company decided to spin off or sell the Red Lobster operations, a group of shareholders sued, claiming the company had no right to change its bylaws to prevent shareholders from having a say in the fate of Red Lobster.

The company as a whole has been struggling. Sales at established restaurants fell 8.8 percent at Red Lobster and 5.4 percent at Olive Garden in the third quarter ended Feb. 23. Losses at Red Lobster have been especially steep, with percentage declines in customer visits for nine straight months.

Restaurants open and close almost weekly in Palm Coast and Flagler County, Tobin said, few of them garnering much attention. The change with live Garden and Red Lobster “is newsworthy because it’s a national chain,” he said.

Beau Falgout, Palm Coast’s senior planner, could not be reached Tuesday.","Tue, 06 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/red-lobster-olive-garden.jpg,"['shareholders', 'company', 'joint', 'darden', 'grows', 'garden', 'palm', 'lobster', 'restaurants', 'olive', 'restaurant', 'red', 'larger', 'experiment']",

Storm chaser sees one hit near St. James, Minnesota, but there is no damage

Storms will hit Arkansas to Indiana on Friday, with rain continuing into Saturday

A line of widely scattered strong storms brought tornadoes to Colorado and Minnesota on Thursday and damaging high winds as far south as Texas.

Three tornadoes stuck Minnesota. One hit near rural St. James. Kholby Martin, a storm chaser with KDR Media, said it was a couple of hundred yards wide but it wasn't fully condensed.

Officials said no one was hurt, nor was there any structural damage.

Two tornadoes touched down in Colorado.

There was still a possibility of tornadoes in south central Minnesota and central Iowa on Thursday night.

Dallas County in Texas saw an hourlong tornado warning Thursday afternoon as the system moved through, bringing winds of up to 70 mph, the National Weather Service said. Students at Southern Methodist University were told to shelter in place.

That was followed by a flash flood warning for several counties in the area through the early evening hours.

CNN affiliate WFAA reported that five boys were rescued from a creek after fast-moving waters moved in. Emergency responders found the boys clinging to whatever they could find along the shore, the station said.

There was wind damage around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In one neighborhood in west Dallas, residents told WFAA that when the storm hit they saw debris flying through the air and heard transformers popping.

Deborah Drake came home to find the glass in an entrance door to her home shattered by some of that debris.

""You just heard this noise (like a train whistle) then it just shook the house,"" said a neighbor who was helping her clean up broken glass. ""I ran in the bathroom and got in the bathtub.""

Some areas of South Dakota near Harrisburg were pelted by quarter-size hail, according to the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls. Winds were blowing as fast as 50 mph.

On Friday, strong storms will probably strike from Arkansas to Indiana, with rain in the Midwest, South and Northeast as the system moves east. That blustery, wet weather could affect as many as 14 million people, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. Saturday should bring more rain for those areas, too.

Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, will also get wet as 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast. The area has been dealing with recent heavy rains, so the risk is high in those areas for flash flooding, and there's been a flash flood watch issued.

Tired of reading about rain? Sorry, there's more.

Rain will begin drenching the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, with the system moving to the Northern Rockies on Friday and Saturday.","Fri, 09 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140508200302-tsr-interview-myers-tornado-update-00004029-story-top.jpg,"['hit', 'storms', 'south', 'minnesota', 'severe', 'rain', 'watch', 'winds', 'weather', 'colorado', 'tornadoes']", 
77,77,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Prisoner to sue justice ministry over books ban - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/08/prisoner-sue-justice-ministry-books-ban,"A female prisoner who has been left ""in despair"" by the ban on books being sent to inmates is preparing a legal challenge to the Ministry of Justice, according to the BBC.

Highly educated and epileptic, the claimant known as BGJ – currently serving a life sentence – is working with lawyers on a case attempting to overturn the recent policy which prevents prisoners from receiving small packages, reported Newsnight's political editor Emily Maitlis.

""[She] is described by her legal team as 'in despair' over the policy, which prevents her from accessing reading matter,"" said Maitlis. ""Her lawyers say the effects of this policy are particularly hard felt by women and by those on life sentences who depend on what they receive from the outside world to keep them motivated and incentivised.""

The Howard League for Penal Reform has also been contacted by prisoners who have been denied access to books, chief executive Frances Crook said this morning, and is considering bringing further legal action against the MoJ on their behalf. The organisation, which broke the news of the blanket ban on families sending in small items to prisoners, is also working with human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC on potential action against justice secretary Chris Grayling for acting ""unlawfully and irrationally"".

The BBC said that lawyers representing BGJ had been told by the MoJ that they were too late, ""as you are only allowed to appeal against a policy within a three-month period, which in this case has now passed"". But according to Maitlis, the lawyers are preparing to challenge that rule, since even though the new policy was introduced in November, it has been implemented slowly across the prison network, and only affected their client in the past 10 days.

Meanwhile the Howard League and leading British authors including Carol Ann Duffy, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Mark Haddon have attacked a letter from the National Offender Management Service's chief executive Michael Spurr, which they say effectively refuses a meeting to discuss the issue.

The letter, which the Howard League has made public , sees Spurr write to Duffy, Crook, McEwan and others that there have been ""no changes in the availability of books in prisons"", and that ""allowing parcels to be sent in unrestricted would be operationally unmanageable and would lead to a significant risk of drugs and other illicit items being smuggled into prisons"".

He also writes that ""you have asked about the possibility of meeting the secretary of state to discuss your concerns further"". ""The rationale for the changes has been set out in detail in the secretary of state's open letter to the poet laureate,"" writes Spurr. ""In the letter, the secretary of state invited the poet laureate to visit a prison library and to take the opportunity to talk to staff. I understand, however, that the invitation was not taken up.""

But Duffy said it was ""atrocious that government ministers will not even meet with the Howard League to discuss our concerns"", and that she did not want ""to engage in a media stunt with the Lord Chancellor in visiting a prison, as I, like most writers, have already visited prisons and indeed wrote the foreword to an edition of the PEN Prisoners Writing Anthology"".

""What I and other authors want to see is government ministers taking our concerns seriously and engaging positively and publicly with the Howard League and English PEN to address the issues we have raised,"" said the poet laureate.

Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, called the response ""a snub to some of the country's most outstanding authors who have demonstrated their commitment to the campaign"", and Crook added that ""it appears that the ministry of justice wishes to shut its eyes and ears to what has become an international scandal"".

""I am afraid it is not so easy to shelve our campaign. If ministers … will not hear our case, and rely on repeating dubious justifications that have been comprehensively trashed in the media, then we will look to take our concerns to Downing Street,"" she said.","Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399546743383/Womens-prison-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aaa6614d1823ac27f0b8fb53d9a1d4ea,"['books', 'policy', 'howard', 'prisoners', 'lawyers', 'justice', 'ban', 'prisoner', 'spurr', 'letter', 'league', 'sue', 'prison', 'ministry', 'concerns', 'secretary']",

(CNN) - Hey Boko Haram, have you read the Quran lately?

Most of the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world have, and we're utterly certain that it condemns kidnapping young girls and selling them into slavery - no matter what you say ""Allah"" tells you.

According to Amnesty International, several hundred schoolgirls - both Christian and Muslim - between the ages of 16 and 18 were abducted at gunpoint on April 14 from their rooms at the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Nigeria, where they had been sleeping.

The armed extremist group Boko Haram, which roughly translates to “Western Education is Sin,” claimed responsibility for these mass kidnappings and threatened to sell these young girls for as little as $12 into sex slavery or forced “marriages” to members of their group.

""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said in a video first obtained by Agence France-Presse.

""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,"" he continued, according to a CNN translation from the local Hausa language.

'I will sell them,' Boko Haram leader says of kidnapped Nigerian girl

As a Muslim human rights lawyer, it is obscene and absolutely un-Islamic for these lunatic human traffickers to invoke the name of God while kidnapping young girls and threatening to sell them into sexual slavery.

The leaders of Boko Haram have clearly never read the Holy Quran, which states quite clearly that “oppression is worse than murder” (2:191) and that nobody “shall force girls to commit prostitution” (24:33).

They must have also missed the numerous times that the Prophet Muhammad categorically stated during his life that women or children were never to be harmed under any situation.

“These abducted schoolgirls are my sisters,” said 2013 Nobel Peace Prize nominee Malala Yousafzai recently in a New York Times interview on the Boko Haram kidnappings.

“The international community and the government of Nigeria (must) take action and save my sisters. … It should be our duty to speak up for our brothers and sisters in Nigeria who are in a very difficult situation.”

Nigeria abductions: 6 reasons why the world should demand action

The real heroes are young Muslim women like Malala Yousafzai and these latest Nigerian schoolgirls who continue to assert their basic human rights to education in the face of danger every day.

These amazing young women will help to empower and motivate our young Muslim girls to become their countries’ next generations of scientists, technologists, engineers and doctors.

In the meantime, the rest of the world’s Muslim population will continue to denounce extremists like Boko Haram.

And we will proudly stand in solidarity with these missing young schoolgirls in Nigeria, and every other woman around the world who continues to fight for her basic human rights.

81,81,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Thailand's PM expelled from office - ucanews,https://www.ucanews.com/news/thailands-pm-expelled-from-office/70885,"Thailand's Constitutional Court Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and nine ministers for abuse of power, leaving the government clinging to power but the nation still locked in a political crisis.

The cabinet swiftly appointed a deputy premier -- Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan -- to replace Yingluck, the younger sister of billionaire former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as the ruling party struggled to regain its footing after the judicial blow.

The court, which has played a key role in deposing two other Shinawatra-linked governments in recent turbulent years, ruled unanimously that Yingluck acted illegally by transferring a top security official in 2011.

""Therefore her prime minister status has ended... Yingluck can no longer stay in her position acting as caretaker prime minister,"" presiding judge Charoon Intachan said in a televised ruling.

Nine cabinet ministers who endorsed the decision to transfer Thawil Pliensri were also stripped of their status.

But fears that the court would dismiss the entire cabinet proved unfounded.

Niwattumrong, a Thaksin loyalist who is also commerce minister, was quickly promoted to the role of caretaker premier.

He vowed to press ahead with a planned July 20 election to establish a new government. That poll date has yet to be endorsed by a royal decree.

Observers said the court ruling does nothing to ease Thailand's prolonged political malaise.

Anti-government protesters are still on Bangkok's streets and the promotion of a Thaksin supporter may make Yingluck's dismissal a hollow victory.

""Red Shirt"" supporters of the government meanwhile threaten to rally to defend it and to press for elections, raising fears of clashes. They will mass on Saturday in a Bangkok suburb.

""This is a war of legal attrition,"" said Paul Chambers of the Institute of South East Asian Affairs at Chiang Mai University.

""And the arch-royalists (anti-government forces) are winning it. They are cutting away at the Puea Thai government slice by slice, hoping to exhaust it into submission,"" he said predicting fresh legal cases against the new premier.

The kingdom has been bitterly split since 2006 when an army coup deposed former telecoms magnate Thaksin as prime minister.

He now lives overseas to avoid jail for corruption convictions, but is accused of running the country by proxy through his sister.

Thaksin is reviled by the Bangkok elite, middle class and royalist southerners who say he has sponsored nepotism and widespread corruption and who see him as a threat to the monarchy.

But he is loved in the poorer north and northeastern regions and among the urban working class for recognising their burgeoning political and economic aspirations.

They have returned Shinawatra-led or linked governments to power in every election since 2001.

In a defiant press conference Yingluck reiterated her innocence of the abuse of power accusation.

""I am proud of every minute I have worked as prime minister because I came from a democratic election,"" she said, at times fighting back tears.

In the six months since the latest street protests erupted, 25 people have been killed and hundreds wounded in gun and grenade attacks, kindling fears of wider clashes.

A general election called by Yingluck in February to shore up her besieged government was disrupted by protesters and boycotted by the main opposition party.

It was later annulled by the Constitutional Court, enraging Red Shirts who said the judges effectively stole their vote.

Anti-government demonstrators are likely to reject the latest poll date. They want an appointed premier to enact loosely defined ""reforms"" to curb the influence of the Shinawatras before any new election.

The ruling party has accused the constitutional court of railroading Yingluck's case through because it is biased against the Shinawatras.

The court oversees cases of violations of Thailand's charter, which was rewritten after Thaksin's removal.

In 2008 it forced two Thaksin-allied prime ministers from office.

Yingluck will also find out over the coming days if she will be indicted by anti-graft officials for neglect of duty in connection with a costly rice subsidy scheme.

An unfavourable ruling could see her banned from politics for five years.

With both sides convinced they can prevail, the ongoing battle for ""Thailand's soul"" looks set to drag on, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.

""Somehow both sides have to think that they cannot win it all -- that's when we will see some compromise... but right now we are likely to see things get much worse before things get better.""

82,82,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Oscar Wilde's gift to governor who let him read in Reading gaol up for auction - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/13/oscar-wilde-gift-governor-reading-gaol-auction,"An edition of The Importance of Being Earnest personally inscribed by Oscar Wilde to the prison governor who the playwright said did him ""a great and noble kindness"" in allowing him access to reading and writing materials will be auctioned for thousands of pounds this summer.

Wilde was found guilty of gross indecency in May 1895, and moved from Wandsworth prison to Reading gaol that November, where his stay was overseen initially by prison governor Henry Isaacson, a man Wilde said had ""the soul of a rat"". The author had feared he was losing his mind under Isaacson's regime, writing to the home secretary of ""the fearful system of cellular confinement"", the absence of writing materials, and the absence of books which he called ""so vital for the preservation of mental balance"".

The prisoner, wrote Wilde – in an echo of today's ban on prisoners being sent books by their families – ""is deprived of everything that could soothe, distract, or heal a wounded and shaken mind"", and ""horrible as all the physical privations of modern prison life are, they are as nothing compared to the entire privation of literature to one to whom Literature was once the first thing of life, the mode by which perfection could be realised, by which, and by which alone, the intellect could feel itself alive"".

When Major James Nelson took over from Isaacson, he immediately gave Wilde access to books; the new governor is said to have told Wilde: ""The Home Office has allowed you some books. Perhaps you would like to read this one. I have just been reading it myself.""

Wilde is said, in Thomas Wright's biographical study Oscar's Books, to have broken down and wept at the words, ""the first kind words that have been spoken to me since I have been in [Reading] gaol"". Nelson also allowed his most famous prisoner to begin writing again – Wilde would go on to pen De Profundis while in Reading gaol, the letter to his former lover Lord Alfred Douglas in which he writes of how ""I have lain in prison for nearly two years. Out of my nature has come wild despair; an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at; terrible and impotent rage; bitterness and scorn; anguish that wept aloud; misery that could find no voice; sorrow that was dumb.""

Nelson bent the rules for Wilde – all written material was meant to be handed to the authorities each evening, but he would let Wilde consult his previous work to keep the thread of his writing, and when the author was released in 1897, Nelson returned the whole manuscript to him.

Wilde described Nelson elsewhere as ""the most Christlike man I ever met"", and in the specially printed copy of The Importance of Being Earnest – number 13 of just 100– has written: ""To Major Nelson: from the author. A trivial recognition of a great and noble kindness. Feb, 99."" The copy of the play is to be auctioned by Bonhams in London on 18 June, and is expected to fetch up to £60,000.

""This inscribed edition of The Importance of Being Earnest is a poignant reminder of the very real hardship which Wilde suffered in prison and the enormous difference which Major Nelson's acts of common humanity made to the writer's morale and health,"" said Bonhams head of books Matthew Haley. ""It is arguable that the governor saved Wilde's life and almost certain that without him there would have been no De Profundis.""

The Importance of Being Earnest was the last work written by Wilde before his conviction. It opened on Valentine's Day 1895 and closed after just 56 performances despite its huge success, after the author went on trial, and was not published until 1899, just a year before Wilde died.

In 1898, Wilde had sent Nelson a copy of The Ballad of Reading Gaol, the poem he wrote in exile in France about a prisoner who is condemned to death, and how he ""looked / With such a wistful eye / Upon that little tent of blue / Which prisoners call the sky."" Wilde wrote in that copy: ""Major Nelson from the Author. In recognition of many acts of kindness and gentleness Feb.98"".","Tue, 13 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1399982585815/Oscar-Wilde--009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3727de79b155f3f33d3082dd6251ac18,"['books', 'let', 'gift', 'wildes', 'auction', 'major', 'writing', 'reading', 'importance', 'read', 'nelson', 'author', 'gaol', 'prison', 'oscar', 'wilde', 'governor']",

Out later this month in France and Germany, the diaries have just been acquired for UK publication by Harvill Secker, which will release an English edition in July. ""He's always kept a diary, and has been asked to publish before and hasn't wanted to, but recent events have changed his mind,"" said editor Ellie Steel. ""I don't think Harvill Secker has ever translated and published a book in such a short space of time. The situation changes daily in Ukraine, and we felt it was important to publish Andrey's diaries as soon as possible, as close to their time of writing as we can.""

The diaries, said Steel, run from 21 November, the night of the first EuroMaidan rallies following the government's decision to stop European Union integration, up until the last week of April. The book will be a mix of on-the-ground commentary, Ukrainian political history, and Kurkov's personal account of living through a time of intense political unrest, said Harvill Secker.

The author, best known for the hit novel Death and the Penguin, told the Guardian that he had originally wanted to write ""a book for foreign readers about Ukraine – which would help readers to get rid of traditional clichés existing about Ukraine thanks to journalists and some politicians"". But while he readied his proposal for that title, Ukraine's prime minister announced that the country would not sign the association treaty with the EU, and the protests began.

""As I have written private diaries for over 35 years I carried on describing my and my family's life in the diary together with the situation in Kiev and in the country,"" said Kurkov.

So on a daily basis I wrote what was happening in Ukraine, in Kiev, in our village house and Kiev flat starting from 21 November ... The events of course go on, the occupation of the Crimea and what followed is also in my daily notes. In fact every evening I was sending new texts to my translators in Berlin and Paris.""

A team of researchers, led by Ivan Ramirez from the University of Texas at Austin, has identified the first “sibling” of the Sun — a star that was almost certainly born from the same cloud of gas and dust as our star. Ramirez’s methods will help other astronomers find other “solar siblings,” work that could lead to an understanding of how and where our Sun formed and how our solar system became hospitable for life.



“We want to know where we were born,” Ramirez said. “If we can figure out in what part of the galaxy the Sun formed, we can constrain conditions on the early solar system. That could help us understand why we are here.”



Additionally, there is a chance, “small, but not zero,” Ramirez said, that these solar sibling stars could host planets that harbor life. In their earliest days within their birth cluster, he explains, collisions could have knocked chunks off planets, and these fragments could have traveled between solar systems and perhaps even may have been responsible for bringing primitive life to Earth. Or, fragments from Earth could have transported life to planets orbiting solar siblings. “So it could be argued that solar siblings are key candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life,” Ramirez said.



The solar sibling his team identified is a star called HD 162826, a star 15 percent more massive than the Sun, located 110 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. The star is not visible to the unaided eye, but easily can be seen with low-power binoculars, not far from the bright star Vega.



The team identified HD 162826 as the Sun’s sibling by following up on 30 possible candidates found by several groups around the world looking for solar siblings. Ramirez’s team studied 23 of these stars in depth with the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the remaining stars — visible only from the Southern Hemisphere — with the Clay Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. All of these observations used high-resolution spectroscopy to get a deep understanding of the stars’ chemical makeups.



But several factors are needed to really pin down a solar sibling, Ramirez said. In addition to chemical analysis, his team also included information about the stars’ orbits — where they had been and where they are going in their paths around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The team’s experts in this field, which is called “dynamics,” are A. T. Bajkova of the Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in St. Petersburg, Russia, and V. V. Bobylev of St. Petersburg State University.



Combining information on both chemical makeup and dynamics of the candidates narrowed the field down to one: HD 162826.



By “lucky coincidence,” Ramirez said, this star has been studied by the McDonald Observatory Planet Search team. “They have been observing it for more than 15 years,” he said. Studies by Michael Endl and William Cochran from the University of Texas together with calculations by Rob Wittenmyer of the University of New South Wales have ruled out any “hot Jupiters” — massive planets orbiting close to the star. The studies indicate that it’s unlikely that a Jupiter analog orbits the star, but they do not rule out the presence of smaller terrestrial planets.



While the finding of a single solar sibling is intriguing, Ramirez points out that the project has a larger purpose: to create a road map for how to identify solar siblings in preparation for the flood of data expected soon from surveys like Gaia.



“The idea is that the Sun was born in a cluster with a thousand or a hundred thousand stars. This cluster, which formed more than 4.5 billion years ago, has since broken up,” Ramirez said. “A lot of things can happen in that amount of time.” The member stars have broken off into their own orbits around the galactic center, taking them to different parts of the Milky Way today. A few, like HD 162826, are still nearby; others are much farther afield.



The data coming soon from Gaia is “not going to be limited to the solar neighborhood,” Ramirez said, noting that Gaia will provide accurate distances and proper motions for a billion stars, allowing astronomers to search for solar siblings all the way to the center of our galaxy. “The number of stars that we can study will increase by a factor of 10,000.”



But even with information on more stars to work with, it’s not like “we’re going to throw this data into a machine, and it’s going to spit out the answer,” Ramirez said. “It’s not that simple. You have to be careful, do things the old way — star-by-star analysis.”



His team’s road map, however, will speed up the process.



“Don’t invest a lot of time in analyzing every detail in every star,” he said. “You can concentrate on certain key chemical elements that are going to be very useful.” These elements are ones that vary greatly among stars that otherwise have similar chemical compositions. These highly variable chemical elements are largely dependent on where in the galaxy the star formed. Ramirez’s team has identified the elements barium and yttrium as particularly useful.



Once many more solar siblings have been identified, astronomers will be one step closer to knowing where and how the Sun formed. To reach that goal, the dynamics specialists will make models that run the orbits of all known solar siblings backward in time to find where they intersect — their birthplace.

86,86,FL-2014-000062-CHN,DR Congo faces food insecurity despite aid - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2014/5/11/dr-congo-faces-food-insecurity-despite-aid,"Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo – When the World Food Programme delivered aid to internally displaced people in the camps nearest to Goma, it did so after several months of warnings that funding shortages could lead to famine conditions.

Months had passed since the last delivery of aid to the camps. During that time, food had run out at the Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp, and residents spoke in April of an increase in prostitution and theft as a result of the insecure conditions.

“There is no food,” said a woman named Mary, as she braided another woman’s hair in Mugunga’s makeshift beauty salon consisting of a single, broken plastic chair. “We don’t know if there will ever be food again.”

But there was food. Nearby, a WFP warehouse held 2,200 tonnes. Some of it, including bags of rice and corn, was stamped with expiry dates from nearly a year prior.

It seems like a clear problem with an easy solution – people are starving, and relief organisations have food. But the issue of aid in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is mired by social, political and economic stakes in a region that has faced two decades of fighting.

According to Dr J Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, the challenge of food insecurity in the Congo is not climatological or meteorological, unlike other African nations in crisis. The weather and soil conditions are ripe for planting, but the political conditions are not.

“It’s not just a matter of forcing people, or incentivising them, to go home and plant. You have to really create the conditions where it would make sense for them to do so,” Pham said.

“If I’m a Congolese, I’m not going to plant, hoe, weed and do all that back-breaking work for the next six months if I have a reasonable fear that in three months I might be running for my life – or if I’m not running, that a marauding gang, or for that matter, marauding government troops, are likely to eat my crop for me.”

A pattern of dependency

This creates tensions between releasing the food aid into the community, which will flood the market and drive down costs, and keeping the market restricted enough to inflate prices to encourage people to attempt farming.

“Holding the food back means there are people hungry now,” Pham said. “But releasing it would mean a likelihood of even greater hunger down the road.”

According to Julien Paluku Kahongya, governor of North Kivu province, this lack of security has created a pattern of dependency on the international humanitarian aid community, and on the government, that is proving difficult to break.

“When the war ended, we told people to leave the camps and go back to their villages,” he told Al Jazeera from a table on his front lawn while gunfire rang out nearby.

“Now, we see there is a population that wants to stay in camps forever and demand assistance. That is why you can see aid remaining in our warehouses. It is not because we want the population to die with hunger, but because we want to be sure that the IDPs who are in front of us are real IDPs.”

Kahongya said he is partnering with the NGOs to complete a new census of those still in the camps.

Further restrictions on how aid can be distributed, determined by foreign donors, can also thwart the relief process. In his office at the WFP compound in Goma, an employee pulls a distribution request from an old filing cabinet.

“Each month, they send me a distribution plan,” he said, referring to WFP headquarters in the DRC. “This one asks for cooking oil. At the moment, I have around 300 tonnes of oil in the warehouse.” But the US donation has some restrictions, he explained: “It’s only for IDPs. But this request is for food-for-work – so I cannot send the oil.” He asked not to be named to prevent possible repercussions from speaking to the press.

Oil, rice, corn and the tonnes of food at the WFP warehouses sit until the right paperwork, hunger levels and economic conditions determine when it should be distributed.

‘What kind of country have we become?’

The continued presence of international aid organisations is a point of ambivalence for some locals, who increasingly view the patrons with wariness. More than 15 people interviewed for this article – including international and local aid workers, business owners, and government employees, among others – questioned the ongoing relief culture that has pervaded Goma, and whether the local economy would collapse should the international community leave the region.

“There is no exit strategy,” said Fidel Bafilemba, a Goma-based field researcher with Enough, an NGO devoted to ending genocide and other crimes against humanity, and a former international aid worker. “There is no plan for allowing Congo to sustain itself. What kind of country have we become knowing muzungas [Westerners] provide all our basic needs – food, water, shelter? What will happen when they leave?”

In the long history of international aid agencies, there are very few that seek to put themselves out of business. - Dr J Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council



As Bafilemba spoke, several UN helicopters roared overhead. He pointed to the sky and said, “We hope that will be the UN legacy; that they will leave their trucks and their buildings and their helicopters here when they go.”

That exit doesn’t appear to be forthcoming. After nearly 20 years of “emergency relief”, the international aid community is woven into the fabric of Goma, so it’s difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. There is no comprehensive, collaborative plan between the agencies, no review of which programmes have been successful and which haven’t, or what work is still needed.

One high-ranking UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity because her views do not reflect that of the organisation’s, said: “We cannot keep injecting this money. Some of the relief has to come from the government. Maybe they have the means, but are they willing? If the crisis had just started, maybe it would be understandable, but it’s been 20 years. They need to think about how things will work.”

But if the displaced have become dependent on international aid organisations for sustenance, those groups are equally dependent on the people they support.

“Without the picture of the starving child or the near famine or potential famine to grab headlines, aid organisations have a fundraising issue,” Pham said. “In the long history of international aid agencies, there are very few that seek to put themselves out of business.”

Eunice Smith, head of Logistics for the World Food Programme in Goma, said the WFP and other aid organisations will remain in the DRC as long as they are needed. Smith refused to speculate on how long that might be. “The IDPs now expect to receive aid. It’s why we’re here,” she said. “As long as there is insecurity, there is business for us.”

The World Food Programme expects to make another delivery to Goma-area camps in May. The organisation said it needs to raise $40m by October 2014 to continue its food-relief operations in the DRC.

The pope will visit the Holy Land from May 24-26 and before returning to Rome is set to hold a mass in the site known as the Upper Room or Cenacle, on Mount Zion near the walls of the Old City.

Jews revere the site as the tomb of King David, which is on the ground floor of the same building. The site is also important for Muslims.

""As soon as they touch the 'status quo' of this place, bad things will happen,"" said rabbi Avraham Goldstein, accusing the Israeli government of wanting to hand the Upper Room over to the Vatican.

Sovereignty over the Cenacle, which was renovated by Franciscans in the 14th century before the group was forced out, is a highly sensitive issue.

It is currently part of negotiations between Israel and the Vatican which hopes to recover the site.

Tradition says it is where Jesus had his last supper with the disciples, before his arrest and crucifixion.

It is also where the Gospels say the Holy Spirit descended at Pentecost, 50 days after Easter.

Israeli President Shimon Peres told an Italian newspaper during a visit to the Vatican last April that a compromise had been reached on the Cenacle, and that ""99 percent"" of the issues concerning the site had been addressed.

However, no official agreement has been announced.

""When 'the crusaders' come here making the sign of the cross and all kinds of rituals, this place will become idolatrous for us, and we will not have the right to pray there any more,"" ultra-Orthodox Jewish protester Yitzhak Batzon told AFP.

Ultra-Orthodox protesters are planning another demonstration there on May 22 -- just three days before the pope is due to arrive in Jerusalem.

Pope Francis's short visit to the Holy Land has already faced obstacles, including a rise in so-called ""price tag"" hate crimes by Jewish extremists targeting Muslims and Christians.

88,88,FL-2014-000062-CHN,The truth inside the Google bus lawsuit: gentrification hurts the environment - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/google-bus-lawsuit-gentrification-environment,"A new lawsuit brought by San Francisco activists against the city places blame squarely on Silicon Valley's now infamous private tech-employee shuttle buses, claiming that they not only spew air pollution across the city and endanger cyclists and pedestrians, but also that they directly displace residents from their homes. But this lawsuit – and the city's bypassing of a review process, and the buses themselves – isn't really about the environment. It's about class, and it could foretell big changes for how California's cities grow in the future.

Activists filed suit against San Francisco and its transit agency for violation of the 1970 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), claiming that an environmental review of the tech shuttles' impact on the city is necessary. (The city had skipped an environmental review of the bus program in its haste to resolve a painful political issue.) A CEQA lawsuit is a powerful procedural weapon in activists' fight against more than just the buses. They are also appealing the city's decision on the basis of residential displacement, as research has shown a strong correlation between the tech bus routes and rising housing costs.

But if that sounds like an unusual take on environmental impact, it is – and it's brand-new.



Last fall, CEQA was updated in an effort to promote more dense, so-called ""smart growth"" in California's cities. The old law prohibited the environmental judgment of a project based on socio-economic factors, and only considered ""displacement"" in any case in which houses would be knocked down and new ones would have to be built. But the new law calls for the state to write a set of review standards by which to judge developments that might destabilize neighborhoods and push out poor and middle-class residents.

This is the first high-profile lawsuit to appeal on the basis of displacement – and those state standards are still on the drawing board and there's no case law to go on.

Gentrification does have environmental ripple effects. Dense city living is better for the environment, but given private conveniences, it's becoming the exclusive realm of the rich. So, when San Francisco workers are forced to move out to cheap suburbs without mass transit, they become reluctant urban drivers – by some standards, more eco-evil than Google. The burden and the blame for urban pollution then often falls on the poor, who can't afford the well-funded environmental measures of Google and Genentech.

But environmental stability in an age of climate change doesn't just mean running buses instead of driving alone. Building and maintaining a resilient social infrastructure is arguably just as vital to surviving future crises as building flood-proof parks. It's often neighborhood relationships ""that might make the difference between life and death"" in disasters, sociologist Eric Klinenberg told NPR.



Located on a volatile fault line and surrounded on three sides by rising sea levels, San Francisco is always planning for crisis. But as high rents and private transit tear up neighborhoods, city disaster networks will have to fill in for those broken relationships.



It's clear that the buses absolutely play a role in reshaping San Francisco's neighborhoods. One study found that, without shuttle access, nearly two-thirds of city-dwelling respondents said they would drive instead – and about 40% would move closer to work for convenience. Tech companies and San Francisco transit officials have argued that the buses are needed to take those hypothetical thousands of cars off the road each day. Google in particular promotes its eco-friendly company ethos and clean-running shuttles.

The old CEQA measures impact on roads by looking at traffic congestion, so projects that slow cars down – like bike lanes – often show a ""negative"" environmental impact. The new CEQA standards measure projects based on vehicle miles traveled. Depending on the details of model used to determine the impact, tech shuttles could be deemed positive under either standard, even if it means more diesel exhaust for San Francisco neighborhoods.

And either way, the law is often used more for political means than environmental ones.



San Francisco tries to scuttle environmental reports all the time, and activists constantly sue them for it, so, in a certain sense, this is business as usual. But if this group can make their case against the company shuttles, they might not just force a city drunk on the promise of technology to take stock of its values – they might impact development across the entire Golden State.","Fri, 09 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399589307017/1d197242-e299-454d-973b-3cdb3880cb44-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=601be794cb9045ef474e3d7566507596,"['hurts', 'lawsuit', 'city', 'google', 'tech', 'cagle', 'standards', 'susie', 'transit', 'gentrification', 'buses', 'francisco', 'impact', 'bus', 'environment', 'inside', 'ceqa', 'environmental', 'san', 'truth']",

90,90,FL-2014-000062-CHN,Clawing for survival: POWs of America's Civil War - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/04/us/civil-war-150th-anniversary-prisons/index.html,"Millen, Georgia (CNN) -- John Charles Tarsney crossed the prisoner of war camp and spied an emaciated Union soldier to whom he had given a drink of water the evening before.

""He had died during the night and was little more than a dead skeleton,"" Tarsney later recalled.

Tarsney, despairing of his own plight as a prisoner at Camp Lawton in Georgia, hatched a scheme.

He decided to trade identities with the lifeless man who was part of a group of ailing soldiers set to be exchanged for Confederate prisoners held up north.

Tarsney pinned his own name and regiment on the dead man's clothing and gave his silver watch to a sergeant to keep him quiet. He affected a limp and, after ""near being caught,"" managed to walk out of the prison as John Frantz of the 54th Pennsylvania Infantry.

Tarsney boarded the train and soon gained his freedom -- later serving four terms as a congressman from Missouri. He recalled his experience more than 25 years later in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Some may question Tarsney's actions, but such desperate schemes were common among the more than 410,000 men held captive during the American Civil War. Prisoners were subject to hunger, overcrowding, violence and disease -- conditions which claimed 56,000 lives from 1861 to 1865.

""I think (Tarsney) is honestly and bluntly recounting a moment when he faced an impossible choice for survival,"" says Eric Leonard, chief of interpretation and education at Andersonville National Historic Site, located on the grounds of the notorious Andersonville prison. Camp Lawton was built to help ease overcrowding and other problems at Andersonville.

Thousands of Civil War POWs clawed for life. When not dreaming of home and freedom, they were obsessed with food, sometimes consuming rats or boiling grass to ward off scurvy.

At several prisons, soldiers were humiliated by civilians who paid to gawk and deride them. Some gave up hope of being freed or exchanged. Others blamed their own government for their predicaments, believing officials cared little about rescuing them.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the peak year of suffering in Civil War prisons. At Andersonville alone, nearly 13,000 men died over 14 months -- an average of more than 30 a day in that span. Overall, 30,000 Union and 26,000 Confederate soldiers died in captivity.

Remembrances over the next 16 months at Andersonville -- the only National Park System area to serve as a memorial to all POWs -- present a milepost to review the plight of POWs throughout American history. The park in Georgia is home to the National Prisoner of War Museum.

At the same time, archaeological digs and research at Camp Lawton, Camp Douglas in Chicago, Johnson's Island in Ohio and Camp Asylum in Columbia, South Carolina, are opportunities to bring fresh insight into the story of Civil War prison life.

The work at Lawton, which operated in 1864, fascinates historians.

With the exception of plowing by farmers 100 years ago and construction by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the 42-acre prison site about 80 miles northwest of Savannah was largely untouched until about four years ago.

""The preservation is so ideal,"" says Lance Greene, an assistant professor overseeing Georgia Southern University anthropology students doing excavations.

The area where prisoners lived is rich with artifacts.

Rick Kanaski, a regional archaeologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, says, ""When you are looking at Lawton, we have an opportunity to delve into the daily details, daily life, from both the prisoner and Confederate guards' perspectives.""

It's not difficult to imagine why Tarsney, severely wounded and captured at Gettysburg, so desperately maneuvered for his freedom.

He had endured the horrors of Andersonville before he was shipped to Lawton, where deadly cold and rain in the late autumn of 1864 picked off hundreds who had managed to survive the suffocating heat and squalor at Andersonville. His time at Lawton came during the waning months of the Confederacy.

Issued few items by their Lawton captors, soldiers used anything they could get their hands on: broken spoons to dig holes, railroad spikes for the construction of shelter and even an Argentine coin used because of the dearth of U.S. money.

""This site is part of this ongoing debate of prisoner treatment,"" says Greene, referring to Abu Ghraib, the site of a prisoner abuse scandal that took place during the Iraq war.

Since the end of the Civil War and the subsequent trial and execution of Andersonville's commandant, historians have argued over whether appalling conditions at Civil War prisons -- in the North and South -- were the result of insufficient resources and mismanagement or included something more intentional: retaliation and deliberate cruelty.

Deaths at Andersonville, by far the most populous Civil War prison, represented a staggering 29% of the prison population. But the death rate was only slightly lower at the North's prison in Elmira, New York, with a 24% death rate and 3,000 deaths, many due to illness.

The debate over what caused the misery continues today. One fact is inescapable: ""We did this to ourselves,"" says Andersonville's Leonard.

The road to massive overcrowding

Motorists can drive around the grassy Andersonville site in middle Georgia in a few minutes. Long gone are the gaunt and dirty faces and the bare earth covered with makeshift tents and shelters.

A walk through the site, says Glenn Robins, a history professor at Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus, is a primer on the travails of Civil War prisoners and the challenges facing their keepers.

""We try to get a sense of how you can get 33,000 people in that prison. We'll talk about the rations and the insufficiency.""

Officials at the prison added 10 acres to the original 16.5-acre site, but the flood of POWs continued. Andersonville housed a total of 45,000 POWs over its lifespan.

Andersonville's Stockade Creek shows just how little water there was for soldiers to drink, bathe and use as a latrine. Nearly 5 acres of the fetid ground was saturated with effluent and human waste, increasing incidents of disease, including dysentery.

""You are sort of at a point where it is hopeless,"" says Robins. ""You start wondering why more people did not die there. You talk about those who survived and how they did. Is it their mindset and value system, whether based in religious faith or trying to help a person who is sharing a hole in the ground with them? Or a belief in country?""

Historians caution against comparing Andersonville, also known as Camp Sumter, to other prisons.

""You cannot convey the horror of Andersonville through the written word,"" says Paul Springer, an author who has written about treatment of POWs from the Revolutionary War forward. ""Until you can bottle the stench ... you cannot tell the story.""

When the Civil War began, there was virtually no such thing as a military prison system or a code of treatment for captives. Neither army expected the conflict to last as long as it did.

""The prison system of the South was less worthy of the name than that of the North,"" wrote William Hesseltine in ""Civil War Prisons.""

In the North, ""the prisons came into being as a result of definite plans and were administered by officers experienced in military administration. In the South, on the other hand, the prison system was the result of a series of accidents. ... Prisons came into existence, without definite plans, to meet the exigencies of the moment.""

POWs were often exchanged during the first two years, but that system largely broke down. There were disputes about the status of black soldiers captured by the South and the treatment of white officers who led them. As the prisons filled, Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant declined in 1864 to resume negotiations on the exchange, realizing that he had numbers on his side.

POWs constantly hoped they would be freed from the oft-hellish conditions, only to have their hopes dashed. Cpl. Charles H. Knox, held at Camp Lawton, was concerned about his wife and small child back home in upstate New York. He wrote a November 14, 1864, letter to them that reads in part:

""Now hopeing the scene may soon change, for we all look for an exchange of most if not all of the Prisinors that are here -- God knows I hope so.. for I am tired of Cecesia (secession) I have been a Prisnor 6 months & 9 days & I think that will do for this time.""

Knox wasn't paroled for another three and a half months, near the war's end.

'It would have been just survival'

Ilene Shuman, a junior at Georgia Southern University, stands near a partially excavated spot where a prison shelter, or ""shebang"" once stood along Main Street at Camp Lawton. During the prison's operation, the busy avenue featured a barbershop and a merchant who sold goods to the few POWs who had money.

Below her, Greene, her professor, uses a trowel near a pile of bricks believed to have been pilfered by prisoners from one of several ovens used to prepare food. There's also evidence of a fire built by prisoners to ward off the persistent cold.

""You get a sense of how people put their society together,"" says Shuman. ""It would have been just survival, day to day. They were probably huddled together for warmth.""

Open for only six weeks, Lawton was largely ""lost"" to history after it was hurriedly evacuated as federal forces approached Savannah, the prize of Maj. Gen. William Sherman's famous March to the Sea. About 10,000 men were held at Lawton during its brief existence. At least 750 died, and some estimates put the number at more than 1,000.

Would-be liberators were outraged to find unburied bodies in the camp. They set fire to large portions of the square 15-foot-high stockade wall. Nature and time later brought down the rest of the timbers.

The site straddles a federal fish hatchery and Magnolia Springs State Park, a few miles north of the small town of Millen. Prisoners congregated on what is now the hatchery area. In 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service erected a tall fence to ward off relic collectors.

Not far from Shuman, other students expose bricks that may be from one of the large ovens put in by Confederate troops. A third crew works along a section of the now-gone stockade wall.

Greene says crews have found the locations of three sides of the stockade and one corner. They also have excavated part of a Confederate officers' barracks. They want to find quarters for enlisted guards, which may make some comparisons to the prisoners' existence possible.

While Confederate commanders may have had ceramic plates and kitchenware, there are no such resources for prisoners, says Greene.

""They have very limited material. They are very savvy in reusing and modifying anything they can get their hands on.""

The South tried to ease overcrowding and lessen sanitary problems at the prison, but it's not surprising that Confederate officers and guards would get better provisions, says Kanaski, the federal archaeologist.

He hopes that Confederate and other documentary records -- which have been tough to find -- will supplement the archaeological efforts. The August 26 episode of PBS' ""Time Team America"" will detail the mapping of the stockade and the search for items covered by sand and clay.

""You can get wowed by an individual artifact, but it may not make a lot of sense until more analysis (is done),"" says Kanaski.

Consumed with thoughts of food

Greene and his students are looking for food remnants to gain insight into the diets of captives, guards and the estimated 500 slaves who built Camp Lawton.

Even today, while a prisoner may dream of home and freedom, waking hours are consumed with thoughts of food.

""I spent 6, 8, 10 hours a day thinking about what meal I was going to cook when I got home,"" says Michael Berryman, who was captured by Iraqi troops during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

A traveling Andersonville exhibit, entitled ""Victory From Within: The American Prisoner of War Experience,"" includes comments from Berryman and others about prison life.

John K. Derden, in his book, ""The World's Largest Prison: The Story of Camp Lawton,"" quotes a Union prisoner as saying he and his ravenous comrades ate the heads of butchered cattle and boiled bones for any form of nutrition. They also ate grease that would rise to the surface.

Adelbert Knight of Belfast, Maine, each day noted the food he received at Andersonville, Lawton and other prisons in the South. Cornbread and bacon, beef and molasses were common fare.

Sometimes, he documented other notable occurrences:

""June 22: wether fine all day. the first fair day here this month. Rat. one pint of mush & Bacon 2 oz. one man died of our mess this evening with a Soar throat.""

On July 11, 1864, Knight noted the execution of six Union soldiers who had terrorized, robbed and killed fellow inmates at Andersonville.

His great-grandson, Larry Knight, of Hudson, New Hampshire, says he marvels at his ancestor's resilience, especially through illness that included scurvy and diarrhea.

""He had a very strong will to live,"" says Knight.

Adelbert later farmed and did carpentry work before dying in 1913 at age 72.

Sgt. David Kennedy, an Ohio cavalryman held at Andersonville, provided a powerful image of the horrors of the camp and its collection of shattered humanity: ""It takes 7 of its ocupiants to make a Shadow.""

John Brunsan, a POW at Elmira, wrote to his sister: ""For breakfast I get one-third of a pound of bread and a small piece of meat; for supper the same quantity of bread and not any meat, but a small plate of warm water called soup.""

An estimated two-thirds of soldier deaths during the Civil War were the result of disease, in part because of limited medical knowledge in the mid-19th century. Antibiotics did not yet exist.

More artifacts uncovered at Camp Lawton

Dora Costa, a UCLA economics professor, studied the life histories of 41,000 white and black Union soldiers. She found that men who entered prison camps with friends and comrades were more likely to survive, especially those with similar ethnicity.

""What we find is, basically, it did help to have men who were like you in there. From the same company or men to whom you are closely tied,"" says Costa.

Being tall was a negative for a captured soldier because it meant you needed more than the customary ration.

""Those with (certain) skills might be put to work,"" thereby receiving more rations, says Costa, co-author of ""Heroes and Cowards: The Social Face of War.""

Those skills might include bookkeeping, accounting and carpentry, she says.

Retaliation against the other side

If war is hell, a phrase credited to Gen. Sherman, then war also means demonizing the enemy and expressing outrage over the other side's treatment of POWs.

William Hesseltine made the case for ""war psychosis"" in his seminal book on Civil War prisons. Overcrowding and ""poverty"" in the South were responsible for the suffering of Union soldiers, he wrote.

Reports of soldiers suffering at Lawton, Andersonville and other Southern prisons ""created the belief the prisoners were ill-treated through a deliberate purpose; the inevitable hatred engendered by the war made such a belief readily credible. The result of this psychosis was that prisoners in the Northern prisons were forced to suffer in retaliation for the alleged Southern cruelty.""

The Confederacy believed ""as firmly as did the citizens of the United States that their soldiers in prison were the victims of barbarous treatment,"" Hesseltine argued.

Michael P. Gray, associate professor of history at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, says Confederates held at Elmira in New York believed a surgeon was deliberately killing some of their comrades. It may have been more neglect than murder, Gray says.

Hunger and malnutrition were prevalent, too, in the North, where some historians say there was retribution for treatment -- real or perceived -- of Yankees held in Southern prisons.

President Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton cut rations for Northern prisons, says Gray, author of ""The Business of Captivity: Elmira and Its Civil War Prison.""

Gray and others contend that the extreme thriftiness of William Hoffman, commissary general of Union prisons, contributed to inadequate conditions.

Despite their ordeal, there were ways for prisoners to ward off persistent victimization and boost morale.

POWs at Elmira, desperate for extra rations and supplies, made rings, jewelry and other items that were sold by others outside the prison walls, says Gray.

Camp Lawton's POWs held a mock presidential election in November 1864, choosing Lincoln over George B. McClellan, a former Union general.

At Andersonville, prisoner Dorence Atwater kept a copy of the voluminous death registry, ensuring that nearly all of the 13,000 dead would receive headstones. He kept the list a secret from Confederate surgeons with whom he worked as a parolee.

On July 4, 1864, a group of prisoners briefly displayed the U.S. flag.

""The crowd goes wild,"" says Andersonville's Leonard. ""Then it disappears because they do not want it taken away from them.""

Complexity of assigning blame

Springer, the author, is also an associate professor of comparative military studies at the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He points out that today, as during the Civil War, the military necessarily puts its best soldiers at the front.

Those who staffed Civil War camps often were invalids, home guards or unfit for other service.

""Because they are not veterans, they don't have that empathy for the guy on the other side of the line,"" says Springer, author of ""America's Captives: Treatment of POWs from the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror.""

The U.S. military generally has treated POWS more humanely than has its enemies, Springer says.

More recently, the U.S. Army has ""outsourced"" the care of some POWs, Springer says. South Korea provided guards during the Korean War; the Saudis did the same in the first Gulf War.

That particular arrangement did not occur in the Iraq war, when Army reservists infamously abused prisoners at the Abu Ghraib facility. Springer terms them a ""handful of bad apples.""

Prison site brings together descendants of guard, captor

Springer references the prosecution of Andersonville's commandant, Maj. Henry Wirz, as an example of the complexity of assigning blame.

Wirz was convicted of murder and conspiracy charges and executed. Some POWs testified he personally shot some of their comrades, although the veracity of some testimony is debated today.

The officer was a ""scapegoat in a lot of ways,"" says Springer, because he was incapable of stopping the massive flow of prisoners from Virginia and elsewhere. The professor suggests Wirz probably was more guilty of barbarous indifference than conspiracy.

""Places like Andersonville remind us that humans have a remarkable capacity for cruelty, indifference and immunity to the suffering of others.""

Having your buddy's back

Andersonville National Historic Site is sponsoring several sesquicentennial events, including living history weekends in October and in March 2015, followed by a memorial candle illumination on September 18-19, 2015, coinciding with National POW/MIA Recognition Day.

A funeral to remember the nearly 13,000 Union soldiers who died there will be held that same weekend at the national cemetery.

""This service will be the funeral they never received,"" the site says.

Historians point out that mortality rates at most prisons were much lower than at Elmira and Andersonville. And there were attempts to improve conditions.

Some 150 years ago, civilians and generals grappled with a crisis over the care of POWs, Leonard says.

""I view military prisons as the overlooked campaign of 1864; prisons, their management and questions of exchange are taking up a massive part of the bureaucratic part of the war.""

In the end, most Civil War POWs survived. Their stories are of resilience and loyalty to comrades who endured a crushing loss of freedom.

There has been a transformation of the public's perception of POWs, says Leonard. Whereas those captured during the Civil War were sometimes seen as less than honorable, Americans held during the Vietnam War and the Iran hostage crisis became symbols of resolve and strength.

On Memorial Day in 1994, former vice presidential candidate and Vice Adm. James Stockdale spoke at Andersonville about his POW experience during the Vietnam War and pressures his generation faced -- including enemy attempts at using prisoners as propaganda tools.

Regardless of their sacrifice and suffering, American POWs share common virtues, Stockdale said at the time.

""Being loyal to our fellow American prison mate, making sacrifices in his behalf if he is down; if tempted, being strong to resist; if missing the mark, having the courage to try again; and so living that you can stand unashamed and unafraid before your prison mates, your loved ones, and the Almighty.""

These findings could tell us something new about the origins of consciousness, the researchers say. And someday, perhaps, you'll be able to buy a kit that allows you to stimulate lucid dreaming at home.

""We are coming very close to identifying the determinants of higher-order consciousness,"" says lead study author Ursula Voss, a sleep and dreaming researcher at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt in Germany. ""This is what makes us human. We are the only known species with reflective insight, reflecting on our past, planning our future, and thinking about this instance that we call self.""

Dream a Lucid Dream for Me

During dreams in the rapid-eye movement (REM) phase of sleep, dreamers experience a flood of uncontrolled memories of the past or thoughts about the future. During lucid dreaming, sleepers become aware of the fact they are dreaming, regaining mental functions such as free will that may enable dreamers to gain control over their dreams.

In one example of a lucid dream following electric stimulation, a volunteer noted, ""I was dreaming about lemon cake. It looked translucent, but then again, it didn't. It was a bit like in an animated movie, like the Simpsons. And then I started falling and the scenery changed and I was talking to Matthias Schweighöfer (a German actor) and two foreign exchange students. And I was wondering about the actor and they told me, 'Yes, you met him before,' so then I realized, 'Oops, you are dreaming.' I mean, while I was dreaming! So strange!""

Gamma Waves

Brain waves are rhythmic activity of brain cells; they come in a number of frequency bands named after Greek letters. Prior studies have revealed that lucid dreams are accompanied by gamma waves, with frequencies ranging from about 20 to 80 cycles per second, in the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. Gamma activity in the frontal and temporal regions is related to the higher-order consciousness seen in people who are awake.

To illuminate the role gamma activity might play during sleep, Voss and her colleagues experimented across with 27 sleepers who had no experience with lucid dreaming. At least two minutes after sleepers entered REM sleep, the researchers applied weak electric currents to the volunteers' skulls using a technique known as transcranial alternating current stimulation, which is known to alter perception and mental performance in waking adults. The scientists tried electric currents at seven different frequencies, with volunteers spending up to four nights in the lab. Lucid dreams were most pronounced during stimulation with electric currents at frequencies of 25 and 40 cycles per second, in the lower portion of the gamma band.

These findings suggest gamma activity ""opened the window for lucid dreaming to be realized,"" Voss said. And the experiment created a feedback loop of sorts: lucid dreaming further increased the activity in gamma waves.

Negating Nightmares?

""I find it intriguing that only 30 seconds of stimulation sufficed to induce a functional effect,"" says neuroscientist Lisa Marshall of the University of Lübeck in Germany, who did not take part in this research. However, Marshall did note electric stimulation in the gamma band did not trigger lucid dreaming in all volunteers. It worked about 58 and 77 percent of the time with electric current frequencies of 25 and 40 cycles per second, respectively.

This research might one day help people with post-traumatic stress disorder control painful recurring nightmares, as well as help restore healthy brain activity in patients with schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorder. These findings may even have commercial applications—though Voss cautions people against zapping their brains by themselves without medical supervision.

""Electrical stimulation of the brain should always be monitored by a professional,"" Voss stressed. ""Don't start stimulating your brain with electrical current at home!""

She didn't stay long. The shopkeeper demanded a $13 bribe to put her name on the list.

It would take her five days to earn that, laboring in the nearby bean fields.

""They won't give me anything if I don't pay,"" said Zein, a 36-year-old widow with six children, leaving the shop empty-handed.

As a host of aid agencies struggle to provide help to the flood of Syrian refugees into Lebanon — so far numbering more than a million and counting — middlemen have worked their way into the cracks of the distribution system, demanding bribes and adding another layer of suffering for those fleeing the war.

The most affected appear to be the poorest of the refugees — the around 160,000 who are unable to afford housing in Lebanon and end up in unofficial, ramshackle tent camps. In a series of interviews with The Associated Press, refugees in one such camp near the eastern town of Kab Elias said they often must pay anywhere from $3 to $100 in bribes to shopkeepers, local strongmen or municipal officials for a variety of tasks, particularly to get some consignments of aid or speed their registration.

""They are hungry dogs at the door,"" said Sabha, a friend of Zein who also went with her to the grocery to seek blankets. ""I don't have money to pay for bribes. Where am I going to get it from?"" The two women, like others in the camp, spoke on condition they be identified only by their first names, fearing for their security.

The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, oversees the bulk of aid distribution in Lebanon, working with 60 partner organizations. Most refugees who register with the UNHCR receive an ATM-like card which they can directly purchase $30 worth of food each month — eliminating any bribe-seeking middleman.

But the $30 runs out quickly, forcing those in the camps to turn to other charities. The smaller groups, in particular, often lack manpower to distribute aid themselves and so turn to local middlemen to register refugees to receive their shipments of food, medicine, blankets and other supplies — opening the door for abuses.

""It's a common issue across all operations and we are well aware of it,"" said Ninette Kelley, UNHCR's representative in Lebanon. ""There will always be people who try exploit refugees ... It's really so sad, because refugees are the most vulnerable in a community.""

She said it was unlikely to be widespread because of extensive checks. The UNHCR also conducts outreach to refugees, informing them its services are free and that they can report incidents of corruption.

But oversight is difficult amid the chaos of one of the world's worst refugee crisis. Syria's civil war has driven more than 2.6 million people into neighboring nations.

The governments of Turkey and Jordan have set up large, organized camps to take in many of the refugees. Lebanon, in contrast, has not allowed official camps, leaving almost no supervision over the dozens of small, informal encampments that have cropped up, particularly in the agricultural fields of the eastern Bekaa Valley.

Each camp is typically controlled by a strongman, known colloquially as the ""shawish"" — usually a refugee who has built up connections with local Lebanese officials or has prominent family connections among the refugees. The shawish often oversees the building of tents, sometimes demanding rent, and provides services for the refugees like securing lines of credit with local shopkeepers, finding them work or dealing with Lebanese officials — all for a fee.

For example, Zein and Sabha, a 32-year-old mother of five, each earn $4 a day each picking beans, but they have to give $1.65 a day to their camp's shawish, who got them the job.

One recent day after work — their hands still stained with dirt — the two went to the grocery near their camp after hearing they could register there for blankets from the charity Caritas.

Inside the store, the shopkeeper stood before a large ledger.

""Is there aid coming?"" asked Zein. ""How much is it?""

Five thousand lira up front, then another 15,000 lira after receiving the aid, he said — altogether, about $13.30. The two women walked out.

Asked about the incident, Caritas spokeswoman Joelle El Dib said the organization's policy is not to use middlemen and that the group was not aware of demands of bribes for its aid. She said the group would investigate the incident.

Seven aid workers with various organizations said relief groups are sometimes forced to use local shopkeepers or the shawish to register refugees. ""The shawish is usually known as being corrupt. They can block access, and (charities) aren't allowed to see the people, unless it's with his permission,"" said one aid worker.

""It's almost impossible to check on whether aid is being properly delivered for a village. Now imagine for a million people,"" another aid worker said.

The aid workers spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the problems.

The shawish in Sabha and Zein's camp acknowledged that he takes money and argued that it was justified because he helps fellow refugees. His tent showed the benefits. It had electricity for a fan, while others go without power. There was a stack of extra blankets and a double bed — a contrast to the thin mattresses on the ground that most camp residents sleep on.

The camp is a collection of about a dozen tents thrown together from pieces of burlap and plastic and wood planks amid the bean fields, home to about 20 families. Sabha and Zein sat with other women in one tent, smoking cheap cigarettes as they spoke about the bribes.

""They control us,"" Zein said of the shawishes and other middlemen.

One woman, Umm Ahmed, told how a driver for one charity demanded $7 to take refugees' names to receive boxes of food and soap distributed by a nearby mosque.

Umm Nader, a mother of seven, said the shawish told her to pay a $30 bribe to speed up registration with the UNHCR, a service that is supposed to be free.

""The land, we pay for. The tent, we pay for. We pay for everything,"" said another woman, Umm Hamid, mother of 10.

News of the threatened censure of the Rev Michael Amaladoss, whose best-known book is “The Asian Jesus,” follows on the heels of a blunt warning on orthodoxy and obedience that the Vatican’s doctrinal watchdog, Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, delivered to a group of nuns who represent most American sisters.

Mueller’s April 30 speech to sisters from the Leadership Conference of Women Religious was seen as an unexpected setback in negotiations over a Vatican investigation of the nuns that began a year before Francis was elected. Mueller’s hard line also seemed out of step with the new style of openness and flexibility that has marked Francis’ young papacy.

Church sources say that Amaladoss, a highly regarded expert on interreligious dialogue and Christology, first came under scrutiny by Mueller’s office a year ago. They said Amaladoss believed that his initial responses to questions about his views on the uniqueness of Jesus and the Catholic Church had answered Vatican objections.

But in January, Mueller’s office returned with a demand that Amaladoss write an article publicly endorsing the Vatican’s views or face silencing. For decades, that level of severe sanction was a hallmark of the hard-line treatment of theologians under Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI.

In early April, Amaladoss met with Mueller and other officials from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and he “agreed to rework … those issues in the light of the dialogue,” the Rev Edward Mudavassery, who oversees the Jesuits in India, wrote in an email.

“I understand it was an open and honest meeting trying to clarify objectionable issues,” Mudavassery said. “We all know that Pope Francis is a man for dialogue. It seems to me that the CDF, too, may follow this path to sort out differences because these men under the scanner are genuine and loyal to the Church and to the teachings of Jesus.”

Francis reportedly knows about the investigation but does not seem overly concerned that it will end in punishing Amaladoss, according to Jesuits familiar with the case.

As a child, Courtney Georgie dreamed of joining the Texas State Strutters.

And on May 3 —just one day after her 18th birthday — her dream came true.

After seeing them at events and competitions, Courtney quickly acquired a deep admiration for the team.

“This organization is unique in that it was the first precision dance team formed at a four-year university and is currently the largest in the nation,” says Courtney, who celebrated her 18th birthday on May 2.

For 54 years, the Strutters have served as ambassadors for Texas State University on state, national and international levels with performances in 26 countries spanning four continents.

“One of the most impressive honors was their selection as the first U.S. dance team to perform in the People’s Republic of China,” Courtney says.

Other highlights include two presidential inaugural parades, numerous NFL and NBA halftime performances, the nationally televised Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, MTV’s “Total Request Live”, a national television commercial for Coca-Cola, appearances in five movies, and “America’s Got Talent.”

Courtney’s ambition has led her to attend Texas State in the fall, where she will be studying psychology and dance, the latter of which she says she has a strong passion for.

Courtney started dancing at the age of 3 at Hermann Sons Dance Hall. She then studied dance with Carolyn Morrow at The School of Dance until their closing. She later studied with the late Virgie Lee Dechman and Jimi Lee Riverkamp at Dance Dance Dance, where she was taught not only to dance but to be a true dancer.

From there, Courtney studied ballet, tap, jazz and hip hop. With the encouragement of Virgie Lee, she decided to study Pointe. Going into high school, she made the Flames dance team. Unfortunately, she had to give up Dance Dance Dance because of Flames practices.

Courtney was taught her first two years by Tracey White Griffin and Loretta Camarillo. During her second year she made officer as major on the dance team — a title she kept for two years -and in her senior year she was appointed colonel of the Flames.

“I had made the Flames team my freshman year in high school and was taught by Tracey and Loretta,” she says. “The difference between the dance styles were very different, from feet to hands! But I was always taught by my mom and Jimi Lee that if my heart was in it I could do anything. I brought a lot learned and learned a lot more.”

During Courtney’s junior year on the team, Arthur Martinez had joined their squad as coach. He was nothing like her past dance instructors. He pressed for precision, he encouraged her to just go for it.

“I made Major my sophomore year and held that position until my senior year when I made Colonel,” she says. “Coach Arthur arrived the summer before my junior year. He pushed to the limit at times but after tears and sweat, I realized that he was another huge addition in my future of dance. He has taught me to not sit on all I know but push for more. He has molded me into a stronger, unbarred dancer.”

Unfortunately, Courtney wasn’t able to dance half the football season due to a broken foot but she was treated no differently. She says the flames team helped her through it all.

“The Sparks — which are the flames helpers with bags, escorting — would carry me literally at times off and on the field and to and from the bus,” she says. “Even though I expressed that I can do it, they said no, you need to be back out there, pointing to the field. I am desperately going to miss my dance family.”

Courtney tried out for the Strutters the day after her 18th birthday.

“Much to my surprise, I made the team,” she says. “I never thought that as a little girl watching them I eventually become one of them.”

“Courtney has learned from the best,” says Courtney’s mother Nancy. “She values their instruction, criticism and wisdom. She will carry this with her wherever dance may take her.”

Courtney expresses a profound love and respect for those who have stood behind her and taught her to be the person and dancer she is today.

“My parents for the encouragement, Carolyn Morrow for broadening my horizons, Jimi Lee and the late Virgie Lee for believing in me and loving me as their own and making me feel like a true ballerina,” she says. “I also want to thank Tracey and Loretta for having patience with my ballet hands and feet and giving me a new style of choreography.
