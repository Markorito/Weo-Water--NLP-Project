0,0,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil's pandemic-weary Manaus flooded by rising Amazon rivers - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-pandemic-weary-manaus-flooded-by-rising-amazon-rivers-2021-05-17/,"Heavy rains in the Amazon rainforest have caused rivers to rise to near record levels, flooding small Brazilian towns and threatening the state capital Manaus with another disaster after it was severely struck by the coronavirus pandemic.

Across the state of Amazonas, more than 400,000 people have been affected by flooding, said the state's Civil Defense service, many of whom were evacuated as water levels climbed.

The Rio Negro river was rising by about 3 centimeters (1 inch) a day and on Monday streets in the center of Manaus were already under water, according to city hall.

""The water level is... the third highest in the history of the city. If it continues like this, it will pass the record 2012 flood,"" said mayoral spokesman Emerson Quaresma.

While rainfall varies from year to year, climate change has brought particularly heavy rainy years and also very dry years that hurt farming, said Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus. Amazon deforestation may also contribute to long-term changes but does not impact rainfall year to year, he said.

Access to the Manaus market on the edge of the Rio Negro is underwater and the city has built raised wooden walkways for pedestrians.

Up the Amazon River, small riverside towns such as Anamã, population 12,700, have been totally flooded, forcing residents to raise the floor levels of their wooden houses or evacuate.

In Manaus, the homes of 4,700 families are in danger. Mayor David Almeida has offered them stipends to rent other dwellings if they are forced to evacuate.

Late last year, Manaus became an epicenter of the pandemic, making headlines as the city's hospital system ran out of oxygen for patients.

The city and surrounding region registered the first cases of a highly contagious variant of coronavirus, called P.1, that has spread rapidly throughout Brazil and to at least 10 other countries.

Some teenagers and young adults who received Covid vaccines experienced heart inflammation, a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group said, recommending further study of the rare condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices in a statement dated May 17 said it had looked into reports that a few young vaccine recipients - predominantly male, adolescents and young adults - developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition often goes away without complications and can be caused by a variety of viruses, the CDC group said. CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but members of the committee on vaccinations felt that healthcare providers should be made aware of the reports of the ""potential adverse event"", the committee said. It did not say how many people had been affected and recommended further investigation. Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said vaccines are known to cause myocarditis and it would be important to monitor to see if it is causally related to the vaccine. It is important to look at the risk-benefit ratio, he said: ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial outweighing this very low, if conclusively established, risk."" The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving the mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The United States has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Israel's Health Ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer's vaccine, although it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30. Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established. Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The CDC in late April, after news of the Israeli investigation, said it did not see a link between the two. Earlier this month US regulators expanded authorisation of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to children aged 12 to 15.","Tue, 18 May 2021 03:20:37 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/18/60a3306f60b4aa6168ac694b/60a3306f60b4aa6168ac694c_o_U_v2.jpg,"['vaccine', 'captures', 'devastating', 'brazil', 'cdc', 'floods', 'drone', 'pfizer', 'committee', 'cases', 'young', 'vaccines', 'condition', 'inflammation', 'heart']",

Rivers in the Brazilian Amazon region have risen to near record levels after heavy rains, flooding small towns and threatening areas hit hard by Covid-19 with another disaster.

In Amazonas state, 52 of the 62 towns and cities have areas under water, and 25 have declared a state of emergency including the capital, Manaus. About 410,000 people have been affected, according to the civil defence service.

In Manaus, the Negro river is at its third-highest level since records began in 1920, at 29.72m (97ft). Brazil's geological service expects the waters to reach 30.35m, exceeding the record flooding seen in 2012.

Raised wooden walkways for pedestrians have been erected in parts of the city centre, and local officials say they will set up barricades with sand bags to try to contain the waters. The houses of 4,200 people have been flooded across the capital.

The increased precipitation in the region is linked to La Niña, a phenomenon where cooler-than-normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean lead to significant weather changes in different parts of the world.

The town of Anamã, with a population of 12,700, has been totally flooded by the Solimões river. Boats and canoes have become the only way to get around the so-called ""Venice of Amazonas"".

Like most residents, Manoel de Oliveira Cardoso and his wife, Eliana dos Santos Madi, have built wooden structures so they can walk around the flooded rooms of their house.

""Look at the state of my house, half flooded, I've got nowhere to keep my things,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I'm struggling to see if I can salvage at least half of my things.""

As Anamã experiences inundations almost every year, some of the houses have a second level where people move their belongings in case of severe flooding. Others are built on wooden poles to keep them above the river level, known locally as palafitas.

The Solimões and Negro rivers are the main branches of the Amazon river, which has flooded the towns of Parintins and Itacoatiara. In Manacapuru, crops were destroyed.

Meanwhile, cases and deaths related to Covid-19 were rising again in the state amid a slow rollout of vaccines and lack of co-ordinated measures to curb the spread of the virus, according to the Fiocruz Amazonas institute.

By boat, Neuda Sousa, a local health worker, carried a box of Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs to vaccinate residents in flooded areas.

Manaus and nearby areas reported the first cases of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19 that has spread throughout Brazil, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Earlier this year, the city's health system collapsed, with hospitals running out of oxygen amid a steep rise in infections.

There are now fears Amazonas state could face a devastating third wave.

Anama, home to 14,000 people on a tributary of the Solimoes River that flows toward capital Manaus, is just one municipality of dozens in Amazonas state that has seen life upended by unusual rainfall.

Amazonas’s civil defense secretariat on Thursday warned the flood could soon be biggest recorded in the last century, and said 350,000 people have already been affected.

As the river continues rising, the sound of power saws in Anama is constant as residents cut boards and beams to build rudimentary scaffolding within their homes. It’s a race to stay above the water’s surface. Motorcycles are stored atop the wood, too.

“What we’re living isn’t good. The flood is here, in this home,” said Luzia Santiago da Costa, a 62-year-old homemaker. Her knee problems mean she keeps her eyes focused on her steps while balancing atop the wood and moving slowly through her home.

Raimundo Sampaio Sobreira, 63, said his floor is now so high that he’s begun hitting his head on the ceiling.

“We are accustomed here, but this is going beyond the limits,” Sobreira said.

Twenty of Amazonas’ municipalities are in a situation of emergency, and 22 have rivers spilling over their banks, according to the secretariat's statement on Thursday. The latter group includes capital Manaus, where people have built makeshift bridges.

The Negro River, which flows past Manaus to meet the Solimoes River, could reach its highest-ever level within days, the state’s government said this week.

Increased precipitation is associated with the La Nina phenomenon, by which cooler-than-normal sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean impact global weather patterns.

KOLKATA: Cops in Bengal have deleted more than 500 fake posts of “post-poll violence in Bengal” and “Hindu genocide in Bengal” in the last 96 hours but the numbers are just one indicator of the enormity of the problem. The fakes have become much more “international”: among images sought to be passed off as “Bengal violence images” are old photos from Brazil , Venezuela and Bangladesh .On Sunday, the CID tweeted a video link where a verified user — Chaudhary Amit Singh — claimed a man was beaten and assaulted with sticks and stones.The video had originated from Brazil, and is at least three years old, the CID said. Also, a 2018 video from Venezuela has been shared on social media as a political worker being lynched in Bengal in post-poll violence by “TMC goons”. Kolkata Police has flagged a Bangladeshi video that was being passed off as an attack on a polling agent in Bengal. After this, half a dozen videos have surfaced with morphed images from incidents which took place in Bangladesh, sources said.Since May 5, when police units across the state began monitoring fake news, the number of fake videos under surveillance is stated to be in the hundreds.The CID has contacted social media companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and have taken down close to 300 posts and accounts. The Kolkata Police claimed on Sunday that it had flagged and removed 200 others.Investigators say there has been special emphasis on a few districts, from where the volumes are higher. The state police have lodged five FIRs in Cooch Behar alone. Four people have been arrested. Another arrest took place at Howrah. TOI had reported that CID had arrested two persons from Deganga and Sonarpur earlier. CID sources said most of the rehashed old incidents are those that were reported from UP, Bihar and Odisha.“We have lodged five separate FIRs at Cooch Behar and arrested four persons for sharing fake news that was promoting enmity. We have decided to have no tolerance for anyone sharing fake and unverified news and WhatsApp forwards. All cyber units have been asked to be vigilant and cross-check everything on the internet and issue rejoinders on our police social media pages,” said a top cop at Nabanna.ADG (law and order) Jawed Shamim has urged people to be vigilant against fake or unverified news. In Kolkata, police have now lodged four FIRs — the last on Sunday by Shyampukur police station — for sharing fake news that can disturb peace in the city. The cops have slapped Section 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups), apart from sections dealing with cheating and under the IT Act.Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the cyber cell was treating each post seriously. “We have already issued six notices for the profile owners to come and contact us. If they fail to do so, we will initiate legal action,” said Sharma.Cyber law expert and special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said organized fake news had witnessed a huge spurt in the last one week. “This is the ugly face of social media. Recently, the government came out with a rule, which we are referring to as Information Technology Rules 2021. It has stringent rules on the ethics and the legality of various posts and the liability of various intermediaries. The person posting these objectionable contents can be booked for various non-bailable penal provisions, including the IPC,” he said.","Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82512811,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['fake', 'media', 'brazil', 'social', 'flood', 'cid', 'posts', 'bangladesh', 'violence', 'video', 'various', 'sharing', 'bengal']",

Judge Nicholas Underhill has agreed to an oral hearing that could help to overturn a previous Court of Appeal decision which denied a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group permission to appeal against a judgment to strike out the landmark case.

“I am satisfied that, exceptionally, an oral hearing is appropriate in this case,” the judge said in the order, which was signed on May 4 and seen by Reuters on Thursday.

No further details were immediately available.

The order comes less than two months after the Court of Appeal refused permission for a lawsuit over Brazil’s worst environmental disaster to proceed in English courts.

The Court of Appeal said in March it agreed with a lower court that the case was an abuse of process, that claimants could – and were – making reparation claims in Brazil and that the lawsuit would be “irredeemably unmanageable.”

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

Samarco has since filed for bankruptcy protection.

PGMBM, the law firm representing the Brazilian claimants, said it had been contacted by many clients to “express their gratitude in respect of the consideration being given by the Court of Appeal to their application.”

BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, said it was aware of the application.

“Previous (court) rulings … have supported our position that the civil claim proceedings were unnecessary as they duplicated matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and are, or have been, the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil,” a BHP spokesman said.

The Renova Foundation is a redress scheme established in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale.

The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

Several villages in Region Nine (Upper Takatu-Upper Essequibo) were Monday flooded due to heavy rainfall and rising rivers in neighbouring Brazil, prompting authorities to obtain relief supplies, Regional Executive Officer Karl Singh said.

“Those rivers in Brazil, including the Amazon, are flowing and pushing back the water to the Takatu River. All the communities along the Takatu River will be affected. The Rupununi River is also high so that is affecting Sand Creek and those areas,” he said.

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) said the floods are being caused by “seasonal rainfall”.

He said residents and businesses in Lethem, the regional capital town, were also bracing themselves for severe flooding as the water level there has been rising steadily. “Right here in Lethem, the water is rising rapidly and a bridge that connects Lethem to St. Ignatius , water is already on the dam already,” he said.

He said mud brick houses were under severe threat because they are very vulnerable to moist conditions. “Once the soil is damp around, it also means that that the mud is going to be damp and the wall will start cracking and so on,” the Regional Executive Officer said.

Mr. Singh said relief efforts were also being coordinated with the Civil Defence Commission (CDC), the government’s emergency response agency, and preparations would be made to eventually assist farmers when the flood waters recede.

The Regional Executive Officer said among the worst hit is Baishaidrun village. That Deep South Rupununi village, which has about 35 households, is under more than two feet of water. “All their farms- all the cassava, all the eddoes, all the provisions and so on are under water so that is how severe it is,” he said. Mr. Singh said the village, located about 200 kilometres from Lethem and close to the Takatu River, has been virtually cut off by the flood waters. “Right now, I have in my possession some food supplies but I am unable to get there because of the accessibility,” he said.

Also affected are Shea Village, another Deep South Rupununi village, where 15 farms are under water.

In the South Central Rupununi village of Sand Creek, the Regional Executive Officer said water has affected houses and residents could not access their farm lands.

The Regional Executive Officer said the CDC has dispatched 300 hampers which were expected to arrive by road Monday night. He said the Region Nine administration has also purchased another 300 hampers.

Meanwhile, residents of Deep South Rupununi are urging drivers of heavy duty vehicles not to cross the Karaudar village bridge because the support has been damaged due to force of the river and erosion.

The CDC said authorities in Region 9, and all other Administrative Regions across Guyana, were being urged to be alert and activate their Regional Response Mechanisms as required and in keeping with their Regional Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan.

The CDC noted that the National Weather Watch Center indicates that “continuous rainfall is expected.” “Residents are encouraged to stockpile on potable water, food, health and hygiene supplies; avoid flood waters and inundated areas; and observe weather patterns and at-risk areas,” the agency said.","Tue, 18 May 2021 00:01:42 GMT",https://demerarawaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Region-Nine-Flood-May-2021.jpg,"['south', 'water', 'cdc', 'executive', 'flooded', 'rupununi', 'regional', 'river', 'residents', 'officer', 'villages', 'village']",

Is the Bovespa – trading at record highs – an accurate picture of the country’s financial health? Or is it the currency that is the real indicator – languishing as it is north of $5.50 – a warning that the share prices have dislocated from their economic fundamentals?

Perhaps the country’s deeply real negative interest rates – inflation is over 5% and the Selic is just 2.75% – might be the biggest fraud, artificially pushing stocks higher and the real lower.

This banker inevitably went on to talk about Brazil’s gushing pipeline of equity issuance – R$100 billion is poised to be issued in the country.

Unless something happens to make markets snap shut soon, 2021 will be another record year – showing that companies are rushing to make hay while the sun shines.

So far, investors remain hungry, though there are early signs of flagging appetite as they demand discounts to participate in the latest wave of IPOs. The proportion of deals that are closing below the bookrunners’ pricing range is rising.

Everybody wants a swimming pool, at least until its thousands of gallons of chemical-laden water come splashing down through the ceiling of the parking garage it was precariously built above. W hich is exactly what was captured on video in Brazil this week.

The video, shared on DailyMotion, YouTube and Reddit, shows CCTV footage from the pool and the inside of the parking garage of a building in Vitória, Brazil. The moment that the floor of the swimming pool collapsed, around 10 p.m. on April 22, is clearly visible . I t appears nobody was injured.

In the video, we see the entire bottom of the pool fall out, all at once and pretty much in one giant piece, into the parking garage below. The cut to the garage shows the gushing water moving powerfully enough to shift the parked cars around in their spots.

Reddit user leandroas, who originally posted a copy of the video to the website, followed up his post with a comment claiming that the building, constructed in 2018, had to be evacuated following the incident. Th e building’s original construction company is said to be paying for the relocation, and t he poster claims residents of the building will be able to return April 27.

One in four cities around the world lack the money to protect themselves against the ravages of climate breakdown, even though more than 90 per cent are facing serious risks, according to research. Cities are facing problems with flooding, overheating, water shortages, and damage to their infrastructure from extreme weather, which is growing more frequent as the climate changes. A survey of 800 cities, carried out by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), found that last year about 43 per cent of them, representing a combined population of 400 million people, did not have a plan to adapt to the climate crisis. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Budgetary restraints were cited as the key reason by about 25 per cent of cities. Many are reliant on national governments for the funding needed to protect their infrastructure and vulnerable populations from these threats.

The survey found that last year, 422 cities had 1,142 projects to adapt to the climate crisis yet to be financed, requiring about $72 billion in investment. The cost of water management projects alone that were yet to be financed was estimated at $22.6 billion. Kyra Appleby, the global director of CDP, said: “Adaptation (to the impacts of climate change) is trickier to finance than emissions action. There are enormous benefits from adaptation and resilience, but they don’t appear on the balance sheet. Only a fraction of recovery spending (from the coronavirus pandemic) is being put towards climate change, and even less towards adaptation.” Installing renewable energy generation, such as solar panels, can generate a financial return, and energy efficiency projects begin to save money quite quickly, but the benefits of adapting to the impacts of extreme weather are less obvious and often more diffuse.","Mon, 17 May 2021 10:10:11 GMT",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2021/05/14/pexels-ryan-4293398.jpg,"['water', 'crisis', 'weather', 'adaptation', 'world', 'climate', 'cent', 'projects', 'survey', 'cities', 'measures', 'cant', 'afford', 'impacts']",

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Thu, 06 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zjh2JaBQpIuhPnOfB35VMg--~B/aD00OTI7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/24ee4ddf76c36e2c58be29028877ae7a,"['bhp', 'inflation', 'global', 'lawsuit', 'court', 'dam', 'brazil', '69', 'uk', 'reconsider', 'billion', 'exclusive', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'china', 'rising', 'prices', 'costs', 'policy', 'banks']",

Grain and bean futures jumped in overnight trading on concerns about adverse global weather.

Little to no rain is expected in at least the next couple of weeks for Brazil’s safrinha corn crop, according to several weather forecasters.

WXRisk said over the weekend that no rain fell anywhere in Brazil Friday or Saturday and that the weather in the South American country is “fairly hot” for this time of year.

The forecaster sees no significant rainfall in Brazil for at least the next couple of weeks.

Consultancy Safras & Mercado on Friday lowered its projection for Brazil’s total corn output to 104.1 million metric tons due to the dry weather, an 8% decline from its previous outlook.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month forecast Brazilian corn production at 109 million metric tons, up from 102 million tons the previous year.

Demand also has been strong in recent days as an unnamed country bought 101,600 metric tons of corn, the USDA said on April 27.

2. Speculators Increase Their Bullish Bets in Soybeans and Wheat

**

Money manager increased their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in soybeans and wheat last week while reducing their bullish bets on corn futures, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Speculators in the seven days that ended on April 27 raised their net longs in soybeans to 168,851 futures contracts, the CFTC said in a report.

That’s up from 160,094 contracts a week earlier and the highest level since the week that ended on Dec. 29, the agency said.

Investors also raised their bullish bets on hard-red winter wheat to a net-30,111 futures contracts last week, up from 18,608 contracts the previous week. That’s the largest such position since March 16.

For soft-red winter futures, investors turned bullish and held a net-long position of 7,210 contracts, the CFTC said. That’s a shift from a net-short position, or bets on lower prices, of 3,697 contracts a week earlier.

Net longs in corn, meanwhile, declined to 362,238 futures contracts last week, down from 380,083 contracts seven days earlier.

That’s the smallest bullish position since the week that ended on March 16, the government said in its report.

Adverse weather in South America and the U.S. has hedge-fund managers and other large investors worried about production while global demand for agricultural commodities has been robust.

The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

By Vatican News staff writer

Thousands of families have been left homeless in the western Amazon after torrential rains caused severe flooding across the Brazilian state of Acre. At an already critical time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, those most hard-hit are the poor who live on the banks of rivers. This is the case for the community of Sena Madureira, a town near the Iaco River. Located about 145 km from the capital Rio Branco, Sena is the third most populous municipality in Acre, after Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Solidarity of the Church

In Sena Madureira, the flood has affected 17 thousand people. Of these, 4 thousand are already housed in public reception facilities such as sports fields and schools. The Catholic Church has joined in the solidarity mobilisation and is welcoming families. Fr Moisés de Oliveira Coelho of the Order of the Servants of Mary, and parish priest of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Parish, spoke to Vatican News and explained ""we have some chapels that are being used as temporary shelters, such as the Nossa Senhora Aparecida Chapel, the São Sebastião Chapel and the Santa Cruz Chapel. Other chapels are also occupied by the goods that families in need of help have managed to recover.

The Church is also working to collect donations for those who have lost everything. Fr Moisés explained that this is why the Ação Bom Samaritano (""Action of the Good Samaritan"") has been launched: a solidarity campaign promoted in collaboration with the local government. He said that the parish collects food, shoes, clothing, personal hygiene and cleaning products: ""We receive donations from our faithful, from people of goodwill and we prepare food parcels and then distribute them to shelters.""

Looking ahead

The solidarity of the local Church does not stop at the current emergency, but also looks to the aftermath, to when people will have to return home. For this reason Fr Moisés said that they are putting donation money aside: ""We have opened an account so that, after the floods are over, we will be able to help families buy cleaning products, personal hygiene items and basic necessities. These are still small gestures compared to the magnitude of what is happening, but they are sufficient and necessary and will increase as donations grow. So, we depend on donations to be able to do these good deeds and that is why we always count on the help and collaboration of everyone at this time.""

The crisis in Acre

The flooding of regional rivers in the State of Acre also created problems in the capital Rio Branco, in Cruzeiro do Sul and in the municipalities of Tarauacá, Feijó, Santa Rosa do Purus and Rodrigues Alves. To deal with the emergency, all public agencies are on high alert and are providing relief to the population at risk. State authorities have created 23 temporary shelters for displaced people and last weekend they distributed more than 500 food parcels to the population. In all, about 120,000 people are affected. More than 32 thousand families have been devastated by these extreme weather events. The health situation in Acre is also particularly critical due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dengue epidemic and malaria. Both infections and hospitalisations are increasing, putting hospitals under great pressure.","Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/multimedia/2021/02/24/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-23-at-15.37.35aem.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['thousand', 'solidarity', 'families', 'acre', 'moisés', 'brazil', 'floods', 'donations', 'state', 'rio', 'churches', 'open', 'parish', 'displaced', 'doors', 'thousands', 'sena']",

A swimming pool crashed into a car park at a beachfront condominium in southeastern Brazil last week. The shocking incident which happened in Vila Velha, Espírito Santo, was captured on a security camera. The 75-foot long pool suddenly collapsed and turned it into a free car wash.

The CCTV footage shows the pool surrounded by plants and flood lights. No people are visible in the area. The bottom of the pool suddenly collapses in a clean break. The video then transitions to the parking garage below the pool, with is suddenly flooded with water. No people are seen in the garage.

The building's 270 residents were evacuated, Brazilian online news portal G1 reported. No injuries were reported in the incident. The accident did not damage vehicles in the indoor parking lot.

Some tenants of the building across the street from Itaparica Beach reported a strong gas odour coming from the heated swimming pool.

Argo, the company that built the 90-unit building, put up displaced tenants in nearby hotels for no cost.

Espírito Santo officials and Vila Velha cleared residents to return to their apartments on Tuesday after engineers inspected the complex and found no structural damage.

The pool was closed for at least three months in 2020 due to a leak, newspaper Folha Vitoria reported.

Unmitigated spread in Brazil

Caroline Ash

Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from Sã o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

The São Paulo State is home of around 45 million people ranging from very vulnerable communities to well structure urban and rural areas. From the beginning of the pandemic, the state has been the epicentre of the COVID-19 in Brazil, with more than 1.5 million cases and 47,768 deaths until this day(https://covid19br.wcota.me/), a quarter of the national numbers.

Data from INPE (National Institute of Space research) and the State University in São Paulo (UNESP), shows that an outstanding season of summer storms will continue in the next months, with its peak from February to April, increasing the alert for areas hit by the floods in the first weeks of 2021.

In the São Paulo Municipality, the most affected districts are in the East and in the South of the city. In the East, the Jacuí and Jardim Santa Helena neighbourhoods are in an area that follows the river course of the Rio Tietê – one of the longest and most polluted rivers in Brazil. That river has a system of dams and barriers that overflows during the rainy season affecting the life of the most vulnerable communities alongside its course. In the south, the Grajaú district has many very poor communities living in the shore of the city’s larger reservoir in informal settlements.

This situation leads to at least 1200 families affected by the floods, causing food insecurity and very low health sanitation standards. The situation is especially bad for around 2400 children, in those areas, for a total 6000 people. Because of the fact that Summer Floods have started earlier than usual, it is expected that the amount of affected population will increase in the following months.","Sun, 10 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1551255-Alert-01-2021-Brazil-Summer-Floods-Sao-Paulo.png?itok=girNLjj2,"['act', 'paulo', 'alliance', 'brazil', 'sao', 'floods', 'summer', 'vulnerable', 'alert', 'state', 'communities', 'areas', 'são', '2021', 'affected']", 
26,26,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Nature-based Solutions: Latin America and the Caribbean’s Green Opportunity - New Security Beat,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2021/05/nature-based-solutions-latin-america-caribbeans-green-opportunity/,"Already facing water stress, much of Latin America (such as the western slopes of the Andes and the dry corridor of Central America) is projected to experience intensified periods of drought in the coming decades, further complicating development efforts in the region. At the same time, heavy floods are the most common natural disaster in the region, disrupting life for countless people. According to the World Bank, in Latin America and the Caribbean alone roughly $14 billion per year is required to meet the 2030 water and sanitation targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Typically, investments at this scale have been made by governments and large firms that invest in traditional infrastructure such as dams. But with ever-growing development needs and increased understanding of the impacts of climate change, Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are gaining momentum as a new way of incorporating environmental considerations into development responses.

NBS refer to the strategic restoration, protection, or management of ecosystems to intentionally address social challenges. Recent research has shown that combining NBS with traditional infrastructure can be more cost-effective, and result in greater positive side effects for communities.

Investment in NBS—from reforestation to protect water supplies and reduce carbon emissions to natural barriers that protect coastal communities from sea level rise and storm surge—is key to delivering sustainable growth that addresses climate change and its impacts. These investments in infrastructure can also address other pressing environmental challenges, such as lack of water and sanitation, deforestation, ecosystem degradation, and loss of biodiversity.

Examples of NBS in the Latin America and the Caribbean, though insufficient in number and scale, already exist. A forthcoming report from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) identifies several studies that illustrate the value of NBS. Many of these examples are already well-known locally. In Brazil, for example, “green roofs” in homes of a favela in Rio de Janeiro reduced temperatures in peak heat by up to 20 degrees Celsius, resulting in health and energy-saving benefits. NBS is already providing valuable benefits for flood prevention, as well. In certain places in Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that every 20 km of mangrove forest along coastlines protects an average of over $250 million of infrastructure. In Mexico, coral reefs along the coast of Quintana Roo reduce flood damages by an estimated $42 million annually. Protecting these ecosystems is vastly more cost-effective than building artificial barriers and provides added benefits to local communities, in the form of tourism-related livelihoods and healthier fishing stocks.

Protecting and restoring ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and floodplains in upper watersheds can improve water quality and availability downstream for agriculture and human consumption, and are necessary for the resilience of critical infrastructure such as hydroelectric power plants.

Other innovative, small-scale nature-based projects, such as planting vetiver grass—a non-invasive plant with a deep root system that can support regrowth of native species—in degraded slopes, can prevent flooding, landslides, and sedimentation while aiding reforestation efforts and supporting livelihoods in local communities. In Trinidad & Tobago, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) and local organization IAMovement are using vetiver grass to promote sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable populations. Migrant Indigenous women are learning to make and sell crafts, such as baskets, mats, and chairs, that use vetiver grass as a raw material, illustrating how these solutions also support sustainable development efforts.

Ignoring the role of nature in addressing these complex challenges can come at a high cost. A study of the Amazon basin estimates that a 20-40 percent reduction in forest cover in the Amazon would result in a decline in power generation of the Belo Monte hydropower dam—one of Brazil’s main sources of electricity—to 25 percent its maximum capacity by 2050. Protecting the forest is vastly cheaper than investing in new power generation infrastructure. In a warming planet, and with growing development needs in Latin America and the Caribbean, proactively promoting nature-based solutions, on their own or integrated with existing gray infrastructure, can support the region’s climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Our organizations, PADF and WRI, are taking steps to help national and local leaders harness the power of nature for development in Latin America and the Caribbean. Through this partnership, we support research to identify promising NBS throughout the region, raise awareness among investors on the benefits of nature, and connect projects with investors to bring these solutions to the real world. We hope that these efforts, combined with greater ambition by local and international stakeholders from the public, private, and civil society sectors, will bring the region’s vast natural wealth to the forefront of the fight against climate change, benefit local communities, and promote a hemisphere of opportunity for all.","Wed, 19 May 2021 06:44:27 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/49888560908_ee1e31219b_o-222x176.jpg,"['water', 'opportunity', 'nbs', 'america', 'green', 'latin', 'naturebased', 'development', 'caribbean', 'solutions', 'infrastructure', 'caribbeans', 'support', 'sustainable', 'local']", 
27,27,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Going under? Brazil's hospitals at risk as climate change brings more floods - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-climate-change-healthcare-idUSKBN2B105V,"SAO PAULO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Last December, when physician Victor Heitor Gomes became health director for Rafard, a municipality 150 km northwest of São Paulo, he knew he had a challenge ahead.

The only clinic in the town of 9,000 had been through hard times: heavy rains in mid-November caused part of a meeting room wall to collapse and a month later more rain flooded parts of the building, including the surgery room and common areas.

The problems forced the clinic to relocate some services to other rooms - and repairing the meter-long hole in the meeting room wall had to be put on hold because of ongoing rain in the Brazilian summer.

Harsher rains and increasingly scorching temperatures have made life tough for doctors in other ways as well, Gomes said.

“They’re changing the seasonality of certain diseases. You don’t expect to see dengue in the winter, but it’s getting more common now,” he said.

Extreme weather, like the floods that ravaged the Maria Tereza Apprilante Gimenez Basic Healthcare Unit in Rafard, are increasingly a threat throughout the region as climate change takes hold - and are creating an additional burden for health workers struggling to battle the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Pan American Health Organization, almost 70% of the 18,000 hospitals in Latin America and the Caribbean are located in areas highly vulnerable to floods, major earthquakes or hurricanes.

Inundation is the most common threat. Nearly 550 floods hit the region in the two decades between 2000 and 2019, affecting over 40 million people and causing almost $26 billion in damages, according to a 2020 report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).

Brazil is the most flood-prone country in Latin America, the report said.

HEAVIER RAIN

The storms that hit Rafard are a worry as well for nearby São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil and in South America.

Concrete-filled urban areas act as “heat islands” that absorb and then slowly release the sun’s heat, making them hotter than surrounding rural areas.

In cities like São Paulo, that extra heat combines with humidity arriving from the nearby Atlantic Ocean to create heavier rain, said Tércio Ambrizzi, an atmospheric scientist at the University of São Paulo.

“The heat lifts and condenses the humidity, making it rain,” often more intensely than might happen elsewhere, said the scientist, who co-authored a 2020 study on changing rain patterns in metropolitan São Paulo between 1930 and 2019.

Using data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology, researchers found that heavy rain is becoming more concentrated in shorter periods, while dry spells stretch longer.

The changes have been particularly noticeable over the last decade, they said.

In 2014, Sao Paulo’s hottest summer in seven decades, water reservoirs for the city dropped below 20% capacity, in the city’s biggest water crisis on record and a serious threat for healthcare facilities.

Extremely heavy rainfall events - the kind that can trigger disasters - similarly nearly doubled in the last decade compared to 1971-1980, researchers found.

The extremes are most apparent in Brazil’s southern and southeast regions, and are a particular problem for heavily populated cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, which are highly vulnerable to floods and landslides in part because of poor urban planning, Ambrizzi said.

PLANNING AHEAD

Eduardo Trani, Sao Paulo state’s environment sub-secretary, said his office is aware of the challenges.

A 2009 law passed by the state established policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate threats, including an effort to map climate risks in all the state’s 645 municipalities.

Almost 250 have been completed so far.

“The mapping is fine-grained to the scale of neighborhoods, so that local city halls can study precautionary measures to take against floods and landslides,” Trani said.

What the results so far have found is that basic healthcare units, particularly in the São Paulo metro area, often lie in flood-prone areas or are surrounded by them.

That can be addressed in part by infrastructure changes, such as building floodwalls around hospitals and relocating vulnerable ventilation, heating and air-conditioning systems to higher ground, resilience experts say.

Having backup power sources - including solar panels or other renewable energy - also can keep hospitals functioning when broader power systems go down in extreme weather.

Mariana Silva, a infrastructure and sustainable finance specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank, said building resilience also is a matter of planning for decades ahead.

“If a hospital is to be built in a place which is highly prone to disasters, we must ask ourselves what can we change in its engineering. You’d be surprised how small changes can make a project resilient,” she said.

Shifting designs can add to costs - but ignoring the risks will cost more, she said.

“Making those changes costs extra money - but now Latin American governments know climate change is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’,” she said.","Mon, 08 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['brings', 'paulo', 'rain', 'sao', 'floods', 'risk', 'climate', 'going', 'hospitals', 'change', 'vulnerable', 'brazils', 'heat', 'são', 'changes', 'threat']",

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Thu, 20 May 2021 14:30:25 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,"['china', 'rising', 'costs', 'tax', 'prices', 'revenue', 'beats', 'record', 'inflation', 'brazils', 'central', 'global', 'policy', 'bloomberg', 'banks', 'federal']",

SAO PAULO, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people died Thursday in floods and landslides sparked by heavy rains in Presidente Getulio, a town in southern Brazil's Santa Catarina state, bordering Argentina, state officials said.

""The situation in Presidente Getulio is critical due to the floods: houses, vehicles, everything destroyed, people with water up to their shoulders,"" the head of the town's fire department, Alex Lima, said.

Civil defense rescue teams were also searching for 12 missing persons in affected neighborhoods, officials said in a statement.

A heavy storm early Thursday battered several towns, some close to Florianopolis, the state capital and one of the most important tourist destinations in Brazil.

Landslides blocked access to Presidente Getulio, home to 14,000 inhabitants, for a few hours.

Due to the possibility of new storms, it is important the population remains alert and heeds the instructions of civil defense authorities, Santa Catarina Governor Carlos Moises said.

It effectively forces Indonesia to open its imports from the Latin American country.

According to IPB University’s animal husbandry faculty lecturer Rudi Afnan, as written in a statement released in the university’s website ipb.ac.id, the chicken meat imports from Brazil may likely threaten local chicken farmers. Rudi argued it is best for Indonesia to halt poultry product imports.

“This is closely related to the issue of policy in international trade where we are obliged to accept chicken imports from Brazil. Meanwhile, we have self-supported our need for broiler meat since 2008 and have even succeeded in exporting,” the lecturer wrote.

Due to its production capacity, he said, Brazil plans to export poultry products to Indonesia with a relatively low price of Rp14,000/kilograms. Rudi believes that it will make it difficult for Indonesian poultry farmers to compete.

He said one of the solutions is through production efficiency, which can be a tall order as local whole chicken products sold around Rp30,000-40,000 per kilogram while local broiler chicken is sold around Rp14,000 per kilogram. Another solution is for the government to provide subsidies to Indonesian chicken farmers.

34,34,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Climate change poses threat to thirsty São Paulo - Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/bae1d239-4c8d-4737-b436-000b131c20e2,"When it rains in São Paulo, it pours. During tropical storms that punctuate late afternoons in summer, drains overflow on to pavements and floods are not uncommon.

But, despite its sobriquet as the Terra da Garoa, or land of drizzle, ensuring an adequate supply of clean water is a major challenge for Latin America’s biggest metropolis as the climate changes.

This was laid bare when the region’s worst drought in 80 years resulted in severe water shortages between 2014 and 2015. Sporadic outages in parts of the city sparked protests, as well as fears that reserves might run out.

Since then, the utility Sabesp — which serves 28m residents in the greater São Paulo area and eponymous state — has undertaken a range of measures and investments with the aim of avoiding a repeat episode.

Chief executive Benedito Braga insists the company is prepared, with systems that kick in for “extreme situations”.

“What we thought was an extreme situation is becoming more common,” he adds. “For 10 years, rainfall has been below average in the region. It’s very worrying”.

While a long dry spell was the primary reason behind the São Paulo crisis, it compounded other factors such as a growing population, polluted waterways and deforestation.

Levels in the city’s large Cantareira system of reservoirs, which serves around 7.5m people, dropped to below one-tenth of its capacity.

Recommended São Paulo drought raises fears of Brazil energy crisis

Sabesp then provoked controversy by lowering pressure in the distribution network, which temporarily led to taps running dry in certain neighbourhoods. But its other main defence tactic has had lasting benefits.

“During the water crisis, we gave economic incentives [discounts] for people to save water,” Braga says. “Then we removed it, but they changed their habits. Today, consumption is approximately 10 per cent less than before the 2014 crisis.”

To increase its resilience, Sabesp has also invested in schemes to boost the supply of water to the metropolitan region. Already planned before the crisis, works were accelerated on the flagship R$2.2bn ($405m) São Lourenço production system, built through a public-private partnership. It transports water from a reservoir 83km away, via a treatment plant, to around 2m residents in the west of São Paulo.

Other actions taken by Sabesp include clamping down on theft, fixing leaky pipes, cleaning contaminated rivers and planting trees in areas adjoining the Cantareira reservoir network.

Braga reckons cities in a similar position to São Paulo should now concentrate on boosting storage. “The theory of climate change is that we will have more intense rainfall and longer dry periods. To minimise this variability, you . . . need to build dams to store water — that’s lesson number one.

“There’s a very strong environmental lobby against the construction of dams. This needs to stop. People need to be more reasonable.”

Pedro Côrtes, a professor of environmental science at the University of São Paulo, commends the way Sabesp has changed management of the Cantareira system, so that less water is drawn when storage levels are low.

“But, in fact, our supply system is still strongly dependent on climatic conditions,” he says. “There is no negotiation with the climate, but adaptation. We always need to save water.”

There is no negotiation with the climate, but adaptation. We always need to save water

Some scientists, including Côrtes, argue that deforestation of the Amazon is contributing to São Paulo’s water problems, given the importance of the “flying rivers” originating in the rainforest that bring clouds and rain to the central and southern regions of Brazil.

Braga sees it differently, though. “If deforestation causes drought, how did we have this huge flood [in 2010]? These variabilities are linked to phenomena on a global scale and it is the oceans that play a much more important role.”

The volatility of rainfall in the city region was made clear in February 2020, a month with the highest volume of precipitation in 77 years of measurement, according to Brazil’s meteorological service, Inmet.

Juan Carlos Castilla-Rubio, a São Paulo resident and chair of SpaceTime Labs, which helps companies optimise their use of natural resources, suggests that water-risky regions should introduce a “water stress early warning system”. This would issue predictive alerts so that water can be conserved in times of stress.

He also suggests that these areas could introduce a price mechanism that reflects water’s scarcity, by using artificial intelligence systems to establish water risk ratings.

But environmental campaigners argue that there needs to be a more fundamental rethink about water. Greater re-use of wastewater for activities like cleaning that do not require it to be drinkable would be a start, says Édison Carlos, head of the NGO Trata Brasil.

35,35,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Climate crisis blamed for rains and floods that have killed 150 in Brazil - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/13/climate-crisis-blamed-for-rains-and-floods-that-have-killed-150-in-brazil,"About 150 people have been killed or are missing following record-breaking heavy rains, landslides and flooding in three Brazilian states this year.

Scientists say global heating is contributing to more “extreme rainfall” events in the country, and warned that such disasters could become “the new normal”.

Monsoon rains kill Brazilians every summer, with floodwaters filling streets and landslides afflicting poorer communities and favelas built on steep hillsides, often without proper drainage or sanitation.

But global temperatures have climbed steeply since the 1980s, and a warming atmosphere causes more evaporation, making more water available for precipitation.

Official data sent to the Guardian showed “extreme rainfall events” – when more than 80mm or 100mm falls within 24 hours – have soared over the past 30 years in the capitals of the south-eastern states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, where the deadly rains happened.

Scientists blame a combination of growing cities and climate breakdown.

“We are seeing more and more extreme events happening in big and important cities,” said Tercio Ambrizzi, a professor of climatology at the University of São Paulo. “There is a relationship with the increase in average global temperatures.”

In Guarujá, a coastal town 25 miles from São Paulo, 282mm fell in just 12 hours last week – more than the total expected for the entire month of March.

“I never saw a day it rained like that,” said Rafael Soares, 22, a tyre factory worker from the town’s hillside Barreira do João Guarda community, hit by a landslide on 3 March that buried dozens of houses, killing 18 people and leaving dozens still missing.

Soares heard a deafening boom at about 1am and ran up the hill behind his house to find that part of his community had been buried.

“You couldn’t see anything, just earth and mud,” he said, describing “just hearing cries, people crying, not knowing what to do. There was no light, there was nothing.”

He spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home.

Days earlier, five people died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela’s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013.

“Older people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,” she said.

According to data from Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A São Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since.

“There’s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of Brazil,” Ambrizzi said.

His own research from São Paulo – capital of the state where four people died in two days in February following heavy rainfall – backs this up.

Data from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found.

“This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,” the paper said. “Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.”

“Urban heat islands” created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect.

“When it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,” said José Marengo from Brazil’s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper’s authors.

Not all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil’s Space Research Institute said the rains were “meteorological phenomena typical of summer”, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone – “a band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean” for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said.

“You can’t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,” said Josélia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer’s rains have been exceptional. “We are breaking records,” she said.

In January, 59 people were killed during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 “extreme rain” events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020.

In Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station – the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year.Extreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies. “This is the new normal,” he said.","Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32986541a0f8ff603fe23a0a8f8e0aaabde34bfe/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4c3d72b619ecac7e400896306aed191,"['warming', 'extreme', 'paulo', 'killed', 'crisis', 'brazil', 'rain', 'weather', 'floods', 'climate', 'events', 'heavy', 'rains', 'global', '150', 'são', 'blamed']",

Since the beginning of 2021, the number of dengue cases has exploded in the region, which already has more than 8,600 suspected cases.

In the last week, rains have caused rivers and streams to overflow, dislodged families in more than 10 cities.

Added to this, the second wave of Covid-19 affected the state, which suffers from a lack of ICU beds, and an unexpected humanitarian crisis involving hundreds of immigrants aggravates the scenario.

The governor of Acre (Brazil), Gladson Cameli, decreed an emergency situation and installed a temporary crisis office to manage the situation

Among the measures that the federal government announced to mitigate the floods is the release of R$ 450 million for several municipalities.

The Ministry of Justice, on the other hand, authorized the use of the National Security Force in the state, in “exceptional and temporary blocking activities of foreigners entering the country”.

President Jair Bolsonaro said he intends to go to Rio Branco, capital of Acre, next Wednesday (24).

Immigrants trying to cross into Peru, whose borders are closed because of the pandemic, are increasing tensions in the city of Assis Brasil.

Right now, more than 400 immigrants, mostly Haitians, are in shelters or camped on the streets.

The possibility of increasing this migratory flow is worrying, since the city does not have the capacity to serve so many people and the agglomeration further increases the risk of contamination by coronavirus.

According to the State Department of Health (Sesacre), Acre has 54,743 covid-19 infected and 957 deaths. The ICU bed occupancy rate rose to 91%, and is concentrated in the two largest cities, Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Assis Brasil leads the ranking of covid contamination rate in the state, with 1,375 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.

Acre (Brazil): the state of emergency is expected to extend in the coming days due to rain forecast until February 25

Acre already has almost 130,000 people affected in some way by the flood of rivers in the capital and in the interior of the state. Residents affected by the floods were taken to shelters set up in schools, churches, gymnasiums, sports courts and boats.

Floods further increase the risk of dengue.

Some teenagers and young adults who received Covid vaccines experienced heart inflammation, a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group said, recommending further study of the rare condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices in a statement dated May 17 said it had looked into reports that a few young vaccine recipients - predominantly male, adolescents and young adults - developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition often goes away without complications and can be caused by a variety of viruses, the CDC group said. CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but members of the committee on vaccinations felt that healthcare providers should be made aware of the reports of the ""potential adverse event"", the committee said. It did not say how many people had been affected and recommended further investigation. Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said vaccines are known to cause myocarditis and it would be important to monitor to see if it is causally related to the vaccine. It is important to look at the risk-benefit ratio, he said: ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial outweighing this very low, if conclusively established, risk."" The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving the mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The United States has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Israel's Health Ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer's vaccine, although it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30. Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established. Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The CDC in late April, after news of the Israeli investigation, said it did not see a link between the two. Earlier this month US regulators expanded authorisation of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to children aged 12 to 15.","Wed, 19 May 2021 17:25:05 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/19/60a54a4ab2bd3f477d72cf09/60a54a4ee1e77f00011f17f1_1280x720_FES_v1.jpg,"['floodwater', 'vaccine', 'houston', 'cdc', 'rain', 'committee', 'submerged', 'pfizer', 'heavy', 'cases', 'young', 'vaccines', 'condition', 'inflammation', 'heart']",

Violent rain has killed scores of people and forced thousands from their homes this year in Brazil's most populous states, a disaster experts blame on climate upheaval but also rampant urbanization.

Flash floods, landslides and other havoc wrought by torrential rain have killed at least 29 people in recent days in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Another 25 are missing.

That comes after more than 50 people were killed by heavy rain that devastated the state of Minas Gerais in January.

The same scenes of destruction have played out in all three southeastern states, together home to more than 83 million people: poor neighborhoods wiped out by tidal waves of brown mud; houses and cars swept away by flash floods; residents evacuated by boat and helicopter as their streets turn to gushing rivers.

More than three million people live in high-risk zones in Brazil's southeast, which has been hit by record rain this year—in some places, a month's worth in a matter of hours.

As dozens of rescue workers dug through the debris of wrecked houses for his missing mother, stepfather and sister-in-law, one of those affected, 24-year-old Yago de Sousa Nunes, voiced frustration that the authorities did not do more to protect the at-risk population.

""The city government knew this was a high-risk zone, they knew how much rain was going to fall this week, but they didn't do anything to evacuate people,"" he said alongside the ruins of the Barreira de Joao Guarda neighborhood, in the coastal city of Guaruja, Sao Paulo.

Extreme weather

Is climate change to blame?

Experts say more studies are needed to be sure.

But there is no doubt the region is experiencing ""an increase in extreme weather events,"" said Andrea Ramos of the National Meteorological Institute.

This year, the rainy season in southeastern Brazil has been marked by extremes, said Marcelo Seluchi of the Natural Disaster Monitoring and Alert Center (Cemaden): very dry in the first half of the summer, then very wet from mid-January on.

""The planet is heating up, that's beyond doubt. It's more humid than 50 or 100 years ago, which means the same weather systems have more potential to create rain,"" he said.

That has combined with the rampant expansion of urban areas to increase people's vulnerability to floods.

Brazil's biggest cities have seen decades of nearly unchecked growth, as poor migrants arrive and settle wherever they can, often building unstable shantytowns on hillsides or the extreme city outskirts.

""Population growth and the growth of cities means we're replacing vegetation with cement, and that's where a long-standing problem in Brazil comes into play: lots of building on high-risk areas,"" Seluchi told AFP.

More than half the population of the southeast region's state capitals—Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Vitoria—lives in at-risk zones. And 80 percent of those people are ""highly vulnerable: they live in very precarious houses, with high population density and a high percentage of children and the elderly,"" he said.

Housing problem

Rio de Janeiro's Mayor Marcelo Crivella, a far-right evangelical Christian bishop, caused outrage amid the floods when he blamed residents for the destruction.

""People like to live close (to flood-prone rivers and gulleys) because they spend less on sewage pipes for their pee and poop,"" he said.

Unaffordable housing costs have forced the urban poor into areas unfit for settlements, said Henrique Evers, an urban development expert at the World Resources Institute.

""Planning housing for vulnerable populations near urban services is one of the best ways to deal with this challenge,"" he said.

But would it have been enough? - News@Northeastern,https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/01/31/better-planning-mightve-limited-brazils-flood-damage-would-that-have-been-enough/,"Historic rainfall in southeastern Brazil has created deadly floods and widespread destruction in a region that was experimenting with “more progressive” planning and zoning policies than most, says Northeastern political science professor Thomas Vicino, who studies metropolitan development and housing in Brazil.

Had they been fully realized, could those policies have reduced some of the destruction in Belo Horizonte wrought by the storms?

“Many people—and we see this in India as well as Brazil—live in informal settlements that are often built in precarious places, like mountainsides” Vicino says.

These communities are typically not zoned or overseen by any government agency, and they crop up as piecemeal settlements as a result of people moving from rural areas of the country closer to urban areas for work, he says.

“They are very susceptible to natural disasters,” says Vicino, who is a professor of political science, public policy, and urban affairs at Northeastern. In 2013, he led a Dialogue of Civilizations program in Belo Horizonte.

“Resilient, sustainable regional planning and approaches to development certainly help,” says Vicino, who spent a year in Belo Horizonte as a United States Fulbright Core Scholar, where he contributed to research on urban planning. “But the core issue is a political question: Does society have the political will to confront the realities of climate change?”

It’s been raining in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais for nearly a month, and Belo Horizonte, its capital, registered last week the heaviest rainfall in the city since it started measuring 110 years ago.

Cities and towns in the region have been washed out by landslides and floods, and thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.

Brazilian officials blame inadequate housing policies in part for the storm’s particularly high death toll, they told The New York Times.

The destruction underscores the need for cities around the world to implement “more resilient policies and more resilient [neighborhood] planning,” Vicino says—policies with which Belo Horizonte was in the early stages of exploring.

City officials had created a number of programs to bring those informal housing settlements (called favelas) into the fold by applying appropriate zoning regulations and adding municipal sewer systems, roads, and public services such as police and schools, Vicino says.

“This makes them more sustainable places to live,” he says.

But it’s not just these communities that are susceptible, Vicino says.

He says that “resilient planning” also involves officials creating fixed boundaries around development zones to protect open space and natural land. Paving over too much of the landscape or burying rivers and creeks in order to build over them, means that these natural water collection systems—soil and rivers—cannot do their jobs, Vicino says.

“It makes an acute event, like the storms we are seeing in Brazil, even more acute,” he says.

The sorts of long-term planning policies that Belo Horizonte and other parts of Brazil are implementing require support and funding that spans elected officials and administrations, Vicino says—support that can be difficult to achieve.

Any interruption to the process, including natural disasters, political upheaval, economic downturn, and social unrest, can derail it, he says.

“What we know is that we need more resilient policies, and more resilient planning for all types of neighborhoods and all types of people,” Vicino says.

49,49,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil's Bem Querer dam: An impending Amazon disaster (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/11/brazils-bem-querer-dam-an-impending-amazon-disaster-commentary/,"Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his administration’s priorities for Amazon dams, including the planned Bem Querer dam on the Rio Branco in the far-northern state of Roraima.

Bem Querer is primarily intended to increase the energy supply to industries in locations outside of Amazonia, rather than for residents of Roraima.

Probable environmental impacts include blocking fish migrations and flooding a riparian forest that possesses extraordinary bird diversity. Downstream flow alteration would impact protected areas, including two Ramsar wetland biodiversity sites. Riverside dwellers would also be impacted.

Sediment flow blockage would impact fisheries and the unique Anavilhanas Archipelago, a spectacular Brazilian national park. These adverse impacts need to be fully evaluated before a decision to build is made. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

The text of this commentary is updated from an earlier Portuguese-language version of the author’s column at Amazônia Real.

Brazilian Amazonia already has more than a dozen large hydroelectric dams, and their development history is not good: severe human and environmental impacts, and benefits far below those envisaged by the proponents at the time decisions were made to build the dams. The lessons of this history have not been learned, and today the government is moving fast in its preparations for yet another dam facing serious questions — the Bem Querer Dam, proposed to block the Rio Branco in Roraima state, to become operational in 2028 with 650 MW installed capacity (EPE, 2020, p. 71) (Figure 1).

President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his priorities for building more Amazon dams, including Bem Querer (Figure 2). Bem Querer is one of three large dams to be built under Brazil’s current 2020-2029 ten-year energy expansion plan, although more dams could be added to the list if the Bolsonaro administration succeeds in its declared objective of removing restrictions on building dams in Indigenous areas.

The Bem Querer dam’s socio-environmental impacts would be large indeed. It would flood a 130-kilometer stretch of the Rio Branco, eliminating the aquatic ecosystems in this high-biodiversity river (Figure 3). The flooding would also eliminate riparian forests upstream of the dam. Downstream of the dam, flow alterations and other effects would directly impact three conservation units (Viruá National Park and the Niquiá and Caracaraí Ecological Stations); Viruá is a Ramsar wetland biodiversity site. Blockage of fish migration and other impacts would indirectly affect almost all conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) in Roraima (ICMBio, 2013, p. 64).

The dam would impact an especially great diversity of birds in the areas sacrificed to flooding. It would emit greenhouse gases, especially methane. It would alter the hydrological regime downstream, an effect that has killed large areas of flooded forest downstream of the Balbina Dam in the neighboring state of Amazonas.

The human population along the river below the Bem Querer dam will suffer from the change in the hydrological regime, as well as from the decrease in fishing caused by the blockage of fish migration and the decreases of both oxygen and nutrients in the water.

The decrease in nutrients will occur due to sediment retention in the reservoir because the nutrients are associated with the sediment particles. The Rio Branco has a lot of sediments, which is why it got the name “Rio Branco” (meaning “white river”). The decrease in sediments downstream of dams causes erosion of the stream bottom and of the river banks, as is now occurring in the Madeira River, where sediments decreased by 30% after the Santo Antônio and Jirau Dams were built. The decrease in nutrients caused by sediment retention undermines the entire food chain that supports fish populations (Figure 4).

The Rio Branco’s sediments are also essential for maintaining the ecosystems of the Anavilhanas Archipelago (Figure 5) that was formed from these sediments in the Rio Negro, just downstream of its confluence with the Rio Branco. In fact, the Bem Querer dam threatens several jewels of the Brazilian national park system. The Anavilhanas and Jaú National Parks, as well as the Rio Negro State Park, are all in the impacted stretch of the Rio Negro and are part of both the Rio Negro Ramsar wetland biodiversity site and UNESCO’s Central Amazon Biosphere Reserve. Anavilhanas and Jaú are also part of the Central Amazon Conservation Complex, recognized since 2003 on UNESCO’s World Heritage list.

Almost the entire length of the Rio Branco between the proposed dam and the river’s confluence with the Rio Negro is composed of conservation units, including “sustainable use” conservation units. This is also the case for the Rio Negro between the Rio Branco confluence and the outskirts of Manaus (Figure 6). All would be impacted.

Roraima does not need the Bem Querer dam. The state’s population is small and it has the best potential for solar energy among the nine states in Brazil’s Legal Amazon Region. The dam does not eliminate the planned transmission line to Manaus, which requires consultation with the Waimri-Atroari Indigenous people whose territory it would traverse. That line is officially justified as a means of transmitting electricity from Manaus to Roraima. Manaus is already electrically connected to the Tucuruí Dam in the state of Pará, from which this city of 2.2 million currently receives power via a transmission line completed in 2013.

Most of the energy that would be generated by Bem Querer is not intended for the people of Roraima, but rather for other parts of Brazil. The electricity would be transmitted to Manaus to allow more of Tucurui’s power to be transmitted to Brazil’s industrial southeast region, or if joined by other planned dams, to transmit power from Bem Querer via Manaus to the rest of Brazil.

A representative of Brazil’s Energy Research Company (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, or EPE), which is a part of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Figure 7), explained this energy transmission scheme at a public event in Boa Vista in July 2018. Since Roraima is in the northern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed in relation to the rest of Brazil. Therefore, the energy generated in Roraima — when there is a lot of rain there — can be transmitted to the south of the equator when water is lacking to use all of the hydroelectric capacity there. This logic is explained in detail on the EPE website.

The EPE representative at the Boa Vista event concluded that Roraima had received a lot of support from the federal government over the years, and so “Now is the time for Roraima to make [a sacrifice] for Brazil.” This viewpoint represents yet another example of the impact of Amazonian dams in terms of environmental justice.

To reach sensible conclusions about major infrastructure projects like the Bem Querer dam, the impacts, benefits and alternatives need to be surveyed and considered before the initial decisions are made. This information needs to be collected and presented without bias and should be disseminated and debated democratically as part of decision making.

Such critically important decisions cannot be made — as it is done today in the licensing process — as a mere formality to legalize a decision already taken.

Amazonian dams have much greater impacts than other energy alternatives such as wind and solar power. Brazil has an extraordinary potential for both of these alternative sources, as confirmed by the country’s recently released 2050 National Energy Plan, but the priority continues to be for building more dams.

Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks - Environmental Finance,https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/market-insight/how-can-we-finance-climate-adaptation-nature-based-solutions-to-the-americas-climate-change-risks.html,"How can we finance climate adaptation? Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks Companies: Scotiabank People: Melissa Menzies

Partnered content

The concepts of 'natural capital' and 'nature-based solutions' are gaining attention in the global capital markets, as public and private sector issuers consider ways to finance projects to enhance their physical asset resiliency to climate change or support reforestation and native species regeneration.

While these forms of sustainable debt are well suited to financing diverse adaptation and resiliency activities, the volume of issuances to date is still low, when considering that just five per cent of the proceeds from green, social or sustainability bond issuances in 2020 went to sustainable land use projects, compared to 85 per cent directed to the categories of energy use/efficiency, green buildings and clean transport1.

Melissa Menzies and the team at Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group are actively introducing clients across the Americas to the potential of these climate adaptation and nature-based financial instruments, to tackle pressing environmental challenges, from destructive flooding in central Canada to deforestation in Chile and Brazil.

The new frontier in sustainable finance

Nature-based solutions are earning profile in the Americas, following early moves by European policy-makers and business leaders, notes Melissa Menzies, Associate Director, Sustainable Finance at Scotiabank: ""There is growing recognition by corporations and governments around the role of nature-based solutions in creating climate resilience and sustainable infrastructure, and preserving the planet's biodiversity.""

She also points out that, ""The market for green financing for resilience and adaptation programs is still maturing, as organizations build an understanding of the opportunities, and begin to align their capital-raising programs with their ESG priorities."" Although global green bond issues reached $1 trillion by 2020, just five per cent of all green bonds issued in the past decade were categorized as 'adaptation,' with their proceeds allocated to adaptation and resilience projects2.

Menzies and the Sustainable Finance group are helping clients understand terms like 'natural capital' and 'ecosystem services,' which have arisen from growing consensus that the world's longstanding focus on 'financial capital' did not adequately account for other important forms of capital. In particular, 'natural capital' includes all the natural resources that humans use to provide a return3. 'Ecosystem services' are the benefits that people obtain from the planet's rich biodiversity4. Although natural capital enables companies to create value, historically these natural elements were undervalued or it was difficult to calculate their financial benefit.

""These topics are attracting much attention, as we witness natural disasters and the deterioration of critical biodiversity and natural capital – from the Amazonian jungle to Canada's boreal forests, which serve as natural 'carbon sinks' that sequester carbon in the ground to reduce GHG emissions,"" explains Menzies. It is estimated that 85 per cent of the world's wetlands have been impacted, 75 per cent of land surface has been altered and millions of hectares of primary forest have been lost5.

And there is growing acceptance that nature-based solutions are an efficient remedy. For example, research shows that improved land management rules through natural climate solutions can deliver 37 per cent of all cost-effective CO² mitigation needed to the year 20306. This means that countries can use products like sustainable land bonds to access inexpensive capital, transition to sustainable, low-carbon land management practices and preserve their resource economies. In fact, sustainable finance instruments can also directly help countries meet their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Turning awareness into action

Awareness of climate and biodiversity risks is prompting many stakeholders to act, including investors like BlackRock Inc., which urged companies to disclose how their business practices are consistent with the sustainable use of natural capital7. And, industry groups are tallying the impacts of climate change, including the Insurance Bureau of Canada (ICB), which determined that severe weather in Canada caused $1.9 billion in insured damage in 20188.

Now there are multi-lateral efforts to incorporate natural capital into economic and political decision-making, and ensure the conditions are in place to help the private and public sectors leverage nature-based solutions. For instance, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), GRI, CDP and Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) are developing a comprehensive corporate reporting framework to ensure that environmental, social and governance metrics are represented in financial statements. Simplified, unified accounting and reporting systems will help organizations satisfy stakeholder demand for transparent ESG disclosure and equip them to design investment programs focused on adaptation and resiliency.

Since the natural question is, ""How will these massive adaptation projects be funded?"", the green bond market – in which bond proceeds are applied to finance or refinance eligible green projects – can help organizations bridge the financing gap. In fact, the Green Bond Principles provide guidelines for the use of proceeds of green bond financing, ranging from sustainable land and resource use to climate change adaptation and development of resilient infrastructure.

Under these guidelines, an array of innovative financial instruments, from green bonds to blue bonds to climate bonds, are coming to fruition. On the grand scale, they include the Netherlands's recent EUR 5.98 billion green bond, which will fund coastal and river ecosystem projects to safeguard the low-lying nation against severe flood risk9 – part of the country's recent Green Bond Framework to become climate-proof and water-resilient by 205010.

On a smaller scale, Central Arkansas Water recently issued a US$31 million municipal green bond, to acquire 4,300 acres of watershed land at risk of development. It is believed to be the first issuance of its kind to buy and protect forests in order to secure clean drinking water, in this case for the small utility firm's 500,000 customers11.

""Such success stories are helping to create greater awareness,"" says Menzies, who notes that sustainable finance debt has more than doubled year-over-year, and it has often resulted in a green pricing benefit for issuers. ""Demand for green assets will only continue to grow, when you consider spiking interest in impact investing, the rise of ESG-integrated asset managers, and net-zero commitments made by a growing number of organizations.""

Sleuthing out green opportunity

Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group is helping clients identify the unfolding opportunities and challenges of green financing. They often advise clients on methods to establish in-depth, corporate ESG reporting and data collection to identify their priority material issues and to build out robust ESG frameworks and governance structures.

Clients often require support steering through the green financing market, since corporate treasury departments may lack in-house resources to focus on unfamiliar considerations in the nuanced sustainable debt sector. For example, since green bond transactions often involve a sizable financial threshold, smaller organizations and municipal or regional governments might turn to green term loans. Or, clients may opt for sustainability-linked instruments, such as sustainability-linked bonds, which enable the issuer to allocate the proceeds of funding across various initiatives for general corporate purposes. They can set material and ambitious targets to the pricing of such instruments tied to achieving nature-based metrics over a set timeframe, such as the number of hectares of forest conserved or the birth-rate of an endangered species.

Menzies guides clients through these multi-faceted issues as part of Scotiabank's dedicated Sustainable Finance group, a team helping the Bank mobilize billions of dollars to reduce the impacts of climate change, support clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and contribute to the global conversation on climate change.

For example, Scotiabank served as joint bookrunner on two of the Province of Ontario's benchmark green bond issues in support of climate adaptation and resilience projects. The proceeds of the province's two green bonds issued in 2019-20, totalling CAD$1.2 billion, will be directed to the Port Lands Flood Protections program. This colossal project will fortify 240 hectares of downtown Toronto land that is at risk of flooding with earthworks/flood protection infrastructure, parks, roads and bridges, naturalized greenspace and wetlands.

In Latin America, Scotiabank also acted as joint bookrunner on significant transactions such as ARAUCO's US$1 billion in sustainability bond issuances in 2019. These issuances will enable the global leader in sustainable forestry to protect native forests and high conservation value areas in Chile. Similarly, the Bank helped Empresas CMPC launch its UF$2.5 million, 10-year green bond in 2019, with proceeds dedicated to restoration of native pine and eucalyptus forests in Chile and Brazil. Scotiabank also supported Klabin's 2019, US$500 million green bond issue to help Brazil's largest paper manufacturer protect vast swaths of forest conservation areas and perform endangered species reintroduction and reproduction at the specialized Klabin Ecological Park.

Menzies is enthusiastic about the impacts of nature-based solutions for the planet's diverse stakeholders – and Scotiabank's ability to bring value to the process: ""Green financing for adaptation and resiliency is an opportunity to connect project developers and investors in sustainable development. There is a lot of room for the Scotiabank's creativity and capability in this area to flourish, and deliver significant, enduring benefits to our clients and communities.""","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.environmental-finance.com/assets/images/mains/78783-main.jpg,"['risks', 'finance', 'adaptation', 'change', 'climate', 'green', 'bond', 'capital', 'naturebased', 'solutions', 'sustainable', 'natural', 'americas']",

In Brazil’s Pantanal, the vegetation compacted under the marshy flood water during the wet season dries out as ponds and lagoons evaporate, leaving flammable deposits underground that can continue to smolder long after visible flames die down.

Firefighters across Brazil are battling raging towers of flames from the Amazon rainforest to the Cerrado savannah, but the fires beneath their feet are a particular challenge in the Pantanal. The only way to combat an underground fires is to dig a trench around it, said state firefighter Lieutenant Isaac Wihby.

“But how do you do that if you have a line of fire that’s 20 kilometers long? It’s not viable,” he said.

The fires here are the worst in 15 years. The flames threaten the region’s biodiversity, rich with tapirs, pumas, capybaras and the world’s most dense population of jaguars.

The Pantanal, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for “swamp,” sprawls over more than 150,000 sq km in Brazil and also extends into Bolivia and Paraguay.

As fires approached emergency workers in the Pantanal this week, they used tractors to cut through desiccated trees and shrubs, leaving a gash of brown dirt meant to rob the flames of fuel and stop their spread.

But strong winds can send the flames over the top, or underground fires can pass below.

“Sometimes it passes under a firebreak and takes the firefighters by surprise,” said Lieutenant Jean Oliveira, who is leading the firefighting efforts.

“Sometimes you control a fire and it’s not really dead, it’s just sleeping,” he said.

Hundreds of firefighters, environmental workers, park rangers and soldiers have worked 24 hours a day for weeks attempting to extinguish flames that have destroyed thousands of square kilometers of the Pantanal.

With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), one fire this week was unstoppable as strong winds pushed it across multiple firebreaks, burning through twisted branches and dry leaves through the day and into the night.

“We controlled it but then it jumped there, jumped there, jumped there,” said Edmilson Rodrigo da Silva, a firefighter for Brazil’s center-west state of Mato Grosso, pointing far into the distance to where the fire had gotten past firebreaks.

The region is a vast flood plain that normally fills with water during the rainy season, roughly from November to March. But the floods were lower than normal this year and a subsequent drought has left the area dangerously susceptible to fire.

The Pantanal so far this month recorded 4,677 “hot spots” in the worst rash of fires since August 2005, according to Brazil’s space research agency, Inpe.

Silva was one of about 20 men battling the fire through the night, bathed in choking smoke and swarmed by gnats flushed out of the undergrowth by flames that encircled the firefighters on three sides. They warned to look out for poisonous snakes and jaguars fleeing the fire in the night.

Rains brought temporary relief to the southern half of the Pantanal last week, but fires again began to pick up this week. Next month could be even worse.

“It’s our worst year here for fires. It’s never been dry like this,” Silva said.","Sat, 29 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200829&t=2&i=1531503658&r=LYNXMPEG7S0F6&w=800,"['worlds', 'worst', 'firefighters', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'jumped', 'largest', 'flames', 'state', 'week', 'burns', 'pantanal', 'brazils', 'underground']",

56,56,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Plan to divert water to Brazil's Belo Monte dam threatens Indigenous peoples and wildlife - The World,https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-04-07/plan-divert-water-brazils-belo-monte-dam-threatens-indigenous-peoples-and,"Norte Energia, operator of the Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River in the eastern Amazon rainforest, has begun diverting about 85% of the river's water to the dam's turbines in order to boost electricity production. Scientists say the resulting drop in water levels will disrupt flood-dependent ecosystems and adversely affect the Indigenous peoples along the river.

Brazil has built more than 200 large hydroelectric dams as a way to produce energy for a growing economy, and Norte Energia's Belo Monte Dam has been one of the most controversial. Aside from its effect on local people and wildlife that rely on the river's natural rise and fall, flooding behind dams can add to climate change by killing trees and other vegetation, which decompose and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

Annual flooding naturally occurs on the Volta Grande (Big Bend) branch of the Xingu River, explains Tiffany Higgins, who reported on the story for Mongabay. The water level rises and the river moves rapidly, up to 25,000 cubic meters per second. The water swells beyond the banks of the river and floods the adjacent forest, where special trees grow that have adapted to being seasonally flooded. Around February, the turtles and the fish catch this river wave and ride it into the flooded forest.

“It's an amazing synchrony, developed over millennia, between the trees that are fruiting and maturing just at this time of year and the fish and turtles who come along."" Tiffany Higgins, Mongabay

“It's an amazing synchrony,” Higgins says, “developed over millennia, between the trees that are fruiting and maturing just at this time of year and the fish and turtles who come along.""

The trees drop their ripening guavas, figs, tucum, cashew fruits, and golosa fruits into the water and then the fish and turtles scoop them up. The fruits give them the essential calories which provide the energy that allows them to reproduce, Higgins explains.

“This is the exact time of year when they're reproducing,” she says. “It’s called the piracema, which is from the Tupi native words. It's something that all the fisherfolk communities are totally oriented to.”

But beginning in February of this year, Norte Energia diverted about 85% of the water that would have flowed into the Volta Grande so they could use it for the Belo Monte Dam. This was written into the original plan back in 2009, as something the company calls Hydrogram B, Higgins says.

At the time, the technical team of IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency of specifically criticized Hydrogram B. Essentially, Hydrogram B indicates that the largest amount of water released to the Volta Grande will be 8,000-cubic-meters-per-second in April, which is always the river’s peak, Higgins explains. About 20,000-cubic meters-per-second is the historical average in April on the Volta Grande.

The company signed an agreement more than a decade ago which said that its license was dependent upon them maintaining life on the Volta Grande. In December 2019, IBAMA's technical team said that Norte Energia had not proven scientifically that their plan could maintain the ecosystem on the Volta Grande and told them to conduct additional studies to prove that it could.

Instead, Higgins says, the president of IBAMA, Eduardo Fortunato Bim, stepped in and made an agreement with the president of Norte Energia that allowed them to implement Hydrogram B.

“The president didn't defend it,” Higgins says. “He simply said, ‘Go ahead, you can implement this Hydrogram B for a whole year.’ But there was no scientific evidence given for it. The experts I talked with, as well as the people on the Volta Grande, say this is a politically motivated decision.”

El Niño of 2016 provided a kind of natural test for what 2021 is going to look like on the Volta Grande, Higgins notes.

The Juruna, a local Indigenous tribe, say fish that year were ""very skinny,” she explains. “They’re supposed to have scales on them, [but] some were smooth. … They would cut them open and see that their eggs were dry or their eggs had been reabsorbed into their bodies. … They saw many turtles who were only bone, they had very little flesh on them. And when they cut the turtles open, they found that where there should be eggs, there was foam instead. The Juruna also noticed a clear change in the taste to acidic, bitter, and they weren't able to eat them.”

In April of 2016, the river flowed at 10,000-cubic-meters-per-second. “But now we're going to have 8,000-cubic-meters-per-second in April in 2021, so we can expect even more disastrous effects on the animals,” Higgins says.

People Higgins spoke with said Norte Energia’s hydrogram violates a wide range of national and international laws.

“Article 231 of the Brazilian Constitution says that hydroelectric dams cannot interfere with Indigenous territories. But this is exactly what's happening."" Tiffany Higgins, Mongabay

“Article 231 of the Brazilian Constitution says that hydroelectric dams cannot interfere with Indigenous territories,” she notes. “But this is exactly what's happening. Other conventions safeguard the fishing stock of Indigenous communities. In essence, you can't remove the food basis of a community.”

Related: How Indigenous land rights could help save the Brazilian Amazon from deforestation

In a video that Higgins filmed as part of her investigation, an Indigenous woman named Bel Juruna says, “This will be a cemetery of trees; this will be a cemetery of fish.” She adds, ""And so we Juruna, we will be here fighting so that we, too, won't become a cemetery in our village.""

“She's being quite literal,” says Higgins. According to a local scientist, Jansen Zuanon, the trees in the forest that are adapted to seasonally flooding will “experience functional death if they are not able to be flooded,” she says.

An ornithologist named Camila Ribas told Higgins that 60% of the birds in the area are adapted only to the flooded forest. “So when the forest dies, these special kinds of birds are going to die off, as well,” Higgins adds. “It'll create a wide patch of deforestation in this forest that will cut off the biological continuity [in] this wildlife corridor between what's called the upper Xingu River and the lower Xingu River.”

When Higgins contacted Norte Energia for her story, the company stated that “there is no technical, scientific proof that the company's hydrogram, i.e. Hydrogram B, will cause any harms to the animals, the fish and turtles of the Volta Grande,” Higgins reports. “In addition, they said, ‘We have robust scientific monitoring.’”

This is “perverse logic,” Higgins says, because Norte Energia is doing the monitoring itself while claiming there’s no proof their actions are going to harm any animals.

The video was posted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) that showed myriad turtle hatchlings whose scientific name is Podocnemis expansa. According to WCS, the turtle babies were emerging from a sandy beach in a protected area along the Purus River, which is a tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil.

The video has garnered over 20.5 k views on Twitter as netizens express their awe. One of the users commented, “A tsunami we all would like to see…,” while others congratulated the WCS conservationists for this awesome scene.

TURTLE TSUNAMI! @TheWCS releases incredible footage of mass hatching of locally endangered turtle: https://t.co/apenzRSzxd pic.twitter.com/KhA1aQsNYc— WCS Newsroom: #EarthStrong (@WCSNewsroom) December 14, 2020

The mass coming out of these turtles took place in the Reserva Biológica do Abufari (Abufari Biological Reserve) where animal conservationists from WCS Brazil have been monitoring adult females. The conservationists have been keeping a track of adult female turtles and their nests before, during, and after the birth of the hatchlings. The study is being conducted to improve the management and protection of this endangered species, which has been impacted by trafficking of their meat and eggs.

According to the WCS Brazil press release, the conservationists say the emergence occurred over several days during which period, around 71,000 hatchlings emerged in a day alone, while another 21,000 and few emerged days later.

WCS Brazil quoted Camila Ferrara, their Aquatic Turtle Specialist, who said that for the endangered giant South America river turtle, birth is an explosion of life as the video suggests quite clearly.

However, Camila also pointed out that it is one of their most fragile times as well. The mass birth is a way of increasing survival and the synchronization of birth allows these species to travel together to the river to start their new life.

The Giant South American river turtle is the largest freshwater turtle in Latin America. It can grow up to three and a half feet that is almost 1.07 meters and they can weigh upto 200 pounds that is 90 kilograms. These species of turtles play a crucial ecological role in nature as they disperse seeds that eventually help regenerate vegetation along river corridors around the Amazon basin.

WCS Brazil leads the project of conservation of these turtles in collaboration with ICMBIO and are sponsored by Fundação o Boticário.

58,58,FL-2017-000067-BRA,‘Out of control’: Brazil’s COVID surge sparks regional fears - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/10/out-of-control-brazils-covid-surge-sparks-regional-fears,"Brazil’s South American neighbours worry a COVID-19 variant will spread quickly and lead to another wave of deaths.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – Almost a year ago to the day, the jungle city of Manaus grabbed international headlines after a flood of COVID-19 deaths forced gravediggers to dig mass burials – catapulting the city into the centre of Brazil’s coronavirus outbreak.

Those scenes are now being repeated throughout Brazil, where authorities are working day and night to bury the dead, with experts warning that the country’s funeral services could be the next to topple.

Since the start of the year, an uncontrollable second wave has pushed Brazil over the 300,000 death mark. As the country continues to hit grim milestones – a record 4,247 deaths on Thursday alone – the entire South American nation is now the global COVID-19 epicentre, with experts warning that 5,000 Brazilians could lose their lives in a single day in April.

Much of the fear is being directed to the P1 variant, linked to the Brazilian Amazon. If Brazil cannot control its high transmission rate, experts fear the country’s healthcare tragedy could endanger the world. If the virus is left to circulate freely, it could create the ideal breeding ground for new and even more deadly variants.

Brazil’s neighbours have sealed off their borders to the country in a desperate attempt to prevent new variants from bleeding into the rest of the continent and harming vaccine efficiency.

“We’re very concerned. The staggering amount of deaths in Brazil in just a few months is our biggest worry,” virologist and researcher Humberto Debat, from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology told Al Jazeera.

Bolsonaro’s catastrophic response

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is increasingly being blamed for undermining the severity of the virus.

Even in the pandemic’s darkest hour, the far-right leader continues to ignore calls from health officials for a national lockdown, attacks the use of masks, ignores science, peddles unproven remedies and told Brazilians this week “there’s no use crying over spilled milk”, referring to Brazil’s soaring death toll.

“Unfortunately, we have a denialist president who refuses to follow science and encourages the public to follow,” said Ethel Maciel, a professor at the Federal University of São Paulo.

No social distancing

Experts have said a lack of social distancing measures has created the ideal environment for variants to mutate.

Since June 2020, Brazil’s infections and deaths marooned at a steady plateau of approximately 1,000 deaths a day, leading many to believe the worst was over. For months, Brazilians commuted on crammed public transport and packed its beaches, bars and nightclubs.

People wait to board a train at Luz station in São Paulo, Brazil, April 6, 2021 [Amanda Perobelli/Reuters] As Brazilians continued to flout containment measures, the P1 variant hatched, believed to have emerged in the Brazilian Amazon at the tail end of 2020. Weeks later, Manaus’ health system had all but collapsed.

According to the Fiocruz research institute, the P1 variant now accounts for more than 80 percent of cases in populous states, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Three months ago, it was 0 percent.

A ticking time bomb

Officials and experts are concerned about the speed with which the P1 variant, which is likely more infectious, is spreading and the damage it could pose globally.

“The virus has become ‘synchronised’ in the whole country, with intensive care units in several states at over 90 percent capacity,” said epidemiologist Daniel Villela from the Fiocruz branch in Rio de Janeiro.

As Brazil’s health system caves in, with intubation drugs and oxygen stocks critically low, Villela also told Al Jazeera that oversaturated hospitals were causing more deaths.

Meanwhile, Brazil’s painfully slow vaccine rollout, the result of disorganisation and a lack of urgency from Bolsonaro is worrying. To date, fewer than 10 percent of Brazil’s 212 million people have been vaccinated.

“The only way out is accelerating our vaccine drive and national coordinated COVID protocols,” explained Villela.

But after Bolsonaro refused to implement a national lockdown on Wednesday, experts fear transmission rates will continue to skyrocket.

Brazil could also spin out new, even more dangerous variants. The more people infected with the virus, the more mutations we’re going to see,” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told Al Jazeera.

Despite promising news on Wednesday of preliminary results from a continuing study finding China’s Sinovac vaccine to be 50 percent effective against the P1 strain, experts have warned that the speed with which the virus is mutating could spell disaster for current vaccine campaigns.

“The 4,000 Brazilian deaths on Tuesday show that the virus is circulating in great quantities, mutating and evolving quickly. It’s trying to find a way to escape natural antibodies,” said Felipe Naveca, a virologist at Fiocruz Amazonas.

“It’s a nuclear reactor that has set off a chain reaction and is out of control,” Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University in the US, told the Reuters news agency this week.

“We desperately need to stop it from spreading in Brazil and other countries with high transmission rates,” Naveca said.

‘How many more lives will we have to lose?’

Brazil’s crisis is now being felt well beyond its borders. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) reported that the P1 variant has been found to be driving the second wave in at least 15 nations in the Americas.

Once championed as Latin America’s COVID poster child, Uruguay is now grappling with an explosive surge in deaths. According to government data, the 121 COVID deaths recorded in April has exceeded last year’s total COVID deaths.

“Uruguay is a good example of how things could get bad quickly,” said the Argentinian virologist Debat, who is monitoring the genome sequences of variants of concern.

A healthcare worker takes a swab sample from a man to be tested for the coronavirus disease in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 6, 2021 [Agustin Marcarian/Reuters] The P1 variant has also been detected in Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia, Peru and Chile, as well as Canada and the United States.

Experts argue that sealing their borders will have little effect now variants of concern have entered.

“It’s too late to keep the P1 out. But it’s also too late to build immunity to the second wave. Only 40 percent of Argentinians over 70 have received their first dose. Still, we’re doing anything to delay it,” Debat explained.

Is now a good time for retail investors to buy emerging market stocks and bonds?

At the height of a pandemic, as growth stutters across the developing world and governments struggle to replicate the success of vaccine rollouts in advanced economies, it may seem odd even to pose such a question. Yet, it seems to be one that many investors are not only asking, but answering with a “yes”.

The number and value of emerging market-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) and similar products — tradeable funds that typically appeal to retail investors — have risen remarkably during the coronavirus crisis.

There were 1,670 such products worldwide at the end of March, according to industry watcher ETFGI, up from 1,447 at the start of last year, while their market capitalisation rose by more than a quarter to $742bn (£528bn) over the same period.

What’s more, retail investors seem attuned to strengths and weaknesses among the emerging markets (EMs), with their eyes drawn less by problem-hit Brazil than by the huge energies of China.

Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-biggest fund supermarket, says China-focused investment trusts and mutual funds feature strikingly among its biggest sellers so far this year — two out of four EM products in the top 40 investment trusts and one in three in the top 40 mutual funds — when there were none in the same period of 2020.

Deborah Fuhr, US-based founder of ETFGI, says many retail investors, with time on their hands during the pandemic, have taken an interest in global investment themes, such as Chinese technology stocks, especially when they are discussed on television. “A lot of men — I don’t think they had a lot of hobbies they did at home,” she says. “Being locked in the house, many of them decided to put some money aside to play with.”

Retail investors are riding on the back of a broader institutional surge into EMs. Data from industry watcher Morningstar shows that investors pumped more than $100bn into EM stocks and bonds in the nine months to the end of March, more than making up for the roughly $44bn they withdrew in the first half of last year as the pandemic took hold.

“What we can say with a high degree of confidence is that investors at large have begun to dedicate more to emerging markets,” says Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s director of global ETF research. Flows into the asset class broadly over the past 12 months amount to “probably the most significant sign of interest we have seen in about a decade”.

But this all comes against a tricky background for emerging economies. On the one hand, their share of global output has surged this century, doubling in dollar terms. On the other, it is still just 40 per cent of the total, even though they are home to more than 80 per cent of the world’s population. And the pandemic is having an uneven impact, wreaking havoc in Brazil, for example, but largely sparing China.

Also, gross domestic product growth does not translate easily into stock market returns. With markets often skewed by government intervention and opaque rules, well-connected local business people tend to do better than regular financial investors. Emerging markets provide about three-quarters of global economic growth, but their equities have lagged behind the S&P 500 index of US stocks for much of the past decade.

Developed world retail investors have barely dipped their toes into emerging markets. Investment trusts, mutual funds and ETFs — the kind of vehicles favoured by small investors — make up a tiny share of the total investment in EM stocks and bonds, and that share has barely budged for a decade. So there is plenty of scope for increasing EM exposure without upsetting the balance of the average portfolio.

With many analysts thinking that the outperformance of US stocks in recent years is looking decidedly frothy, could views now change? Might this be the moment to look again at emerging markets in general?

FT Money takes a look at the pros and cons.

A new story with old roots

There is a long history of investors hunting for profit in undeveloped economies — whether in Latin American railways, South African gold or Indonesian rubber.

The modern story of EMs starts in the 1980s, when fund managers in the UK and other rich countries sought to take advantage of the high returns on offer from fast-growing countries in Latin America, south-east Asia and other parts of the developing world.

The countries classified as emerging markets have changed almost beyond recognition since then. Today’s MSCI EM index of equities in 27 countries — the most widely-followed benchmark — includes some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and the Czech Republic, that have made such progress that few outside the index-driven investment community would regard them as any less developed than industrialised economies.

But while the landscape has changed, the proposition remains the same: emerging markets, as they catch up with countries in the developed world, will grow more quickly, offering greater rates of return on investments. The downside is that such growth, and the returns, can be highly erratic.

The profits were often stellar during the commodities supercycle of the 1990s and 2000s, when Chines demand fuelled growth in raw materials exporters such as Brazil. Since then, some formerly fast-growing economies — not least Brazil — have suffered stagnation and recession, prompting some to ask whether EM investing still makes sense at all.

Still, some states, especially the south-east Asian countries, have learnt to avoid past mistakes. They have generally tamed inflation, managed domestic and external deficits well, and coped better with volatility by reducing reliance on foreign debt and building cash buffers of foreign reserves.

The rise of China

The biggest single transformation has been the seemingly relentless rise of China. Its demand for commodities — of all varieties, agricultural as well as mineral — was such that many emerging economies rode through the global financial crisis of 2008-09 relatively unscathed. Since then, its growth has remained the single most powerful driver in the developing world.

Nevertheless, emerging economies are not immune to shocks. The “taper tantrum” of 2013 reminded investors that EMs are at the mercy of bigger forces. The US Federal Reserve caused waves when it suggested it might soon begin tapering a massive economy-boosting bond-buying programme — indicating that the rock-bottom yields might soon begin to rise. Foreign investors withdrew from EMs en masse, irrespective of how successfully or otherwise policymakers had reformed their economies.

Since then, the highs and lows of EM assets have often been driven by the US dollar. When the dollar is weak and US growth is slow, investors are willing to take more risk. At such times, EMs offer attractive returns.

But when the US dollar strengthens — as it did unexpectedly in 2018, catching many EM investors off-guard — money can flood out. At times like these, even Chinese assets can take a beating.

These forces are at work today. With the US economy rebounding from the pandemic more quickly than many expected, the biggest issue on the minds of professional investors is whether — or rather, when — US inflation and interest rates will rise, spurred by the Biden administration’s huge fiscal stimulus. If US yields suddenly become tempting again, emerging markets could once more see money sucked away to America.

“The US fiscal spend completely dominates the debate,” said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS investment bank and an emerging markets specialist.

But while familiar dangers still lurk so too do the incentives for EM investing. As Jan Dehn, a longtime flag-bearer for EM investing at specialist fund manager Ashmore, pointed out in 2019, emerging economies at that point accounted for 74 per cent of global economic growth and were forecast to contribute 84 per cent by 2023. The pandemic may have slowed the pace of that advance, yet few doubt that, in the long term, EMs are where the growth is.

Yet, gaining a share of the upside from that growth is challenging as the risks are unevenly spread. Contagion between markets is much less than it was. When a crisis blows up in a more volatile market such as Argentina or Turkey, it no longer sweeps across the rest of the asset class. Each emerging market has its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the correlations between them are now lower.

What became of the Brics?

Of the Brics held up as future stars by economist Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs in 2001 — Brazil, Russia, India, China and, a later addition, South Africa — three have lost their shine.

India and China, however, have continued to deliver. Beijing’s huge stimulus during the global financial crisis saved not only its own economy but also those of many other developing countries and, perhaps, even the industrialised world.

Beijing’s focus has changed in recent years, from investment to consumption as the driver of its economy, with a concern for financial stability tempering its enthusiasm for credit-fuelled growth. Investors in EM assets should keep a close watch on policy.

India has also seen strong growth over the past decade. This year, it was able to announce a big increase in public spending to counter the pandemic without scaring investors — a testament to their faith in its growth story, although the ferocious second wave of Covid-19 sweeping the country over the past month has raised questions.

By contrast, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have all seen growth stutter, stagnate or even go into reverse during the past decade.

Nicolaj Sebrell, senior equity analyst at Rowan Dartington, part of the St James’s Place wealth management business, says the gains from a country-by-country strategy are potentially great.

He argues that investors can outperform by avoiding basket cases like Venezuela and Argentina and sticking to states with credible policies, reasonable growth prospects and inexpensively priced markets. He says: “EM is an asset class because we’ve defined it that way. But it’s also just a selection of countries. If you can treat them all as individual markets, that has some real advantages.”

Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, says this is an approach not open to many. Only those unconstrained by liquidity and time — sovereign wealth funds and the very rich — he says, can benefit from country-specific knowledge and sit through the risk-on, risk-off cycles of US monetary policy. “For the rest of us, sadly, index-hugging is the default option.”

Nevertheless, the outlook remains uncertain, with the pandemic increasing the differences between states. It is hard to see how those economies that were foundering before the coronavirus crisis will be any better placed afterwards. But those countries that have managed the pandemic well — notably in east Asia — could be rewarded with new investment.

Funds offer a good way in to emerging markets Most investors taking their first steps into emerging markets will do so through actively managed funds, such as investment trusts and mutual funds, which typically aim to beat the market for a fee. Or they will use passively managed exchange traded funds (ETFs), which aim to replicate a benchmark index, charge no or very low fees, and can be bought and sold like shares. Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at Interactive Investor, says that while emerging markets will benefit from the post-pandemic recovery, and the long-term investment case remains intact, “for most emerging markets, vaccination against Covid-19 remains a story for this year and, probably, next year as well”. It is hard to gauge how significant retail investment is in emerging markets. Data from Morningstar suggests that while total investments in EM stock and bonds are worth two and a half times today what they were a decade ago, the amount represented by investment funds — popular in the retail market — is still small. Mutual funds, open-ended trusts and ETFs made up less than 2.5 per cent of global emerging markets equity at the end of March, the data show, unchanged from 10 years ago. In fixed income funds, the share was slightly less than 1 per cent, also unchanged over the decade. Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, says it is hard to say how much of this comes from retail investors and how much from institutions. He says retail investors are likely to be influenced by home bias more than institutional investors. “Retail investors globally are under allocated not just to emerging markets but to any markets outside their home country . . . It’s a characteristic of human behaviour, and I wouldn’t expect to see a dramatic change in any of our lifetimes.” But a preference for home does not necessarily rule out EM exposure. Unilever in the UK and Yum Brands in the US are old favourites among investors looking for a local play on EMs without the complication of investing overseas. Globalisation has multiplied such opportunities. More than 200 Chinese companies are listed on US exchanges, for example, including internet giants such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Deborah Fuhr of ETF data service ETFGI says one trend driving more retail investment in emerging markets is the rise of so-called robo-advisers. At Wealthfront, for example, a portfolio with a high risk weighting of 8 out of 10 would include a 16 per cent allocation to emerging markets — more aggressive than the median allocation of 6 to 7 per cent among global equity funds. At II, Lipski suggests four funds for retail investors to consider, starting with JPMorgan Emerging Markets Trust, which is conservatively run, with a bias towards domestic consumption. Then there is Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Sustainability Fund, which took account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues long before ESG became a buzzword. Lipski also likes M&G Emerging Markets Bond Fund, for a mix of government and corporate bonds in local and hard currency, and Utilico Emerging Markets Trust, a play on infrastructure opportunities. Michael Arno, a portfolio manager at investment company Brandywine, says that despite the changing nature of emerging markets, the old rules apply. “It’s all about portfolio diversification and making sure you are not taking an exuberant amount of risk, or no more than you can handle,” he says. “But emerging markets are the growing part of the global economy and there are definitely periods when one should be invested.”","Thu, 13 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1a784b36-a7e6-4c20-9aab-e0b6433dccf0.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,"['investment', 'growth', 'funds', 'covid', 'risk', 'investors', 'retail', 'reward', 'emerging', 'global', 'pandemic', 'em', 'markets']",

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

What happens to a rich and unique biome when so much is destroyed?

The unprecedented fires in the wetland have attracted less attention than blazes in Australia, the Western United States and the Amazon, its celebrity sibling to the north. But while the Pantanal is not a global household name, tourists in the know flock there because it is home to exceptionally high concentrations of breathtaking wildlife: Jaguars, tapirs, endangered giant otters and bright blue hyacinth macaws. Like a vast tub, the wetland swells with water during the rainy season and empties out during the dry months. Fittingly, this rhythm has a name that evokes a beating heart: the flood pulse.

The wetland, which is larger than Greece and stretches over parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, also offers unseen gifts to a vast swath of South America by regulating the water cycle upon which life depends. Its countless swamps, lagoons and tributaries purify water and help prevent floods and droughts. They also store untold amounts of carbon, helping to stabilize the climate.

For centuries, ranchers have used fire to clear fields and new land. But this year, drought worsened by climate change turned the wetlands into a tinderbox and the fires raged out of control.

“The extent of fires is staggering,” said Douglas C. Morton, who leads the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and studies fire and food production in South America. “When you wipe out a quarter of a biome, you create all kinds of unprecedented circumstances.”

His analysis showed that at least 22 percent of the Pantanal in Brazil has burned since January, with the worst fires, in August and September, blazing for two months straight.

Naturally occurring fire plays a role in the Pantanal, in addition to the burning by ranchers. The flames are usually contained by the landscape’s mosaic of water. But this year’s drought sucked these natural barriers dry. The fires are far worse than any since satellite records began.

Instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites have experienced periodic failures. · Source: NASA Terra and Aqua satellite data, based on detections with greater than 95 percent confidence levels.

The fires are also worse than any in the memory of the Guató people, an Indigenous group whose ancestors have lived in the Pantanal for thousands of years.

Guató leaders in an Indigenous territory called Baía dos Guató said the fires spread from the ranches that surround their land, and satellite images confirm that the flames swept in from the outside. When fire started closing in on the home of Sandra Guató Silva, a community leader and healer, she fought to save it with the help of her son, grandson and a boat captain with a hose.

For many desperate hours, she said, they threw buckets of river water and sprayed the area around the house and its roof of thatched palm leaves. They succeeded in defending it, but at least 85 percent of her people’s territory burned, according to Instituto Centro de Vida, a nonprofit group that monitors land use in the area. Throughout the Pantanal, almost half of the Indigenous lands burned, an investigative journalism organization called Agência Pública found.

Now Ms. Guató Silva mourns the loss of nature itself. “It makes me sick,” she said. “The birds don’t sing anymore. I no longer hear the song of the Chaco chachalaca bird. Even the jaguar that once scared me is suffering. That hurts me. I suffer from depression because of this. Now there is a hollow silence. I feel as though our freedom has left us, has been taken from us with the nature that we have always protected.”

Now these people of the wetlands, some still coughing after weeks of smoke, are depending on donations of water and food. They fear that once the rains come in October, ash will run into the rivers and kill the fish they rely on for their food and livelihood.

“I couldn’t help but think, our Pantanal is dead,” said Eunice Morais de Amorim, another member of the community. “It is so terrible.”

Scientists are scrambling to determine an estimate of animals killed in the fires. While large mammals and birds have suffered casualties, many were able to run or fly away. It appears that reptiles, amphibians and small mammals have fared the worst. In places like California, small animals often take refuge underground during wildfires. But in the Pantanal, scientists say, fires burn underground too, fueled by dried-out wetland vegetation. One of the hard-hit places was a national park designated as a United Nations World Heritage site.

“I don’t want to be an alarmist,” said José Sabino, a biologist at the Anhanguera-Uniderp University in Brazil who studies the Pantanal, “but in a region where 25 percent has burned, there is a huge loss.”

As the worst flames raged in August and September, biologists, ecotourism guides and other volunteers turned into firefighters, sometimes working 24 hours at a time. Fernando Tortato, a conservation scientist with Panthera, a group that advocates for big cats, visited the Pantanal in early August to install cameras for his research monitoring jaguars and ocelots. But he found the camera sites burned.

“I said to my boss, I need to change my job,” Mr. Tortato said. “I need to be a firefighter.” Instead of returning home to his family, he spent much of the next two months digging fire breaks with a bulldozer in an urgent attempt to protect forested areas.

One day in September, working under an orange sky, he and his team finished a huge semicircular fire break, using a wide river along one side to protect more than 3,000 hectares, he said, a vital refuge for wildlife. But as the men stood there, pleased with their accomplishment, they watched as flaming debris suddenly jumped the river, igniting the area they thought was safe. They raced into boats and tried to douse the spread, but the flames quickly climbed too high.

“That’s the moment that we lost hope, almost,” Mr. Tortato said. “But the next day we woke up and started again.”

Mr. Tortato knows of three injured jaguars, one with third-degree burns on her paws. All were treated by veterinarians. Now, biologists are braced for the next wave of deaths from starvation; first the herbivores, left without vegetation, and then the carnivores, left without the herbivores.

“It’s a cascade effect,” Mr. Tortato said.

Animal rescue volunteers have flocked to the Pantanal, delivering injured animals to pop-up veterinary triage stations and leaving food and water for other animals to find. Larissa Pratta Campos, a veterinary student, has helped treat wild boar, marsh deer, birds, primates and a raccoon-like creature called a coati.

“We are working in the middle of a crisis,” Ms. Pratta Campos said. “I have woken up many times in the middle of the night to tend to animals here.”

Last week, the O Globo newspaper reported that firefighting specialists from Brazil's main environmental protection agency were stymied by bureaucratic procedures, delaying their deployment by four months.

Given the historic scope of the fires, their long-term consequences on the Pantanal are unclear. The ecosystem’s grasslands may recover quickly, followed by its shrublands and swamps over the next few years, said Wolfgang J. Junk, a scientist who specializes in the region. But the forests will require decades or centuries.

Even more critical than the impact of this year’s fires, scientists say, is what they tell us about the underlying health of the wetlands. Like a patient whose high fever signals a dangerous infection, the extent of the wildfires is a symptom of grave threats to the Pantanal, both from inside and out.

More than 90 percent of the Pantanal is privately owned. Ranchers have raised cattle there for hundreds of years, and ecologists emphasize that many do so sustainably. But new farmers are moving in, often with little understanding of how to use fire properly, said Cátia Nunes, a scientist from the Brazilian National Institute for Science and Technology in Wetlands. Moreover, cattle farming in the highlands has put pressure on local farmers to increase the size of their herds, using more land as they do so.

Eduardo Eubank Campos, a fifth-generation rancher, remembers his family using controlled burns to clear the land when he was a boy. He said they stopped after adding an ecotourism lodge to their 7,000 hectare property, which now includes reserves and fields on which they raise about 2,000 head of cattle and horses. This year, thanks to firebreaks, a water tank truck and workers quickly trained to fight fire, they were able to keep the flames at bay. The worst impact was on his ecotourism business, hit first by the coronavirus and then by the wildfires. It brings in three-quarters of his revenue.

Mr. Eubank Campos struggles to understand who would set fires when the land was so dry. “Pantaneiros know this is not the time to do burns,” Mr. Eubank Campos said, using a term for the locals that also conveys a culture built up over centuries ranching in the wetland. “They don’t want to destroy their own land.”

The Brazilian federal police are investigating the fires, some of which appear to have been illegally targeting forests.

Still, when asked about the biggest threat to the Pantanal, Mr. Eubank Campos’s answer highlights the region’s political and cultural fault lines. “I fear those organizations that come here wanting to exploit the issue and eventually ‘close’ the Pantanal, turn it into one big reserve and kick out the Pantaneiros,” he said.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a promise to weaken conservation regulations, is popular in the region.

But Mr. Eubank Campos agrees with ecologists on a major threat to the Pantanal that comes from its borders and beyond.

Because ecosystems are interconnected, the well-being of the wetland is at the mercy of the booming agriculture in the surrounding highlands. The huge fields of soy, other grains and cattle — commodities traded around the world — cause soil erosion that flows into the Pantanal, clogging its rivers so severely that some have become accidental dams, robbing the area downstream of water.

The rampant deforestation and related fires in the neighboring Amazon also create a domino effect, disrupting the rainforest’s “flying rivers” of precipitation that contribute to rainfall to the Pantanal. Damming for hydroelectric power deflects water away, scientists say, and a proposal to channelize the wetland’s main river would make it drain too quickly.

But perhaps the most ominous danger comes from even further afield: climate change. The effects that models have predicted, a much hotter Pantanal alternating between severe drought and extreme rainfall, are already being felt, scientists say. A study published this year found that climate change poses “a critical threat” to the ecosystem, damaging biodiversity and impairing its ability to help regulate water for the continent and carbon for the world. In less than 20 years, it found that the northern Pantanal may turn into a savanna or even an arid zone.

“We are digging our grave,” said Karl-Ludwig Schuchmann, an ecologist with Brazil’s National Institute of Science and Technology in Wetlands and one of the study’s authors.

To save the Pantanal, scientists offer solutions: Reduce climate change immediately. Practice sustainable agriculture in and around the wetland. Pay ranchers to preserve forests and other natural areas on their land. Increase ecotourism. Do not divert the Pantanal’s waters, because its flood pulse is its life.

“Everybody talks about, ‘we have to avoid this and that,’” Dr. Schuchmann said. “But little is done.”","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/12/us/pantanal-brazil-fires-promo-1602539858586/pantanal-brazil-fires-promo-1602539858586-facebookJumbo-v7.jpg,"['amazon', 'worlds', 'water', 'indigenous', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'inferno', 'tropical', 'largest', 'area', 'pantanal', 'guató', 'land']",

According to Brazil’s meteorological agency, INMET, Brazil's extreme rainfall is caused by the location of the country, in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). SACZ describes an area that has monsoonal characteristics, which causes Brazil's summer thunderstorms.

Though the amount of rain that fell on Brazil between Dec. 25 and Jan. 26 was double the historical average.

Between Jan. 23 - 24, the city of Belo Horizonte saw 171 mm of rain. This amount obliterated the standing record set 110 years before.

In the state of Minas Gerais, more than 15,000 people were evacuated from their homes. In the state of Espirito Santo, 10,000 people were evacuated, and in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, 6,000 were evacuated.

Those who were evacuated stayed at makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations.

In Minas Gerais, Brazil's second-most populous state, about 40 municipalities were badly hit.

The aggressive rainfall and flooding led to landslides.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sent in the Brazilian Armed Forces to provide aid in the affected regions.

The floods and landslides killed 70 people.

A.1 Description of the Disaster

Heavy rains affected the Northeast Region of Brazil in June 2017, the main states affected were Alagoas and Pernambuco. These states recorded historical rainfall levels in a 24-hour period. In Alagoas, the Maceió station registered 152.4 mm on 27 May, exceeding the previous record. In Pernambuco, the Joao Pessoa station 129.8 mm on 29 May.

In the state of Alagoas, there were seven days of intense rains. The municipalities belonging to the Metropolitan Region, Maceió, Valle de Paraiba, Valle de Mundau, al Litoral Norte, Grota de Santo, Marechal suffered severe flooding affecting 53,453 people and more than 22 municipalities. Likewise, 29 cities and 47,477 people were affected by heavy rains and related landslides in the state of Pernambuco, mainly affecting their homes, causing internal displacement during the first weeks.

At the close of the operation, the rains had fallen significantly, facilitating response and recovery actions by the municipalities and authorities of both states. In Alagoas, the Army provided care through its field hospitals while health centres affected by the floods were recovering, and the local government authorized the occupation of popular houses in order to demobilize the shelters. Similarly, in Pernambuco families returned to their homes and have progressively recovered with the support of the authorities, self-management and response institutions. government authorized the occupation of popular houses in order to demobilize the shelters.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Reports are emerging of Brazilian health workers forced to intubate patients without the aid of sedatives, after weeks of warnings that hospitals and state governments risked running out of critical medicines.

One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.

“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”

Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.

“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.

The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.

It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.

Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.

“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”

His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.

Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.

He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”

For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains ""a daily concern.″

A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.

The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.

A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.

Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.

“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.

Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.

Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.

The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.12newsnow.com/assets/CCT/images/d403a652-d202-4eb3-9a09-fb5ea16d04ed/d403a652-d202-4eb3-9a09-fb5ea16d04ed_1140x641.jpg,"['patients', 'drug', 'brazil', 'health', 'makes', 'covid', 'states', 'hospitals', 'state', 'outbreak', 'sedatives', 'shortage', 'rio', 'reported', 'intubation', 'brutal', 'days']", 
67,67,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil region swept by floods and record rains faces muddy desolation - Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2020-01-brazil-region-swept-muddy-desolation.html,"A flooded house in the Brazilian town of Sabara, near Belo Horizonte, in January 2020

Elaine Almeida looked at her aunt's ruined house in Sabara, a town in a southeastern region of Brazil where at least 45 people have died in floods that followed record rainfall.

""The water rose more than two meters, she lost everything,"" Almeida said.

She and her aunt tried pushing the door of the house open, but the mud inside was so deep they had to give up.

In Sabara, a town of some 130,000 residents on the edge of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, homes built on the banks of the Rio das Velhas river were completely submerged by mud and water, their roofs either ripped off by the surging current or caved in under the weight of the mud.

The football pitch in front of the aunt's house has completely disappeared under a thick brown layer of mud.

""The water rose very quickly and she couldn't leave by the front door, she had to climb over three walls to escape,"" said Elaine, 36, who is putting her aunt up while she looks for a new place to live.

Elaine's own house was spared the worst because she lives in a hillier part of Sabara.

Like her aunt, 15,000 people had to leave their homes across Minas Gerais, where more than 100 towns have been put on a state of alert.

At least 45 people have been killed in the floods, with the death toll expected to rise still further

Most of those who died in the wake of the violent storms that swept the southeast of Brazil perished in landslides or when their homes collapsed in the floods and unprecedented rains.

The authorities reported 44 dead late Sunday but a 45th fatality was reported Monday and the toll is expected to rise further, with another 18 people still listed as missing.

'Critical situation'

Gilvan Jesus Amorim, 43, only just escaped the worst. ""I didn't managed to save anything except my own life,"" he said, looking crushed.

""There's nothing to salvage, I'll have to throw everything away,"" said Amorim, who has been living for three days with his wife and daughter at a neighbor's house, with no running water or electricity.

""When it started raining, I told my wife we had to sleep upstairs and we took a mattress up there. But a few hours later the water started to rise really fast and we had to leave,"" he said.

His street is strewn with household items all coated in mud: refrigerators, remote controls, mattresses, scattered clothes.

""It's one of the worst floods I've ever seen, the situation is critical,"" said Lucimara Soares, a 42-year-old cleaner.

""Lots of my friends have lost everything, they have nothing left,"" she said.

Firefighters and the Red Cross have launched a campaign to gather donations to help the flood victims.

Most of the buildings that were destroyed had been built without permits and in areas considered to be at risk. The National Meteorological Institute said the rainfall was the heaviest ever recorded in Minas Gerais since records began 110 years ago.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel”.

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing”.

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

71,71,FL-2017-000067-BRA,News Feature: A sea in the Amazon - pnas.org,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2102396118,"Did the Caribbean sweep into the western Amazon millions of years ago, shaping the region’s rich biodiversity?

A tropical shrub called Chrysobalanus icaco pushes up through Brazil’s white sandy beaches. The plant’s leathery oval leaves and tough silver bark give it the distinct appearance of a mangrove species, adapted to a life buffeted by saltwater. Strangely, though, C. icaco also turns up more than a thousand miles inland, in the forests of the western Amazon. “We find fossil mangroves and associated coastal plants in the middle of the Amazon,” says paleoecologist Carina Hoorn, at the University of Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

New evidence, including geophysical modeling, supports the contentious notion that the Caribbean flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene. Image credit: Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), Victor Sacek (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), and Lucy Reading-Ikkanda (artist).

The shrub’s appearance inland with an assemblage of mangrove plants, noted in a 2019 article, is among the latest lines of evidence hinting that the Caribbean Sea flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene, sometime in the last 10 to 20 million years (1). If it did, the region could have been awash in shallow saltwater for hundreds of thousands of years after the flooding. C. icaco and other plants may have spread into Brazil’s interior by dispersing along this sea’s beaches, before the water retreated and forest reclaimed the land (2).

The prevailing view of the western Amazon during the Miocene is one of a massive wetland, twice the size of Texas, furred with rainforest and streaked with lakes and tributaries. Whether this wetland was ever inundated by seawater remains a matter of some debate amongst geologists, paleontologists, ecologists, biogeographers, and researchers of pollen known as palynologists. All of them are united by the desire to answer a much larger question: How did the Amazon become so species-rich? That question, Hoorn says, is the “overarching motive that brings us all together.”

Several recent studies bolster the case that the Caribbean swept inland. A 2017 analysis of rock cores from Colombia and Brazil, for example, revealed changes in sediments as well as uncovering a fossilized shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years (3). If an inland sea did reach the western Amazon, the changing landscape would have shaped patterns of species dispersal and ultimately diversification. Other lines of evidence, including the occurrence of Amazon River dolphins, sharks, stingrays, and manatees, also suggest that the area was once inundated by saltwater (4).

A series of new geophysical models provide some explanation for how the flooding might have occurred, suggesting a combination of global sea level rise, uplift of the Andes Mountains, and changes in plate tectonics and mantle dynamics. All of these factors would have worked in concert to pull down on the Earth’s crust and form a flooded depression in the continent. To find out whether this really happened, geologists will begin the largest sampling project to date, likely this summer, drilling rock cores from three Brazilian sites in search of definitive evidence.

A Lush History No one really knows what the view would have been, standing on a summit of the Andes Mountains about 20 million years ago. From a peak in modern-day Peru, looking north and east, some researchers imagine they’d have seen a glittering inland ocean, “where you could go from Paraguay to Venezuela in a boat,” says palynologist Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, in Panama City, Panama. Still others picture a landscape of freshwater marshes, he says, with “no marine evidence at all.” For his part, Jaramillo envisions multiple intervals during the Miocene when the ocean surged into the western Amazon, creating a continuous inland sea. Saltwater currents would have poured in from the Caribbean in the north, where they mixed with fresh water pouring down from torrential rains. Flooding periods would have been relatively brief, however. For the majority of the epoch, the ocean receded, leaving a freshwater megawetland of interconnected lakes and snaking channels with a narrow neck to the Caribbean in the north. The salinity would have been low, because the wetland was mostly freshwater, but episodically salty, says paleontologist Frank Wesselingh. He’s spent two decades studying the ancient western Amazon and is now part of the Netherlands’ Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. Beneath the water’s surface, Wesselingh imagines a carnival of colorful fish, as well as stingrays, manatees, and dolphins. Even typically bland mud snails may have been striking, Wesselingh says, based on evidence of squiggled lines and shell ornamentation on 19-million-year-old aquatic snail fossils in the area (5). “I’d love to go snorkeling,” he says, “but there were also 14-meter-long caimans and 11-meter-long gharials. There were all kinds of not-so-nice creatures that would be a problem for us.” Such swirling visions of mangroves and salty, brackish water are relatively new for the Amazon. When Hoorn began her PhD fieldwork in 1988, collecting sediment and pollen samples in the Colombian, Peruvian, and Brazilian Amazon, the origins of Amazonian biodiversity were hotly debated. Most biologists at the time focused on the region’s more recent history, just the last 2.6 million years, to explain the evolution of biodiversity there. They thought that forest and savannah expanded and contracted between glacial periods, bounded by stable rivers that flowed along the same paths for millennia. Geologist and ornithologist Jürgen Haffer first proposed that theory in 1969, at a time when most biologists thought new species only arose through geographic isolation (6). Haffer assumed a patchwork of isolated refuges of forest and savannah, each an evolutionary haven (7). His ideas dominated the field through the 1980s. But by the time Hoorn came along, cracks had appeared in Haffer’s theory, and disagreements over his views had become “quite personal,” Hoorn recalls. Ultimately, in the early 1990s, a variety of studies refuted Haffer’s view, including work on pollen which revealed a recent history of continuous forest cover rather than patchy tree stands (8). Without patchy forest, a theory of geographic isolation didn’t hold up. Paleoecologists went back to the drawing board to figure out what had driven Amazonian diversification. Although Hoorn was aware of the debate raging all around her, “I felt like I had nothing to do with it,” she says, because her research focused on the Amazon’s much deeper past than the last 2.6 million years. “I lived happily like that,” she says with a chuckle. But in her fieldwork collecting clay and soil samples around the top of South America, Hoorn discovered evidence of fossilized pollen from mangrove trees. She published a seminal study in 1993 suggesting that the pollen was evidence of a megawetland in western Amazonia during the Miocene, 10 to 20 million years ago, which was subject to coastal influence through several periods of marine flooding (9). Shortly after Hoorn finished her doctorate, she took a break from research. Upon her return to Europe in 1999, she was “very surprised” to find that her thesis had exploded across the Amazonian research community. Whereas Hoorn’s Miocene wetland theory has largely been accepted since 1993, according to palynologist Jaramillo, the marine flooding aspect has remained more controversial—in part because of the difficulty of fieldwork in the Amazon, he says. The forest is so dense that geologists tend to travel by riverboat rather than overland, searching for the relatively few exposed rock faces that poke out from under the thick cover of vegetation. Research teams collect sediment samples from the cliffs along the riverbanks. But the cliffs jut out at odd angles, making it difficult to tell whether two outcropping rock faces are the same age based on stratified rock layers alone. Some show evidence of marine influence. Fossilized mollusks and ostracods stud certain cliffs, and oxygen- and carbon-stable isotope ratios in some samples also point to saltwater flooding (10). But not all riverbank sediments tell the same story, and none is unequivocally marine. Even among those that support marine influence, there are seeming contradictions. In a study Wesselingh published in 2006, for instance, he found fossilized saltwater invertebrates alongside freshwater mollusks in the same rocky outcrop. He concluded that the fossils could be different ages. Or, if they were the same age, the saltwater invertebrates could have evolved an unusual tolerance for freshwater (11). Without limestone deposits or fossilized whale skeletons—the kind of material that plainly shows areas once under oceans in other parts of the world—the debate over the Amazon rages on. The Caribbean may have swept south twice during the Miocene, penetrating a landscape dominated by freshwater lakes, swamps, rivers, and rainforest. Image credit: Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama) and Lucy Reading-Ikkanda (artist).

Shifting Tides Jaramillo himself was skeptical of an Amazonian sea until about three years ago. Fossil-strewn rock cores changed his mind. Stored in the laboratory of Paleoflora in Bucaramanga, Colombia, each core is a cylinder of shale, clay, and sandstone, drilled out of sites in northern Brazil or Southern Colombia. The Brazilian geological survey and a Colombian oil company had collected them in the 1970s, in search of coal and oil. And although the cores were old and in some cases broken or incomplete, they offered the best available window on the past, Jaramillo says. With a hand lens pressed to his eye, Jaramillo scanned each core, inspecting the many different layers of sediment, deposited one on top of the other over millions of years. Some of the layers were unmistakably river mud, with the kinds of fine-grained sediments, sandstones, and mudstones that tend to accumulate in tributaries today. But two of the layers were more typically marine. Organic peat, algae, and fossil fragments hinted at salty estuarine environments. Under a microscope, the fossils included about 20 different species of dinoflagellates found in Miocene marine deposits worldwide. Two larger fossils, a shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, provided further evidence for ocean flooding. Pollen records from the two marine sediment layers suggest that they date to 18 million years ago and 14 million years ago, respectively. “The logical conclusion is the ocean was there,” Jaramillo explains. His 2017 analysis of the cores demonstrated two marine intervals when ocean waters reached the western Amazon, he says, with the incursion likely starting from the Caribbean in the north and flowing south along the foot of the Andes (3). In each case, the water advanced and then retreated over periods as short as half a million years. Jaramillo suspects that a combination of tectonic processes and punctuated global sea level rise flooded a depression in the continent. Geological models published since 2010 suggest such a scenario is possible (12). High-speed video simulations show the uplift of the Andean cordillera over tens of millions of years and, in some cases, the subsequent submersion of western Amazonia. Over a Zoom call from his office at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, geophysicist Victor Sacek screen-shared one such model, which he first developed in 2014. It simulates the surface of South America during the uplift of the Andes, beginning sometime between 30 million and 60 million years ago. The initial model described geological processes at the level of Earth’s crust, such as erosion, sedimentation, and the formation of the Andean Cordillera. In 2019, PhD student Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo updated the model to also approximate processes deep in the Earth, including convection in the mantle below the South American continent. To picture mantle convection, Sacek says, first imagine the western edge of South America colliding with the oceanic Nazca Plate tens of millions of years ago. As the two tectonic plates ground against each other, the lip of South America contracted and thickened into the rising spine of the Andes. Simultaneously, the oceanic Nazca Plate dove under the continent into the softer mantle beneath it. Think of the hard, dense oceanic plate as if it was made of iron, Sacek says, and the mantle as a vat of honey. The heavy iron mass plunging through the honey would create convection that perturbed the liquid’s surface. So, too, did the plate sinking through the mantle, creating a smooth depression in the Earth’s surface far above. When Sacek, Bicudo, and others included these dynamics in their models—published in 2019 and 2020—the simulations put this subsidence right under the western Amazon, forming a huge depression in the continent (13, 14). This hollow could have flooded from the Caribbean, pouring in across an apron-shaped expanse of what is now parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and western Brazil, to form an inland sea between 25 and 17 million years ago. Whether this actually happened is still impossible to say. “With our models we just give scenarios,” Bicudo says. The mantle was certainly in motion beneath the continent at the time, he says. But the size and shape of the depression it created, and whether it ever connected to the ocean, remain unknown. Geodynamicist Nicolas Flament at the University of Wollongong in Australia has also modeled the western Amazon. In one 2015 paper, he combined data on the positions and speed of the tectonic plates and the thickness of the top layer of the mantle, called the lithosphere, to simulate the changing topography of South America attributable to mantle convection over the last 50 million years (15). Flament’s models also predicted a western Amazonian shallow sea during the Miocene. Although he acknowledges that “models are not evidence,” Flament thinks the fact that his tectonic data-based simulations match predictions from the geological record lends further support to marine incursions as plausible—even likely.

Ebb and Flow A sea in the Amazon captures the imagination, but there are still geologists who consider it just that—imaginary. What’s clear in the geological record is that mud, silt, and, in smaller proportion, sand blanketed the region, explains Edgardo Latrubesse, at the Federal University of Goiás in Goiânia, Brazil. The age of those sediments, and how exactly they arrived in the western Amazon, is less clear. Oceans don’t typically transport and deposit sediment into vast inland areas, Latrubesse points out. Rivers, on the other hand, do erode mountains and hills to produce sandy and silty deposits. “To accumulate such a huge amount of sediment, the only way are rivers,” Latrubesse says. Hoorn and Jaramillo, in fact, would agree that although repeated ocean flooding carried some sediments, most did wash in on rivers when the area looked more like a freshwater wetland than a continuous sea. One key point of disagreement: the age of the sediments. Fossil pollen, ostracod, and mollusk assemblages date them to mid-to-late Miocene, which would match the proposed age of the ancient sea. But Latrubesse doesn’t put much stock in pollen-based age estimates; plants, he says, evolve too slowly to provide precise-enough date ranges. And in work published in 2010 analyzing vertebrate fossils from the southwestern Amazon, Latrubesse dated the sediments as far more recent, 6.5 to 9 million years old (16). It makes no sense to debate the existence of an inland sea 20 million years ago, he says, based on evidence from sediments that aren’t even 10 million years old. In other parts of the world, layers of volcanic ash could be used for absolute radiometric dating. But volcanic ash sediments are rare in the western Amazon. Geologists instead rely on comparisons of fossils with the evolutionary record, which is far from an exact science, says palynologist Andrea Kern. She coauthored a 2020 study aiming to resolve the Amazon sediment age debate while working as a postdoc at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Kern and her collaborators analyzed one Brazilian sediment core from a different site in the same collection that Jaramillo used in his 2017 analysis. In previous studies, pollen and ostracod fossils had dated the rock to the middle Miocene, about 14 million years ago. However, Kern’s 2020 study used grains of the mineral zircon buried in the sediments alongside the fossils (17). Zircon can be radiometrically dated, and Kern’s analysis put the rock’s maximum age at about 11.4 million years. Although the cores in both studies came from sites potentially inundated by marine incursions during the Miocene, most of the pollen and ostracod fauna in the sample Kern analyzed indicated swamps and small lakes transitioning to a river-dominated habitat. She acknowledges, however, that it is just one record from a single site. In a 2017 study, Carlos Jaramillo and coauthors analyzed rock cores from Columbia and Brazil (top) consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years. Evidence included this marine mantis shrimp (bottom). Image credit: Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama).

Drilling Down “I love this stuff, but it’s so complicated,” says evolutionary biologist John Bates, speaking from the Field Museum in Chicago, IL, where he curates birds. Although geology isn’t his specialty, Bates is keenly interested in the geologic history of the western Amazon. “I want to know what the ramifications were for biology,” he says. An inland sea could help explain how a region that contains a tenth of the world’s known species became such a trove of life. Take, for instance, the sand-colored nighthawk. The bird is only found in the western Amazon, where it nests on sandbanks. There’s no clear behavioral or ecological reason why nighthawks should be tied to creeks and rivers, Bates says. Yet they are, as are scarlet-crowned barbets and a wealth of other birds, endemic to the same waterways. A massive Miocene lake or sea could offer some evolutionary explanation for the birds’ association with a shoreline niche, Bates says. He coauthored a 2018 study comparing the phylogenetic relatedness and geographic distributions of 1,783 passerine species across 19 families of neotropical birds (18). Bates found that bird lineages in the western Amazon are younger and more related, on average, than lineages in surrounding areas. That means the western Amazon has its own evolutionary history, separate from the rest of the continent, he says. A huge body of water would have been such a starkly different habitat from surrounding forests that it could have spurred a unique evolutionary signature among species there. If sand-colored nighthawks evolved around an ancient sea or delta, it may explain why they still live near water today. Plant species, too, could have been affected by marine incursions. Although the Amazonian flora was diverse millions of years before the Miocene, Hoorn notes that saltwater flooding could certainly have altered regional plant biodiversity. Not only would seawater change the chemical composition and fertility of the soil, shaping which plants grew where, but coastal species brought inland by marine incursions could also have been isolated and adapted into new groups. If a seaway enabled new plants and animals to radiate into the west, it could be an overlooked mechanism driving the region’s species richness. Geologists agree that resolving exactly what the Miocene landscape looked like will require better rock samples. The oil and coal industries did not collect cores with multidisciplinary studies in mind; some are contaminated and so can’t be thoroughly analyzed by researchers. They’re also proprietary and only available to a small subset of the scientific community. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America. It’s just all of the details are difficult.” —Christine Bacon Paul Baker, a geologist at Duke University in Durham, NC, will colead the effort, likely starting in June or July, to collect and analyze what researchers believe will be the best sediment samples ever taken from the Amazon. Called the Trans-Amazon Drilling Project, and funded by the National Science Foundation, International Ocean Discovery Program, the São Paulo Research Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution, the plan includes roughly 50 scientific collaborators from a range of disciplines, including Hoorn and Jaramillo. They will drill 2,000-meter-long sediment cores from three Brazilian sites running east-to-west across the Amazon Basin, following the Amazon River, with the goal of capturing a snapshot of the entire Cenozoic Era, from 66 million years ago to the present (19). Painstakingly collected and carefully stored, these freshly drilled cores will capture even millimeter-scale changes in the sediment layers that could hold evidence of ocean incursion. Continuous rock will give geologists their best shot yet at comprehensively assessing every layer of Miocene sediment for marine evidence. And dating zircon grains in the rock cores will give the most definitive time frame for the sediment to date, based on “by far the best material that’s ever been looked at,” Baker says. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America,” says evolutionary biologist Christine Bacon, co-first author of the 2019 study on C. icaco and other plants’ unusual inland distributions. “It’s just all of the details are difficult,” she says, on the phone from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If there is unequivocal marine evidence, it should turn up in the new cores. “Without continuous rock,” Jaramillo says, “the discussions could go forever.” And that might mean never knowing whether the view from the Andes 20 million years ago included a vast, shimmering inland sea.","Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2102396118/F1.large.jpg,"['amazon', 'sea', 'miocene', 'sediment', 'western', 'million', 'marine', 'evidence', 'jaramillo', 'feature', 'inland']",

Critics say that in the Amazon and in the Pantanal, land-grabbers and ranchers have interpreted President Jair Bolsonaro’s vocal contempt for conservation as carte blanche to clear more land, and that environmental agencies, held back by budget cuts and a pandemic, have little recourse to stop them.

Just last week, Brazil’s Environment Ministry said it would halt all its efforts to stop deforestation in the Amazon, citing lack of funds, before dramatically reversing the decision hours later.

Vinicius Silgueiro, a forest engineer at ICV, said that it was clear as early as the end of 2019, from low rainfall and rainy season flood levels, that the Pantanal would be exceptionally vulnerable to fire this year. It ought to have been possible to plan more effectively for the disaster, he added, but the current administration lacked the political will to do so.

Silgueiro added that the tools existed to bring to justice those responsible for environmental destruction, but they were simply not being used.

“ICV studies show that in recent years, more than half of all the deforestation and fires in Mato Grosso states occur on properties registered with the CAR,” Silgueiro said, referring to the rural property registry. “This means that the federal and state governments have all the data on the owners of these areas, and accountability is possible.”

The coronavirus pandemic has also aggravated the situation, said Garcia, as indigenous firefighters – who make up a third of the Mato Grosso do Sul fire brigade – had to isolate within their territories.

Connected ecosystems

Heavy downpours have flooded parts of Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, including the neighbourhoods of Botafogo and Jardim Botanico.

The month of April delivers 95mm of rain on average, but in nine hours on Monday night, 246mm of rain fell.

This report came from Copacabana Fort, south of Botafogo and on the peninsula separating the famous beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema. This was the first report of rain this month and, if confirmed, it will mark the highest 24-hour rain total ever recorded in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

The former capital of Brazil can expect rain every month of the year but the “rainy season” lasts from December to March.

As the sun goes north to bring summer to the northern hemisphere, the heaviest rain follows it. The heaviest rain is typically north of Rio. Civil defence officials say heavy rains in northeastern Brazil have killed at least three people and displaced 3,600.

In the state of Piaui, the capital of Teresina, received 77mm of rain in a single night, flooding a neighbourhood and killing three people.

In neighbouring Ceara state, meteorologists have recorded 162.3mm of rain in the city of Granja so far this month. That has caused the Coreau River to flood.

In a year when millions were forced to flee their homes due to climate-fueled natural disasters, the Philippines and Bangladesh were among the most affected countries in 2020, according to a report published Thursday by a group that monitors internal displacements of people worldwide.

More than 40 million people around the world were displaced last year within their nations’ borders by natural disasters or conflict despite many governments imposing lockdowns or movement restrictions due to a global pandemic, the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reported.

“Weather-related events were responsible for 98 percent of all disaster displacement recorded in 2020,” the group said in its annual Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID).

“Most disaster displacements were the result of tropical storms and floods in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. China, the Philippines and Bangladesh each recorded more than four million new displacements, many of them pre-emptive evacuations.”

And, according to a report published earlier this week by Forest Trends, a Washington-based conservation NGO, Southeast Asia suffers terribly from the effects of climate change, with Indonesia and Malaysia contributing to climate erosion.

Between 2013 and 2019, Indonesia, the region’s largest country and a top producer of palm oil, was responsible for 20 percent of the world’s illegal razing of tropical forests through agricultural clear-cutting fires that increased carbon emissions in the region, the study by Forest Trends said.

Tropical cyclones, typhoons, monsoon rains and floods hit highly exposed areas that are home to millions of people in South and Southeast, according to the report by IDMC.

“It’s shocking that someone was forced to flee their home inside their own country every single second last year,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which IDMC is a part of.

IDMC’s “Grid 2021” report tracked displacement from extreme climate events as well as war and conflict.

The year “2020 was, for many of us, a year of lockdowns and travel restrictions but not so for the millions who fled for their lives because of conflict, violence and disasters,” Egeland said.

“[W]e have documented that, 40 million times [last year], a man, a woman, or a child have been forced out of their homes because of disaster or conflict. It’s the worst figures in a decade.”

As the United States Geological Survey noted, climate change plays a role in exacerbating disasters.

“With increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop,” the U.S. government agency said.

“More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms.”

Typhoon Vongfong, also known as Ambo, the first tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2020, caused more than 298,000 displacements, mostly in the form of pre-emptive evacuations.

Later that year, Typhoons Goni and Vamco cause more than 3 million displacements in the Philippines and Vietnam in October and November, according to IDMC.

‘Proactive measures that build resilience’

Elsewhere, South Asia accounted for almost a third of the world’s new disaster displacements in 2020.

Around 9.2 million displacements were recorded in the region, which IDMC said was an above-average figure for the second year in a row.

A big contributor was Cyclone Amphan, which triggered nearly 2.5 million displacements in Bangladesh alone, of a total 5 million in the region.

“It damaged and destroyed homes and other infrastructure and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless,” IDMC said.

“The damage it did to embankments led to the flooding of homes, farms and fields that have been underwater ever since,” IDMC said.

Powerful storms and cyclones have become more frequent in South Asia due to warmer temperatures in the Indian Ocean. When combined with rising sea levels, the phenomena cause even more devastating storm surges that flood larger and larger areas, IDMC said, adding that Cyclone Amphan illustrated the problem.

“The need for more inclusive and proactive measures that build the resilience of those regularly exposed to similar hazards is also clear,” IDMC said.

Lush forests turned into palm-oil plantations

In Southeast Asia, palm oil, soy and cattle products drive global figures of illegal deforestation, according to the report by Forest Trends.

Most of the forest clearing took place in in Brazil and Indonesia during 2013-2019, the years the report studied.

Southeast Asia has 80 percent of the world’s palm oil plantations, and many of Indonesia’s and Malaysia’s palm oil, paper, and pulp plantations are built on illegally razed tropical forests, the NGO said.

“The criminal destruction of rainforests for commodities such as beef, chocolate, soy and palm oil knocks down 4.5 million hectares and releases 2.7 gigatons of emissions a year,” said a press release which accompanied the report by Forest Trends, titled “Illicit Harvest, Complicit Goods: The State of Illegal Deforestation for Agriculture.”

Palm oil is the biggest forest risk commodity in Asia-Pacific, said the study, and Indonesia led other Southeast Asian nations in forest-clearing, the report said.

“The global average proportion of illegality for palm oil (59 percent) is constrained by low data availability in Malaysia. …These [forest] losses have been tied to billions of dollars in economic losses, such as those resulting from the El Niño drought-linked forest fires that created massive haze events.”

In Indonesia, companies and farmers clear land by burning their vegetation. The fires often spread to protected forestlands. And the resulting giant blazes emit greenhouse gases and cause a heavy haze that crosses national boundaries and engulfs other Southeast Asian countries.

While the findings of Forest Trends seem dire, there is hope, as Indonesia has successfully reduced its deforestation every year since a peak in 2016, the report said.

Indonesia’s deforestation rate hit a historic low in 2020, according to the country’s Environment and Forestry Ministry.

The government attributed the reduction to policies such as a moratorium on licenses for new palm oil plantations, and a ban on clearing primary forests and peatlands.

But other experts have noted that drop was likely due to more rains, falling oil palm prices, and an economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thu, 20 May 2021 21:35:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/climate-disasters-05202021173444.html/@@images/image,"['internally', 'indonesia', 'bangladesh', 'oil', 'palm', 'displaced', 'forest', '2020', 'million', 'philippines', 'idmc', 'climate', 'asia', 'disasters', 'study', 'displacements', '8m', 'report', 'according']",

You can hear the frustration in the nurse’s voice as he narrates the video, walking closer to an open window.

“You have to be an engineer to make this work,” he says. “You have to be like MacGyver.”

The video moves past a woman on oxygen, the tube running down from her nose to the gurney she’s sitting on and, eventually, out that open window.

It runs to another window, the green tube swinging in the breeze above an open courtyard a half-dozen stories below. The tube ends at an oxygen hookup in the wall of the other room.

This is the only way that woman, a Covid-19 patient at this hospital in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia, can get oxygen. The room where the oxygen source is located is so overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, she has to sit in what is otherwise a hallway, her life-saving oxygen precariously fed to her.

The scene is a microcosm of what is playing out across Brazil right now amid a brutal and out-of-control wave of Covid-19.

On Thursday night, Brazil’s Health Ministry reported the gruesome figure of more than 100,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed in a single day, the country’s highest such figure since the pandemic began.

So far, a total of 303,462 people have died in the country from the virus, according to official data.

But it’s the seven-day averages that paint an even bleaker picture.

At 15,963 deaths from March 19-25 and 14,610 deaths in the previous week, those are the highest such numbers of the pandemic so far and they are trending in the wrong direction.

Brazil has recorded roughly 24% of all coronavirus deaths worldwide over the past two weeks, according to JHU data.

A Covid-19 variant, P1, continues to rip through the country as experts agree it is more contagious and potentially produces more severe illness than previous strains. Even younger people are not spared.

Of Brazil’s 26 states plus its federal district, only one or two on any given day have ICU occupancy rates below 80%.

More than half are above 90%, which means if the healthcare systems haven’t yet collapsed already in those states, they are at imminent risk of doing so.

Health systems have been inundated with patients they can no longer adequately take care of due to a critical lack of space and supplies.

As Brazil suffers through its worst days of this pandemic so far, there are signs of collapse at every level of the healthcare system in nearly every state across the country.

Signs of collapse

First responders, hospital personnel and even cemetery employees have told CNN they’ve been brought to their knees by this latest wave.

“It’s a war scenario,” said paramedic Luis Eduardo Pimentel in São Paulo. “I can barely describe what I’m seeing, it is so sad what is happening to the country.”

He described non-stop Covid-19 calls, unnecessary deaths, and hospitals so overburdened, they take supplies from wherever they can.

CNN spoke to him after his shift ended, earlier than expected, after a hospital took the gurney he had brought his Covid-19 patient in on — the hospital had run out of beds.

Other examples are myriad.

In a video given to CNN last week, 12 ambulances with patients inside are seen waiting outside a São Paulo hospital for bedspace to open up inside.

CNN visited a Covid-19-designated hospital on Thursday that had stopped accepting patients because they had run out of room. In a section normally reserved for 16 semi-intensive care patients, nearly double that amount were being treated.

Several had already been intubated and would normally have sent to an ICU, but no such space existed in the hospital.

When ICU rates hit 90%, as they did in Sao Paulo on Thursday, they’re effectively full, said Geraldo Reple Sobrinho, the state’s President of the Council of Municipal Health Secretaries. “In reality, that means total bed occupancy because every time there is a patient who is discharged or dies, you need time to clean this bed and change the equipment. It takes four, five hours.”

In the meantime, more and more patients keep dying. On several recent days, there have been so many deaths that burials in São Paulo cemeteries are happening every few minutes.

Crematoriums have not been able to keep up. In a video shared with CNN, at least two dozen coffins can be seen waiting to be cremated — the demand is about three times what the facility can handle in a single day.

The government response … or lack of it

As his country has reeled during this latest outbreak, President Jair Bolsonaro has yet to take any significant steps to try and implement a coordinated national response.

He did deliver a televised address to the country on Tuesday night, saying 2021 would be the “year of the vaccine.”

But critics derided the 3-minute speech as a half-hearted attempt at a public-relations rescue on a day where Brazil set its own record for most coronavirus deaths recorded in a single day.

The federal government appeared to commit another own goal the following day, with the Health Ministry announcing that it would require more information from municipalities reporting Covid-19 victim information.

That sparked immediate concern that the additional requirements would lower the number of Covid-19 deaths that were reported.

Those concerns appeared to be immediately justified as Wednesday’s reported death toll was nearly 1,200 fewer than the previous day.

By the end of the day Wednesday, the Health Ministry suspended the new reporting requirements after severe backlash from states and the public.

Absent a coordinated federal response, any restrictions put in place designed to stem the spread of the virus have been left to individual states.

Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais are among the states that have implemented nightly curfews, even as the Bolsonaro administration filed suit in Brazil’s Supreme Court declaring that only the federal government has the right to impose such restrictions.

The court this week sided with the states, however, calling Bolsonaro’s argument “totalitarian.”","Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['paulo', 'collapse', 'covid', 'little', 'response', 'são', 'patients', 'brazil', 'spirals', 'control', 'video', 'hospital', 'bolsonaro', 'states', 'signs', 'day', 'oxygen', 'covid19', 'deaths']",

Severe river floods are escalating in temperate climates and putting at risk populations, livelihoods and property, according to evidence published today in Geophysical Research Letters by an Oxford-led international team.

The first global examination of recent changes in the size, frequency, and probability of extreme river floods using historical river records, the paper shows that dangers of extreme river flooding demand close monitoring of rivers for decades to come, to understand and account for the potential impact of such changes.

Dr. Louise Slater, the main author and Oxford expert in flood risks, warns, ""Our work shows the magnitude and frequency of floods are changing substantially in different climates of the globe. Flood maps need to be regularly updated to keep up with these changes and protect people and their livelihoods.""

She maintains, ""These changes cannot be ignored. We need to keep monitoring our rivers because long-term records are necessary to understand and communicate how major floods are changing relative to the past.""'

Using historic recorded magnitudes of river flow, the team found that overall, floods have mostly decreased at the global scale. In arid, tropical, polar, and cold climate zones, 20-year floods decreased between −33% and −12% on average since the 1970s. This was most visible in regions such as north eastern Brazil, eastern Europe, parts of western US and parts of northern China.

The team suggests these decreases may be caused by a range of factors such as flood control measures, climate changes and decreasing soil moisture, where drier antecedent conditions offset flood magnitudes (due to increasing temperatures, decreasing rainfall, or groundwater depletion).

By contrast, the size of 20-year river floods increased by 22% on average since the 1970s in temperate climate zones such as Atlantic-facing Europe, south eastern Brazil, and south eastern China. According to the team, it is likely some of these increases result from climate change and variability, but no direct link was drawn within the research paper.

In temperate countries, it is not just the size of major river floods that is increasing. The paper shows that major floods have also been occurring more frequently, which is why it is essential to maintain up-to-date flood risk mapping.

That decision reversed an earlier ruling to maintain much higher Xingu River flows and the fishery — as legally required.

The flow reduction will leave 70% of usually-flooded forest dry this season, causing massive fish mortality and diminished reproduction, experts say. Community group Xingu Vivo Para Sempre denounced the decision as “a death sentence for the Xingu” and demanded IBAMA’s and Norte Energia’s presidents be “criminally prosecuted.”

Norte Energia has funded projects to mitigate the reduced flow, collecting and dropping fruit into the river for fish to feed on, and releasing captive-bred fish. But scientists say these approaches are unscientific and will likely be ineffective, and can’t make up for the loss of the river’s seasonal flood pulse, upon which fish depend.

Residents say the government has spread misinformation, telling Brazilian consumers that their electricity bills would go up if Belo Monte released more water to maintain the Xingu’s ecosystem — something Norte Energia is obligated to do. At present, water levels on the Volta Grande have not been restored.

Bel Juruna, of the Juruna (Yudjá) Indigenous people, points her camera at the Xingu River, beside which she lives in Mïratu village in the Paciçamba Indigenous Territory on the 130-kilometer (81-mile) Volta Grande (Big Bend), in Pará state, Brazil.

The video shows a shoulder-high, light-colored waterline streaking a dark exposed boulder. Just days before, that boulder was mostly submerged and the river ran at a much higher level, but its flow has been drastically, suddenly, intentionally, and possibly illegally, reduced — threatening the Xingu’s fishery and the people who depend on it for food and livelihoods.

On February 8, Belo Monte mega-dam operator Norte Energia received permission from IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency, to immediately reduce river flows to less than 13% of normal — shifting the water to the dam’s electricity-producing turbines. This dramatic flow reduction was completely unanticipated by riverine Indigenous and traditional peoples, Bel’s video shows the effects: canoes with outboard motors stranded on dry rocks, aquatic vegetation exposed to the air.

“These plants are usually on the bottom [of the river]; they are water plants. And because the water won’t come [here] any more, they’re all going to die,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s action comes during the piracema, a time of year when fish should be traveling on seasonally rising waters, deep into the flooded forest to feed and spawn. The government’s water reduction decision effectively closes the door on this reproductive window — an opportunity that comes but once a year.

“The Volta Grande will turn into a cemetery. A cemetery of fish, a cemetery of dead trees,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B permitted

In the second week of February, Norte Energia diverted more than 85% of the Xingu’s normal flow away from the Volta Grande, where thousands of Indigenous and traditional fisherfolk live. The company’s diversion to the Belo Monte dam reduced river flow abruptly from early-February speeds of 10,900 cubic meters per second (m3/s) to 1,600 m3/s. (The historical average flows before the dam was built were 12,736 m3/s.)

On February 8, IBAMA president Eduardo Fortunato Bim signed an agreement allowing Norte Energia to implement the company’s so-called Hydrogram B, an artificial hydrological regime that will remove 73% of normal annual Xingu River flows from the Volta Grande.

The socio-environmental consequences, say experts, will be catastrophic. Hydrogram B “will cause the end of the cyclical, ecological phenomenon of the [annual] flood pulse, which guarantees fishes’ and turtles’ access to their feeding areas. There will be high amounts of mortality and, in those [aquatic animals] who survive, loss of nutritional condition,” Juarez Pezzuti from the Federal University of Pará wrote in an email to Mongabay,

Turtles, of “extremely high cultural significance” to the Juruna and other riverine people, “will no longer be able to accumulate the energy necessary to produce eggs. The number of times they lay eggs and the number of eggs per nest will be drastically reduced.”

In a note to Mongabay on Hydrogram B’s effects, Norte Energia states, “There is no technical-scientific proof, nor any indications at present, that the flow [regime] practiced by Belo Monte can cause mortality of fish or turtles,” citing “robust monitoring.” Independent scientists allege Norte Energia’s monitoring studies are flawed.

Lorena Curuaia, a leader of the Curuaia people, of Iawá village, sent Mongabay audio commenting on IBAMA’s decision: “This is absurd. Once again, we see the fauna, the flora, totally threatened, especially all the biodiversity. We know that the normal flow of water on the Volta Grande and the whole Xingu Basin doesn’t work that way.

“So they are assaulting nature again. To do what?,” she asks. “To generate energy, to generate financial gain for them, unfortunately leaving biodiversity to the wayside? We are indignant.”

The leader demands, “We want a response from IBAMA itself, saying why they accepted this from Belo Monte.” IBAMA did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Norte Energia’s studies on Hydrogram B rejected as faulty

In 2009, IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s extreme low flow Hydrogram B proposal as being unable to maintain life on the Volta Grande, something the Belo Monte dam operator is legally mandated to do. In December 2019, IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to study alternative hydrological regimes.

But when IBAMA reviewed the new studies, submitted in December 2020, they found that Norte Energia had only presented an analysis of Hydrogram B versus the historical natural flow, and had offered no alternative flow plans. This limited comparison made it impossible for experts to analyze alternative hydrological regimes, says Pezzuti. Agreeing with that assessment is Camila Ribas of the National Institute for Amazon Research and the American Museum of Natural History, after she had access to the studies.

Consequently, on February 2, 2021 IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s studies as “faulty” and incomplete.

What should have happened next, says Ribas, is Norte Energia should have had to redo its studies, addressing IBAMA’s critiques, and then resubmit. Until then, IBAMA’s “provisional hydrogram,” with higher river flows — in place since April 2019 — should have continued.

Political pressure on IBAMA and misinformation

But IBAMA allegedly received intense pressure from other ministries within the Jair Bolsonaro administration, lobbying it to reverse its expected upcoming decision to maintain provisional hydrogram water releases to the Volta Grande. For two months, IBAMA had signaled that Norte Energia would have to return significant amounts of water to the river to prevent further ecosystem harm.

Meanwhile, Ribas recalls that the Mines and Energy department and the electricity agency ANEEL “leaked supposedly internal documents” to the press, claiming that if IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to divert less water from the Volta Grande, then Brazilian consumers’ electricity bills would jump dramatically in cost.

That claim, according to Ribas and Pezzuti, is false.

According to Pezzuti, “The company claimed [Belo Monte’s] non-production of energy would make it necessary to produce energy by activating thermoelectric plants” to make up an energy shortfall, which would supposedly greatly raise costs. But, he says, Norte Energia had presented outdated data on Brazil’s hydroelectric reserves, giving a false picture of Brazil’s current hydroelectric energy potential.

In fact, in the current rainy season, Amazon hydroelectric reservoirs are full. “The majority of hydroelectric plants [in Brazil] have a good level and flows, and so less energy [coming from] Belo Monte won’t generate the [electricity] deficit that’s being threatened by the press and the government,” says Pezzuti. Norte Energia did not respond to Mongabay’s question on this matter.

Political interference and an environmental crime?

Apparently, IBAMA president Bim contradicted his own technical team’s conclusions to strike the February 8 agreement with Norte Energia’s president, Paulo Roberto Pinto, allowing the company to immediately implement Hydrogram B.

Bim is thought to have circumvented IBAMA organizational procedures and overruled his own director of licensing Jônatas Souza da Trindade, who should have made the decision, notes Pezzuti. In a note to Mongabay, Licensing General Coordinator Régis Fontana Pinto stated, “The decisions pertinent to the application of the Belo Monte [dam] hydrogram are taken in the purview of IBAMA’s president, though supplied with information by the technical team, by me as General Coordinator, and by the Environmental Licensing director.”

This agreement directly violates Article 231 of Brazil’s 1988 constitution, Pezzuti says, which states that hydroelectric plants can’t impact Indigenous lands. It also appears to violate international conventions such as ILO 169, ratified in Brazil as Decree 5,051, which protects traditional activities such as fishing as essential for cultural preservation. Further infringed regulations may include Law 11,346 ensuring Nutritional and Food Security, Law 9,985 protecting “the natural resources necessary for traditional populations’ subsistence,” and Decree 6,040 guaranteeing “traditional peoples’ access to natural resources for their physical, economic, and cultural reproduction.”

Concerning projected losses to the diets of Amazon fisherfolk, Lorena Curuaia told Mongabay, “No company has the right to take away another’s dietary sustenance. The fisher people’s culture is fish. To remove their food, is to remove their life.”

On February 18, dozens of fisherfolk organizations, all members of the Xingu Vivo Para Sempre association, formally demanded Eduardo Fortunato Bim and Paulo Roberto Pinto be “criminally prosecuted” for environmental damages resulting from IBAMA’s decision.

“In my understanding, if the president of the environmental organ takes a decision that contradicts the technical position of the institution itself, he is failing in his duty. He is committing a crime in failing to act in accordance with his function, which is to protect the environment,” Pezzuti states.

In a note to Mongabay, Norte Energia states, “There is no crime practiced — since there do not exist any environmental damages, but rather impacts [already] predicted” in the environmental licensing stage. In 2020, federal judges and IBAMA’s team documented that impacts of the dam, characterized by IBAMA as “grave and irreversible,” were greater than projected during licensing.

Norte Energia offers mitigation plans

In its February 8 IBAMA agreement, Norte Energia also committed $R 157 million (US$ 28 million) to river flow mitigation plans. Three projects were approved: to send teams to collect fruit and leaves from the forests that should have been flooded, then throw these into the reduced area of the river where fish are trapped; to build floating platforms with bushes for fish to feed from; and to breed fish in captivity and then release them into the Xingu.

Pezzuti rejects the plan as scientifically unproven: “It’s an absurd pseudo-project, impossible to be executed on a scale that compensates for the [absence of] flooding of tens of thousands of hectares.” He notes, “The first two [projects] aren’t based on any kind of precedent,” and the raising of fish in captivity in the hopes of repopulating the river “already has proven to be ineffective in several studies.”

Alexander Lees, of England’s Manchester Metropolitan University, concurs that these are unworkable solutions, “a waste of money” better spent on maintaining the ecosystem.

“Messing around with chucking fruit into rivers or floating trees is just throwing money away,” says Lees. “It just looks like good publicity,”

Bel Juruna says Norte Energia’s present efforts are ineffectual. “There are lots of companies [contracted by Norte Energia] here that go around, visit, hold meetings, but despite that, there aren’t any projects from the [original] Basic Environmental Plan that are working here.”

Pezzuti explains that Norte Energia’s fisheries mitigation plan was “signed off on by professors employed by public research universities, contributing to this scientific makeup, as if there were a solution for the tragedy that Hydrogram [B] will cause.” However, he adds, independent researchers, not paid by Norte Energia, “experts in fish ecology and aquatic turtles… vehemently protested… this bizarre proposal,” as did “IBAMA’s analysts, who rejected it” on February 2.

Ribas adds, “The research Norte Energia and its consultants do is already directed toward a certain end goal.” She believes that the company-contracted researchers’ finding that Hydrogram B is viable resulted from a conflict of interest which, she says, might explain why the firm’s experts didn’t present analysis of alternatives. “That’s not science,” she says, but Ribas is concerned the Brazilian public will accept the flawed research as valid.

What’s needed, she concludes, is independent monitoring. Ribas and her fellow scientists are seeking funding to monitor the effects of Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B on the Volta Grande in 2021.

As for the Juruna people, Bel Juruna says they will endure: “We will be here. We want to resist in this place, fighting so that we, too, won’t turn into a cemetery in our village.”

Almost half of this legislation, 27 bills, was passed during the height of Brazil’s Covid-19 pandemic, from March to September 2020.

The study also found that the issuing of environmental fines for illegal deforestation dropped by more than 70 percent during the pandemic. This is despite a 9.5 percent increase in deforestation in the Amazon over the past year. The research was led by scientists in Brazil, Britain, and the United States.

“The current administration is taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to intensify a pattern of weakening environmental protection in Brazil,” the study authors wrote. “This has the potential to intensify ongoing loss of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood of other zoonotic disease outbreaks, and inflict substantial harm to traditional and indigenous peoples.”

The study authors used data from the Official Gazette of the Union, the legal newspaper of Brazil that publishes records of all decrees and changes in legislation. They also examined monthly deforestation data from Brazil’s National Institute for Spatial Research (INPE) and records of environmental fines from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA).

In April 2020, Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told other government ministers at a meeting to take advantage of how “the media attention is almost exclusively on Covid… to open the flood gates and change all the rules and simplify the norms.” In the months following Salles’ statement, Brazilian lawmakers and officials did just that. In July, 47 pesticides had their toxicity classifications either lowered or eliminated, the study found. In June, another piece of legislation made it “no longer necessary to restore all permanent environmental conservation areas, even if they are illegally deforested,” SciDev.net reported. The amount of biodiesel added to Brazilian diesel was decreased, from 12 to 10 percent. Laws began allowing mining permits in designated areas even before final authorization and environmental reviews were complete. And several military leaders were appointed to environmental agencies.

“The effects of such changes will likely last for decades,” the scientists wrote.","Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png,"['environmental', 'brazil', 'study', 'dozens', 'toxicity', 'weakened', 'legislation', 'deforestation', 'pandemic', 'wrote', 'scientists', 'brazilian', 'laws']",

By Sophie Hares

TEPIC, Mexico, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Severe flooding on the Amazon has increased amid changing weather patterns, and is harming the health and incomes of people living along the world's biggest river, scientists said.

Analysing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years.

""There are catastrophic effects on the lives of the people as the drinking water gets flooded, and the houses get completely destroyed,"" said Jonathan Barichivich, environmental scientist at the Universidad Austral de Chile.

""Our findings unravel the ultimate causes of the recent intensification - wet season getting wetter, and dry season getting drier - of the water cycle of the largest hydrological basin of the planet,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Droughts have also become more frequent in the past two to three decades, but the rise in flooding stood out, he noted.

In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers from institutions including Britain's University of Leeds said severe flooding had affected the Amazon basin nearly every year from 2009 to 2015.

They linked the increase in flooding to a combination of warmer temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and cooler temperatures over the Pacific.

Known as the Walker circulation, this effect influences tropical weather patterns, and can partly be attributed to shifts in wind belts caused by global warming, the study said.

With temperatures in the Atlantic expected to rise more than in the Pacific, flood risks on the Amazon River will persist, the scientists predicted.

""We think that it's going to continue for at least a decade,"" said Barichivich, formerly a University of Leeds research fellow.

The paper also noted that deforestation and construction of hydro-power plants could play a role in water-level changes.

Besides disrupting cattle ranching and agriculture on the river's flood plains, heavy flooding has health consequences for communities in Brazil, Peru and other Amazon nations, as it contaminates water and helps spread disease, said the study.

Monitoring changes in river levels is important because the Amazon basin and its tropical rainforest play a major role in the world's hydrological and carbon systems, said Barichivich.

82,82,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil's Amazon dam plans: Ominous warnings of future destruction (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/brazils-amazon-dam-plans-ominous-warnings-of-future-destruction-commentary/,"Brazil’s current 10-year Energy Expansion Plan calls for three more large dams in Amazonia by 2029, and Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Plan lists many more.

Both plans contain ominous passages explaining that the list of dams could expand if “uncertainty” is resolved regarding current regulations protecting Indigenous peoples and protected areas for biodiversity.

Brazil’s National Congress is considering bills to eliminate environmental licensing; a bill submitted by President Jair Bolsonaro would allow dams on Indigenous lands. Brazil’s dam-building plans to satisfy 2050 energy demand extend to neighboring Amazonian nations, including Peru and Bolivia.

The 2050 plan essentially admits that dams on Indigenous lands and within other protected areas are not necessary because the electricity could be generated by offshore wind power. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

Every year Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy publishes a “Decennial Plan for Energy Expansion,” which includes the “large” dams (since 2004 defined in Brazil as having at least 30 MW installed capacity) to be completed within the ten-year time horizon.

The number of Amazonian dams listed has steadily declined in the last few plans, a fact that the plans make clear is due to “uncertainty” about current licensing policies restricting impacts on the environment and on Indigenous peoples. The most recent plan, which is for 2020-2029, lists only three dams: Tabajara (in Rondônia), Bem Querer (in Roraima), and Castanheiras (in Mato Grosso). A longer list of dams to be completed “after 2029” is also included, but the most controversial dams are also not included in it.

The 2020-2029 plan contains an ominous paragraph (p. 264) making clear that unnamed dams could be built depending on the “treatment” of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) and Indigenous Lands. In other words, more and more-damaging dams could be built if regulations are changed, as is proposed in bills currently moving through committees in Brazil’s National Congress.

This is not a remote possibility, as Brazil’s environmental regulations have been being dismantled since the mid-2000s, and this process has accelerated enormously since Jair Bolsonaro became president in January 2019. Several proposed laws would effectively eliminate environmental licensing. There is also a proposed law introduced by President Bolsonaro that would open Indigenous lands for exploitation by non-indigenous people — hydroelectric development is one of the uses specifically mentioned, development which could be carried out without requiring consent of the Indigenous groups impacted.

In addition to the ten-year plans, Brazil also has periodic “National Energy Plans.” The most recent one, which completed its public comment period on October 13, extends to 2050. This plan also omits the most controversial dams such as the Babaquara (renamed “Altamira”) Dam on the Xingu River upstream of Belo Monte. However, the report’s list of potential dams (Figure 1) includes the Chacorão Dam on the Tapajós River, which would flood part of the Munduruku Indigenous Land, as well as other dams on the Tapajós and its tributary the Jamanxim River that would flood part of Sawré Mubyu, a Munduruku area that has had its official status as an “Indigenous land” blocked precisely to make way for these dams.

The omissions in the 2050 National Energy Plan are intriguing. For example, the map of planned transmission lines omits the line from Manaus to Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state (p. 191). It is included in the 2029 10-year plan (p. 105). This line would pass through the Waimiri-Atroari Indigenous Land and requires consultation. Yet the planned Bem Querer Dam in Roraima, which would use the line to transmit most of its output to Manaus, is moving ahead quickly and is scheduled for completion in 2028 according to the 2020-2029 10-year plan (p. 57).

Dam plans can appear out of nowhere, as with the Barão do Rio Branco project announced soon after Bolsonaro took office. This project would build a 2,000-MW dam on the Trombetas River (Figure 2) together with a road connecting the Amazon River to the border with Suriname on a route that is almost entirely composed of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity), Indigenous Lands and Quilombola Lands. “Quilombolas” are descendants of enslaved Africans who escaped in past centuries and set up their own villages in the forest; they have the same rights as Indigenous peoples under Brazil’s 1988 constitution. Bolsonaro’s planned dam would flood Quilombola Lands.

Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador also have big plans for Amazonian dams. The 2010 Brazil/Peru agreement specified six large dams in the Amazonian part of Peru to be built by Brazilian construction firms with financing from Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), largely to export electricity to Brazil (Figure 3). Since 2010 the “Lava Jato” (“Car Wash”) corruption scandal in Brazil has tainted the main construction firm expected to build the dams (Odebrecht), as well as various political figures in Brazil and in the other Amazonian countries. In addition, Brazil’s economy has not been doing well, and BNDES has less money to invest than it once did. Nevertheless, many of these dams are listed in Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Expansion Plan as possible sources of electricity in the coming decades (Figure 4).

The dams Brazil plans to build in Peru and Bolivia would have many impacts on the environment and on the people who live along the rivers in these countries. Ironically, they also would have impacts in Brazil itself. A study by Bruce Forsberg and coworkers showed that these planned dams would retain enough sediments to significantly reduce the transport of this valuable material into the Brazilian part of the basin. Nutrients in, and associated with, these sediments represent the base of the food chain for fish. As a result, the fisheries along the entire length of the Amazon River would see reduced production.

The fact that Brazil would be “shooting itself in the foot” by building these dams does not mean that they won’t be built. After all, Brazil dammed the Madeira River with the Santo Antônio Dam in 2011 and the Jirau Dam in 2013, thus sacrificing much of what had been the world’s second-greatest riverine fishery, second only to the Mekong (which is also threatened by dams). Fish catches plummeted due to the two Madeira dams, not only in Brazil but also in Bolivia and Peru because of the blockage of fish migrations.

In Bolivia, the same type of arrangement as in Peru applies to at least two planned dams. Brazil has also considered building a dam in Guyana, which could be connected to the planned Boa Vista-Manaus transmission line. All of these dams would have major environmental and human impacts, and the other Amazonian countries generally have even weaker legal protections than Brazil. This fact appears to be part of the reason for building these dams abroad, as the secretary of planning of Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy as much as confessed in 2012 in admitting that the foreign dams had priority because they would be faster to approve and build.

As compared to previous energy plans, one improvement in the current plans is that they foresee a substantial increase in wind energy. While the plans for wind power still focuses on onshore generation, the 2050 plan has calculations of the enormous potential for wind power on the continental shelf along the Brazilian coast. The plan admits that “The total expected installed capacity of wind power in 2050 may be even greater than 200 GW… as long as the expansion of hydroelectric dams with interference in protected areas is not allowed” (p. 101). In other words, Brazil could get all of the electricity it demands by tapping this wind resource without needing to allow hydroelectric dams to be built in the country’s Indigenous Lands and conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity).

The 2050 National Energy Plan shows that by 2050 Brazil could install 89 GW of “centralized” photovoltaic solar power (i.e., not counting “distributed” panels on rooftops), and that this would make up the difference in foregone hydroelectric generation if restrictions are not removed on Indigenous land and protected areas (pp. 111-112). If restrictions on hydropower are relaxed, less centralized photovoltaic solar (42 GW) would be installed. These numbers for solar power assume that wind power will be installed on a large scale. If some restriction prevents this, then centralized photovoltaic solar power could be expanded to over 100 GW (p. 112).

For comparison, Brazil’s total potential installed capacity of untapped hydropower is only 52 GW, and of this only 12 GW (23%) does not interfere with indigenous lands and other protected areas (p. 79). The 2050 plan’s repeated inclusion of scenarios with flooding within Indigenous lands and conservation units undoubtedly reflects the expectation of Brazil’s electrical authorities that protection of these areas against flooding by dams will indeed be eliminated.

The 2050 plan assumes that hydropower is the cheapest, and therefore the most desirable option, followed by wind and then solar. However, dams are by no means cheap energy, as shown by a worldwide survey of hundreds of dams that found that most are uneconomical because they almost always cost much more than originally estimated and they routinely take longer than expected to begin generating electricity. Brazil’s Belo Monte Dam is a good example: it cost more than double the original expectation and completion took longer than planned. The importance of the high financial cost of dams pales in comparison to that of their human and environmental impacts, which are far greater than those of wind and solar power.

The plans could be more ambitious in the area of energy conservation. The 2020-2029 Ten-Year Plan calculates that 4.8% of Brazil’s projected electricity use in 2029 could be avoided through conservation measures (p. 220). The 2050 National Energy Plan has many calls for energy efficiency, but no calculations of how much electricity use could be avoided. Ever since the 2008 National Plan for Climate Change (PNMC), the government’s goal has been to end use of the electric showerheads that, according to the PNMC, consume 5% of all electricity in Brazil (p. 58), but basically nothing has been done. There is no mention in any of these plans of stopping the export of electricity in the form of aluminum and other electro-intensive products (7% of Brazil’s electricity use).

At a Glance At least 200 jaguars have been killed, injured or displaced.

They live in a state park called Encontro das Aguas.

Extreme drought, heat and wind have created a dire situation.

The largest population of jaguars in the world is under attack from wildfires burning across vast tropical wetlands in southwestern Brazil.

Firefighters, ranchers, scientists, environmentalists and local residents are banding together to try to stifle the blazes and save the jaguars.

The fires are burning in a region known as the Pantanal, which is considered one of the most biologically diverse regions on the planet. Besides the jaguars, the Pantanal is also home to thousands of other plant and animal species, including toucans, caiman, giant otters and giant anteaters, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

The jaguars are concentrated in a state park called Encontro das Aguas, or Meeting of Waters. Fires reached the park in recent days after scorching more than 8,900 square miles of land across wetlands known as the Pantanal, which starts at the southern end of the Amazon forest and stretches over parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, Agence France-Presse reported.

Two hundred of them have already been killed, injured or displaced due to the fires, according to Panthera, a big cat conservation group.

The region is used to fires during the dry season, but those who work in the Pantanal say extreme drought, combined with heat and wind, have created a dire situation.

""Very few animals survive. The ones that do often suffer very severe effects. They're burned to the bone, they often have to be euthanized, or die of hunger and thirst,"" Juliana Camargo, head of the wildlife conservation group AMPARA Animal, told AFP.

""The worst part is when the people on the ground fighting the fires tell us, 'There's nothing we can do, everything is going to burn.' The only hope is for it to rain, but that's not expected until November.""

Rafael Hoogesteijn, a veterinarian and program director at Panthera, is among those helping fight the fires. Hoogesteijn said in a blog post that the fires are five times larger than those that burned last year.

""Brazil's Pantanal is a unique ecosystem and has the world's largest flooded forested grasslands, but when I look around some areas, all I see is burned soil peppered with a few bare trees,"" he said.

Advertisement Lt. Col. Sheila Sebalhos, a spokeswoman for the region's firefighters, told the Associated Press that there is no sign of a break in the weather.

""The forecast isn’t good,"" Sebalhos, who spent weeks in the fire zone, said by phone from the state capital of Cuiaba. ""High speeds of those winds that change direction many times throughout the day are favoring the rapid spread (of fire).""

Winds were blamed for carrying sparks into Encontro das Aguas and igniting the fires that affected the jaguars.

Felipe Dias, the executive director of environmental group SOS Pantanal, said this is the driest the region's been in 47 years.

""There’s a climate problem. The rains happen in a concentrated way and then 30, 40, 50 days go by without rain,"" Dias said. ""The Pantanal is a flood plain; The soil should be soaked.""

Ranching and farming are common in the Pantanal, but many residents also depend on tourism generated by the jaguars, who have grown accustomed to people viewing them.

Hoogesteijn wrote in his blog post that he and others fighting the fires are doing their best to help both humans and animals.

""Our first priority is to protect people's lives by stopping the fires from burning their homes and communities, including their cattle corrals. After that, we focus on saving wildlife,"" Hoogesteijn said.

""Our third priority is to save as much unburnt habitat as possible, for all the surviving fauna and flora to find refuge and food.""

SAO PAULO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A rare bomb cyclone lashed southern Brazil, leaving at least 10 people dead and forcing more than 1,000 people to evacuate their homes, local Civil Defense authorities said on Wednesday.

Nine of the deaths were reported in the state of Santa Catarina, where one person has also been reported missing. The tenth victim was in southernmost Rio Grande do Sul state bordering on neighboring Argentina and Uruguay.

An atypical climate event for the region, meteorologists said the ""extratropical bomb cyclone,"" or rapidly developing storm, originated in the Atlantic Ocean and whipped southern Brazil with winds of up to 110 kilometers per hour.

The cyclone knocked out power to at least 48 towns, some 686,000 homes, in Santa Catarina.

Florianopolis, the capital of Santa Catarina, and its metropolitan region were the hardest hit, registering six deaths due to landslides and mudslides.

""We have never seen anything like it. We always believed we were far from the kind of phenomena we were used to seeing on television of the Caribbean,"" a resident of Ilhota, a community in greater Florianopolis, told local media.

Strong winds and heavy rains ripped away tile roofs and sheet roofing, and uprooted electricity poles.

Winds of up to 80 kilometers per hour reached as far as the southeast states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the meteorological service reported.

On the coast of Sao Paulo, damage to a marina caused eight boats to sink.

In Curitiba, Parana state, cellphone video captured rooftops blown away by winds of over 100 kilometers per hour.

The governments of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana issued flood warnings and evacuated more than 1,000 people.

Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday that “all means” are being made available to help the country’s largest state, Amazonas, where hospitals are running out of beds and oxygen tanks amid soaring coronavirus infections.

His claim came a day after Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello described the healthcare system in the Amazonas state capital, Manaus, as being in “collapse.”

“I would say yes, there is a collapse in healthcare in Manaus. The line to get a hospital bed has grown a lot, today we have about 480 people waiting in line. And the reality is that there is a lower supply of oxygen — not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen,” he said during a Facebook live with Bolsonaro on Thursday.

Doctors and nurses have been quoted in local news reports as saying patients are dying of asphyxiation in the city’s hospitals because of a lack of oxygen.

Bolsonaro posted on his official Facebook page Friday that “all means have been made available to the population of Manaus.”

Pazuello has been in Manaus for three days, the President said, and the federal government has provided “oxygen, supplies and patient transfers to federal hospitals.”

The Brazilian air force delivered six cylinders of liquid oxygen, totaling 9,300 kilograms, to Manaus early Friday. It also flew out nine patients and five doctors from Manaus to the city of Teresina, in the northeastern state of Piauí.

Speaking in Brasilia, Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourão said there was no way to foresee the collapse in the public health system and blamed a new variant of coronavirus that is circulating in the city.

“You cannot predict what would happen with this strain that is occurring in Manaus. Totally different from what had happened in the first half,” said Mourão.

Last September, research led by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) recommended a lockdown after confirming that Manaus was experiencing a second wave of the disease. The government of Amazonas denied the second wave of Covid cases at that time.

Manaus, globally known as the gateway to the Amazon region, also suffered badly in the first wave of the pandemic between April and May, when its public health and funeral systems collapsed.

Brazil’s Covid-19 death toll is the second highest in the world, behind only that of the United States. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 207,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Brazil and more than 8.3 million reported cases of coronavirus.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published Wednesday accused Bolsonaro of having “tried to sabotage public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19” earlier in the pandemic.

The Amazonas state government announced emergency measures Thursday — including a nighttime curfew, ban on mass transit and the airlifting of patients to other Brazilian states — as it grapples with the latest crisis.

“Today we are in the most critical moment of the pandemic, one that has no precedent in the state of Amazonas. We are facing a lot of difficulty in getting medical supplies. And as everyone is following, our main difficulty now has been getting oxygen,” Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima told a news conference Thursday.

Demand for oxygen is up fivefold over the past 15 days, according to the state government.

Some 235 patients will be airlifted to five other Brazilian states, the state government tweeted Thursday. It said the transfers were necessary due to the state’s oxygen shortages.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Thursday he had spoken with Lima and had offered immediately to send oxygen tanks. “Latin American solidarity above all!” he tweeted. Lima responded: “The people of Amazonas thank you!”

Minister: Vaccinations to start ‘in January’

Covid-19 vaccinations have yet to get underway in Brazil, despite its strong track record on national vaccination programs.

Speaking Thursday, Pazuello said Brazil would begin to inoculate people in January but did not specify a date.

“In January we will start vaccinating. In the beginning with 2, 6, or 8 million doses,” the health minister said. “And in February, we will have mass production, and our National Vaccination Program, which we’ve been doing for 45 years, will get ahead of everyone in the whole world, including the United States.”

The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) will meet on Sunday to decide whether to give emergency approvals to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines, according to the official news agency, Agencia Brasil.

Bolsonaro has publicly second-guessed the urgency of immunization, disparaging “the rush for a vaccine” in comments made last month.

“The pandemic is really reaching its end, the numbers have showed this, we are dealing with small rises now,” he said, according to CNN Brasil. “But the rush for the vaccine is not justified because you are playing with people’s lives.”

In its World Report 2021, Human Rights Watch recalled how the right-wing President repeatedly downplayed the danger posed by the coronavirus, by calling it “a little flu” and by spreading misleading information about the pandemic.

Bolsonaro “refused to take measures to protect himself and the people around him; disseminated misleading information; and tried to block states from imposing social distancing rules,” said the report.

“His administration attempted to withhold Covid-19 data from the public. He fired his health minister for defending World Health Organization recommendations, and the replacement health minister quit in opposition to the president’s advocacy of an unproven drug to treat Covid-19.”

Anna Livia Arida, Brazil’s associate director at Human Rights Watch, also recognized the role of other government institutions such as the Supreme Court and Congress in helping to “block many, although not all, of Bolsonaro’s anti-rights policies.”

Ministry defends record on rights

According to CNN Brasil, the country’s Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights issued a statement Wednesday arguing that the HRW report “ignores measures taken by the government to protect human rights during the pandemic.”

Numerous projects aimed to help children, adolescents, women and the elderly were mentioned in the statement, saying those were “a form of government aid to the socioeconomic developments that occurred in the pandemic,” according to CNN Brasil.

CNN has reached out to Bolsonaro’s office for comment.

Meanwhile, a study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, published Friday, found that “the spread of Covid-19 in Brazil overwhelmed the health systems in all the country’s regions, particularly in areas where they were already fragile.”

The findings, based on analysis of the first 250,000 patients admitted to hospital in the country, “reveal that a large percentage of Covid-19 patients that were hospitalised in Brazil required intensive care and respiratory support, and many did not survive.”

The researchers also found regional differences in mortality, with patients in the north and northeast of the country faring worse than those in the south.

The United Kingdom imposed a ban Friday on arrivals from Brazil, a dozen Latin American countries, Cape Verde and Portugal, which has strong travel links with Brazil, amid concerns that the new Brazilian coronavirus variant could spread to the UK.

British authorities are already battling to contain a more contagious variant first detected in the UK late last year.

UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said that scientists who had examined the mutation discovered in Brazil were concerned “not so much that the vaccine won’t work, in fact scientists think that it will work, but just the fact that it’s more spreadable.”","Sun, 17 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2021/01/a3d4968916ef25b3dfc01a7d9c22e56-320x180_700k-1-thumb.jpg,"['patients', 'collapse', 'surge', 'health', 'oxygen', 'brazil', 'amazonas', 'care', 'manaus', 'state', 'minister', 'brazils', 'covid19', 'brazilian', 'infections']",

Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

JANUARY

Hottest January on record

1 January

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

FEBRUARY

6 February

Record mainland Antarctic heat. The Argentinian research base Esperanza on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, measures a new high for the southern continent of 18.4C (65.3F).

9 February

Record Antarctic island heat. The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island is almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C in 1982. This has still to be confirmed by the WMO.

MARCH

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

APRIL

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

13 August

Two months of record rainfall in southern China kills 219 people, prompts the evacuation of 4 million, and causes $26bn in economic losses. The Three Gorges Dam inflow hits a record 72,000 cubic meters a second. The megacity of Chongqing is put on its highest flooding alert since 1981.

16 August

Hottest summer ever in the northern hemisphere. Death Valley records a temperature of 54.4C (129.9F), the third-highest on Earth since 1931 (and the two previous records are in question).

26 August

Record fires in California. More than 405,000 hectares burn in nine days – more than three times the average in the “normal” wildfire season. At least five people are killed, and more than 100,000 evacuated.

28 August

Record rain in Karachi of 231mm (9 in) in a single day. Pakistan has the wettest month in its history.

SEPTEMBER

4-12 September

Record flooding in the Sahel region of Africa affects 500,000 people. The White and Blue Nile burst banks. The average level of the Blue Nile reaches 17.43 metres (57.19ft), the highest since Sudan started measuring in 1912. Senegal records 124mm of rain over a seven-hour downpour – the amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season from July to September. Sudan imposes a three-month state of emergency on 4 September, after rains destroys about 100,000 houses and kills more than 100 people. In Nigeria, flooding damages 500,000 hectares of farm produce, amounting to about 5bn naira (£9.8m), according to NKC African Economics.

12 September

1 December

Record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season ends. Thirty storms grew strong enough to earn a name, beating 2005’s record of 28 storms. The WMO ran out of storm names by September, turning to the Greek alphabet for labels for the first time since 2005.

4 December

The bushfire season starts early in Australia with devastating wildfires on Fraser Island as experts worry that the months ahead could be disastrous.

12 December

The World Meteorological Agency says 2020 is certain to be among the three hottest years ever recorded. Although global emissions are likely to have fallen by 7% this year, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The UN reports global heating in on course to reach 3.2C by the end of the century because governments are not taking sufficient climate action to keep temperatures to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C to 2C. All eyes are now on the UN climate conference (Cop26) in Glasgow next year.

30 December

Almost one year on from the first reported case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, the worldwide death toll of the pandemic has passed 1.6 million people and is estimated to cause $28tn of losses. Scientists have warned such outbreaks will become more common as the world’s natural life support systems, including the climate, break down as a result of rising temperatures, deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade. The UN secretary general says humanity has been waging war on nature, and that making peace will be the defining task of the 21st century.","Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb9db4f80d4a4b71ebd3db63097319d092c6f50/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=014552998e4de138981ddd3ae07f737e,"['extreme', 'weather', 'hectares', 'million', 'fires', 'world', 'floods', 'hottest', 'searing', 'storms', 'photograph', '2020', 'record', 'records', 'average', 'heat']", 
88,88,FL-2017-000067-BRA,UPDATE 2-Brazil's central bank to flood lenders with fresh liquidity - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-banks-idUSL1N2BG0IX,"(Adds more measures, central bank president quotes)

BRASILIA, March 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank on Monday said it planned to inject 1.2 trillion reais ($233.81 billion) into the country’s financial system to counteract the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with more than half that amount comprising loans to banks.

Under the program, lenders will be able to package their loan portfolios into long-term deposits to be acquired by the central bank in a move aimed at freeing up 670 billion reais for fresh loans.

The bank loans are part of a raft of steps the Brazilian central bank announced aimed at keeping consumers and companies borrowing amid the coronavirus outbreak that it said would collectively make available the equivalent of 16.7% of Brazil’s gross domestic product in fresh cash.

“This is the biggest liquidity injection ever announced by the central bank,” Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto said in a conference call with reporters. “We understand that the acquisition of long-term deposits backed by banks’ loans will allow money to get to companies.”

New regulations governing the letters of credit backed by loans will be released soon, Campos Neto added.

Shares in Brazil’s biggest lenders were underperforming the Bovespa stock exchange index, amid concerns on credit deliquencies amid the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Itau Unibanco Holdings SA and Banco Bradesco SA down 8% and Banco do Brasil SA losing 9%.

The central bank also cut long-term reserve requirements to 17% from 25%, freeing up 68 billion reais currently in compulsory deposits with the central bank to banks.

It also announced measures allowing small and mid-sized lenders to issue up to 2 billion reais in special long-term bonds guaranteed by a privately held deposit insurance fund, limited to an amount equivalent to its shareholders’ equity.

The central bank estimates the measure will allow banks to extend up to 200 billion reais in new loans.

The central bank said it will also extend loans backed by corporate bonds to financial institutions between March 23 and April 30 to add liquidity to their investment funds.

The Brazilian central bank last week allowed lenders to offer firms and households in good financial shape increased loans and better terms over the next six months, besides lowering capital requirements.

Campos Neto added the central bank may further lower reserve requirements and announce other additional measures if necessary.

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Wed, 19 May 2021 11:30:28 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,"['china', 'debt', 'nurses', 'johnson', 'uk', 'rising', 'costs', 'prices', 'inflation', 'global', 'acknowledges', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'policy', 'huge', 'banks']", 
90,90,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact 31 million people globally - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/iu-cfw100120.php,"Study is first to assess the impact of climate change on the global population of river deltas

Thirty-one million people living in river deltas are at high risk of experiencing flooding and other impacts from tropical cyclones and climate change, according to a study by Indiana University researchers.

""To date, no one has successfully quantified the global population on river deltas and assessed the cumulative impacts from climate change,"" said Douglas Edmonds, the Malcolm and Sylvia Boyce Chair in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and lead author on the study. ""Since river deltas have long been recognized as hotspots of population growth, and with increasing impacts from climate change, we realized we needed to properly quantify what the cumulative risks are in river deltas.""

The findings are the result of a collaboration facilitated by IU's Institute for Advanced Study with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute.

The team’s analysis shows that river deltas occupy 0.5 percent of the earth’s land surface, yet they contain 4.5 percent of the global population—a total of 339 million people. Because river deltas form at the ocean at or below sea level, they are highly prone to storm surges, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise and coastal flooding.

In the study, IU researchers analyzed these geographic regions, which include cities like New Orleans, Bangkok, and Shanghai, using a new global dataset to determine how many people live on river deltas, how many are vulnerable to a 100-year storm surge event, and the ability of the deltas to naturally mitigate impacts of climate change.

“River deltas present special challenges for predicting coastal floods that deserve more attention in discussions about the future impacts of climate change,” said IU Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Eduardo Brondizio, a co-author of the study who has been working with rural and urban communities in the Amazon delta for 3 decades. “Our estimates are likely a minimum because the storm surge and flooding models do not account for the compound interactions of the climate impacts, deficient infrastructure, and high population density.”

With Edmonds and Brondizio, co-authors on the study include Rebecca Caldwell and graduate student Sacha Siani.

In addition to the threat of flooding, many of the residents in river deltas are low-income and experience water, soil, and air pollution, poor and subnormal housing infrastructure, and limited access to public services. According to the study, of the 339 million people living on deltas throughout the world, 31 million of these people are living in the 100-year storm surge floodplains. To make matters worse, 92 percent of the 31 million live in developing or least-developed economies. As a result, some of the most disadvantaged populations are among the most at-risk to the impacts of climate change.

“These communities are already dealing with health risks, lack of sanitation and services, poverty, and exposure to flooding and other environmental risks. Climate change is exacerbating all of these issues and creating more impacts,” Brondizio said.

To conduct their study, the researchers created a global dataset of delta populations and areas, aggregating 2,174 delta locations. They then cross-referenced the dataset with a land population count to determine how many people were living in the deltas. To determine the natural mitigation capacity of the deltas, researchers looked at the volume of incoming sediment deposited by rivers and other waterways flowing out to sea. The volume of incoming sediment was compared to the relative area of the delta to determine if the delta would be considered sediment starved and thus unable to naturally mitigate flooding.

Decades of engineering have expanded the habitable land area of river deltas, but they’ve also starved the regions of flood-preventing sediment. Without the sediment being renewed naturally, the shorelines will continue to recede, worsening the impacts of storm surges

“To effectively prepare for more intense future coastal flooding, we need to reframe it as a problem that disproportionately impacts people on river deltas in developing and least-developed economies,” said Edmonds. “We need better models for the climate impacts that are capable of stimulating compound flooding in densely populated areas so that exposure and risk can be mapped to more accurately assess risk and vulnerability.”

The storms have caused floods and landslides, submerging entire neighborhoods and sending homes tumbling down hillsides in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. Rains subsided by Monday, but were expected to resume later this week in some areas.

Flooded roads created violent rapids, sweeping up victims, cars and other debris.

Those evacuated were being housed in makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations. Local authorities have asked for donations of clothes, sheets and mattresses for the victims.

In Minas Gerais, 15,000 people were evacuated and in Espírito Santo nearly 10,000 more, according to local rescue efforts. In Rio, at least 6,000 were evacuated, according to local news media, citing figures from various municipalities. Rio state authorities didn’t immediately respond to a request for official data.

Local authorities warned that the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area, home to nearly 6 million people, could see up to 100 millimeters (4in) of rain in the next three days.

The city had 171 millimeters (6.7in) over one 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday, the highest rainfall in 110 years.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.”

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing.”

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

94,94,FL-2017-000067-BRA,The world's largest wetlands are on fire. That's a disaster for all of us - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/americas/pantanal-fires-climate-change-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The world watched as California and the Amazon went up in flames this year, but the largest tropical wetland on earth has been ablaze for months, largely unnoticed by the outside world.

South America's Pantanal region has been hit by the worst wildfires in decades. The blazes have already consumed about 28% of the vast floodplain that stretches across parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. They are still not completely under control.

The fires have destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal's diverse indigenous communities. But their damaging impact reaches far beyond the region.

Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth's most effective carbon sinks -- ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe's wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle.

When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.

""The Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,"" said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. ""It is vital that it [receives] as much attention as the Amazon.""

Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected more than 21,200 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this year, a figure that is already 69% higher than the full-year record from 2005, when INPE recorded roughly 12,500 fires. There were 8,106 fires in September alone -- more than four times the historic average for the month.

Alberto Setzer, a senior scientist at INPE, said satellite data shows the fires are the worst since records began in 2002, both in terms of the number of individual blazes and the area burnt.

The Pantanal's distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the ""flood pulse."" During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again.

The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It's also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds.

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America -- higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon.

But this year's dry season has been the most severe since the 1970s. ""There has been a climate emergency situation, with a great drought, never seen before,"" Siqueira said.

Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires -- for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. But the unusually dry conditions this year have seen the blazes spread further and faster because there were fewer natural water barriers. Even areas that normally stay wet have turned into tinderboxes.

It's all connected

The fires ripping through the Pantanal are an example of a natural disaster that is exacerbated by climate change while simultaneously making the problem worse.

Extreme weather events, such as drought and floods, are becoming more frequent and more severe around the world, and the Pantanal is no exception. There are indications that the region is getting drier and warmer as the global temperatures rise.

A recently-burned area of the Encontro das Aguas park in the Pantanal wetlands, pictured on September 12, 2020.

This year's record dry season can be traced back to 2019, when the Upper Paraguay Basin experienced unusually low rainfall.

Biologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades, said official data showed precipitation had been below the long-term average over the past decade, but in the past two years had dropped further to just 70% of the average.

The region's rain patterns are also changing. While the amount of overall precipitation might not be dramatically different, the rains are becoming more extreme and concentrated over shorter periods of time.

Climate change is just one part of the problem. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon rainforest to the north and the Cerrado savanna to the east are also having profound effects on the Pantanal.

Ecology and conservation expert Leticia Larcher said deforestation was shortening rainy seasons and making droughts more severe in central and southeastern Brazil. She explained that it was impacting the ""flying rivers"" phenomenon, a crucial process in which a stream of moisture arising from the forest travels to other areas such as the Pantanal, where the water-filled air becomes colder and turns into rain.

""As the forest decreases and loses its ecological functions, the environmental service it provides is also being lost,"" Larcher said.

Mostly man-made

While fires ignited by lightning sometimes occur naturally in the Pantanal, Larcher, who works for environmental NGO Instituto Homem Pantaneiro, said this year's fires have mostly been caused by people. This is despite the Brazilian government's ban on fires for 120 days in the Amazon and the Pantanal that was issued in July.

But Siqueira said the ban wasn't being enforced strictly enough. ""There are extensive areas (where) livestock farmers have regularly used fire as a way to clear farm fields,"" said Siqueira. ""This year, even with the governmental ban ... these producers set fire that ended up spreading for thousands of acres due to the great drought.""

As the global demand for agricultural products rises, so commercial farmers clear more of the Pantanal's native vegetation for growing and grazing. Brazil is already the world's leading exporter of beef. As the demand for meat rises around the world, so does deforestation in the Amazon.

Sugarcane, cotton and soybeans are other lucrative options. When US President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese exports in 2018, Beijing retaliated by placing a new 25% tariff on American soybeans, forcing Chinese buyers to look for alternative sources of the protein-rich commodity.

Brazil was ready to step in. The US Department of Agriculture expects the South American country to have record soybean production this year, and the land area used keeps growing. A soy moratorium, in place since 2006, banned deforestation for the crop in the Amazon -- but those protections don't apply in the Pantanal and Cerrado.

Siqueira and many others, including global environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, Wetlands International and the WWF, blame the policies of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his Environment Minister Ricardo Salles for the devastation.

""It's a direct result of the dismantling of the Brazilian environmental agenda and its institutions under the current government,"" Siqueira said, pointing to deregulation and funding cuts for monitoring agencies.

""[There are] less actions to prevent fires, dismantling of responsible federal institutions, and omission at federal and state levels,"" said biologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades. ""Actually, it was the civil society that readily responded to rescue, save, feed and offer water to the surviving animals and help traditional riverine and indigenous people with food and mineral water,"" she added.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September, Bolsonaro refused to accept any blame for the fires, claiming instead that they were an ""inevitable consequence of high local temperature, coupled with the accumulation of decaying organic matter.""

Out of control forest fire burns the area of the Brazilian Pantanal in rural Mato Grosso.

Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly rejected criticism of his government's stance on the environment and has accused foreign actors of a ""brutal disinformation campaign"" on the issue, told the UNGA that no other country protected as much wild territory as Brazil.

Speaking to CNN's affiliate CNN Brasil last month, Salles, the environmental minister, doubled down on Bolsonaro's message. He blamed the fires on the drought and said farmers had no interest in burning the land, because they rely on it economically.

The government eventually recognized the Pantanal fires as a federal emergency and sent funding into the area, but for many, this was too little, too late.

The government's policies, Siqueira says, send a ""clear message of impunity of environmental crimes.""

Parts of the Pantanal have been designated a biosphere conservation area and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but overall, less than 5% of the region is under formal protection, according to the WWF. More than 90% is privately owned by ranchers, farmers and conservation groups, with 80% of that private land used for cattle farming, according to Brazil's environment ministry.

The fires burned millions of acres of flowering plants, starving pollinators and leaving no food for other animals.

The blazes are hurting local people too. The Pantanal is home to a number of indigenous and traditional communities, which have settled on the banks of the rivers and make their living from fishing and small-scale agriculture. ""Riverside communities, which traditionally survive on artisanal fishing, build their culture there strictly linked to the biome,"" Larcher said.

Fires are still raging in parts of the Pantanal, but recovery efforts are already underway.

The biome has gone through periods of harsh drought in the past. However, Calheiros said the ecosystems are much more fragile than they were just a few decades ago and their capacity to recover is uncertain. The environmental damage inflicted on the Pantanal is also much greater, she added.

Siqueira said it could take decades to restore what the blazes took. ""This will only be possible if we have a normal rainfall from 2020 to 2021,"" he said. If there is more drought, he added, the recovery of the plants and animals living in the Pantanal will be much more difficult.

An analysis by Indonesia’s space agency shows an area of forest twice the size of London was cleared in the past decade in the watershed area of the Barito River in South Kalimantan province.

During the same period, plantations spanning twice the size of Los Angeles have been established in the watershed area.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of licenses as well as rehabilitation of degraded areas in the region.

JAKARTA — Recent floods that inundated large areas of the southern part of Indonesian Borneo might have been exacerbated by massive deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines, activists say.

Heavy rains over the course of several days in early January battered the province of South Kalimantan, causing the Barito and other rivers to overflow. Floodwaters, in some areas as high as 3 meters (10 feet), forced the displacement of more than 112,000 people and claimed at least 21 lives. Nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) have been affected.

President Joko Widodo, during a visit to the affected district of Banjar, attributed the disaster to the heavy and sustained rainfall. But environmentalists say the rapid loss of forest in the region in recent decades contributed to the scale of the flooding.

An area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years, according to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover, while the watershed of another river in the province, the Maluka, has less than 1% of its forest cover remaining.

“It shows the carrying capacity of the forests in that region has drastically decreased,” Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Arie Rompas said.

Trees hold the soil in place, preventing erosion that results in heavy silting of rivers during rains. Silting makes rivers shallower, decreasing their water flow rate and making it more likely that they will overflow in the event of heavy rains.

The country’s disaster mitigation agency, the BNPB, has called for further studies to determine the cause of the South Kalimantan flooding.

“We also need to involve the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in [analyzing] the management of river areas and spatial planning,” BNPB disaster data, information and communications department head Raditya Jati said.

LAPAN analysis of satellite imagery shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito River’s watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres), according to LAPAN’s remote-sensing division head, Rokhis Khomarudin.

He said the analysis could provide an explanation of the possible cause of the recent flooding.

“We understand that plantations are related to the economy, but the environmental aspect has to be paid attention to,” Rokhis said.

However, the analysis hasn’t identified the type of the crops being cultivated in the area.

“Because the data is from mid-resolution satellite data, [we] haven’t been able to determine [whether the plantations are] oil palm or other plantations,” Rokhis said.

There’s conflicting data on the true extent of oil palm plantations in South Kalimantan. The Agriculture Ministry identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020. The Central Statistics Agency, BPS, lists 424,932 hectares (1.05 million acres) as of 2018.

Half of the plantation area, 227,791 hectares (562,884 acres), is owned or controlled by the 25 largest agribusiness conglomerates in Indonesia, according to a 2019 report by TuK Indonesia, an NGO that advocates for social justice in the agribusiness sector.

Among these conglomerates are Jardine Matheson Group, Triputra Group and Sinar Mas Group, which control 61,932 hectares (153,037 acres), 49,500 hectares (122,300 acres) and 48,741 hectares (120,442 acres) of oil palm concessions respectively, the report shows.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), the country’s largest green group, says it’s clear that South Kalimantan is in an ecological crisis driven by unbridled deforestation.

Half of South Kalimantan’s total area of 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) has been parceled off to the palm oil industry and the mining industry.

“Indeed, these floods are strongly suspected to be caused by the ecosystems that have lost their carrying capacity,” Walhi executive director Nur Hidayati said. “So when there is extreme weather, the carrying capacity collapses and causes disasters.”

Walhi South Kalimantan chapter head Kisworo Dwi Cahyono said the destruction of natural ecosystems in the upstream areas of the province’s rivers leads to flooding downstream.

“So this is [caused by] a disarray in the management of the environment and natural resources, and then the degradation of environmental carrying capacity,” he said.

Data from Global Forest Watch show that oil palm is not the only crop that might have contributed to deforestation in the region. In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, where 64,400 people were affected by the flooding, mixed fruit plantations occupy the largest span of plantation area, at 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres), while oil palms occupy only 200 hectares (500 acres).

In Banjar district, where floods displaced more than 51,000 people, rubber trees are the dominant crop, covering 38,500 hectares (95,100 acres), followed by oil palms at 27,900 hectares (68,900 acres).

But in Balangan district, where nearly 12,000 people have been displaced, mixed oil palm plantations cover the largest area, 19,800 hectares (48,900 acres).

While the dominant crops differ, all three districts have one thing in common: all have experienced massive deforestation. In 2000, lush natural forests in all three districts were still largely intact, occupying from 50% to 78% of the total area. By 2016, almost all of them were gone.

Mining

Besides oil palm plantations, environmentalists have also attributed the flooding to the proliferation of mines in the region. Walhi data show 814 coal mining pits left by 157 companies after they finished digging.

The Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) says there are 177 mining concessions dotted throughout the flooded districts.

According to data from the South Kalimantan provincial government, there were 13 coal companies with mining contracts and 160 firms with mining permits in the province as of 2013.

Combined, concessions for mining and oil palm plantations occupy half of South Kalimantan’s total area; 33% of the land falls under mining concessions and 17% under oil palm concessions, Walhi says.

“The biggest cause of deforestation in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo] right now is palm oil and coal,” Greenpeace Indonesia climate campaigner Hindun Mulaika said.

This is not the first time a major natural disaster in Indonesia has been linked to environmental destruction wrought by the plantation and the mining industries. In 2019, the hilly district of North Konawe on the island of Sulawesi was struck by floods that displaced thousands of people.

A report by the ombudsman of Southeast Sulawesi province said that “generally the cause [of the flooding] was land conversion for plantations, mining and illegal logging.” An analysis of the floods by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry cited “river silting” and “oil palm plantations” as among the causes of the disaster.

Extensive mining along North Konawe’s coast might also have been a factor. The mining exacerbated silting near the mouth of the Lasolo River, resulting in a “backwater effect” that intensified the flooding, the ministry’s report says.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of plantation and mining licenses in South Kalimantan as well as a moratorium on new mining permits in the wake of the recent floods.

“The current condition shows that the environmental carrying capacity [in South Kalimantan] is no longer capable [of mitigating disasters],” Hindun said.

Jatam campaign head Melky Nahar said it’s also important for the government to enforce the law by revoking mining and plantation permits in areas that play a crucial role in protecting the environment and the people who live there. He added the government should also start rehabilitating degraded areas in South Kalimantan.

“Without that, similar incidents will happen again [in the future] and we will listen to [rhetorical] statements from President Joko Widodo again,” Melky said.

Jefri Raharja, a campaigner at Walhi South Kalimantan, said the widespread deforestation in the region has also exacerbated global climate change.

“Kalimantan was once proud of its forests, but now the forests have been replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations and coal mines,” he said.

Brazil’s economy is suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic, causing a 40% slide in its currency, the real. That spurred a flood of exports of now-cheaper goods, but imports have dropped sharply, causing the imbalance in containers that has led to delays.

That’s a direct hit to Brazil, which with 30% of global coffee trade is the world’s largest exporter of the commodity.

According to shipping industry consultancy Datamar, there was an imbalance of nearly 80,000 boxes in Brazil in August, with around 251,000 containers leaving the country and only 172,000 arriving. By contrast, in January, 216,000 boxes arrived and 201,000 left.

Global shipping companies such as MSC and Maersk are fully booked for weeks to months in Brazil. Merchants say it is not feasible to currently export Brazilian coffee for prompt shipment, and what is possible can only be done at a higher cost.

“I sold coffee to a client in Spain and I’m still waiting for MSC to make containers available for the shipment,” said Nelson Salvaterra, a partner at Brazilian coffee exporter Coffee Selection.

MSC’s press office did not confirm that specific problem, and declined to comment further. Maersk said it was working to improve container availability.

“It is clear that the coffee sector is entering into the peak season. It is highly important that producers provide the proper visibility on when to move stocks in advance,” said Julian Thomas, general manager for Maersk East Coast South America.

He added that there is no more room for shipments in October.

Coffee, unlike other soft commodities like sugar, is shipped via containers rather than in dry bulk vessels.

Christian Wolthers, a partner at U.S.-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said he managed to find containers for a shipment out of Brazil, but there was no space in the ship and his merchandise was left at the port to be loaded onto another vessel.

Brazil’s trade surplus jumped to $6.16 billion in September, 38% more than a year earlier, due to the weak real. In recent months, Brazilian farmers rushed to sell their crops, boosting exports, as the weak currency means they receive more reais in dollar-denominated trade.

Foreign coffee sales that were planned ahead of time are being processed without much trouble, traders said. However, they said that some cargoes from Brazil may take longer to arrive, meaning global coffee merchants may need to substitute supply from other country.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20201014&t=2&i=1537379189&r=LYNXMPEG9D0BQ&w=800,"['delays', 'shipment', 'coffee', 'brazil', 'maersk', 'crop', 'weak', 'trade', 'wolthers', 'record', 'shortage', 'brazils', 'container', 'containers', 'shipments', 'brazilian', 'traders']", 
98,98,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil mining flood could devastate environment for years - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-damburst-environment-idUSKCN0T40PY20151115,"RIO DOCE, Brazil (Reuters) - The collapse of two dams at a Brazilian mine has cut off drinking water for quarter of a million people and saturated waterways downstream with dense orange sediment that could wreck the ecosystem for years to come.

Nine people were killed, 19 are still listed as missing and 500 people were displaced from their homes when the dams burst at an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil on Nov. 5.

The sheer volume of water disgorged by the dams and laden with mineral waste across nearly 500 km is staggering: 60 million cubic meters, the equivalent of 25,000 Olympic swimming pools or the volume carried by about 187 oil tankers.

President Dilma Rousseff compared the damage to the 2010 oil spill by BP PLC in the Gulf of Mexico and Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira called it an “environmental catastrophe.”

Scientists say the sediment, which may contain chemicals used by the mine to reduce iron ore impurities, could alter the course of streams as they harden, reduce oxygen levels in the water and diminish the fertility of riverbanks and farmland where floodwater passed.

Samarco Mineração SA, a joint venture between mining giants Vale SA and BHP Billiton and owner of the mine, has repeatedly said the mud is not toxic.

But biologists and environmental experts disagree. Local authorities have ordered families rescued from the flood to wash thoroughly and dispose of clothes that came in contact with the mud.

“It’s already clear wildlife is being killed by this mud,” said Klemens Laschesfki, professor of geosciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “To say the mud is not a health risk is overly simplistic.”

As the heavy mud hardens, Laschesfki says, it will make farming difficult. And so much silt will settle along the bottom of the Rio Doce and the tributaries that carried the mud there that the very course of watershed could change.

“Many regions will never be the same,” he says.

Researchers are testing the river water and results should be published over the coming weeks, giving a better idea of the contents of the mining waste.

One cause for concern is that compounds known as ether amines could have been used at the mine to separate silica from the iron ore, in order to produce a better quality product.

According to mining industry research and scientific literature published in recent years, the compounds are commonly used at Brazilian mines, including Samarco’s.

At least some of the compounds, according to the website of Air Products, a company that produces them, “are not readily biodegradable and have high toxicity to aquatic organisms.” They can also raise PH levels to a point that is environmentally harmful.

“There will be serious problems using the water from the river now,” says Pedro Antonio Molinas, a water resources engineer and mining industry consultant familiar with the region.

Samarco did not respond to questions about whether it used the compounds or whether they were in the so-called tailings pond whose contents burst through the broken dams.

‘SWEET RIVER’

The disaster is the latest assault on the Rio Doce, or “Sweet River”, one of the main routes connecting mineral-rich Minas Gerais state with the Atlantic Ocean.

Once lined with thick rainforest and populated by indigenous tribes, the waterway has long suffered because of ravenous demand for the minerals nearby.

So synonymous is it with the mining industry that Vale, which means “valley” in Portuguese, refers to the land through which the river runs. Before a name change in 2007, the miner was formally known as the Vale of the Rio Doce Company.

Its banks now barren, and bed full of silt, the river grew prone to flooding with heavy rains that over the years devastated communities along its more than 800 km course.

More recently it was plagued by drought.

On Thursday, the river running a reddish brown, farmhands moved livestock away from its banks, afraid to let cattle drink the water. At a picnic table, Nilo Candido da Silva, 74, said he never saw devastation on this scale during a life spent by the river.

“I don’t think I’ll ever see it go back to normal,” said Silva, gazing at thick mud and shredded trees where last week the river rose but now just a brown trickle flows. A fish lay dead in the mud.

As the mud flows toward the ocean, environmentalists fear its impact on the coast too.

“Who had the brilliant idea of opening the dams along the river?” asked marine biologist Andre Ruschi in a Facebook post, referring to the decision by authorities to open dams along the Rio Doce to allow the surge to dissipate and proceed toward the ocean.

The mouth of the Rio Doce is a nesting area for endangered sea turtles, an animal sensitive to chemical changes in the water. The beaches are expected to turn a deep red.

“It’s a huge shock for nature,” said Professor David Zee, an expert in oceanography and the environment at the State University in Rio de Janeiro.","Sun, 15 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20151115&t=2&i=1095109336&r=LYNXNPEBAE0DZ&w=800,"['water', 'brazil', 'flood', 'environment', 'river', 'mud', 'devastate', 'doce', 'dams', 'vale', 'used', 'compounds', 'mining', 'rio']", 
99,99,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Fire burns Pantanal's upland heart and threatens nature's fragile balance - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/fire-burns-pantanals-upland-heart-and-threatens-natures-fragile-balance/,"After spreading for 9 months across the biodiverse Brazilian Pantanal wetlands, fires have reached the Amolar Mountains. This upland area is at the heart of the ecosystem and shelters traditional communities like Barra de São Lourenço.

Humans and animals, who thrive on the Pantanal’s seasonal cycle of rising and ebbing floods, now see their way of life menaced by an unprecedented wave of drought and fire.

The region’s inhabitants are already suffering from air and water contamination due to smoke and soot, and dread the fires’ aftermath. With the uplands devastated by the blazes, jaguars, other mammals and birds won’t have anywhere to flee during the next cycle of annual floods.

“For me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says resident Leonida Aires de Souza. But now that much of this remote area has burned, the future is uncertain.

“It has been a hard day. We are in the middle of a fight against the fire in one of the most emblematic communities of [the] Pantanal. For the first time in nine months, the fire is getting close to the houses, threatening people’s lives,” André Luiz Siqueira told this journalist in a rushed Whatsapp audio recording.

The director-president of the NGO Ecoa was in Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul, giving logistic support to nearly twenty firemen struggling to fight the flames in the Barra de São Lourenço community, along the Paraguai River.

At the same time, Denir Marques was rescuing his 80-year-old mother, nearly forced to drag her from her home. “The fire was close and the wind was really strong, and she didn’t want to get out. Lucky the firemen were able to save her house,” he says.

The scenes described by Siqueira and Marques happened on September 22. No one was hurt, thanks to the joint effort of volunteer firefighters who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with professional fire brigades from state and federal environmental agencies.

More than two weeks later, however, and the fires were still burning on the far side of the Paraguai River in the Amolar Mountains. According to the NGO the Man of Pantanal’s Institute (IHP), the fires were only controlled by mid-October after 90% of the area was consumed by the blazes (120.000 square kilometers or 2.9 million acres).

Eyewitness to a conflagration

The Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland and it straddles the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. Brazil contains the lion’s share of habitat, with the ecosystem spreading over Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states, in the Brazilian central-west.

Barra de São Lourenço is at the heart of this biodiverse territory — sitting on the border of the two Brazilian states, next to Matogrossense Pantanal National Park, and just a few kilometers from the frontier with Bolívia. The village, composed of just 25 families, sits at the confluence of the Cuiabá and Paraguay rivers, a hard to access area, reachable only by a five hour boat trip from the city of Corumbá.

“Some people say we are crazy for living here, in the middle of the bush. In the flood season, there are tons of mosquitoes. But, for me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says Leonida Aires de Souza, president of the Renascer Women’s Association and a Barra de São Lourenço resident.

This deep sense of belonging, explains Siqueira, is firmly anchored in the founding of this community. “Barra de São Lourenço is a mixture of the cultures, [coming] from the descendants of the black slaves, the Indigenous guató and the survivors of the Paraguay War. They are the traditional Pantanal’s population,” he states.

The war Siqueira refers to was the worst armed conflict in South America, fought from 1864 to 1870 between troops from Paraguay and the Triple Alliance, formed by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The Indigenous guatós, for their turn, were among the original inhabitants of the Pantanal, along with the Bororo, Paiaguá, Guaikuru and Kayapó Indigenous groups.

Nowadays the guatós populate two Indigenous territories. One is located on Ínsua Island, a few kilometers from Barra de São Lourenço, and was not harmed by the fire. The other Indigenous reserve is the Baía dos Guató, around 200 kilometers away from there, and it had almost its entire area destroyed by this year’s fire.

“My grandmother was a guató,” says resident Denir Marques, proudly. Amid the mix of cultures, some Indigenous traditions remain strong in São Lourenço, including a handcraft in which an aquatic plant called aguapé is braided into beautiful baskets and hats. That art, along with fish and shellfish, is sold to tourists who come from Corumbá and travel up River Paraguai. In the dry season, the people plant watermelon, corn and cassava. During the flood time, they use a technique, called jirau, to increase the height of their houses with timber structures in order to escape the rising water. Now everyone wonders how the aftermath of the fires will impact these livelihoods and activities.

People and jaguars, in tune with the seasons

In the Pantanal, everyone follows the rhythmic seasonal cycle of floods (occurring from April to June) and their ebb (happening from July to December).

At the same time of year that the São Lourenço village dwellers elevate their houses, the animals from the National Park move from the wet bottomlands to the higher ground of the Amolar Mountains.

“Ninety percent of the national park is formed by lowlands that flood in the rainy season. So they [the wildlife] go to the mountains. When it gets drier, they come back to the park. It all works in a very balanced way. That is why the Amolar Mountains and the national park are both considered a natural heritage of humanity,” says Letícia Larcher, who has a doctorate in Ecology. According to the Mato Grosso Fire Department Command, 19.600 hectares (48.432 acres) have already been burnt in the national park, which represents 14% of its territory.

Big, far roaming mammals, especially jaguars (Panthera onca), are the most likely to move from one locale to the other. As a result, the Amolar Mountains possess the world’s second highest P. onca density; in one particular mountainous area, there are an average of ten jaguars per 100 square kilometers (38.6 square miles). Porto Jofre, 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the northeast, boasts the highest density anywhere, with 12.3 jaguars for each 100 km².

“Fortunately, we didn’t find any dead jaguars so far. They may have run to the protected areas of the Bolivian Chaco,” suggests Larcher, the technical coordinator from IHP, the institute that manages the four Private Natural Heritage Reserves (RPPNs) that protect the Amolar Mountains — all the RPPNs were hit by the fire.

Besides the jaguar, the Amolar Mountains are home to other mammals under threat of extinction, like the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the queixada (Tayassu pecari, a species of pig), the tamanduá-bandeira (Myrmecophaga tridactyla, an anteater species), the tatu-canastra (Priodontes Maximus, a type of armadillo), and the ariranha (Pteronura brasiliensis, from the otter subfamily), along with the mutum de penacho (Crax fasciolata, a bird species). Of these animals the ariranha, or giant otter, is the most at risk, receiving an Endangered listing from the IUCN.

Climate change worsens fires?

Over recent weeks, about fifty men have struggled to curb the area’s blazes. But propelled by high winds, the flames were so strong they could “jump” over 40-meter (130-feet) wide containment lines — areas intentionally burned over by firefighters to deny the fires fuel to feed on.

“I am 53 years old and I was born here. I have seen huge droughts, but I had never seen a fire with such intensity,” says Leonida Aires de Souza. “It is the first time since 1974 that we don’t have a flood,” adds Marques.

According to biologist Débora Calheiros, annual rains have been below average regionally since 2010 — with 2019 and 2020 especially dry. In her view, the Pantanal may already be feeling the impacts of global warming.

“In this part of Brazil, climate change tends to let the weather [get] drier, with poorly distributed rains. In the face of it, the federal government should be working on prevention. But it is doing exactly the opposite. It has dismantled the [nation’s] environmental policy and even extinguished the Secretary of Climate Change and Forests,” notes researcher Calheiros, who has been studying Pantanal river and flood ecology for 30 years.

Larcher suggests that the unprecedented Brazilian fires result from the government’s failure to police environmental crimes across the nation, especially in the Amazon rainforest and Cerrado savanna; the Pantanal wetlands are a transitional zone between those two biomes. “The Amazon deforestation decreases the amount of rain that reaches Pantanal. And there are areas of the Cerrado, which shelter the headwaters of the main Pantanal rivers, which are totally devastated. Everything is interconnected,” Larcher points out.

Add to all these complex problems the reckless and even criminal actions of landgrabbers, irresponsible ranchers and farmers — who reportedly have set many Pantanal fires — and Brazil is looking at a formula for disaster, and one that may intensify in future.

“Everyone knows that since 2019 it has not been raining, [but still] people are setting fires to renew their pastures. Even with the [Bolsonaro government] decree forbidding it. It is a crime,” says Ecoa’s Siqueira.

In Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, ranchers often burn degraded pastures to renew grasses and reduce insect pests. But the burning for agricultural purposes is permitted only during the rainy season, and only with authorization from the State Secretariat for the Environment. In July, 2020, as a result of international pressure, the ban on fires was reinforced by a federal decree and moratorium on burning across the Pantanal and Amazon for 120 days.

That ban, however, didn’t have any practical effect. From July to September, Pantanal fires increased by 210%, soaring from 5,071 hotspots in 2019 to 15,725 hotspots in 2020, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Estimates are that over 3.3 million hectares (8.1 million acres) of Pantanal have gone up in flames so far this year. That’s about 22% of the entire region, and approximately six and a half times the size of Grand Canyon National Park. Reports show that most of the fires originated on private property.

Fire threatens future health

Even when such widespread and devastating fires end, their effects may be felt for a long time afterward by people and wildlife. Resident Denir Marques, for example, still recalls how he felt while battling the flames in his community. “We spent days and nights fighting. Those who couldn’t stand anymore would lay down on the river shore to take some rest. I felt ill, with a headache, because the smoke was too strong.”

A study by a Federal University of Alagoas laboratory found that the air in Cuaibá, Mato Grosso’s capital, reached carbon monoxide concentrations 15 times more than what’s acceptable to human health.

“This area of Barra de São Lourenço became the epicenter of the fires, so the smoke stationed there for more than sixty days. They [Firefighters and residents] couldn’t see 100 meters ahead. No one knows the effects of it on their health, especially during a pandemic, in a community that has always been forgotten by the governments and that has precarious access to the health system,” worries Siqueira.

Air quality isn’t the only concern. According to researcher Calheiros, regional water may soon be undrinkable. Excess organic matter, infused in the ashes, speeds the proliferation of bacteria harmful to human health. “When the rains start, probably at the end of October, [conditions] will get worse as more ash will be drained into the lakes and little rivers, and then to the major ones. The governments have to act with urgency to deliver drinkable water and chlorine to those [impacted] communities.”

According to Calheiros, water contamination may also prompt fish mortality. That would aggravate the crises that began in March, as the coronavirus suffocated outback tourism. Barra de São Lourenço’s people make most of their living from selling fish, shellfish and handicrafts to community visitors. Now, of the 17 participants in the Renascer Women’s Association, only four continue working with handcrafts. “We are trying to recuperate the association so our colleagues may live from our work again, from our handcraft. That is our way of living, it is inherited from our ancestral guatós,” says Leonida Aires de Souza.

The same future uncertainty applies to wildlife. Animals not killed outright by the blazes will have to survive in denuded inhospitable habitat, with potentially poisoned waters.

“The fire burned everything, from plants to the colonies of ants and termites. Even if the plants turn green again with the rains, [too] many [habitat] pieces will be missing to have a balanced environment. We still don’t know what is going to happen with these animals, because we don’t have any study that evaluates the impacts of a fire of such dimension,” Larcher concludes.

0,0,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Brazil's pandemic-weary Manaus flooded by rising Amazon rivers - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-pandemic-weary-manaus-flooded-by-rising-amazon-rivers-2021-05-17/,"Heavy rains in the Amazon rainforest have caused rivers to rise to near record levels, flooding small Brazilian towns and threatening the state capital Manaus with another disaster after it was severely struck by the coronavirus pandemic.

Across the state of Amazonas, more than 400,000 people have been affected by flooding, said the state's Civil Defense service, many of whom were evacuated as water levels climbed.

The Rio Negro river was rising by about 3 centimeters (1 inch) a day and on Monday streets in the center of Manaus were already under water, according to city hall.

""The water level is... the third highest in the history of the city. If it continues like this, it will pass the record 2012 flood,"" said mayoral spokesman Emerson Quaresma.

While rainfall varies from year to year, climate change has brought particularly heavy rainy years and also very dry years that hurt farming, said Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus. Amazon deforestation may also contribute to long-term changes but does not impact rainfall year to year, he said.

Access to the Manaus market on the edge of the Rio Negro is underwater and the city has built raised wooden walkways for pedestrians.

Up the Amazon River, small riverside towns such as Anamã, population 12,700, have been totally flooded, forcing residents to raise the floor levels of their wooden houses or evacuate.

In Manaus, the homes of 4,700 families are in danger. Mayor David Almeida has offered them stipends to rent other dwellings if they are forced to evacuate.

Late last year, Manaus became an epicenter of the pandemic, making headlines as the city's hospital system ran out of oxygen for patients.

The city and surrounding region registered the first cases of a highly contagious variant of coronavirus, called P.1, that has spread rapidly throughout Brazil and to at least 10 other countries.

Some teenagers and young adults who received Covid vaccines experienced heart inflammation, a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group said, recommending further study of the rare condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices in a statement dated May 17 said it had looked into reports that a few young vaccine recipients - predominantly male, adolescents and young adults - developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition often goes away without complications and can be caused by a variety of viruses, the CDC group said. CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but members of the committee on vaccinations felt that healthcare providers should be made aware of the reports of the ""potential adverse event"", the committee said. It did not say how many people had been affected and recommended further investigation. Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said vaccines are known to cause myocarditis and it would be important to monitor to see if it is causally related to the vaccine. It is important to look at the risk-benefit ratio, he said: ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial outweighing this very low, if conclusively established, risk."" The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving the mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The United States has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Israel's Health Ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer's vaccine, although it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30. Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established. Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The CDC in late April, after news of the Israeli investigation, said it did not see a link between the two. Earlier this month US regulators expanded authorisation of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to children aged 12 to 15.","Tue, 18 May 2021 03:20:37 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/18/60a3306f60b4aa6168ac694b/60a3306f60b4aa6168ac694c_o_U_v2.jpg,"['vaccine', 'captures', 'devastating', 'brazil', 'cdc', 'floods', 'drone', 'pfizer', 'committee', 'cases', 'young', 'vaccines', 'condition', 'inflammation', 'heart']",

Rivers in the Brazilian Amazon region have risen to near record levels after heavy rains, flooding small towns and threatening areas hit hard by Covid-19 with another disaster.

In Amazonas state, 52 of the 62 towns and cities have areas under water, and 25 have declared a state of emergency including the capital, Manaus. About 410,000 people have been affected, according to the civil defence service.

In Manaus, the Negro river is at its third-highest level since records began in 1920, at 29.72m (97ft). Brazil's geological service expects the waters to reach 30.35m, exceeding the record flooding seen in 2012.

Raised wooden walkways for pedestrians have been erected in parts of the city centre, and local officials say they will set up barricades with sand bags to try to contain the waters. The houses of 4,200 people have been flooded across the capital.

The increased precipitation in the region is linked to La Niña, a phenomenon where cooler-than-normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean lead to significant weather changes in different parts of the world.

The town of Anamã, with a population of 12,700, has been totally flooded by the Solimões river. Boats and canoes have become the only way to get around the so-called ""Venice of Amazonas"".

Like most residents, Manoel de Oliveira Cardoso and his wife, Eliana dos Santos Madi, have built wooden structures so they can walk around the flooded rooms of their house.

""Look at the state of my house, half flooded, I've got nowhere to keep my things,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I'm struggling to see if I can salvage at least half of my things.""

As Anamã experiences inundations almost every year, some of the houses have a second level where people move their belongings in case of severe flooding. Others are built on wooden poles to keep them above the river level, known locally as palafitas.

The Solimões and Negro rivers are the main branches of the Amazon river, which has flooded the towns of Parintins and Itacoatiara. In Manacapuru, crops were destroyed.

Meanwhile, cases and deaths related to Covid-19 were rising again in the state amid a slow rollout of vaccines and lack of co-ordinated measures to curb the spread of the virus, according to the Fiocruz Amazonas institute.

By boat, Neuda Sousa, a local health worker, carried a box of Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs to vaccinate residents in flooded areas.

Manaus and nearby areas reported the first cases of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19 that has spread throughout Brazil, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Earlier this year, the city's health system collapsed, with hospitals running out of oxygen amid a steep rise in infections.

There are now fears Amazonas state could face a devastating third wave.

Anama, home to 14,000 people on a tributary of the Solimoes River that flows toward capital Manaus, is just one municipality of dozens in Amazonas state that has seen life upended by unusual rainfall.

Amazonas’s civil defense secretariat on Thursday warned the flood could soon be biggest recorded in the last century, and said 350,000 people have already been affected.

As the river continues rising, the sound of power saws in Anama is constant as residents cut boards and beams to build rudimentary scaffolding within their homes. It’s a race to stay above the water’s surface. Motorcycles are stored atop the wood, too.

“What we’re living isn’t good. The flood is here, in this home,” said Luzia Santiago da Costa, a 62-year-old homemaker. Her knee problems mean she keeps her eyes focused on her steps while balancing atop the wood and moving slowly through her home.

Raimundo Sampaio Sobreira, 63, said his floor is now so high that he’s begun hitting his head on the ceiling.

“We are accustomed here, but this is going beyond the limits,” Sobreira said.

Twenty of Amazonas’ municipalities are in a situation of emergency, and 22 have rivers spilling over their banks, according to the secretariat's statement on Thursday. The latter group includes capital Manaus, where people have built makeshift bridges.

The Negro River, which flows past Manaus to meet the Solimoes River, could reach its highest-ever level within days, the state’s government said this week.

Increased precipitation is associated with the La Nina phenomenon, by which cooler-than-normal sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean impact global weather patterns.

KOLKATA: Cops in Bengal have deleted more than 500 fake posts of “post-poll violence in Bengal” and “Hindu genocide in Bengal” in the last 96 hours but the numbers are just one indicator of the enormity of the problem. The fakes have become much more “international”: among images sought to be passed off as “Bengal violence images” are old photos from Brazil , Venezuela and Bangladesh .On Sunday, the CID tweeted a video link where a verified user — Chaudhary Amit Singh — claimed a man was beaten and assaulted with sticks and stones.The video had originated from Brazil, and is at least three years old, the CID said. Also, a 2018 video from Venezuela has been shared on social media as a political worker being lynched in Bengal in post-poll violence by “TMC goons”. Kolkata Police has flagged a Bangladeshi video that was being passed off as an attack on a polling agent in Bengal. After this, half a dozen videos have surfaced with morphed images from incidents which took place in Bangladesh, sources said.Since May 5, when police units across the state began monitoring fake news, the number of fake videos under surveillance is stated to be in the hundreds.The CID has contacted social media companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and have taken down close to 300 posts and accounts. The Kolkata Police claimed on Sunday that it had flagged and removed 200 others.Investigators say there has been special emphasis on a few districts, from where the volumes are higher. The state police have lodged five FIRs in Cooch Behar alone. Four people have been arrested. Another arrest took place at Howrah. TOI had reported that CID had arrested two persons from Deganga and Sonarpur earlier. CID sources said most of the rehashed old incidents are those that were reported from UP, Bihar and Odisha.“We have lodged five separate FIRs at Cooch Behar and arrested four persons for sharing fake news that was promoting enmity. We have decided to have no tolerance for anyone sharing fake and unverified news and WhatsApp forwards. All cyber units have been asked to be vigilant and cross-check everything on the internet and issue rejoinders on our police social media pages,” said a top cop at Nabanna.ADG (law and order) Jawed Shamim has urged people to be vigilant against fake or unverified news. In Kolkata, police have now lodged four FIRs — the last on Sunday by Shyampukur police station — for sharing fake news that can disturb peace in the city. The cops have slapped Section 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups), apart from sections dealing with cheating and under the IT Act.Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the cyber cell was treating each post seriously. “We have already issued six notices for the profile owners to come and contact us. If they fail to do so, we will initiate legal action,” said Sharma.Cyber law expert and special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said organized fake news had witnessed a huge spurt in the last one week. “This is the ugly face of social media. Recently, the government came out with a rule, which we are referring to as Information Technology Rules 2021. It has stringent rules on the ethics and the legality of various posts and the liability of various intermediaries. The person posting these objectionable contents can be booked for various non-bailable penal provisions, including the IPC,” he said.","Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82512811,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-169320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['fake', 'media', 'brazil', 'social', 'flood', 'cid', 'posts', 'bangladesh', 'violence', 'video', 'various', 'sharing', 'bengal']",

Judge Nicholas Underhill has agreed to an oral hearing that could help to overturn a previous Court of Appeal decision which denied a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group permission to appeal against a judgment to strike out the landmark case.

“I am satisfied that, exceptionally, an oral hearing is appropriate in this case,” the judge said in the order, which was signed on May 4 and seen by Reuters on Thursday.

No further details were immediately available.

The order comes less than two months after the Court of Appeal refused permission for a lawsuit over Brazil’s worst environmental disaster to proceed in English courts.

The Court of Appeal said in March it agreed with a lower court that the case was an abuse of process, that claimants could – and were – making reparation claims in Brazil and that the lawsuit would be “irredeemably unmanageable.”

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

Samarco has since filed for bankruptcy protection.

PGMBM, the law firm representing the Brazilian claimants, said it had been contacted by many clients to “express their gratitude in respect of the consideration being given by the Court of Appeal to their application.”

BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, said it was aware of the application.

“Previous (court) rulings … have supported our position that the civil claim proceedings were unnecessary as they duplicated matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and are, or have been, the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil,” a BHP spokesman said.

The Renova Foundation is a redress scheme established in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale.

The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

Several villages in Region Nine (Upper Takatu-Upper Essequibo) were Monday flooded due to heavy rainfall and rising rivers in neighbouring Brazil, prompting authorities to obtain relief supplies, Regional Executive Officer Karl Singh said.

“Those rivers in Brazil, including the Amazon, are flowing and pushing back the water to the Takatu River. All the communities along the Takatu River will be affected. The Rupununi River is also high so that is affecting Sand Creek and those areas,” he said.

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) said the floods are being caused by “seasonal rainfall”.

He said residents and businesses in Lethem, the regional capital town, were also bracing themselves for severe flooding as the water level there has been rising steadily. “Right here in Lethem, the water is rising rapidly and a bridge that connects Lethem to St. Ignatius , water is already on the dam already,” he said.

He said mud brick houses were under severe threat because they are very vulnerable to moist conditions. “Once the soil is damp around, it also means that that the mud is going to be damp and the wall will start cracking and so on,” the Regional Executive Officer said.

Mr. Singh said relief efforts were also being coordinated with the Civil Defence Commission (CDC), the government’s emergency response agency, and preparations would be made to eventually assist farmers when the flood waters recede.

The Regional Executive Officer said among the worst hit is Baishaidrun village. That Deep South Rupununi village, which has about 35 households, is under more than two feet of water. “All their farms- all the cassava, all the eddoes, all the provisions and so on are under water so that is how severe it is,” he said. Mr. Singh said the village, located about 200 kilometres from Lethem and close to the Takatu River, has been virtually cut off by the flood waters. “Right now, I have in my possession some food supplies but I am unable to get there because of the accessibility,” he said.

Also affected are Shea Village, another Deep South Rupununi village, where 15 farms are under water.

In the South Central Rupununi village of Sand Creek, the Regional Executive Officer said water has affected houses and residents could not access their farm lands.

The Regional Executive Officer said the CDC has dispatched 300 hampers which were expected to arrive by road Monday night. He said the Region Nine administration has also purchased another 300 hampers.

Meanwhile, residents of Deep South Rupununi are urging drivers of heavy duty vehicles not to cross the Karaudar village bridge because the support has been damaged due to force of the river and erosion.

Is the Bovespa – trading at record highs – an accurate picture of the country’s financial health? Or is it the currency that is the real indicator – languishing as it is north of $5.50 – a warning that the share prices have dislocated from their economic fundamentals?

Perhaps the country’s deeply real negative interest rates – inflation is over 5% and the Selic is just 2.75% – might be the biggest fraud, artificially pushing stocks higher and the real lower.

This banker inevitably went on to talk about Brazil’s gushing pipeline of equity issuance – R$100 billion is poised to be issued in the country.

Unless something happens to make markets snap shut soon, 2021 will be another record year – showing that companies are rushing to make hay while the sun shines.

So far, investors remain hungry, though there are early signs of flagging appetite as they demand discounts to participate in the latest wave of IPOs. The proportion of deals that are closing below the bookrunners’ pricing range is rising.

Everybody wants a swimming pool, at least until its thousands of gallons of chemical-laden water come splashing down through the ceiling of the parking garage it was precariously built above. W hich is exactly what was captured on video in Brazil this week.

The video, shared on DailyMotion, YouTube and Reddit, shows CCTV footage from the pool and the inside of the parking garage of a building in Vitória, Brazil. The moment that the floor of the swimming pool collapsed, around 10 p.m. on April 22, is clearly visible . I t appears nobody was injured.

In the video, we see the entire bottom of the pool fall out, all at once and pretty much in one giant piece, into the parking garage below. The cut to the garage shows the gushing water moving powerfully enough to shift the parked cars around in their spots.

Reddit user leandroas, who originally posted a copy of the video to the website, followed up his post with a comment claiming that the building, constructed in 2018, had to be evacuated following the incident. Th e building’s original construction company is said to be paying for the relocation, and t he poster claims residents of the building will be able to return April 27.

One in four cities around the world lack the money to protect themselves against the ravages of climate breakdown, even though more than 90 per cent are facing serious risks, according to research. Cities are facing problems with flooding, overheating, water shortages, and damage to their infrastructure from extreme weather, which is growing more frequent as the climate changes. A survey of 800 cities, carried out by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), found that last year about 43 per cent of them, representing a combined population of 400 million people, did not have a plan to adapt to the climate crisis. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. Budgetary restraints were cited as the key reason by about 25 per cent of cities. Many are reliant on national governments for the funding needed to protect their infrastructure and vulnerable populations from these threats.

The survey found that last year, 422 cities had 1,142 projects to adapt to the climate crisis yet to be financed, requiring about $72 billion in investment. The cost of water management projects alone that were yet to be financed was estimated at $22.6 billion. Kyra Appleby, the global director of CDP, said: “Adaptation (to the impacts of climate change) is trickier to finance than emissions action. There are enormous benefits from adaptation and resilience, but they don’t appear on the balance sheet. Only a fraction of recovery spending (from the coronavirus pandemic) is being put towards climate change, and even less towards adaptation.” Installing renewable energy generation, such as solar panels, can generate a financial return, and energy efficiency projects begin to save money quite quickly, but the benefits of adapting to the impacts of extreme weather are less obvious and often more diffuse.","Mon, 17 May 2021 10:10:11 GMT",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2021/05/14/pexels-ryan-4293398.jpg,"['water', 'crisis', 'weather', 'adaptation', 'world', 'climate', 'cent', 'projects', 'survey', 'cities', 'measures', 'cant', 'afford', 'impacts']",

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Thu, 06 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zjh2JaBQpIuhPnOfB35VMg--~B/aD00OTI7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/24ee4ddf76c36e2c58be29028877ae7a,"['bhp', 'inflation', 'global', 'lawsuit', 'court', 'dam', 'brazil', '69', 'uk', 'reconsider', 'billion', 'exclusive', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'china', 'rising', 'prices', 'costs', 'policy', 'banks']",

Grain and bean futures jumped in overnight trading on concerns about adverse global weather.

Little to no rain is expected in at least the next couple of weeks for Brazil’s safrinha corn crop, according to several weather forecasters.

WXRisk said over the weekend that no rain fell anywhere in Brazil Friday or Saturday and that the weather in the South American country is “fairly hot” for this time of year.

The forecaster sees no significant rainfall in Brazil for at least the next couple of weeks.

Consultancy Safras & Mercado on Friday lowered its projection for Brazil’s total corn output to 104.1 million metric tons due to the dry weather, an 8% decline from its previous outlook.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month forecast Brazilian corn production at 109 million metric tons, up from 102 million tons the previous year.

Demand also has been strong in recent days as an unnamed country bought 101,600 metric tons of corn, the USDA said on April 27.

2. Speculators Increase Their Bullish Bets in Soybeans and Wheat

**

Money manager increased their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in soybeans and wheat last week while reducing their bullish bets on corn futures, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Speculators in the seven days that ended on April 27 raised their net longs in soybeans to 168,851 futures contracts, the CFTC said in a report.

That’s up from 160,094 contracts a week earlier and the highest level since the week that ended on Dec. 29, the agency said.

Investors also raised their bullish bets on hard-red winter wheat to a net-30,111 futures contracts last week, up from 18,608 contracts the previous week. That’s the largest such position since March 16.

For soft-red winter futures, investors turned bullish and held a net-long position of 7,210 contracts, the CFTC said. That’s a shift from a net-short position, or bets on lower prices, of 3,697 contracts a week earlier.

Net longs in corn, meanwhile, declined to 362,238 futures contracts last week, down from 380,083 contracts seven days earlier.

That’s the smallest bullish position since the week that ended on March 16, the government said in its report.

Adverse weather in South America and the U.S. has hedge-fund managers and other large investors worried about production while global demand for agricultural commodities has been robust.

The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

By Vatican News staff writer

Thousands of families have been left homeless in the western Amazon after torrential rains caused severe flooding across the Brazilian state of Acre. At an already critical time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, those most hard-hit are the poor who live on the banks of rivers. This is the case for the community of Sena Madureira, a town near the Iaco River. Located about 145 km from the capital Rio Branco, Sena is the third most populous municipality in Acre, after Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Solidarity of the Church

In Sena Madureira, the flood has affected 17 thousand people. Of these, 4 thousand are already housed in public reception facilities such as sports fields and schools. The Catholic Church has joined in the solidarity mobilisation and is welcoming families. Fr Moisés de Oliveira Coelho of the Order of the Servants of Mary, and parish priest of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Parish, spoke to Vatican News and explained ""we have some chapels that are being used as temporary shelters, such as the Nossa Senhora Aparecida Chapel, the São Sebastião Chapel and the Santa Cruz Chapel. Other chapels are also occupied by the goods that families in need of help have managed to recover.

The Church is also working to collect donations for those who have lost everything. Fr Moisés explained that this is why the Ação Bom Samaritano (""Action of the Good Samaritan"") has been launched: a solidarity campaign promoted in collaboration with the local government. He said that the parish collects food, shoes, clothing, personal hygiene and cleaning products: ""We receive donations from our faithful, from people of goodwill and we prepare food parcels and then distribute them to shelters.""

Looking ahead

The solidarity of the local Church does not stop at the current emergency, but also looks to the aftermath, to when people will have to return home. For this reason Fr Moisés said that they are putting donation money aside: ""We have opened an account so that, after the floods are over, we will be able to help families buy cleaning products, personal hygiene items and basic necessities. These are still small gestures compared to the magnitude of what is happening, but they are sufficient and necessary and will increase as donations grow. So, we depend on donations to be able to do these good deeds and that is why we always count on the help and collaboration of everyone at this time.""

The crisis in Acre

The flooding of regional rivers in the State of Acre also created problems in the capital Rio Branco, in Cruzeiro do Sul and in the municipalities of Tarauacá, Feijó, Santa Rosa do Purus and Rodrigues Alves. To deal with the emergency, all public agencies are on high alert and are providing relief to the population at risk. State authorities have created 23 temporary shelters for displaced people and last weekend they distributed more than 500 food parcels to the population. In all, about 120,000 people are affected. More than 32 thousand families have been devastated by these extreme weather events. The health situation in Acre is also particularly critical due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dengue epidemic and malaria. Both infections and hospitalisations are increasing, putting hospitals under great pressure.","Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/multimedia/2021/02/24/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-23-at-15.37.35aem.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg,"['thousand', 'solidarity', 'families', 'acre', 'moisés', 'brazil', 'floods', 'donations', 'state', 'rio', 'churches', 'open', 'parish', 'displaced', 'doors', 'thousands', 'sena']",

The CCTV footage shows the pool surrounded by plants and flood lights. No people are visible in the area. The bottom of the pool suddenly collapses in a clean break. The video then transitions to the parking garage below the pool, with is suddenly flooded with water. No people are seen in the garage.

The building's 270 residents were evacuated, Brazilian online news portal G1 reported. No injuries were reported in the incident. The accident did not damage vehicles in the indoor parking lot.

Some tenants of the building across the street from Itaparica Beach reported a strong gas odour coming from the heated swimming pool.

Argo, the company that built the 90-unit building, put up displaced tenants in nearby hotels for no cost.

Espírito Santo officials and Vila Velha cleared residents to return to their apartments on Tuesday after engineers inspected the complex and found no structural damage.

The pool was closed for at least three months in 2020 due to a leak, newspaper Folha Vitoria reported.

Unmitigated spread in Brazil

Caroline Ash

Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from Sã o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

The São Paulo State is home of around 45 million people ranging from very vulnerable communities to well structure urban and rural areas. From the beginning of the pandemic, the state has been the epicentre of the COVID-19 in Brazil, with more than 1.5 million cases and 47,768 deaths until this day(https://covid19br.wcota.me/), a quarter of the national numbers.

Data from INPE (National Institute of Space research) and the State University in São Paulo (UNESP), shows that an outstanding season of summer storms will continue in the next months, with its peak from February to April, increasing the alert for areas hit by the floods in the first weeks of 2021.

In the São Paulo Municipality, the most affected districts are in the East and in the South of the city. In the East, the Jacuí and Jardim Santa Helena neighbourhoods are in an area that follows the river course of the Rio Tietê – one of the longest and most polluted rivers in Brazil. That river has a system of dams and barriers that overflows during the rainy season affecting the life of the most vulnerable communities alongside its course. In the south, the Grajaú district has many very poor communities living in the shore of the city’s larger reservoir in informal settlements.

This situation leads to at least 1200 families affected by the floods, causing food insecurity and very low health sanitation standards. The situation is especially bad for around 2400 children, in those areas, for a total 6000 people. Because of the fact that Summer Floods have started earlier than usual, it is expected that the amount of affected population will increase in the following months.","Sun, 10 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1551255-Alert-01-2021-Brazil-Summer-Floods-Sao-Paulo.png?itok=girNLjj2,"['act', 'paulo', 'alliance', 'brazil', 'sao', 'floods', 'summer', 'vulnerable', 'alert', 'state', 'communities', 'areas', 'são', '2021', 'affected']", 
26,26,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Nature-based Solutions: Latin America and the Caribbean’s Green Opportunity - New Security Beat,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2021/05/nature-based-solutions-latin-america-caribbeans-green-opportunity/,"Already facing water stress, much of Latin America (such as the western slopes of the Andes and the dry corridor of Central America) is projected to experience intensified periods of drought in the coming decades, further complicating development efforts in the region. At the same time, heavy floods are the most common natural disaster in the region, disrupting life for countless people. According to the World Bank, in Latin America and the Caribbean alone roughly $14 billion per year is required to meet the 2030 water and sanitation targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Typically, investments at this scale have been made by governments and large firms that invest in traditional infrastructure such as dams. But with ever-growing development needs and increased understanding of the impacts of climate change, Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are gaining momentum as a new way of incorporating environmental considerations into development responses.

NBS refer to the strategic restoration, protection, or management of ecosystems to intentionally address social challenges. Recent research has shown that combining NBS with traditional infrastructure can be more cost-effective, and result in greater positive side effects for communities.

Investment in NBS—from reforestation to protect water supplies and reduce carbon emissions to natural barriers that protect coastal communities from sea level rise and storm surge—is key to delivering sustainable growth that addresses climate change and its impacts. These investments in infrastructure can also address other pressing environmental challenges, such as lack of water and sanitation, deforestation, ecosystem degradation, and loss of biodiversity.

Examples of NBS in the Latin America and the Caribbean, though insufficient in number and scale, already exist. A forthcoming report from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) identifies several studies that illustrate the value of NBS. Many of these examples are already well-known locally. In Brazil, for example, “green roofs” in homes of a favela in Rio de Janeiro reduced temperatures in peak heat by up to 20 degrees Celsius, resulting in health and energy-saving benefits. NBS is already providing valuable benefits for flood prevention, as well. In certain places in Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that every 20 km of mangrove forest along coastlines protects an average of over $250 million of infrastructure. In Mexico, coral reefs along the coast of Quintana Roo reduce flood damages by an estimated $42 million annually. Protecting these ecosystems is vastly more cost-effective than building artificial barriers and provides added benefits to local communities, in the form of tourism-related livelihoods and healthier fishing stocks.

Protecting and restoring ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and floodplains in upper watersheds can improve water quality and availability downstream for agriculture and human consumption, and are necessary for the resilience of critical infrastructure such as hydroelectric power plants.

Other innovative, small-scale nature-based projects, such as planting vetiver grass—a non-invasive plant with a deep root system that can support regrowth of native species—in degraded slopes, can prevent flooding, landslides, and sedimentation while aiding reforestation efforts and supporting livelihoods in local communities. In Trinidad & Tobago, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) and local organization IAMovement are using vetiver grass to promote sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable populations. Migrant Indigenous women are learning to make and sell crafts, such as baskets, mats, and chairs, that use vetiver grass as a raw material, illustrating how these solutions also support sustainable development efforts.

Ignoring the role of nature in addressing these complex challenges can come at a high cost. A study of the Amazon basin estimates that a 20-40 percent reduction in forest cover in the Amazon would result in a decline in power generation of the Belo Monte hydropower dam—one of Brazil’s main sources of electricity—to 25 percent its maximum capacity by 2050. Protecting the forest is vastly cheaper than investing in new power generation infrastructure. In a warming planet, and with growing development needs in Latin America and the Caribbean, proactively promoting nature-based solutions, on their own or integrated with existing gray infrastructure, can support the region’s climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Our organizations, PADF and WRI, are taking steps to help national and local leaders harness the power of nature for development in Latin America and the Caribbean. Through this partnership, we support research to identify promising NBS throughout the region, raise awareness among investors on the benefits of nature, and connect projects with investors to bring these solutions to the real world. We hope that these efforts, combined with greater ambition by local and international stakeholders from the public, private, and civil society sectors, will bring the region’s vast natural wealth to the forefront of the fight against climate change, benefit local communities, and promote a hemisphere of opportunity for all.","Wed, 19 May 2021 06:44:27 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/49888560908_ee1e31219b_o-222x176.jpg,"['water', 'opportunity', 'nbs', 'america', 'green', 'latin', 'naturebased', 'development', 'caribbean', 'solutions', 'infrastructure', 'caribbeans', 'support', 'sustainable', 'local']", 
27,27,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Going under? Brazil's hospitals at risk as climate change brings more floods - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-climate-change-healthcare-idUSKBN2B105V,"SAO PAULO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Last December, when physician Victor Heitor Gomes became health director for Rafard, a municipality 150 km northwest of São Paulo, he knew he had a challenge ahead.

The only clinic in the town of 9,000 had been through hard times: heavy rains in mid-November caused part of a meeting room wall to collapse and a month later more rain flooded parts of the building, including the surgery room and common areas.

The problems forced the clinic to relocate some services to other rooms - and repairing the meter-long hole in the meeting room wall had to be put on hold because of ongoing rain in the Brazilian summer.

Harsher rains and increasingly scorching temperatures have made life tough for doctors in other ways as well, Gomes said.

“They’re changing the seasonality of certain diseases. You don’t expect to see dengue in the winter, but it’s getting more common now,” he said.

Extreme weather, like the floods that ravaged the Maria Tereza Apprilante Gimenez Basic Healthcare Unit in Rafard, are increasingly a threat throughout the region as climate change takes hold - and are creating an additional burden for health workers struggling to battle the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Pan American Health Organization, almost 70% of the 18,000 hospitals in Latin America and the Caribbean are located in areas highly vulnerable to floods, major earthquakes or hurricanes.

Inundation is the most common threat. Nearly 550 floods hit the region in the two decades between 2000 and 2019, affecting over 40 million people and causing almost $26 billion in damages, according to a 2020 report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).

Brazil is the most flood-prone country in Latin America, the report said.

HEAVIER RAIN

The storms that hit Rafard are a worry as well for nearby São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil and in South America.

Concrete-filled urban areas act as “heat islands” that absorb and then slowly release the sun’s heat, making them hotter than surrounding rural areas.

In cities like São Paulo, that extra heat combines with humidity arriving from the nearby Atlantic Ocean to create heavier rain, said Tércio Ambrizzi, an atmospheric scientist at the University of São Paulo.

“The heat lifts and condenses the humidity, making it rain,” often more intensely than might happen elsewhere, said the scientist, who co-authored a 2020 study on changing rain patterns in metropolitan São Paulo between 1930 and 2019.

Using data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology, researchers found that heavy rain is becoming more concentrated in shorter periods, while dry spells stretch longer.

The changes have been particularly noticeable over the last decade, they said.

In 2014, Sao Paulo’s hottest summer in seven decades, water reservoirs for the city dropped below 20% capacity, in the city’s biggest water crisis on record and a serious threat for healthcare facilities.

Extremely heavy rainfall events - the kind that can trigger disasters - similarly nearly doubled in the last decade compared to 1971-1980, researchers found.

The extremes are most apparent in Brazil’s southern and southeast regions, and are a particular problem for heavily populated cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, which are highly vulnerable to floods and landslides in part because of poor urban planning, Ambrizzi said.

PLANNING AHEAD

Eduardo Trani, Sao Paulo state’s environment sub-secretary, said his office is aware of the challenges.

A 2009 law passed by the state established policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate threats, including an effort to map climate risks in all the state’s 645 municipalities.

Almost 250 have been completed so far.

“The mapping is fine-grained to the scale of neighborhoods, so that local city halls can study precautionary measures to take against floods and landslides,” Trani said.

What the results so far have found is that basic healthcare units, particularly in the São Paulo metro area, often lie in flood-prone areas or are surrounded by them.

That can be addressed in part by infrastructure changes, such as building floodwalls around hospitals and relocating vulnerable ventilation, heating and air-conditioning systems to higher ground, resilience experts say.

Having backup power sources - including solar panels or other renewable energy - also can keep hospitals functioning when broader power systems go down in extreme weather.

Mariana Silva, a infrastructure and sustainable finance specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank, said building resilience also is a matter of planning for decades ahead.

“If a hospital is to be built in a place which is highly prone to disasters, we must ask ourselves what can we change in its engineering. You’d be surprised how small changes can make a project resilient,” she said.

Shifting designs can add to costs - but ignoring the risks will cost more, she said.

“Making those changes costs extra money - but now Latin American governments know climate change is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’,” she said.","Mon, 08 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['brings', 'paulo', 'rain', 'sao', 'floods', 'risk', 'climate', 'going', 'hospitals', 'change', 'vulnerable', 'brazils', 'heat', 'são', 'changes', 'threat']",

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Thu, 20 May 2021 14:30:25 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,"['china', 'rising', 'costs', 'tax', 'prices', 'revenue', 'beats', 'record', 'inflation', 'brazils', 'central', 'global', 'policy', 'bloomberg', 'banks', 'federal']",

SAO PAULO, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people died Thursday in floods and landslides sparked by heavy rains in Presidente Getulio, a town in southern Brazil's Santa Catarina state, bordering Argentina, state officials said.

""The situation in Presidente Getulio is critical due to the floods: houses, vehicles, everything destroyed, people with water up to their shoulders,"" the head of the town's fire department, Alex Lima, said.

Civil defense rescue teams were also searching for 12 missing persons in affected neighborhoods, officials said in a statement.

A heavy storm early Thursday battered several towns, some close to Florianopolis, the state capital and one of the most important tourist destinations in Brazil.

Landslides blocked access to Presidente Getulio, home to 14,000 inhabitants, for a few hours.

Due to the possibility of new storms, it is important the population remains alert and heeds the instructions of civil defense authorities, Santa Catarina Governor Carlos Moises said.

It effectively forces Indonesia to open its imports from the Latin American country.

According to IPB University’s animal husbandry faculty lecturer Rudi Afnan, as written in a statement released in the university’s website ipb.ac.id, the chicken meat imports from Brazil may likely threaten local chicken farmers. Rudi argued it is best for Indonesia to halt poultry product imports.

“This is closely related to the issue of policy in international trade where we are obliged to accept chicken imports from Brazil. Meanwhile, we have self-supported our need for broiler meat since 2008 and have even succeeded in exporting,” the lecturer wrote.

Due to its production capacity, he said, Brazil plans to export poultry products to Indonesia with a relatively low price of Rp14,000/kilograms. Rudi believes that it will make it difficult for Indonesian poultry farmers to compete.

He said one of the solutions is through production efficiency, which can be a tall order as local whole chicken products sold around Rp30,000-40,000 per kilogram while local broiler chicken is sold around Rp14,000 per kilogram. Another solution is for the government to provide subsidies to Indonesian chicken farmers.

34,34,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Climate change poses threat to thirsty São Paulo - Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/bae1d239-4c8d-4737-b436-000b131c20e2,"When it rains in São Paulo, it pours. During tropical storms that punctuate late afternoons in summer, drains overflow on to pavements and floods are not uncommon.

But, despite its sobriquet as the Terra da Garoa, or land of drizzle, ensuring an adequate supply of clean water is a major challenge for Latin America’s biggest metropolis as the climate changes.

This was laid bare when the region’s worst drought in 80 years resulted in severe water shortages between 2014 and 2015. Sporadic outages in parts of the city sparked protests, as well as fears that reserves might run out.

Since then, the utility Sabesp — which serves 28m residents in the greater São Paulo area and eponymous state — has undertaken a range of measures and investments with the aim of avoiding a repeat episode.

Chief executive Benedito Braga insists the company is prepared, with systems that kick in for “extreme situations”.

“What we thought was an extreme situation is becoming more common,” he adds. “For 10 years, rainfall has been below average in the region. It’s very worrying”.

While a long dry spell was the primary reason behind the São Paulo crisis, it compounded other factors such as a growing population, polluted waterways and deforestation.

Levels in the city’s large Cantareira system of reservoirs, which serves around 7.5m people, dropped to below one-tenth of its capacity.

Recommended São Paulo drought raises fears of Brazil energy crisis

Sabesp then provoked controversy by lowering pressure in the distribution network, which temporarily led to taps running dry in certain neighbourhoods. But its other main defence tactic has had lasting benefits.

“During the water crisis, we gave economic incentives [discounts] for people to save water,” Braga says. “Then we removed it, but they changed their habits. Today, consumption is approximately 10 per cent less than before the 2014 crisis.”

To increase its resilience, Sabesp has also invested in schemes to boost the supply of water to the metropolitan region. Already planned before the crisis, works were accelerated on the flagship R$2.2bn ($405m) São Lourenço production system, built through a public-private partnership. It transports water from a reservoir 83km away, via a treatment plant, to around 2m residents in the west of São Paulo.

Other actions taken by Sabesp include clamping down on theft, fixing leaky pipes, cleaning contaminated rivers and planting trees in areas adjoining the Cantareira reservoir network.

Braga reckons cities in a similar position to São Paulo should now concentrate on boosting storage. “The theory of climate change is that we will have more intense rainfall and longer dry periods. To minimise this variability, you . . . need to build dams to store water — that’s lesson number one.

“There’s a very strong environmental lobby against the construction of dams. This needs to stop. People need to be more reasonable.”

Pedro Côrtes, a professor of environmental science at the University of São Paulo, commends the way Sabesp has changed management of the Cantareira system, so that less water is drawn when storage levels are low.

“But, in fact, our supply system is still strongly dependent on climatic conditions,” he says. “There is no negotiation with the climate, but adaptation. We always need to save water.”

There is no negotiation with the climate, but adaptation. We always need to save water

Some scientists, including Côrtes, argue that deforestation of the Amazon is contributing to São Paulo’s water problems, given the importance of the “flying rivers” originating in the rainforest that bring clouds and rain to the central and southern regions of Brazil.

Braga sees it differently, though. “If deforestation causes drought, how did we have this huge flood [in 2010]? These variabilities are linked to phenomena on a global scale and it is the oceans that play a much more important role.”

The volatility of rainfall in the city region was made clear in February 2020, a month with the highest volume of precipitation in 77 years of measurement, according to Brazil’s meteorological service, Inmet.

Juan Carlos Castilla-Rubio, a São Paulo resident and chair of SpaceTime Labs, which helps companies optimise their use of natural resources, suggests that water-risky regions should introduce a “water stress early warning system”. This would issue predictive alerts so that water can be conserved in times of stress.

He also suggests that these areas could introduce a price mechanism that reflects water’s scarcity, by using artificial intelligence systems to establish water risk ratings.

But environmental campaigners argue that there needs to be a more fundamental rethink about water. Greater re-use of wastewater for activities like cleaning that do not require it to be drinkable would be a start, says Édison Carlos, head of the NGO Trata Brasil.

35,35,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Climate crisis blamed for rains and floods that have killed 150 in Brazil - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/13/climate-crisis-blamed-for-rains-and-floods-that-have-killed-150-in-brazil,"About 150 people have been killed or are missing following record-breaking heavy rains, landslides and flooding in three Brazilian states this year.

Scientists say global heating is contributing to more “extreme rainfall” events in the country, and warned that such disasters could become “the new normal”.

Monsoon rains kill Brazilians every summer, with floodwaters filling streets and landslides afflicting poorer communities and favelas built on steep hillsides, often without proper drainage or sanitation.

But global temperatures have climbed steeply since the 1980s, and a warming atmosphere causes more evaporation, making more water available for precipitation.

Official data sent to the Guardian showed “extreme rainfall events” – when more than 80mm or 100mm falls within 24 hours – have soared over the past 30 years in the capitals of the south-eastern states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, where the deadly rains happened.

Scientists blame a combination of growing cities and climate breakdown.

“We are seeing more and more extreme events happening in big and important cities,” said Tercio Ambrizzi, a professor of climatology at the University of São Paulo. “There is a relationship with the increase in average global temperatures.”

In Guarujá, a coastal town 25 miles from São Paulo, 282mm fell in just 12 hours last week – more than the total expected for the entire month of March.

“I never saw a day it rained like that,” said Rafael Soares, 22, a tyre factory worker from the town’s hillside Barreira do João Guarda community, hit by a landslide on 3 March that buried dozens of houses, killing 18 people and leaving dozens still missing.

Soares heard a deafening boom at about 1am and ran up the hill behind his house to find that part of his community had been buried.

“You couldn’t see anything, just earth and mud,” he said, describing “just hearing cries, people crying, not knowing what to do. There was no light, there was nothing.”

He spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home.

Days earlier, five people died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela’s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013.

“Older people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,” she said.

According to data from Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A São Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since.

“There’s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of Brazil,” Ambrizzi said.

His own research from São Paulo – capital of the state where four people died in two days in February following heavy rainfall – backs this up.

Data from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found.

“This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,” the paper said. “Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.”

“Urban heat islands” created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect.

“When it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,” said José Marengo from Brazil’s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper’s authors.

Not all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil’s Space Research Institute said the rains were “meteorological phenomena typical of summer”, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone – “a band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean” for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said.

“You can’t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,” said Josélia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer’s rains have been exceptional. “We are breaking records,” she said.

In January, 59 people were killed during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 “extreme rain” events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020.

In Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station – the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year.Extreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies. “This is the new normal,” he said.","Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32986541a0f8ff603fe23a0a8f8e0aaabde34bfe/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e4c3d72b619ecac7e400896306aed191,"['warming', 'extreme', 'paulo', 'killed', 'crisis', 'brazil', 'rain', 'weather', 'floods', 'climate', 'events', 'heavy', 'rains', 'global', '150', 'são', 'blamed']",

Since the beginning of 2021, the number of dengue cases has exploded in the region, which already has more than 8,600 suspected cases.

In the last week, rains have caused rivers and streams to overflow, dislodged families in more than 10 cities.

Added to this, the second wave of Covid-19 affected the state, which suffers from a lack of ICU beds, and an unexpected humanitarian crisis involving hundreds of immigrants aggravates the scenario.

The governor of Acre (Brazil), Gladson Cameli, decreed an emergency situation and installed a temporary crisis office to manage the situation

Among the measures that the federal government announced to mitigate the floods is the release of R$ 450 million for several municipalities.

The Ministry of Justice, on the other hand, authorized the use of the National Security Force in the state, in “exceptional and temporary blocking activities of foreigners entering the country”.

President Jair Bolsonaro said he intends to go to Rio Branco, capital of Acre, next Wednesday (24).

Immigrants trying to cross into Peru, whose borders are closed because of the pandemic, are increasing tensions in the city of Assis Brasil.

Right now, more than 400 immigrants, mostly Haitians, are in shelters or camped on the streets.

The possibility of increasing this migratory flow is worrying, since the city does not have the capacity to serve so many people and the agglomeration further increases the risk of contamination by coronavirus.

According to the State Department of Health (Sesacre), Acre has 54,743 covid-19 infected and 957 deaths. The ICU bed occupancy rate rose to 91%, and is concentrated in the two largest cities, Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Assis Brasil leads the ranking of covid contamination rate in the state, with 1,375 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.

Acre (Brazil): the state of emergency is expected to extend in the coming days due to rain forecast until February 25

Acre already has almost 130,000 people affected in some way by the flood of rivers in the capital and in the interior of the state. Residents affected by the floods were taken to shelters set up in schools, churches, gymnasiums, sports courts and boats.

Floods further increase the risk of dengue.

Some teenagers and young adults who received Covid vaccines experienced heart inflammation, a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group said, recommending further study of the rare condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices in a statement dated May 17 said it had looked into reports that a few young vaccine recipients - predominantly male, adolescents and young adults - developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition often goes away without complications and can be caused by a variety of viruses, the CDC group said. CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but members of the committee on vaccinations felt that healthcare providers should be made aware of the reports of the ""potential adverse event"", the committee said. It did not say how many people had been affected and recommended further investigation. Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said vaccines are known to cause myocarditis and it would be important to monitor to see if it is causally related to the vaccine. It is important to look at the risk-benefit ratio, he said: ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial outweighing this very low, if conclusively established, risk."" The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving the mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The United States has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Israel's Health Ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer's vaccine, although it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30. Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established. Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The CDC in late April, after news of the Israeli investigation, said it did not see a link between the two. Earlier this month US regulators expanded authorisation of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to children aged 12 to 15.","Wed, 19 May 2021 17:25:05 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-05/19/60a54a4ab2bd3f477d72cf09/60a54a4ee1e77f00011f17f1_1280x720_FES_v1.jpg,"['floodwater', 'vaccine', 'houston', 'cdc', 'rain', 'committee', 'submerged', 'pfizer', 'heavy', 'cases', 'young', 'vaccines', 'condition', 'inflammation', 'heart']",

Violent rain has killed scores of people and forced thousands from their homes this year in Brazil's most populous states, a disaster experts blame on climate upheaval but also rampant urbanization.

Flash floods, landslides and other havoc wrought by torrential rain have killed at least 29 people in recent days in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Another 25 are missing.

That comes after more than 50 people were killed by heavy rain that devastated the state of Minas Gerais in January.

The same scenes of destruction have played out in all three southeastern states, together home to more than 83 million people: poor neighborhoods wiped out by tidal waves of brown mud; houses and cars swept away by flash floods; residents evacuated by boat and helicopter as their streets turn to gushing rivers.

More than three million people live in high-risk zones in Brazil's southeast, which has been hit by record rain this year—in some places, a month's worth in a matter of hours.

As dozens of rescue workers dug through the debris of wrecked houses for his missing mother, stepfather and sister-in-law, one of those affected, 24-year-old Yago de Sousa Nunes, voiced frustration that the authorities did not do more to protect the at-risk population.

""The city government knew this was a high-risk zone, they knew how much rain was going to fall this week, but they didn't do anything to evacuate people,"" he said alongside the ruins of the Barreira de Joao Guarda neighborhood, in the coastal city of Guaruja, Sao Paulo.

Extreme weather

Is climate change to blame?

Experts say more studies are needed to be sure.

But there is no doubt the region is experiencing ""an increase in extreme weather events,"" said Andrea Ramos of the National Meteorological Institute.

This year, the rainy season in southeastern Brazil has been marked by extremes, said Marcelo Seluchi of the Natural Disaster Monitoring and Alert Center (Cemaden): very dry in the first half of the summer, then very wet from mid-January on.

""The planet is heating up, that's beyond doubt. It's more humid than 50 or 100 years ago, which means the same weather systems have more potential to create rain,"" he said.

That has combined with the rampant expansion of urban areas to increase people's vulnerability to floods.

Brazil's biggest cities have seen decades of nearly unchecked growth, as poor migrants arrive and settle wherever they can, often building unstable shantytowns on hillsides or the extreme city outskirts.

""Population growth and the growth of cities means we're replacing vegetation with cement, and that's where a long-standing problem in Brazil comes into play: lots of building on high-risk areas,"" Seluchi told AFP.

More than half the population of the southeast region's state capitals—Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Vitoria—lives in at-risk zones. And 80 percent of those people are ""highly vulnerable: they live in very precarious houses, with high population density and a high percentage of children and the elderly,"" he said.

Housing problem

Rio de Janeiro's Mayor Marcelo Crivella, a far-right evangelical Christian bishop, caused outrage amid the floods when he blamed residents for the destruction.

""People like to live close (to flood-prone rivers and gulleys) because they spend less on sewage pipes for their pee and poop,"" he said.

Unaffordable housing costs have forced the urban poor into areas unfit for settlements, said Henrique Evers, an urban development expert at the World Resources Institute.

""Planning housing for vulnerable populations near urban services is one of the best ways to deal with this challenge,"" he said.

But would it have been enough? - News@Northeastern,https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/01/31/better-planning-mightve-limited-brazils-flood-damage-would-that-have-been-enough/,"Historic rainfall in southeastern Brazil has created deadly floods and widespread destruction in a region that was experimenting with “more progressive” planning and zoning policies than most, says Northeastern political science professor Thomas Vicino, who studies metropolitan development and housing in Brazil.

Had they been fully realized, could those policies have reduced some of the destruction in Belo Horizonte wrought by the storms?

“Many people—and we see this in India as well as Brazil—live in informal settlements that are often built in precarious places, like mountainsides” Vicino says.

These communities are typically not zoned or overseen by any government agency, and they crop up as piecemeal settlements as a result of people moving from rural areas of the country closer to urban areas for work, he says.

“They are very susceptible to natural disasters,” says Vicino, who is a professor of political science, public policy, and urban affairs at Northeastern. In 2013, he led a Dialogue of Civilizations program in Belo Horizonte.

“Resilient, sustainable regional planning and approaches to development certainly help,” says Vicino, who spent a year in Belo Horizonte as a United States Fulbright Core Scholar, where he contributed to research on urban planning. “But the core issue is a political question: Does society have the political will to confront the realities of climate change?”

It’s been raining in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais for nearly a month, and Belo Horizonte, its capital, registered last week the heaviest rainfall in the city since it started measuring 110 years ago.

Cities and towns in the region have been washed out by landslides and floods, and thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.

Brazilian officials blame inadequate housing policies in part for the storm’s particularly high death toll, they told The New York Times.

The destruction underscores the need for cities around the world to implement “more resilient policies and more resilient [neighborhood] planning,” Vicino says—policies with which Belo Horizonte was in the early stages of exploring.

City officials had created a number of programs to bring those informal housing settlements (called favelas) into the fold by applying appropriate zoning regulations and adding municipal sewer systems, roads, and public services such as police and schools, Vicino says.

“This makes them more sustainable places to live,” he says.

But it’s not just these communities that are susceptible, Vicino says.

He says that “resilient planning” also involves officials creating fixed boundaries around development zones to protect open space and natural land. Paving over too much of the landscape or burying rivers and creeks in order to build over them, means that these natural water collection systems—soil and rivers—cannot do their jobs, Vicino says.

“It makes an acute event, like the storms we are seeing in Brazil, even more acute,” he says.

The sorts of long-term planning policies that Belo Horizonte and other parts of Brazil are implementing require support and funding that spans elected officials and administrations, Vicino says—support that can be difficult to achieve.

Any interruption to the process, including natural disasters, political upheaval, economic downturn, and social unrest, can derail it, he says.

“What we know is that we need more resilient policies, and more resilient planning for all types of neighborhoods and all types of people,” Vicino says.

49,49,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Brazil's Bem Querer dam: An impending Amazon disaster (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/11/brazils-bem-querer-dam-an-impending-amazon-disaster-commentary/,"Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his administration’s priorities for Amazon dams, including the planned Bem Querer dam on the Rio Branco in the far-northern state of Roraima.

Bem Querer is primarily intended to increase the energy supply to industries in locations outside of Amazonia, rather than for residents of Roraima.

Probable environmental impacts include blocking fish migrations and flooding a riparian forest that possesses extraordinary bird diversity. Downstream flow alteration would impact protected areas, including two Ramsar wetland biodiversity sites. Riverside dwellers would also be impacted.

Sediment flow blockage would impact fisheries and the unique Anavilhanas Archipelago, a spectacular Brazilian national park. These adverse impacts need to be fully evaluated before a decision to build is made. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

The text of this commentary is updated from an earlier Portuguese-language version of the author’s column at Amazônia Real.

Brazilian Amazonia already has more than a dozen large hydroelectric dams, and their development history is not good: severe human and environmental impacts, and benefits far below those envisaged by the proponents at the time decisions were made to build the dams. The lessons of this history have not been learned, and today the government is moving fast in its preparations for yet another dam facing serious questions — the Bem Querer Dam, proposed to block the Rio Branco in Roraima state, to become operational in 2028 with 650 MW installed capacity (EPE, 2020, p. 71) (Figure 1).

President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his priorities for building more Amazon dams, including Bem Querer (Figure 2). Bem Querer is one of three large dams to be built under Brazil’s current 2020-2029 ten-year energy expansion plan, although more dams could be added to the list if the Bolsonaro administration succeeds in its declared objective of removing restrictions on building dams in Indigenous areas.

The Bem Querer dam’s socio-environmental impacts would be large indeed. It would flood a 130-kilometer stretch of the Rio Branco, eliminating the aquatic ecosystems in this high-biodiversity river (Figure 3). The flooding would also eliminate riparian forests upstream of the dam. Downstream of the dam, flow alterations and other effects would directly impact three conservation units (Viruá National Park and the Niquiá and Caracaraí Ecological Stations); Viruá is a Ramsar wetland biodiversity site. Blockage of fish migration and other impacts would indirectly affect almost all conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) in Roraima (ICMBio, 2013, p. 64).

The dam would impact an especially great diversity of birds in the areas sacrificed to flooding. It would emit greenhouse gases, especially methane. It would alter the hydrological regime downstream, an effect that has killed large areas of flooded forest downstream of the Balbina Dam in the neighboring state of Amazonas.

The human population along the river below the Bem Querer dam will suffer from the change in the hydrological regime, as well as from the decrease in fishing caused by the blockage of fish migration and the decreases of both oxygen and nutrients in the water.

The decrease in nutrients will occur due to sediment retention in the reservoir because the nutrients are associated with the sediment particles. The Rio Branco has a lot of sediments, which is why it got the name “Rio Branco” (meaning “white river”). The decrease in sediments downstream of dams causes erosion of the stream bottom and of the river banks, as is now occurring in the Madeira River, where sediments decreased by 30% after the Santo Antônio and Jirau Dams were built. The decrease in nutrients caused by sediment retention undermines the entire food chain that supports fish populations (Figure 4).

The Rio Branco’s sediments are also essential for maintaining the ecosystems of the Anavilhanas Archipelago (Figure 5) that was formed from these sediments in the Rio Negro, just downstream of its confluence with the Rio Branco. In fact, the Bem Querer dam threatens several jewels of the Brazilian national park system. The Anavilhanas and Jaú National Parks, as well as the Rio Negro State Park, are all in the impacted stretch of the Rio Negro and are part of both the Rio Negro Ramsar wetland biodiversity site and UNESCO’s Central Amazon Biosphere Reserve. Anavilhanas and Jaú are also part of the Central Amazon Conservation Complex, recognized since 2003 on UNESCO’s World Heritage list.

Almost the entire length of the Rio Branco between the proposed dam and the river’s confluence with the Rio Negro is composed of conservation units, including “sustainable use” conservation units. This is also the case for the Rio Negro between the Rio Branco confluence and the outskirts of Manaus (Figure 6). All would be impacted.

Roraima does not need the Bem Querer dam. The state’s population is small and it has the best potential for solar energy among the nine states in Brazil’s Legal Amazon Region. The dam does not eliminate the planned transmission line to Manaus, which requires consultation with the Waimri-Atroari Indigenous people whose territory it would traverse. That line is officially justified as a means of transmitting electricity from Manaus to Roraima. Manaus is already electrically connected to the Tucuruí Dam in the state of Pará, from which this city of 2.2 million currently receives power via a transmission line completed in 2013.

Most of the energy that would be generated by Bem Querer is not intended for the people of Roraima, but rather for other parts of Brazil. The electricity would be transmitted to Manaus to allow more of Tucurui’s power to be transmitted to Brazil’s industrial southeast region, or if joined by other planned dams, to transmit power from Bem Querer via Manaus to the rest of Brazil.

A representative of Brazil’s Energy Research Company (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, or EPE), which is a part of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Figure 7), explained this energy transmission scheme at a public event in Boa Vista in July 2018. Since Roraima is in the northern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed in relation to the rest of Brazil. Therefore, the energy generated in Roraima — when there is a lot of rain there — can be transmitted to the south of the equator when water is lacking to use all of the hydroelectric capacity there. This logic is explained in detail on the EPE website.

The EPE representative at the Boa Vista event concluded that Roraima had received a lot of support from the federal government over the years, and so “Now is the time for Roraima to make [a sacrifice] for Brazil.” This viewpoint represents yet another example of the impact of Amazonian dams in terms of environmental justice.

To reach sensible conclusions about major infrastructure projects like the Bem Querer dam, the impacts, benefits and alternatives need to be surveyed and considered before the initial decisions are made. This information needs to be collected and presented without bias and should be disseminated and debated democratically as part of decision making.

Such critically important decisions cannot be made — as it is done today in the licensing process — as a mere formality to legalize a decision already taken.

Amazonian dams have much greater impacts than other energy alternatives such as wind and solar power. Brazil has an extraordinary potential for both of these alternative sources, as confirmed by the country’s recently released 2050 National Energy Plan, but the priority continues to be for building more dams.

Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks - Environmental Finance,https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/market-insight/how-can-we-finance-climate-adaptation-nature-based-solutions-to-the-americas-climate-change-risks.html,"How can we finance climate adaptation? Nature-based solutions to the Americas' climate change risks Companies: Scotiabank People: Melissa Menzies

Partnered content

The concepts of 'natural capital' and 'nature-based solutions' are gaining attention in the global capital markets, as public and private sector issuers consider ways to finance projects to enhance their physical asset resiliency to climate change or support reforestation and native species regeneration.

While these forms of sustainable debt are well suited to financing diverse adaptation and resiliency activities, the volume of issuances to date is still low, when considering that just five per cent of the proceeds from green, social or sustainability bond issuances in 2020 went to sustainable land use projects, compared to 85 per cent directed to the categories of energy use/efficiency, green buildings and clean transport1.

Melissa Menzies and the team at Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group are actively introducing clients across the Americas to the potential of these climate adaptation and nature-based financial instruments, to tackle pressing environmental challenges, from destructive flooding in central Canada to deforestation in Chile and Brazil.

The new frontier in sustainable finance

Nature-based solutions are earning profile in the Americas, following early moves by European policy-makers and business leaders, notes Melissa Menzies, Associate Director, Sustainable Finance at Scotiabank: ""There is growing recognition by corporations and governments around the role of nature-based solutions in creating climate resilience and sustainable infrastructure, and preserving the planet's biodiversity.""

She also points out that, ""The market for green financing for resilience and adaptation programs is still maturing, as organizations build an understanding of the opportunities, and begin to align their capital-raising programs with their ESG priorities."" Although global green bond issues reached $1 trillion by 2020, just five per cent of all green bonds issued in the past decade were categorized as 'adaptation,' with their proceeds allocated to adaptation and resilience projects2.

Menzies and the Sustainable Finance group are helping clients understand terms like 'natural capital' and 'ecosystem services,' which have arisen from growing consensus that the world's longstanding focus on 'financial capital' did not adequately account for other important forms of capital. In particular, 'natural capital' includes all the natural resources that humans use to provide a return3. 'Ecosystem services' are the benefits that people obtain from the planet's rich biodiversity4. Although natural capital enables companies to create value, historically these natural elements were undervalued or it was difficult to calculate their financial benefit.

""These topics are attracting much attention, as we witness natural disasters and the deterioration of critical biodiversity and natural capital – from the Amazonian jungle to Canada's boreal forests, which serve as natural 'carbon sinks' that sequester carbon in the ground to reduce GHG emissions,"" explains Menzies. It is estimated that 85 per cent of the world's wetlands have been impacted, 75 per cent of land surface has been altered and millions of hectares of primary forest have been lost5.

And there is growing acceptance that nature-based solutions are an efficient remedy. For example, research shows that improved land management rules through natural climate solutions can deliver 37 per cent of all cost-effective CO² mitigation needed to the year 20306. This means that countries can use products like sustainable land bonds to access inexpensive capital, transition to sustainable, low-carbon land management practices and preserve their resource economies. In fact, sustainable finance instruments can also directly help countries meet their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Turning awareness into action

Awareness of climate and biodiversity risks is prompting many stakeholders to act, including investors like BlackRock Inc., which urged companies to disclose how their business practices are consistent with the sustainable use of natural capital7. And, industry groups are tallying the impacts of climate change, including the Insurance Bureau of Canada (ICB), which determined that severe weather in Canada caused $1.9 billion in insured damage in 20188.

Now there are multi-lateral efforts to incorporate natural capital into economic and political decision-making, and ensure the conditions are in place to help the private and public sectors leverage nature-based solutions. For instance, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), GRI, CDP and Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) are developing a comprehensive corporate reporting framework to ensure that environmental, social and governance metrics are represented in financial statements. Simplified, unified accounting and reporting systems will help organizations satisfy stakeholder demand for transparent ESG disclosure and equip them to design investment programs focused on adaptation and resiliency.

Since the natural question is, ""How will these massive adaptation projects be funded?"", the green bond market – in which bond proceeds are applied to finance or refinance eligible green projects – can help organizations bridge the financing gap. In fact, the Green Bond Principles provide guidelines for the use of proceeds of green bond financing, ranging from sustainable land and resource use to climate change adaptation and development of resilient infrastructure.

Under these guidelines, an array of innovative financial instruments, from green bonds to blue bonds to climate bonds, are coming to fruition. On the grand scale, they include the Netherlands's recent EUR 5.98 billion green bond, which will fund coastal and river ecosystem projects to safeguard the low-lying nation against severe flood risk9 – part of the country's recent Green Bond Framework to become climate-proof and water-resilient by 205010.

On a smaller scale, Central Arkansas Water recently issued a US$31 million municipal green bond, to acquire 4,300 acres of watershed land at risk of development. It is believed to be the first issuance of its kind to buy and protect forests in order to secure clean drinking water, in this case for the small utility firm's 500,000 customers11.

""Such success stories are helping to create greater awareness,"" says Menzies, who notes that sustainable finance debt has more than doubled year-over-year, and it has often resulted in a green pricing benefit for issuers. ""Demand for green assets will only continue to grow, when you consider spiking interest in impact investing, the rise of ESG-integrated asset managers, and net-zero commitments made by a growing number of organizations.""

Sleuthing out green opportunity

Scotiabank's Sustainable Finance group is helping clients identify the unfolding opportunities and challenges of green financing. They often advise clients on methods to establish in-depth, corporate ESG reporting and data collection to identify their priority material issues and to build out robust ESG frameworks and governance structures.

Clients often require support steering through the green financing market, since corporate treasury departments may lack in-house resources to focus on unfamiliar considerations in the nuanced sustainable debt sector. For example, since green bond transactions often involve a sizable financial threshold, smaller organizations and municipal or regional governments might turn to green term loans. Or, clients may opt for sustainability-linked instruments, such as sustainability-linked bonds, which enable the issuer to allocate the proceeds of funding across various initiatives for general corporate purposes. They can set material and ambitious targets to the pricing of such instruments tied to achieving nature-based metrics over a set timeframe, such as the number of hectares of forest conserved or the birth-rate of an endangered species.

Menzies guides clients through these multi-faceted issues as part of Scotiabank's dedicated Sustainable Finance group, a team helping the Bank mobilize billions of dollars to reduce the impacts of climate change, support clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and contribute to the global conversation on climate change.

For example, Scotiabank served as joint bookrunner on two of the Province of Ontario's benchmark green bond issues in support of climate adaptation and resilience projects. The proceeds of the province's two green bonds issued in 2019-20, totalling CAD$1.2 billion, will be directed to the Port Lands Flood Protections program. This colossal project will fortify 240 hectares of downtown Toronto land that is at risk of flooding with earthworks/flood protection infrastructure, parks, roads and bridges, naturalized greenspace and wetlands.

In Latin America, Scotiabank also acted as joint bookrunner on significant transactions such as ARAUCO's US$1 billion in sustainability bond issuances in 2019. These issuances will enable the global leader in sustainable forestry to protect native forests and high conservation value areas in Chile. Similarly, the Bank helped Empresas CMPC launch its UF$2.5 million, 10-year green bond in 2019, with proceeds dedicated to restoration of native pine and eucalyptus forests in Chile and Brazil. Scotiabank also supported Klabin's 2019, US$500 million green bond issue to help Brazil's largest paper manufacturer protect vast swaths of forest conservation areas and perform endangered species reintroduction and reproduction at the specialized Klabin Ecological Park.

Menzies is enthusiastic about the impacts of nature-based solutions for the planet's diverse stakeholders – and Scotiabank's ability to bring value to the process: ""Green financing for adaptation and resiliency is an opportunity to connect project developers and investors in sustainable development. There is a lot of room for the Scotiabank's creativity and capability in this area to flourish, and deliver significant, enduring benefits to our clients and communities.""","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.environmental-finance.com/assets/images/mains/78783-main.jpg,"['risks', 'finance', 'adaptation', 'change', 'climate', 'green', 'bond', 'capital', 'naturebased', 'solutions', 'sustainable', 'natural', 'americas']",

In Brazil’s Pantanal, the vegetation compacted under the marshy flood water during the wet season dries out as ponds and lagoons evaporate, leaving flammable deposits underground that can continue to smolder long after visible flames die down.

Firefighters across Brazil are battling raging towers of flames from the Amazon rainforest to the Cerrado savannah, but the fires beneath their feet are a particular challenge in the Pantanal. The only way to combat an underground fires is to dig a trench around it, said state firefighter Lieutenant Isaac Wihby.

“But how do you do that if you have a line of fire that’s 20 kilometers long? It’s not viable,” he said.

The fires here are the worst in 15 years. The flames threaten the region’s biodiversity, rich with tapirs, pumas, capybaras and the world’s most dense population of jaguars.

The Pantanal, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for “swamp,” sprawls over more than 150,000 sq km in Brazil and also extends into Bolivia and Paraguay.

As fires approached emergency workers in the Pantanal this week, they used tractors to cut through desiccated trees and shrubs, leaving a gash of brown dirt meant to rob the flames of fuel and stop their spread.

But strong winds can send the flames over the top, or underground fires can pass below.

“Sometimes it passes under a firebreak and takes the firefighters by surprise,” said Lieutenant Jean Oliveira, who is leading the firefighting efforts.

“Sometimes you control a fire and it’s not really dead, it’s just sleeping,” he said.

Hundreds of firefighters, environmental workers, park rangers and soldiers have worked 24 hours a day for weeks attempting to extinguish flames that have destroyed thousands of square kilometers of the Pantanal.

With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), one fire this week was unstoppable as strong winds pushed it across multiple firebreaks, burning through twisted branches and dry leaves through the day and into the night.

“We controlled it but then it jumped there, jumped there, jumped there,” said Edmilson Rodrigo da Silva, a firefighter for Brazil’s center-west state of Mato Grosso, pointing far into the distance to where the fire had gotten past firebreaks.

The region is a vast flood plain that normally fills with water during the rainy season, roughly from November to March. But the floods were lower than normal this year and a subsequent drought has left the area dangerously susceptible to fire.

The Pantanal so far this month recorded 4,677 “hot spots” in the worst rash of fires since August 2005, according to Brazil’s space research agency, Inpe.

Silva was one of about 20 men battling the fire through the night, bathed in choking smoke and swarmed by gnats flushed out of the undergrowth by flames that encircled the firefighters on three sides. They warned to look out for poisonous snakes and jaguars fleeing the fire in the night.

Rains brought temporary relief to the southern half of the Pantanal last week, but fires again began to pick up this week. Next month could be even worse.

“It’s our worst year here for fires. It’s never been dry like this,” Silva said.","Sat, 29 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200829&t=2&i=1531503658&r=LYNXMPEG7S0F6&w=800,"['worlds', 'worst', 'firefighters', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'jumped', 'largest', 'flames', 'state', 'week', 'burns', 'pantanal', 'brazils', 'underground']",

56,56,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Plan to divert water to Brazil's Belo Monte dam threatens Indigenous peoples and wildlife - The World,https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-04-07/plan-divert-water-brazils-belo-monte-dam-threatens-indigenous-peoples-and,"Norte Energia, operator of the Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River in the eastern Amazon rainforest, has begun diverting about 85% of the river's water to the dam's turbines in order to boost electricity production. Scientists say the resulting drop in water levels will disrupt flood-dependent ecosystems and adversely affect the Indigenous peoples along the river.

Brazil has built more than 200 large hydroelectric dams as a way to produce energy for a growing economy, and Norte Energia's Belo Monte Dam has been one of the most controversial. Aside from its effect on local people and wildlife that rely on the river's natural rise and fall, flooding behind dams can add to climate change by killing trees and other vegetation, which decompose and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

Annual flooding naturally occurs on the Volta Grande (Big Bend) branch of the Xingu River, explains Tiffany Higgins, who reported on the story for Mongabay. The water level rises and the river moves rapidly, up to 25,000 cubic meters per second. The water swells beyond the banks of the river and floods the adjacent forest, where special trees grow that have adapted to being seasonally flooded. Around February, the turtles and the fish catch this river wave and ride it into the flooded forest.

“It's an amazing synchrony, developed over millennia, between the trees that are fruiting and maturing just at this time of year and the fish and turtles who come along."" Tiffany Higgins, Mongabay

“It's an amazing synchrony,” Higgins says, “developed over millennia, between the trees that are fruiting and maturing just at this time of year and the fish and turtles who come along.""

The trees drop their ripening guavas, figs, tucum, cashew fruits, and golosa fruits into the water and then the fish and turtles scoop them up. The fruits give them the essential calories which provide the energy that allows them to reproduce, Higgins explains.

“This is the exact time of year when they're reproducing,” she says. “It’s called the piracema, which is from the Tupi native words. It's something that all the fisherfolk communities are totally oriented to.”

But beginning in February of this year, Norte Energia diverted about 85% of the water that would have flowed into the Volta Grande so they could use it for the Belo Monte Dam. This was written into the original plan back in 2009, as something the company calls Hydrogram B, Higgins says.

At the time, the technical team of IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency of specifically criticized Hydrogram B. Essentially, Hydrogram B indicates that the largest amount of water released to the Volta Grande will be 8,000-cubic-meters-per-second in April, which is always the river’s peak, Higgins explains. About 20,000-cubic meters-per-second is the historical average in April on the Volta Grande.

The company signed an agreement more than a decade ago which said that its license was dependent upon them maintaining life on the Volta Grande. In December 2019, IBAMA's technical team said that Norte Energia had not proven scientifically that their plan could maintain the ecosystem on the Volta Grande and told them to conduct additional studies to prove that it could.

Instead, Higgins says, the president of IBAMA, Eduardo Fortunato Bim, stepped in and made an agreement with the president of Norte Energia that allowed them to implement Hydrogram B.

“The president didn't defend it,” Higgins says. “He simply said, ‘Go ahead, you can implement this Hydrogram B for a whole year.’ But there was no scientific evidence given for it. The experts I talked with, as well as the people on the Volta Grande, say this is a politically motivated decision.”

El Niño of 2016 provided a kind of natural test for what 2021 is going to look like on the Volta Grande, Higgins notes.

The Juruna, a local Indigenous tribe, say fish that year were ""very skinny,” she explains. “They’re supposed to have scales on them, [but] some were smooth. … They would cut them open and see that their eggs were dry or their eggs had been reabsorbed into their bodies. … They saw many turtles who were only bone, they had very little flesh on them. And when they cut the turtles open, they found that where there should be eggs, there was foam instead. The Juruna also noticed a clear change in the taste to acidic, bitter, and they weren't able to eat them.”

In April of 2016, the river flowed at 10,000-cubic-meters-per-second. “But now we're going to have 8,000-cubic-meters-per-second in April in 2021, so we can expect even more disastrous effects on the animals,” Higgins says.

People Higgins spoke with said Norte Energia’s hydrogram violates a wide range of national and international laws.

“Article 231 of the Brazilian Constitution says that hydroelectric dams cannot interfere with Indigenous territories. But this is exactly what's happening."" Tiffany Higgins, Mongabay

“Article 231 of the Brazilian Constitution says that hydroelectric dams cannot interfere with Indigenous territories,” she notes. “But this is exactly what's happening. Other conventions safeguard the fishing stock of Indigenous communities. In essence, you can't remove the food basis of a community.”

Related: How Indigenous land rights could help save the Brazilian Amazon from deforestation

In a video that Higgins filmed as part of her investigation, an Indigenous woman named Bel Juruna says, “This will be a cemetery of trees; this will be a cemetery of fish.” She adds, ""And so we Juruna, we will be here fighting so that we, too, won't become a cemetery in our village.""

“She's being quite literal,” says Higgins. According to a local scientist, Jansen Zuanon, the trees in the forest that are adapted to seasonally flooding will “experience functional death if they are not able to be flooded,” she says.

An ornithologist named Camila Ribas told Higgins that 60% of the birds in the area are adapted only to the flooded forest. “So when the forest dies, these special kinds of birds are going to die off, as well,” Higgins adds. “It'll create a wide patch of deforestation in this forest that will cut off the biological continuity [in] this wildlife corridor between what's called the upper Xingu River and the lower Xingu River.”

When Higgins contacted Norte Energia for her story, the company stated that “there is no technical, scientific proof that the company's hydrogram, i.e. Hydrogram B, will cause any harms to the animals, the fish and turtles of the Volta Grande,” Higgins reports. “In addition, they said, ‘We have robust scientific monitoring.’”

This is “perverse logic,” Higgins says, because Norte Energia is doing the monitoring itself while claiming there’s no proof their actions are going to harm any animals.

The video was posted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) that showed myriad turtle hatchlings whose scientific name is Podocnemis expansa. According to WCS, the turtle babies were emerging from a sandy beach in a protected area along the Purus River, which is a tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil.

The video has garnered over 20.5 k views on Twitter as netizens express their awe. One of the users commented, “A tsunami we all would like to see…,” while others congratulated the WCS conservationists for this awesome scene.

TURTLE TSUNAMI! @TheWCS releases incredible footage of mass hatching of locally endangered turtle: https://t.co/apenzRSzxd pic.twitter.com/KhA1aQsNYc— WCS Newsroom: #EarthStrong (@WCSNewsroom) December 14, 2020

The mass coming out of these turtles took place in the Reserva Biológica do Abufari (Abufari Biological Reserve) where animal conservationists from WCS Brazil have been monitoring adult females. The conservationists have been keeping a track of adult female turtles and their nests before, during, and after the birth of the hatchlings. The study is being conducted to improve the management and protection of this endangered species, which has been impacted by trafficking of their meat and eggs.

According to the WCS Brazil press release, the conservationists say the emergence occurred over several days during which period, around 71,000 hatchlings emerged in a day alone, while another 21,000 and few emerged days later.

WCS Brazil quoted Camila Ferrara, their Aquatic Turtle Specialist, who said that for the endangered giant South America river turtle, birth is an explosion of life as the video suggests quite clearly.

However, Camila also pointed out that it is one of their most fragile times as well. The mass birth is a way of increasing survival and the synchronization of birth allows these species to travel together to the river to start their new life.

The Giant South American river turtle is the largest freshwater turtle in Latin America. It can grow up to three and a half feet that is almost 1.07 meters and they can weigh upto 200 pounds that is 90 kilograms. These species of turtles play a crucial ecological role in nature as they disperse seeds that eventually help regenerate vegetation along river corridors around the Amazon basin.

WCS Brazil leads the project of conservation of these turtles in collaboration with ICMBIO and are sponsored by Fundação o Boticário.

58,58,FL-2015-000092-BRA,‘Out of control’: Brazil’s COVID surge sparks regional fears - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/10/out-of-control-brazils-covid-surge-sparks-regional-fears,"Brazil’s South American neighbours worry a COVID-19 variant will spread quickly and lead to another wave of deaths.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – Almost a year ago to the day, the jungle city of Manaus grabbed international headlines after a flood of COVID-19 deaths forced gravediggers to dig mass burials – catapulting the city into the centre of Brazil’s coronavirus outbreak.

Those scenes are now being repeated throughout Brazil, where authorities are working day and night to bury the dead, with experts warning that the country’s funeral services could be the next to topple.

Since the start of the year, an uncontrollable second wave has pushed Brazil over the 300,000 death mark. As the country continues to hit grim milestones – a record 4,247 deaths on Thursday alone – the entire South American nation is now the global COVID-19 epicentre, with experts warning that 5,000 Brazilians could lose their lives in a single day in April.

Much of the fear is being directed to the P1 variant, linked to the Brazilian Amazon. If Brazil cannot control its high transmission rate, experts fear the country’s healthcare tragedy could endanger the world. If the virus is left to circulate freely, it could create the ideal breeding ground for new and even more deadly variants.

Brazil’s neighbours have sealed off their borders to the country in a desperate attempt to prevent new variants from bleeding into the rest of the continent and harming vaccine efficiency.

“We’re very concerned. The staggering amount of deaths in Brazil in just a few months is our biggest worry,” virologist and researcher Humberto Debat, from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology told Al Jazeera.

Bolsonaro’s catastrophic response

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is increasingly being blamed for undermining the severity of the virus.

Even in the pandemic’s darkest hour, the far-right leader continues to ignore calls from health officials for a national lockdown, attacks the use of masks, ignores science, peddles unproven remedies and told Brazilians this week “there’s no use crying over spilled milk”, referring to Brazil’s soaring death toll.

“Unfortunately, we have a denialist president who refuses to follow science and encourages the public to follow,” said Ethel Maciel, a professor at the Federal University of São Paulo.

No social distancing

Experts have said a lack of social distancing measures has created the ideal environment for variants to mutate.

Since June 2020, Brazil’s infections and deaths marooned at a steady plateau of approximately 1,000 deaths a day, leading many to believe the worst was over. For months, Brazilians commuted on crammed public transport and packed its beaches, bars and nightclubs.

People wait to board a train at Luz station in São Paulo, Brazil, April 6, 2021 [Amanda Perobelli/Reuters] As Brazilians continued to flout containment measures, the P1 variant hatched, believed to have emerged in the Brazilian Amazon at the tail end of 2020. Weeks later, Manaus’ health system had all but collapsed.

According to the Fiocruz research institute, the P1 variant now accounts for more than 80 percent of cases in populous states, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Three months ago, it was 0 percent.

A ticking time bomb

Officials and experts are concerned about the speed with which the P1 variant, which is likely more infectious, is spreading and the damage it could pose globally.

“The virus has become ‘synchronised’ in the whole country, with intensive care units in several states at over 90 percent capacity,” said epidemiologist Daniel Villela from the Fiocruz branch in Rio de Janeiro.

As Brazil’s health system caves in, with intubation drugs and oxygen stocks critically low, Villela also told Al Jazeera that oversaturated hospitals were causing more deaths.

Meanwhile, Brazil’s painfully slow vaccine rollout, the result of disorganisation and a lack of urgency from Bolsonaro is worrying. To date, fewer than 10 percent of Brazil’s 212 million people have been vaccinated.

“The only way out is accelerating our vaccine drive and national coordinated COVID protocols,” explained Villela.

But after Bolsonaro refused to implement a national lockdown on Wednesday, experts fear transmission rates will continue to skyrocket.

Brazil could also spin out new, even more dangerous variants. The more people infected with the virus, the more mutations we’re going to see,” epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told Al Jazeera.

Despite promising news on Wednesday of preliminary results from a continuing study finding China’s Sinovac vaccine to be 50 percent effective against the P1 strain, experts have warned that the speed with which the virus is mutating could spell disaster for current vaccine campaigns.

“The 4,000 Brazilian deaths on Tuesday show that the virus is circulating in great quantities, mutating and evolving quickly. It’s trying to find a way to escape natural antibodies,” said Felipe Naveca, a virologist at Fiocruz Amazonas.

“It’s a nuclear reactor that has set off a chain reaction and is out of control,” Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University in the US, told the Reuters news agency this week.

“We desperately need to stop it from spreading in Brazil and other countries with high transmission rates,” Naveca said.

‘How many more lives will we have to lose?’

Brazil’s crisis is now being felt well beyond its borders. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) reported that the P1 variant has been found to be driving the second wave in at least 15 nations in the Americas.

Once championed as Latin America’s COVID poster child, Uruguay is now grappling with an explosive surge in deaths. According to government data, the 121 COVID deaths recorded in April has exceeded last year’s total COVID deaths.

“Uruguay is a good example of how things could get bad quickly,” said the Argentinian virologist Debat, who is monitoring the genome sequences of variants of concern.

A healthcare worker takes a swab sample from a man to be tested for the coronavirus disease in Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 6, 2021 [Agustin Marcarian/Reuters] The P1 variant has also been detected in Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia, Peru and Chile, as well as Canada and the United States.

Experts argue that sealing their borders will have little effect now variants of concern have entered.

“It’s too late to keep the P1 out. But it’s also too late to build immunity to the second wave. Only 40 percent of Argentinians over 70 have received their first dose. Still, we’re doing anything to delay it,” Debat explained.

Is now a good time for retail investors to buy emerging market stocks and bonds?

At the height of a pandemic, as growth stutters across the developing world and governments struggle to replicate the success of vaccine rollouts in advanced economies, it may seem odd even to pose such a question. Yet, it seems to be one that many investors are not only asking, but answering with a “yes”.

The number and value of emerging market-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) and similar products — tradeable funds that typically appeal to retail investors — have risen remarkably during the coronavirus crisis.

There were 1,670 such products worldwide at the end of March, according to industry watcher ETFGI, up from 1,447 at the start of last year, while their market capitalisation rose by more than a quarter to $742bn (£528bn) over the same period.

What’s more, retail investors seem attuned to strengths and weaknesses among the emerging markets (EMs), with their eyes drawn less by problem-hit Brazil than by the huge energies of China.

Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-biggest fund supermarket, says China-focused investment trusts and mutual funds feature strikingly among its biggest sellers so far this year — two out of four EM products in the top 40 investment trusts and one in three in the top 40 mutual funds — when there were none in the same period of 2020.

Deborah Fuhr, US-based founder of ETFGI, says many retail investors, with time on their hands during the pandemic, have taken an interest in global investment themes, such as Chinese technology stocks, especially when they are discussed on television. “A lot of men — I don’t think they had a lot of hobbies they did at home,” she says. “Being locked in the house, many of them decided to put some money aside to play with.”

Retail investors are riding on the back of a broader institutional surge into EMs. Data from industry watcher Morningstar shows that investors pumped more than $100bn into EM stocks and bonds in the nine months to the end of March, more than making up for the roughly $44bn they withdrew in the first half of last year as the pandemic took hold.

“What we can say with a high degree of confidence is that investors at large have begun to dedicate more to emerging markets,” says Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s director of global ETF research. Flows into the asset class broadly over the past 12 months amount to “probably the most significant sign of interest we have seen in about a decade”.

But this all comes against a tricky background for emerging economies. On the one hand, their share of global output has surged this century, doubling in dollar terms. On the other, it is still just 40 per cent of the total, even though they are home to more than 80 per cent of the world’s population. And the pandemic is having an uneven impact, wreaking havoc in Brazil, for example, but largely sparing China.

Also, gross domestic product growth does not translate easily into stock market returns. With markets often skewed by government intervention and opaque rules, well-connected local business people tend to do better than regular financial investors. Emerging markets provide about three-quarters of global economic growth, but their equities have lagged behind the S&P 500 index of US stocks for much of the past decade.

Developed world retail investors have barely dipped their toes into emerging markets. Investment trusts, mutual funds and ETFs — the kind of vehicles favoured by small investors — make up a tiny share of the total investment in EM stocks and bonds, and that share has barely budged for a decade. So there is plenty of scope for increasing EM exposure without upsetting the balance of the average portfolio.

With many analysts thinking that the outperformance of US stocks in recent years is looking decidedly frothy, could views now change? Might this be the moment to look again at emerging markets in general?

FT Money takes a look at the pros and cons.

A new story with old roots

There is a long history of investors hunting for profit in undeveloped economies — whether in Latin American railways, South African gold or Indonesian rubber.

The modern story of EMs starts in the 1980s, when fund managers in the UK and other rich countries sought to take advantage of the high returns on offer from fast-growing countries in Latin America, south-east Asia and other parts of the developing world.

The countries classified as emerging markets have changed almost beyond recognition since then. Today’s MSCI EM index of equities in 27 countries — the most widely-followed benchmark — includes some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and the Czech Republic, that have made such progress that few outside the index-driven investment community would regard them as any less developed than industrialised economies.

But while the landscape has changed, the proposition remains the same: emerging markets, as they catch up with countries in the developed world, will grow more quickly, offering greater rates of return on investments. The downside is that such growth, and the returns, can be highly erratic.

The profits were often stellar during the commodities supercycle of the 1990s and 2000s, when Chines demand fuelled growth in raw materials exporters such as Brazil. Since then, some formerly fast-growing economies — not least Brazil — have suffered stagnation and recession, prompting some to ask whether EM investing still makes sense at all.

Still, some states, especially the south-east Asian countries, have learnt to avoid past mistakes. They have generally tamed inflation, managed domestic and external deficits well, and coped better with volatility by reducing reliance on foreign debt and building cash buffers of foreign reserves.

The rise of China

The biggest single transformation has been the seemingly relentless rise of China. Its demand for commodities — of all varieties, agricultural as well as mineral — was such that many emerging economies rode through the global financial crisis of 2008-09 relatively unscathed. Since then, its growth has remained the single most powerful driver in the developing world.

Nevertheless, emerging economies are not immune to shocks. The “taper tantrum” of 2013 reminded investors that EMs are at the mercy of bigger forces. The US Federal Reserve caused waves when it suggested it might soon begin tapering a massive economy-boosting bond-buying programme — indicating that the rock-bottom yields might soon begin to rise. Foreign investors withdrew from EMs en masse, irrespective of how successfully or otherwise policymakers had reformed their economies.

Since then, the highs and lows of EM assets have often been driven by the US dollar. When the dollar is weak and US growth is slow, investors are willing to take more risk. At such times, EMs offer attractive returns.

But when the US dollar strengthens — as it did unexpectedly in 2018, catching many EM investors off-guard — money can flood out. At times like these, even Chinese assets can take a beating.

These forces are at work today. With the US economy rebounding from the pandemic more quickly than many expected, the biggest issue on the minds of professional investors is whether — or rather, when — US inflation and interest rates will rise, spurred by the Biden administration’s huge fiscal stimulus. If US yields suddenly become tempting again, emerging markets could once more see money sucked away to America.

“The US fiscal spend completely dominates the debate,” said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS investment bank and an emerging markets specialist.

But while familiar dangers still lurk so too do the incentives for EM investing. As Jan Dehn, a longtime flag-bearer for EM investing at specialist fund manager Ashmore, pointed out in 2019, emerging economies at that point accounted for 74 per cent of global economic growth and were forecast to contribute 84 per cent by 2023. The pandemic may have slowed the pace of that advance, yet few doubt that, in the long term, EMs are where the growth is.

Yet, gaining a share of the upside from that growth is challenging as the risks are unevenly spread. Contagion between markets is much less than it was. When a crisis blows up in a more volatile market such as Argentina or Turkey, it no longer sweeps across the rest of the asset class. Each emerging market has its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the correlations between them are now lower.

What became of the Brics?

Of the Brics held up as future stars by economist Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs in 2001 — Brazil, Russia, India, China and, a later addition, South Africa — three have lost their shine.

India and China, however, have continued to deliver. Beijing’s huge stimulus during the global financial crisis saved not only its own economy but also those of many other developing countries and, perhaps, even the industrialised world.

Beijing’s focus has changed in recent years, from investment to consumption as the driver of its economy, with a concern for financial stability tempering its enthusiasm for credit-fuelled growth. Investors in EM assets should keep a close watch on policy.

India has also seen strong growth over the past decade. This year, it was able to announce a big increase in public spending to counter the pandemic without scaring investors — a testament to their faith in its growth story, although the ferocious second wave of Covid-19 sweeping the country over the past month has raised questions.

By contrast, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have all seen growth stutter, stagnate or even go into reverse during the past decade.

Nicolaj Sebrell, senior equity analyst at Rowan Dartington, part of the St James’s Place wealth management business, says the gains from a country-by-country strategy are potentially great.

He argues that investors can outperform by avoiding basket cases like Venezuela and Argentina and sticking to states with credible policies, reasonable growth prospects and inexpensively priced markets. He says: “EM is an asset class because we’ve defined it that way. But it’s also just a selection of countries. If you can treat them all as individual markets, that has some real advantages.”

Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, says this is an approach not open to many. Only those unconstrained by liquidity and time — sovereign wealth funds and the very rich — he says, can benefit from country-specific knowledge and sit through the risk-on, risk-off cycles of US monetary policy. “For the rest of us, sadly, index-hugging is the default option.”

Nevertheless, the outlook remains uncertain, with the pandemic increasing the differences between states. It is hard to see how those economies that were foundering before the coronavirus crisis will be any better placed afterwards. But those countries that have managed the pandemic well — notably in east Asia — could be rewarded with new investment.

Funds offer a good way in to emerging markets Most investors taking their first steps into emerging markets will do so through actively managed funds, such as investment trusts and mutual funds, which typically aim to beat the market for a fee. Or they will use passively managed exchange traded funds (ETFs), which aim to replicate a benchmark index, charge no or very low fees, and can be bought and sold like shares. Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at Interactive Investor, says that while emerging markets will benefit from the post-pandemic recovery, and the long-term investment case remains intact, “for most emerging markets, vaccination against Covid-19 remains a story for this year and, probably, next year as well”. It is hard to gauge how significant retail investment is in emerging markets. Data from Morningstar suggests that while total investments in EM stock and bonds are worth two and a half times today what they were a decade ago, the amount represented by investment funds — popular in the retail market — is still small. Mutual funds, open-ended trusts and ETFs made up less than 2.5 per cent of global emerging markets equity at the end of March, the data show, unchanged from 10 years ago. In fixed income funds, the share was slightly less than 1 per cent, also unchanged over the decade. Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, says it is hard to say how much of this comes from retail investors and how much from institutions. He says retail investors are likely to be influenced by home bias more than institutional investors. “Retail investors globally are under allocated not just to emerging markets but to any markets outside their home country . . . It’s a characteristic of human behaviour, and I wouldn’t expect to see a dramatic change in any of our lifetimes.” But a preference for home does not necessarily rule out EM exposure. Unilever in the UK and Yum Brands in the US are old favourites among investors looking for a local play on EMs without the complication of investing overseas. Globalisation has multiplied such opportunities. More than 200 Chinese companies are listed on US exchanges, for example, including internet giants such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Deborah Fuhr of ETF data service ETFGI says one trend driving more retail investment in emerging markets is the rise of so-called robo-advisers. At Wealthfront, for example, a portfolio with a high risk weighting of 8 out of 10 would include a 16 per cent allocation to emerging markets — more aggressive than the median allocation of 6 to 7 per cent among global equity funds. At II, Lipski suggests four funds for retail investors to consider, starting with JPMorgan Emerging Markets Trust, which is conservatively run, with a bias towards domestic consumption. Then there is Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Sustainability Fund, which took account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues long before ESG became a buzzword. Lipski also likes M&G Emerging Markets Bond Fund, for a mix of government and corporate bonds in local and hard currency, and Utilico Emerging Markets Trust, a play on infrastructure opportunities. Michael Arno, a portfolio manager at investment company Brandywine, says that despite the changing nature of emerging markets, the old rules apply. “It’s all about portfolio diversification and making sure you are not taking an exuberant amount of risk, or no more than you can handle,” he says. “But emerging markets are the growing part of the global economy and there are definitely periods when one should be invested.”","Thu, 13 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1a784b36-a7e6-4c20-9aab-e0b6433dccf0.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,"['investment', 'growth', 'funds', 'covid', 'risk', 'investors', 'retail', 'reward', 'emerging', 'global', 'pandemic', 'em', 'markets']",

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

What happens to a rich and unique biome when so much is destroyed?

The unprecedented fires in the wetland have attracted less attention than blazes in Australia, the Western United States and the Amazon, its celebrity sibling to the north. But while the Pantanal is not a global household name, tourists in the know flock there because it is home to exceptionally high concentrations of breathtaking wildlife: Jaguars, tapirs, endangered giant otters and bright blue hyacinth macaws. Like a vast tub, the wetland swells with water during the rainy season and empties out during the dry months. Fittingly, this rhythm has a name that evokes a beating heart: the flood pulse.

The wetland, which is larger than Greece and stretches over parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, also offers unseen gifts to a vast swath of South America by regulating the water cycle upon which life depends. Its countless swamps, lagoons and tributaries purify water and help prevent floods and droughts. They also store untold amounts of carbon, helping to stabilize the climate.

For centuries, ranchers have used fire to clear fields and new land. But this year, drought worsened by climate change turned the wetlands into a tinderbox and the fires raged out of control.

“The extent of fires is staggering,” said Douglas C. Morton, who leads the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and studies fire and food production in South America. “When you wipe out a quarter of a biome, you create all kinds of unprecedented circumstances.”

His analysis showed that at least 22 percent of the Pantanal in Brazil has burned since January, with the worst fires, in August and September, blazing for two months straight.

Naturally occurring fire plays a role in the Pantanal, in addition to the burning by ranchers. The flames are usually contained by the landscape’s mosaic of water. But this year’s drought sucked these natural barriers dry. The fires are far worse than any since satellite records began.

Instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites have experienced periodic failures. · Source: NASA Terra and Aqua satellite data, based on detections with greater than 95 percent confidence levels.

The fires are also worse than any in the memory of the Guató people, an Indigenous group whose ancestors have lived in the Pantanal for thousands of years.

Guató leaders in an Indigenous territory called Baía dos Guató said the fires spread from the ranches that surround their land, and satellite images confirm that the flames swept in from the outside. When fire started closing in on the home of Sandra Guató Silva, a community leader and healer, she fought to save it with the help of her son, grandson and a boat captain with a hose.

For many desperate hours, she said, they threw buckets of river water and sprayed the area around the house and its roof of thatched palm leaves. They succeeded in defending it, but at least 85 percent of her people’s territory burned, according to Instituto Centro de Vida, a nonprofit group that monitors land use in the area. Throughout the Pantanal, almost half of the Indigenous lands burned, an investigative journalism organization called Agência Pública found.

Now Ms. Guató Silva mourns the loss of nature itself. “It makes me sick,” she said. “The birds don’t sing anymore. I no longer hear the song of the Chaco chachalaca bird. Even the jaguar that once scared me is suffering. That hurts me. I suffer from depression because of this. Now there is a hollow silence. I feel as though our freedom has left us, has been taken from us with the nature that we have always protected.”

Now these people of the wetlands, some still coughing after weeks of smoke, are depending on donations of water and food. They fear that once the rains come in October, ash will run into the rivers and kill the fish they rely on for their food and livelihood.

“I couldn’t help but think, our Pantanal is dead,” said Eunice Morais de Amorim, another member of the community. “It is so terrible.”

Scientists are scrambling to determine an estimate of animals killed in the fires. While large mammals and birds have suffered casualties, many were able to run or fly away. It appears that reptiles, amphibians and small mammals have fared the worst. In places like California, small animals often take refuge underground during wildfires. But in the Pantanal, scientists say, fires burn underground too, fueled by dried-out wetland vegetation. One of the hard-hit places was a national park designated as a United Nations World Heritage site.

“I don’t want to be an alarmist,” said José Sabino, a biologist at the Anhanguera-Uniderp University in Brazil who studies the Pantanal, “but in a region where 25 percent has burned, there is a huge loss.”

As the worst flames raged in August and September, biologists, ecotourism guides and other volunteers turned into firefighters, sometimes working 24 hours at a time. Fernando Tortato, a conservation scientist with Panthera, a group that advocates for big cats, visited the Pantanal in early August to install cameras for his research monitoring jaguars and ocelots. But he found the camera sites burned.

“I said to my boss, I need to change my job,” Mr. Tortato said. “I need to be a firefighter.” Instead of returning home to his family, he spent much of the next two months digging fire breaks with a bulldozer in an urgent attempt to protect forested areas.

One day in September, working under an orange sky, he and his team finished a huge semicircular fire break, using a wide river along one side to protect more than 3,000 hectares, he said, a vital refuge for wildlife. But as the men stood there, pleased with their accomplishment, they watched as flaming debris suddenly jumped the river, igniting the area they thought was safe. They raced into boats and tried to douse the spread, but the flames quickly climbed too high.

“That’s the moment that we lost hope, almost,” Mr. Tortato said. “But the next day we woke up and started again.”

Mr. Tortato knows of three injured jaguars, one with third-degree burns on her paws. All were treated by veterinarians. Now, biologists are braced for the next wave of deaths from starvation; first the herbivores, left without vegetation, and then the carnivores, left without the herbivores.

“It’s a cascade effect,” Mr. Tortato said.

Animal rescue volunteers have flocked to the Pantanal, delivering injured animals to pop-up veterinary triage stations and leaving food and water for other animals to find. Larissa Pratta Campos, a veterinary student, has helped treat wild boar, marsh deer, birds, primates and a raccoon-like creature called a coati.

“We are working in the middle of a crisis,” Ms. Pratta Campos said. “I have woken up many times in the middle of the night to tend to animals here.”

Last week, the O Globo newspaper reported that firefighting specialists from Brazil's main environmental protection agency were stymied by bureaucratic procedures, delaying their deployment by four months.

Given the historic scope of the fires, their long-term consequences on the Pantanal are unclear. The ecosystem’s grasslands may recover quickly, followed by its shrublands and swamps over the next few years, said Wolfgang J. Junk, a scientist who specializes in the region. But the forests will require decades or centuries.

Even more critical than the impact of this year’s fires, scientists say, is what they tell us about the underlying health of the wetlands. Like a patient whose high fever signals a dangerous infection, the extent of the wildfires is a symptom of grave threats to the Pantanal, both from inside and out.

More than 90 percent of the Pantanal is privately owned. Ranchers have raised cattle there for hundreds of years, and ecologists emphasize that many do so sustainably. But new farmers are moving in, often with little understanding of how to use fire properly, said Cátia Nunes, a scientist from the Brazilian National Institute for Science and Technology in Wetlands. Moreover, cattle farming in the highlands has put pressure on local farmers to increase the size of their herds, using more land as they do so.

Eduardo Eubank Campos, a fifth-generation rancher, remembers his family using controlled burns to clear the land when he was a boy. He said they stopped after adding an ecotourism lodge to their 7,000 hectare property, which now includes reserves and fields on which they raise about 2,000 head of cattle and horses. This year, thanks to firebreaks, a water tank truck and workers quickly trained to fight fire, they were able to keep the flames at bay. The worst impact was on his ecotourism business, hit first by the coronavirus and then by the wildfires. It brings in three-quarters of his revenue.

Mr. Eubank Campos struggles to understand who would set fires when the land was so dry. “Pantaneiros know this is not the time to do burns,” Mr. Eubank Campos said, using a term for the locals that also conveys a culture built up over centuries ranching in the wetland. “They don’t want to destroy their own land.”

The Brazilian federal police are investigating the fires, some of which appear to have been illegally targeting forests.

Still, when asked about the biggest threat to the Pantanal, Mr. Eubank Campos’s answer highlights the region’s political and cultural fault lines. “I fear those organizations that come here wanting to exploit the issue and eventually ‘close’ the Pantanal, turn it into one big reserve and kick out the Pantaneiros,” he said.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a promise to weaken conservation regulations, is popular in the region.

But Mr. Eubank Campos agrees with ecologists on a major threat to the Pantanal that comes from its borders and beyond.

Because ecosystems are interconnected, the well-being of the wetland is at the mercy of the booming agriculture in the surrounding highlands. The huge fields of soy, other grains and cattle — commodities traded around the world — cause soil erosion that flows into the Pantanal, clogging its rivers so severely that some have become accidental dams, robbing the area downstream of water.

The rampant deforestation and related fires in the neighboring Amazon also create a domino effect, disrupting the rainforest’s “flying rivers” of precipitation that contribute to rainfall to the Pantanal. Damming for hydroelectric power deflects water away, scientists say, and a proposal to channelize the wetland’s main river would make it drain too quickly.

But perhaps the most ominous danger comes from even further afield: climate change. The effects that models have predicted, a much hotter Pantanal alternating between severe drought and extreme rainfall, are already being felt, scientists say. A study published this year found that climate change poses “a critical threat” to the ecosystem, damaging biodiversity and impairing its ability to help regulate water for the continent and carbon for the world. In less than 20 years, it found that the northern Pantanal may turn into a savanna or even an arid zone.

“We are digging our grave,” said Karl-Ludwig Schuchmann, an ecologist with Brazil’s National Institute of Science and Technology in Wetlands and one of the study’s authors.

To save the Pantanal, scientists offer solutions: Reduce climate change immediately. Practice sustainable agriculture in and around the wetland. Pay ranchers to preserve forests and other natural areas on their land. Increase ecotourism. Do not divert the Pantanal’s waters, because its flood pulse is its life.

“Everybody talks about, ‘we have to avoid this and that,’” Dr. Schuchmann said. “But little is done.”","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/12/us/pantanal-brazil-fires-promo-1602539858586/pantanal-brazil-fires-promo-1602539858586-facebookJumbo-v7.jpg,"['amazon', 'worlds', 'water', 'indigenous', 'wetland', 'brazil', 'fires', 'inferno', 'tropical', 'largest', 'area', 'pantanal', 'guató', 'land']",

According to Brazil’s meteorological agency, INMET, Brazil's extreme rainfall is caused by the location of the country, in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). SACZ describes an area that has monsoonal characteristics, which causes Brazil's summer thunderstorms.

Though the amount of rain that fell on Brazil between Dec. 25 and Jan. 26 was double the historical average.

Between Jan. 23 - 24, the city of Belo Horizonte saw 171 mm of rain. This amount obliterated the standing record set 110 years before.

In the state of Minas Gerais, more than 15,000 people were evacuated from their homes. In the state of Espirito Santo, 10,000 people were evacuated, and in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, 6,000 were evacuated.

Those who were evacuated stayed at makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations.

In Minas Gerais, Brazil's second-most populous state, about 40 municipalities were badly hit.

The aggressive rainfall and flooding led to landslides.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sent in the Brazilian Armed Forces to provide aid in the affected regions.

The floods and landslides killed 70 people.

A.1 Description of the Disaster

Heavy rains affected the Northeast Region of Brazil in June 2017, the main states affected were Alagoas and Pernambuco. These states recorded historical rainfall levels in a 24-hour period. In Alagoas, the Maceió station registered 152.4 mm on 27 May, exceeding the previous record. In Pernambuco, the Joao Pessoa station 129.8 mm on 29 May.

In the state of Alagoas, there were seven days of intense rains. The municipalities belonging to the Metropolitan Region, Maceió, Valle de Paraiba, Valle de Mundau, al Litoral Norte, Grota de Santo, Marechal suffered severe flooding affecting 53,453 people and more than 22 municipalities. Likewise, 29 cities and 47,477 people were affected by heavy rains and related landslides in the state of Pernambuco, mainly affecting their homes, causing internal displacement during the first weeks.

At the close of the operation, the rains had fallen significantly, facilitating response and recovery actions by the municipalities and authorities of both states. In Alagoas, the Army provided care through its field hospitals while health centres affected by the floods were recovering, and the local government authorized the occupation of popular houses in order to demobilize the shelters. Similarly, in Pernambuco families returned to their homes and have progressively recovered with the support of the authorities, self-management and response institutions. government authorized the occupation of popular houses in order to demobilize the shelters.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Reports are emerging of Brazilian health workers forced to intubate patients without the aid of sedatives, after weeks of warnings that hospitals and state governments risked running out of critical medicines.

One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.

“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”

Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.

“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.

The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.

It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.

Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.

“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”

His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.

Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.

He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”

For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains ""a daily concern.″

A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.

The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.

A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.

Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.

“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.

Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.

Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.

The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.12newsnow.com/assets/CCT/images/d403a652-d202-4eb3-9a09-fb5ea16d04ed/d403a652-d202-4eb3-9a09-fb5ea16d04ed_1140x641.jpg,"['patients', 'drug', 'brazil', 'health', 'makes', 'covid', 'states', 'hospitals', 'state', 'outbreak', 'sedatives', 'shortage', 'rio', 'reported', 'intubation', 'brutal', 'days']", 
67,67,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Brazil region swept by floods and record rains faces muddy desolation - Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2020-01-brazil-region-swept-muddy-desolation.html,"A flooded house in the Brazilian town of Sabara, near Belo Horizonte, in January 2020

Elaine Almeida looked at her aunt's ruined house in Sabara, a town in a southeastern region of Brazil where at least 45 people have died in floods that followed record rainfall.

""The water rose more than two meters, she lost everything,"" Almeida said.

She and her aunt tried pushing the door of the house open, but the mud inside was so deep they had to give up.

In Sabara, a town of some 130,000 residents on the edge of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, homes built on the banks of the Rio das Velhas river were completely submerged by mud and water, their roofs either ripped off by the surging current or caved in under the weight of the mud.

The football pitch in front of the aunt's house has completely disappeared under a thick brown layer of mud.

""The water rose very quickly and she couldn't leave by the front door, she had to climb over three walls to escape,"" said Elaine, 36, who is putting her aunt up while she looks for a new place to live.

Elaine's own house was spared the worst because she lives in a hillier part of Sabara.

Like her aunt, 15,000 people had to leave their homes across Minas Gerais, where more than 100 towns have been put on a state of alert.

At least 45 people have been killed in the floods, with the death toll expected to rise still further

Most of those who died in the wake of the violent storms that swept the southeast of Brazil perished in landslides or when their homes collapsed in the floods and unprecedented rains.

The authorities reported 44 dead late Sunday but a 45th fatality was reported Monday and the toll is expected to rise further, with another 18 people still listed as missing.

'Critical situation'

Gilvan Jesus Amorim, 43, only just escaped the worst. ""I didn't managed to save anything except my own life,"" he said, looking crushed.

""There's nothing to salvage, I'll have to throw everything away,"" said Amorim, who has been living for three days with his wife and daughter at a neighbor's house, with no running water or electricity.

""When it started raining, I told my wife we had to sleep upstairs and we took a mattress up there. But a few hours later the water started to rise really fast and we had to leave,"" he said.

His street is strewn with household items all coated in mud: refrigerators, remote controls, mattresses, scattered clothes.

""It's one of the worst floods I've ever seen, the situation is critical,"" said Lucimara Soares, a 42-year-old cleaner.

""Lots of my friends have lost everything, they have nothing left,"" she said.

Firefighters and the Red Cross have launched a campaign to gather donations to help the flood victims.

Most of the buildings that were destroyed had been built without permits and in areas considered to be at risk. The National Meteorological Institute said the rainfall was the heaviest ever recorded in Minas Gerais since records began 110 years ago.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel”.

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing”.

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

71,71,FL-2015-000092-BRA,News Feature: A sea in the Amazon - pnas.org,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2102396118,"Did the Caribbean sweep into the western Amazon millions of years ago, shaping the region’s rich biodiversity?

A tropical shrub called Chrysobalanus icaco pushes up through Brazil’s white sandy beaches. The plant’s leathery oval leaves and tough silver bark give it the distinct appearance of a mangrove species, adapted to a life buffeted by saltwater. Strangely, though, C. icaco also turns up more than a thousand miles inland, in the forests of the western Amazon. “We find fossil mangroves and associated coastal plants in the middle of the Amazon,” says paleoecologist Carina Hoorn, at the University of Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

New evidence, including geophysical modeling, supports the contentious notion that the Caribbean flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene. Image credit: Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), Victor Sacek (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), and Lucy Reading-Ikkanda (artist).

The shrub’s appearance inland with an assemblage of mangrove plants, noted in a 2019 article, is among the latest lines of evidence hinting that the Caribbean Sea flooded into the western Amazon during the Miocene, sometime in the last 10 to 20 million years (1). If it did, the region could have been awash in shallow saltwater for hundreds of thousands of years after the flooding. C. icaco and other plants may have spread into Brazil’s interior by dispersing along this sea’s beaches, before the water retreated and forest reclaimed the land (2).

The prevailing view of the western Amazon during the Miocene is one of a massive wetland, twice the size of Texas, furred with rainforest and streaked with lakes and tributaries. Whether this wetland was ever inundated by seawater remains a matter of some debate amongst geologists, paleontologists, ecologists, biogeographers, and researchers of pollen known as palynologists. All of them are united by the desire to answer a much larger question: How did the Amazon become so species-rich? That question, Hoorn says, is the “overarching motive that brings us all together.”

Several recent studies bolster the case that the Caribbean swept inland. A 2017 analysis of rock cores from Colombia and Brazil, for example, revealed changes in sediments as well as uncovering a fossilized shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years (3). If an inland sea did reach the western Amazon, the changing landscape would have shaped patterns of species dispersal and ultimately diversification. Other lines of evidence, including the occurrence of Amazon River dolphins, sharks, stingrays, and manatees, also suggest that the area was once inundated by saltwater (4).

A series of new geophysical models provide some explanation for how the flooding might have occurred, suggesting a combination of global sea level rise, uplift of the Andes Mountains, and changes in plate tectonics and mantle dynamics. All of these factors would have worked in concert to pull down on the Earth’s crust and form a flooded depression in the continent. To find out whether this really happened, geologists will begin the largest sampling project to date, likely this summer, drilling rock cores from three Brazilian sites in search of definitive evidence.

A Lush History No one really knows what the view would have been, standing on a summit of the Andes Mountains about 20 million years ago. From a peak in modern-day Peru, looking north and east, some researchers imagine they’d have seen a glittering inland ocean, “where you could go from Paraguay to Venezuela in a boat,” says palynologist Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, in Panama City, Panama. Still others picture a landscape of freshwater marshes, he says, with “no marine evidence at all.” For his part, Jaramillo envisions multiple intervals during the Miocene when the ocean surged into the western Amazon, creating a continuous inland sea. Saltwater currents would have poured in from the Caribbean in the north, where they mixed with fresh water pouring down from torrential rains. Flooding periods would have been relatively brief, however. For the majority of the epoch, the ocean receded, leaving a freshwater megawetland of interconnected lakes and snaking channels with a narrow neck to the Caribbean in the north. The salinity would have been low, because the wetland was mostly freshwater, but episodically salty, says paleontologist Frank Wesselingh. He’s spent two decades studying the ancient western Amazon and is now part of the Netherlands’ Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. Beneath the water’s surface, Wesselingh imagines a carnival of colorful fish, as well as stingrays, manatees, and dolphins. Even typically bland mud snails may have been striking, Wesselingh says, based on evidence of squiggled lines and shell ornamentation on 19-million-year-old aquatic snail fossils in the area (5). “I’d love to go snorkeling,” he says, “but there were also 14-meter-long caimans and 11-meter-long gharials. There were all kinds of not-so-nice creatures that would be a problem for us.” Such swirling visions of mangroves and salty, brackish water are relatively new for the Amazon. When Hoorn began her PhD fieldwork in 1988, collecting sediment and pollen samples in the Colombian, Peruvian, and Brazilian Amazon, the origins of Amazonian biodiversity were hotly debated. Most biologists at the time focused on the region’s more recent history, just the last 2.6 million years, to explain the evolution of biodiversity there. They thought that forest and savannah expanded and contracted between glacial periods, bounded by stable rivers that flowed along the same paths for millennia. Geologist and ornithologist Jürgen Haffer first proposed that theory in 1969, at a time when most biologists thought new species only arose through geographic isolation (6). Haffer assumed a patchwork of isolated refuges of forest and savannah, each an evolutionary haven (7). His ideas dominated the field through the 1980s. But by the time Hoorn came along, cracks had appeared in Haffer’s theory, and disagreements over his views had become “quite personal,” Hoorn recalls. Ultimately, in the early 1990s, a variety of studies refuted Haffer’s view, including work on pollen which revealed a recent history of continuous forest cover rather than patchy tree stands (8). Without patchy forest, a theory of geographic isolation didn’t hold up. Paleoecologists went back to the drawing board to figure out what had driven Amazonian diversification. Although Hoorn was aware of the debate raging all around her, “I felt like I had nothing to do with it,” she says, because her research focused on the Amazon’s much deeper past than the last 2.6 million years. “I lived happily like that,” she says with a chuckle. But in her fieldwork collecting clay and soil samples around the top of South America, Hoorn discovered evidence of fossilized pollen from mangrove trees. She published a seminal study in 1993 suggesting that the pollen was evidence of a megawetland in western Amazonia during the Miocene, 10 to 20 million years ago, which was subject to coastal influence through several periods of marine flooding (9). Shortly after Hoorn finished her doctorate, she took a break from research. Upon her return to Europe in 1999, she was “very surprised” to find that her thesis had exploded across the Amazonian research community. Whereas Hoorn’s Miocene wetland theory has largely been accepted since 1993, according to palynologist Jaramillo, the marine flooding aspect has remained more controversial—in part because of the difficulty of fieldwork in the Amazon, he says. The forest is so dense that geologists tend to travel by riverboat rather than overland, searching for the relatively few exposed rock faces that poke out from under the thick cover of vegetation. Research teams collect sediment samples from the cliffs along the riverbanks. But the cliffs jut out at odd angles, making it difficult to tell whether two outcropping rock faces are the same age based on stratified rock layers alone. Some show evidence of marine influence. Fossilized mollusks and ostracods stud certain cliffs, and oxygen- and carbon-stable isotope ratios in some samples also point to saltwater flooding (10). But not all riverbank sediments tell the same story, and none is unequivocally marine. Even among those that support marine influence, there are seeming contradictions. In a study Wesselingh published in 2006, for instance, he found fossilized saltwater invertebrates alongside freshwater mollusks in the same rocky outcrop. He concluded that the fossils could be different ages. Or, if they were the same age, the saltwater invertebrates could have evolved an unusual tolerance for freshwater (11). Without limestone deposits or fossilized whale skeletons—the kind of material that plainly shows areas once under oceans in other parts of the world—the debate over the Amazon rages on. The Caribbean may have swept south twice during the Miocene, penetrating a landscape dominated by freshwater lakes, swamps, rivers, and rainforest. Image credit: Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama) and Lucy Reading-Ikkanda (artist).

Shifting Tides Jaramillo himself was skeptical of an Amazonian sea until about three years ago. Fossil-strewn rock cores changed his mind. Stored in the laboratory of Paleoflora in Bucaramanga, Colombia, each core is a cylinder of shale, clay, and sandstone, drilled out of sites in northern Brazil or Southern Colombia. The Brazilian geological survey and a Colombian oil company had collected them in the 1970s, in search of coal and oil. And although the cores were old and in some cases broken or incomplete, they offered the best available window on the past, Jaramillo says. With a hand lens pressed to his eye, Jaramillo scanned each core, inspecting the many different layers of sediment, deposited one on top of the other over millions of years. Some of the layers were unmistakably river mud, with the kinds of fine-grained sediments, sandstones, and mudstones that tend to accumulate in tributaries today. But two of the layers were more typically marine. Organic peat, algae, and fossil fragments hinted at salty estuarine environments. Under a microscope, the fossils included about 20 different species of dinoflagellates found in Miocene marine deposits worldwide. Two larger fossils, a shark tooth and a marine mantis shrimp, provided further evidence for ocean flooding. Pollen records from the two marine sediment layers suggest that they date to 18 million years ago and 14 million years ago, respectively. “The logical conclusion is the ocean was there,” Jaramillo explains. His 2017 analysis of the cores demonstrated two marine intervals when ocean waters reached the western Amazon, he says, with the incursion likely starting from the Caribbean in the north and flowing south along the foot of the Andes (3). In each case, the water advanced and then retreated over periods as short as half a million years. Jaramillo suspects that a combination of tectonic processes and punctuated global sea level rise flooded a depression in the continent. Geological models published since 2010 suggest such a scenario is possible (12). High-speed video simulations show the uplift of the Andean cordillera over tens of millions of years and, in some cases, the subsequent submersion of western Amazonia. Over a Zoom call from his office at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, geophysicist Victor Sacek screen-shared one such model, which he first developed in 2014. It simulates the surface of South America during the uplift of the Andes, beginning sometime between 30 million and 60 million years ago. The initial model described geological processes at the level of Earth’s crust, such as erosion, sedimentation, and the formation of the Andean Cordillera. In 2019, PhD student Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo updated the model to also approximate processes deep in the Earth, including convection in the mantle below the South American continent. To picture mantle convection, Sacek says, first imagine the western edge of South America colliding with the oceanic Nazca Plate tens of millions of years ago. As the two tectonic plates ground against each other, the lip of South America contracted and thickened into the rising spine of the Andes. Simultaneously, the oceanic Nazca Plate dove under the continent into the softer mantle beneath it. Think of the hard, dense oceanic plate as if it was made of iron, Sacek says, and the mantle as a vat of honey. The heavy iron mass plunging through the honey would create convection that perturbed the liquid’s surface. So, too, did the plate sinking through the mantle, creating a smooth depression in the Earth’s surface far above. When Sacek, Bicudo, and others included these dynamics in their models—published in 2019 and 2020—the simulations put this subsidence right under the western Amazon, forming a huge depression in the continent (13, 14). This hollow could have flooded from the Caribbean, pouring in across an apron-shaped expanse of what is now parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and western Brazil, to form an inland sea between 25 and 17 million years ago. Whether this actually happened is still impossible to say. “With our models we just give scenarios,” Bicudo says. The mantle was certainly in motion beneath the continent at the time, he says. But the size and shape of the depression it created, and whether it ever connected to the ocean, remain unknown. Geodynamicist Nicolas Flament at the University of Wollongong in Australia has also modeled the western Amazon. In one 2015 paper, he combined data on the positions and speed of the tectonic plates and the thickness of the top layer of the mantle, called the lithosphere, to simulate the changing topography of South America attributable to mantle convection over the last 50 million years (15). Flament’s models also predicted a western Amazonian shallow sea during the Miocene. Although he acknowledges that “models are not evidence,” Flament thinks the fact that his tectonic data-based simulations match predictions from the geological record lends further support to marine incursions as plausible—even likely.

Ebb and Flow A sea in the Amazon captures the imagination, but there are still geologists who consider it just that—imaginary. What’s clear in the geological record is that mud, silt, and, in smaller proportion, sand blanketed the region, explains Edgardo Latrubesse, at the Federal University of Goiás in Goiânia, Brazil. The age of those sediments, and how exactly they arrived in the western Amazon, is less clear. Oceans don’t typically transport and deposit sediment into vast inland areas, Latrubesse points out. Rivers, on the other hand, do erode mountains and hills to produce sandy and silty deposits. “To accumulate such a huge amount of sediment, the only way are rivers,” Latrubesse says. Hoorn and Jaramillo, in fact, would agree that although repeated ocean flooding carried some sediments, most did wash in on rivers when the area looked more like a freshwater wetland than a continuous sea. One key point of disagreement: the age of the sediments. Fossil pollen, ostracod, and mollusk assemblages date them to mid-to-late Miocene, which would match the proposed age of the ancient sea. But Latrubesse doesn’t put much stock in pollen-based age estimates; plants, he says, evolve too slowly to provide precise-enough date ranges. And in work published in 2010 analyzing vertebrate fossils from the southwestern Amazon, Latrubesse dated the sediments as far more recent, 6.5 to 9 million years old (16). It makes no sense to debate the existence of an inland sea 20 million years ago, he says, based on evidence from sediments that aren’t even 10 million years old. In other parts of the world, layers of volcanic ash could be used for absolute radiometric dating. But volcanic ash sediments are rare in the western Amazon. Geologists instead rely on comparisons of fossils with the evolutionary record, which is far from an exact science, says palynologist Andrea Kern. She coauthored a 2020 study aiming to resolve the Amazon sediment age debate while working as a postdoc at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Kern and her collaborators analyzed one Brazilian sediment core from a different site in the same collection that Jaramillo used in his 2017 analysis. In previous studies, pollen and ostracod fossils had dated the rock to the middle Miocene, about 14 million years ago. However, Kern’s 2020 study used grains of the mineral zircon buried in the sediments alongside the fossils (17). Zircon can be radiometrically dated, and Kern’s analysis put the rock’s maximum age at about 11.4 million years. Although the cores in both studies came from sites potentially inundated by marine incursions during the Miocene, most of the pollen and ostracod fauna in the sample Kern analyzed indicated swamps and small lakes transitioning to a river-dominated habitat. She acknowledges, however, that it is just one record from a single site. In a 2017 study, Carlos Jaramillo and coauthors analyzed rock cores from Columbia and Brazil (top) consistent with two separate Caribbean flooding periods in the last 20 million years. Evidence included this marine mantis shrimp (bottom). Image credit: Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama City, Panama).

Drilling Down “I love this stuff, but it’s so complicated,” says evolutionary biologist John Bates, speaking from the Field Museum in Chicago, IL, where he curates birds. Although geology isn’t his specialty, Bates is keenly interested in the geologic history of the western Amazon. “I want to know what the ramifications were for biology,” he says. An inland sea could help explain how a region that contains a tenth of the world’s known species became such a trove of life. Take, for instance, the sand-colored nighthawk. The bird is only found in the western Amazon, where it nests on sandbanks. There’s no clear behavioral or ecological reason why nighthawks should be tied to creeks and rivers, Bates says. Yet they are, as are scarlet-crowned barbets and a wealth of other birds, endemic to the same waterways. A massive Miocene lake or sea could offer some evolutionary explanation for the birds’ association with a shoreline niche, Bates says. He coauthored a 2018 study comparing the phylogenetic relatedness and geographic distributions of 1,783 passerine species across 19 families of neotropical birds (18). Bates found that bird lineages in the western Amazon are younger and more related, on average, than lineages in surrounding areas. That means the western Amazon has its own evolutionary history, separate from the rest of the continent, he says. A huge body of water would have been such a starkly different habitat from surrounding forests that it could have spurred a unique evolutionary signature among species there. If sand-colored nighthawks evolved around an ancient sea or delta, it may explain why they still live near water today. Plant species, too, could have been affected by marine incursions. Although the Amazonian flora was diverse millions of years before the Miocene, Hoorn notes that saltwater flooding could certainly have altered regional plant biodiversity. Not only would seawater change the chemical composition and fertility of the soil, shaping which plants grew where, but coastal species brought inland by marine incursions could also have been isolated and adapted into new groups. If a seaway enabled new plants and animals to radiate into the west, it could be an overlooked mechanism driving the region’s species richness. Geologists agree that resolving exactly what the Miocene landscape looked like will require better rock samples. The oil and coal industries did not collect cores with multidisciplinary studies in mind; some are contaminated and so can’t be thoroughly analyzed by researchers. They’re also proprietary and only available to a small subset of the scientific community. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America. It’s just all of the details are difficult.” —Christine Bacon Paul Baker, a geologist at Duke University in Durham, NC, will colead the effort, likely starting in June or July, to collect and analyze what researchers believe will be the best sediment samples ever taken from the Amazon. Called the Trans-Amazon Drilling Project, and funded by the National Science Foundation, International Ocean Discovery Program, the São Paulo Research Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution, the plan includes roughly 50 scientific collaborators from a range of disciplines, including Hoorn and Jaramillo. They will drill 2,000-meter-long sediment cores from three Brazilian sites running east-to-west across the Amazon Basin, following the Amazon River, with the goal of capturing a snapshot of the entire Cenozoic Era, from 66 million years ago to the present (19). Painstakingly collected and carefully stored, these freshly drilled cores will capture even millimeter-scale changes in the sediment layers that could hold evidence of ocean incursion. Continuous rock will give geologists their best shot yet at comprehensively assessing every layer of Miocene sediment for marine evidence. And dating zircon grains in the rock cores will give the most definitive time frame for the sediment to date, based on “by far the best material that’s ever been looked at,” Baker says. “I’d say it’s pretty much a slam dunk that there were marine incursions in South America,” says evolutionary biologist Christine Bacon, co-first author of the 2019 study on C. icaco and other plants’ unusual inland distributions. “It’s just all of the details are difficult,” she says, on the phone from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If there is unequivocal marine evidence, it should turn up in the new cores. “Without continuous rock,” Jaramillo says, “the discussions could go forever.” And that might mean never knowing whether the view from the Andes 20 million years ago included a vast, shimmering inland sea.","Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2102396118/F1.large.jpg,"['amazon', 'sea', 'miocene', 'sediment', 'western', 'million', 'marine', 'evidence', 'jaramillo', 'feature', 'inland']",

Critics say that in the Amazon and in the Pantanal, land-grabbers and ranchers have interpreted President Jair Bolsonaro’s vocal contempt for conservation as carte blanche to clear more land, and that environmental agencies, held back by budget cuts and a pandemic, have little recourse to stop them.

Just last week, Brazil’s Environment Ministry said it would halt all its efforts to stop deforestation in the Amazon, citing lack of funds, before dramatically reversing the decision hours later.

Vinicius Silgueiro, a forest engineer at ICV, said that it was clear as early as the end of 2019, from low rainfall and rainy season flood levels, that the Pantanal would be exceptionally vulnerable to fire this year. It ought to have been possible to plan more effectively for the disaster, he added, but the current administration lacked the political will to do so.

Silgueiro added that the tools existed to bring to justice those responsible for environmental destruction, but they were simply not being used.

“ICV studies show that in recent years, more than half of all the deforestation and fires in Mato Grosso states occur on properties registered with the CAR,” Silgueiro said, referring to the rural property registry. “This means that the federal and state governments have all the data on the owners of these areas, and accountability is possible.”

The coronavirus pandemic has also aggravated the situation, said Garcia, as indigenous firefighters – who make up a third of the Mato Grosso do Sul fire brigade – had to isolate within their territories.

Connected ecosystems

Heavy downpours have flooded parts of Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, including the neighbourhoods of Botafogo and Jardim Botanico.

The month of April delivers 95mm of rain on average, but in nine hours on Monday night, 246mm of rain fell.

This report came from Copacabana Fort, south of Botafogo and on the peninsula separating the famous beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema. This was the first report of rain this month and, if confirmed, it will mark the highest 24-hour rain total ever recorded in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

The former capital of Brazil can expect rain every month of the year but the “rainy season” lasts from December to March.

As the sun goes north to bring summer to the northern hemisphere, the heaviest rain follows it. The heaviest rain is typically north of Rio. Civil defence officials say heavy rains in northeastern Brazil have killed at least three people and displaced 3,600.

In the state of Piaui, the capital of Teresina, received 77mm of rain in a single night, flooding a neighbourhood and killing three people.

In neighbouring Ceara state, meteorologists have recorded 162.3mm of rain in the city of Granja so far this month. That has caused the Coreau River to flood.

In a year when millions were forced to flee their homes due to climate-fueled natural disasters, the Philippines and Bangladesh were among the most affected countries in 2020, according to a report published Thursday by a group that monitors internal displacements of people worldwide.

More than 40 million people around the world were displaced last year within their nations’ borders by natural disasters or conflict despite many governments imposing lockdowns or movement restrictions due to a global pandemic, the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reported.

“Weather-related events were responsible for 98 percent of all disaster displacement recorded in 2020,” the group said in its annual Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID).

“Most disaster displacements were the result of tropical storms and floods in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. China, the Philippines and Bangladesh each recorded more than four million new displacements, many of them pre-emptive evacuations.”

And, according to a report published earlier this week by Forest Trends, a Washington-based conservation NGO, Southeast Asia suffers terribly from the effects of climate change, with Indonesia and Malaysia contributing to climate erosion.

Between 2013 and 2019, Indonesia, the region’s largest country and a top producer of palm oil, was responsible for 20 percent of the world’s illegal razing of tropical forests through agricultural clear-cutting fires that increased carbon emissions in the region, the study by Forest Trends said.

Tropical cyclones, typhoons, monsoon rains and floods hit highly exposed areas that are home to millions of people in South and Southeast, according to the report by IDMC.

“It’s shocking that someone was forced to flee their home inside their own country every single second last year,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which IDMC is a part of.

IDMC’s “Grid 2021” report tracked displacement from extreme climate events as well as war and conflict.

The year “2020 was, for many of us, a year of lockdowns and travel restrictions but not so for the millions who fled for their lives because of conflict, violence and disasters,” Egeland said.

“[W]e have documented that, 40 million times [last year], a man, a woman, or a child have been forced out of their homes because of disaster or conflict. It’s the worst figures in a decade.”

As the United States Geological Survey noted, climate change plays a role in exacerbating disasters.

“With increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop,” the U.S. government agency said.

“More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms.”

Typhoon Vongfong, also known as Ambo, the first tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2020, caused more than 298,000 displacements, mostly in the form of pre-emptive evacuations.

Later that year, Typhoons Goni and Vamco cause more than 3 million displacements in the Philippines and Vietnam in October and November, according to IDMC.

‘Proactive measures that build resilience’

Elsewhere, South Asia accounted for almost a third of the world’s new disaster displacements in 2020.

Around 9.2 million displacements were recorded in the region, which IDMC said was an above-average figure for the second year in a row.

A big contributor was Cyclone Amphan, which triggered nearly 2.5 million displacements in Bangladesh alone, of a total 5 million in the region.

“It damaged and destroyed homes and other infrastructure and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless,” IDMC said.

“The damage it did to embankments led to the flooding of homes, farms and fields that have been underwater ever since,” IDMC said.

Powerful storms and cyclones have become more frequent in South Asia due to warmer temperatures in the Indian Ocean. When combined with rising sea levels, the phenomena cause even more devastating storm surges that flood larger and larger areas, IDMC said, adding that Cyclone Amphan illustrated the problem.

“The need for more inclusive and proactive measures that build the resilience of those regularly exposed to similar hazards is also clear,” IDMC said.

Lush forests turned into palm-oil plantations

In Southeast Asia, palm oil, soy and cattle products drive global figures of illegal deforestation, according to the report by Forest Trends.

Most of the forest clearing took place in in Brazil and Indonesia during 2013-2019, the years the report studied.

Southeast Asia has 80 percent of the world’s palm oil plantations, and many of Indonesia’s and Malaysia’s palm oil, paper, and pulp plantations are built on illegally razed tropical forests, the NGO said.

“The criminal destruction of rainforests for commodities such as beef, chocolate, soy and palm oil knocks down 4.5 million hectares and releases 2.7 gigatons of emissions a year,” said a press release which accompanied the report by Forest Trends, titled “Illicit Harvest, Complicit Goods: The State of Illegal Deforestation for Agriculture.”

Palm oil is the biggest forest risk commodity in Asia-Pacific, said the study, and Indonesia led other Southeast Asian nations in forest-clearing, the report said.

“The global average proportion of illegality for palm oil (59 percent) is constrained by low data availability in Malaysia. …These [forest] losses have been tied to billions of dollars in economic losses, such as those resulting from the El Niño drought-linked forest fires that created massive haze events.”

In Indonesia, companies and farmers clear land by burning their vegetation. The fires often spread to protected forestlands. And the resulting giant blazes emit greenhouse gases and cause a heavy haze that crosses national boundaries and engulfs other Southeast Asian countries.

While the findings of Forest Trends seem dire, there is hope, as Indonesia has successfully reduced its deforestation every year since a peak in 2016, the report said.

Indonesia’s deforestation rate hit a historic low in 2020, according to the country’s Environment and Forestry Ministry.

The government attributed the reduction to policies such as a moratorium on licenses for new palm oil plantations, and a ban on clearing primary forests and peatlands.

But other experts have noted that drop was likely due to more rains, falling oil palm prices, and an economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thu, 20 May 2021 21:35:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/climate-disasters-05202021173444.html/@@images/image,"['internally', 'indonesia', 'bangladesh', 'oil', 'palm', 'displaced', 'forest', '2020', 'million', 'philippines', 'idmc', 'climate', 'asia', 'disasters', 'study', 'displacements', '8m', 'report', 'according']",

You can hear the frustration in the nurse’s voice as he narrates the video, walking closer to an open window.

“You have to be an engineer to make this work,” he says. “You have to be like MacGyver.”

The video moves past a woman on oxygen, the tube running down from her nose to the gurney she’s sitting on and, eventually, out that open window.

It runs to another window, the green tube swinging in the breeze above an open courtyard a half-dozen stories below. The tube ends at an oxygen hookup in the wall of the other room.

This is the only way that woman, a Covid-19 patient at this hospital in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia, can get oxygen. The room where the oxygen source is located is so overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, she has to sit in what is otherwise a hallway, her life-saving oxygen precariously fed to her.

The scene is a microcosm of what is playing out across Brazil right now amid a brutal and out-of-control wave of Covid-19.

On Thursday night, Brazil’s Health Ministry reported the gruesome figure of more than 100,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed in a single day, the country’s highest such figure since the pandemic began.

So far, a total of 303,462 people have died in the country from the virus, according to official data.

But it’s the seven-day averages that paint an even bleaker picture.

At 15,963 deaths from March 19-25 and 14,610 deaths in the previous week, those are the highest such numbers of the pandemic so far and they are trending in the wrong direction.

Brazil has recorded roughly 24% of all coronavirus deaths worldwide over the past two weeks, according to JHU data.

A Covid-19 variant, P1, continues to rip through the country as experts agree it is more contagious and potentially produces more severe illness than previous strains. Even younger people are not spared.

Of Brazil’s 26 states plus its federal district, only one or two on any given day have ICU occupancy rates below 80%.

More than half are above 90%, which means if the healthcare systems haven’t yet collapsed already in those states, they are at imminent risk of doing so.

Health systems have been inundated with patients they can no longer adequately take care of due to a critical lack of space and supplies.

As Brazil suffers through its worst days of this pandemic so far, there are signs of collapse at every level of the healthcare system in nearly every state across the country.

Signs of collapse

First responders, hospital personnel and even cemetery employees have told CNN they’ve been brought to their knees by this latest wave.

“It’s a war scenario,” said paramedic Luis Eduardo Pimentel in São Paulo. “I can barely describe what I’m seeing, it is so sad what is happening to the country.”

He described non-stop Covid-19 calls, unnecessary deaths, and hospitals so overburdened, they take supplies from wherever they can.

CNN spoke to him after his shift ended, earlier than expected, after a hospital took the gurney he had brought his Covid-19 patient in on — the hospital had run out of beds.

Other examples are myriad.

In a video given to CNN last week, 12 ambulances with patients inside are seen waiting outside a São Paulo hospital for bedspace to open up inside.

CNN visited a Covid-19-designated hospital on Thursday that had stopped accepting patients because they had run out of room. In a section normally reserved for 16 semi-intensive care patients, nearly double that amount were being treated.

Several had already been intubated and would normally have sent to an ICU, but no such space existed in the hospital.

When ICU rates hit 90%, as they did in Sao Paulo on Thursday, they’re effectively full, said Geraldo Reple Sobrinho, the state’s President of the Council of Municipal Health Secretaries. “In reality, that means total bed occupancy because every time there is a patient who is discharged or dies, you need time to clean this bed and change the equipment. It takes four, five hours.”

In the meantime, more and more patients keep dying. On several recent days, there have been so many deaths that burials in São Paulo cemeteries are happening every few minutes.

Crematoriums have not been able to keep up. In a video shared with CNN, at least two dozen coffins can be seen waiting to be cremated — the demand is about three times what the facility can handle in a single day.

The government response … or lack of it

As his country has reeled during this latest outbreak, President Jair Bolsonaro has yet to take any significant steps to try and implement a coordinated national response.

He did deliver a televised address to the country on Tuesday night, saying 2021 would be the “year of the vaccine.”

But critics derided the 3-minute speech as a half-hearted attempt at a public-relations rescue on a day where Brazil set its own record for most coronavirus deaths recorded in a single day.

The federal government appeared to commit another own goal the following day, with the Health Ministry announcing that it would require more information from municipalities reporting Covid-19 victim information.

That sparked immediate concern that the additional requirements would lower the number of Covid-19 deaths that were reported.

Those concerns appeared to be immediately justified as Wednesday’s reported death toll was nearly 1,200 fewer than the previous day.

By the end of the day Wednesday, the Health Ministry suspended the new reporting requirements after severe backlash from states and the public.

Absent a coordinated federal response, any restrictions put in place designed to stem the spread of the virus have been left to individual states.

Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais are among the states that have implemented nightly curfews, even as the Bolsonaro administration filed suit in Brazil’s Supreme Court declaring that only the federal government has the right to impose such restrictions.

The court this week sided with the states, however, calling Bolsonaro’s argument “totalitarian.”","Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['paulo', 'collapse', 'covid', 'little', 'response', 'são', 'patients', 'brazil', 'spirals', 'control', 'video', 'hospital', 'bolsonaro', 'states', 'signs', 'day', 'oxygen', 'covid19', 'deaths']",

Severe river floods are escalating in temperate climates and putting at risk populations, livelihoods and property, according to evidence published today in Geophysical Research Letters by an Oxford-led international team.

The first global examination of recent changes in the size, frequency, and probability of extreme river floods using historical river records, the paper shows that dangers of extreme river flooding demand close monitoring of rivers for decades to come, to understand and account for the potential impact of such changes.

Dr. Louise Slater, the main author and Oxford expert in flood risks, warns, ""Our work shows the magnitude and frequency of floods are changing substantially in different climates of the globe. Flood maps need to be regularly updated to keep up with these changes and protect people and their livelihoods.""

She maintains, ""These changes cannot be ignored. We need to keep monitoring our rivers because long-term records are necessary to understand and communicate how major floods are changing relative to the past.""'

Using historic recorded magnitudes of river flow, the team found that overall, floods have mostly decreased at the global scale. In arid, tropical, polar, and cold climate zones, 20-year floods decreased between −33% and −12% on average since the 1970s. This was most visible in regions such as north eastern Brazil, eastern Europe, parts of western US and parts of northern China.

The team suggests these decreases may be caused by a range of factors such as flood control measures, climate changes and decreasing soil moisture, where drier antecedent conditions offset flood magnitudes (due to increasing temperatures, decreasing rainfall, or groundwater depletion).

By contrast, the size of 20-year river floods increased by 22% on average since the 1970s in temperate climate zones such as Atlantic-facing Europe, south eastern Brazil, and south eastern China. According to the team, it is likely some of these increases result from climate change and variability, but no direct link was drawn within the research paper.

In temperate countries, it is not just the size of major river floods that is increasing. The paper shows that major floods have also been occurring more frequently, which is why it is essential to maintain up-to-date flood risk mapping.

That decision reversed an earlier ruling to maintain much higher Xingu River flows and the fishery — as legally required.

The flow reduction will leave 70% of usually-flooded forest dry this season, causing massive fish mortality and diminished reproduction, experts say. Community group Xingu Vivo Para Sempre denounced the decision as “a death sentence for the Xingu” and demanded IBAMA’s and Norte Energia’s presidents be “criminally prosecuted.”

Norte Energia has funded projects to mitigate the reduced flow, collecting and dropping fruit into the river for fish to feed on, and releasing captive-bred fish. But scientists say these approaches are unscientific and will likely be ineffective, and can’t make up for the loss of the river’s seasonal flood pulse, upon which fish depend.

Residents say the government has spread misinformation, telling Brazilian consumers that their electricity bills would go up if Belo Monte released more water to maintain the Xingu’s ecosystem — something Norte Energia is obligated to do. At present, water levels on the Volta Grande have not been restored.

Bel Juruna, of the Juruna (Yudjá) Indigenous people, points her camera at the Xingu River, beside which she lives in Mïratu village in the Paciçamba Indigenous Territory on the 130-kilometer (81-mile) Volta Grande (Big Bend), in Pará state, Brazil.

The video shows a shoulder-high, light-colored waterline streaking a dark exposed boulder. Just days before, that boulder was mostly submerged and the river ran at a much higher level, but its flow has been drastically, suddenly, intentionally, and possibly illegally, reduced — threatening the Xingu’s fishery and the people who depend on it for food and livelihoods.

On February 8, Belo Monte mega-dam operator Norte Energia received permission from IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency, to immediately reduce river flows to less than 13% of normal — shifting the water to the dam’s electricity-producing turbines. This dramatic flow reduction was completely unanticipated by riverine Indigenous and traditional peoples, Bel’s video shows the effects: canoes with outboard motors stranded on dry rocks, aquatic vegetation exposed to the air.

“These plants are usually on the bottom [of the river]; they are water plants. And because the water won’t come [here] any more, they’re all going to die,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s action comes during the piracema, a time of year when fish should be traveling on seasonally rising waters, deep into the flooded forest to feed and spawn. The government’s water reduction decision effectively closes the door on this reproductive window — an opportunity that comes but once a year.

“The Volta Grande will turn into a cemetery. A cemetery of fish, a cemetery of dead trees,” Bel says.

Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B permitted

In the second week of February, Norte Energia diverted more than 85% of the Xingu’s normal flow away from the Volta Grande, where thousands of Indigenous and traditional fisherfolk live. The company’s diversion to the Belo Monte dam reduced river flow abruptly from early-February speeds of 10,900 cubic meters per second (m3/s) to 1,600 m3/s. (The historical average flows before the dam was built were 12,736 m3/s.)

On February 8, IBAMA president Eduardo Fortunato Bim signed an agreement allowing Norte Energia to implement the company’s so-called Hydrogram B, an artificial hydrological regime that will remove 73% of normal annual Xingu River flows from the Volta Grande.

The socio-environmental consequences, say experts, will be catastrophic. Hydrogram B “will cause the end of the cyclical, ecological phenomenon of the [annual] flood pulse, which guarantees fishes’ and turtles’ access to their feeding areas. There will be high amounts of mortality and, in those [aquatic animals] who survive, loss of nutritional condition,” Juarez Pezzuti from the Federal University of Pará wrote in an email to Mongabay,

Turtles, of “extremely high cultural significance” to the Juruna and other riverine people, “will no longer be able to accumulate the energy necessary to produce eggs. The number of times they lay eggs and the number of eggs per nest will be drastically reduced.”

In a note to Mongabay on Hydrogram B’s effects, Norte Energia states, “There is no technical-scientific proof, nor any indications at present, that the flow [regime] practiced by Belo Monte can cause mortality of fish or turtles,” citing “robust monitoring.” Independent scientists allege Norte Energia’s monitoring studies are flawed.

Lorena Curuaia, a leader of the Curuaia people, of Iawá village, sent Mongabay audio commenting on IBAMA’s decision: “This is absurd. Once again, we see the fauna, the flora, totally threatened, especially all the biodiversity. We know that the normal flow of water on the Volta Grande and the whole Xingu Basin doesn’t work that way.

“So they are assaulting nature again. To do what?,” she asks. “To generate energy, to generate financial gain for them, unfortunately leaving biodiversity to the wayside? We are indignant.”

The leader demands, “We want a response from IBAMA itself, saying why they accepted this from Belo Monte.” IBAMA did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Norte Energia’s studies on Hydrogram B rejected as faulty

In 2009, IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s extreme low flow Hydrogram B proposal as being unable to maintain life on the Volta Grande, something the Belo Monte dam operator is legally mandated to do. In December 2019, IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to study alternative hydrological regimes.

But when IBAMA reviewed the new studies, submitted in December 2020, they found that Norte Energia had only presented an analysis of Hydrogram B versus the historical natural flow, and had offered no alternative flow plans. This limited comparison made it impossible for experts to analyze alternative hydrological regimes, says Pezzuti. Agreeing with that assessment is Camila Ribas of the National Institute for Amazon Research and the American Museum of Natural History, after she had access to the studies.

Consequently, on February 2, 2021 IBAMA’s technical team rejected Norte Energia’s studies as “faulty” and incomplete.

What should have happened next, says Ribas, is Norte Energia should have had to redo its studies, addressing IBAMA’s critiques, and then resubmit. Until then, IBAMA’s “provisional hydrogram,” with higher river flows — in place since April 2019 — should have continued.

Political pressure on IBAMA and misinformation

But IBAMA allegedly received intense pressure from other ministries within the Jair Bolsonaro administration, lobbying it to reverse its expected upcoming decision to maintain provisional hydrogram water releases to the Volta Grande. For two months, IBAMA had signaled that Norte Energia would have to return significant amounts of water to the river to prevent further ecosystem harm.

Meanwhile, Ribas recalls that the Mines and Energy department and the electricity agency ANEEL “leaked supposedly internal documents” to the press, claiming that if IBAMA ordered Norte Energia to divert less water from the Volta Grande, then Brazilian consumers’ electricity bills would jump dramatically in cost.

That claim, according to Ribas and Pezzuti, is false.

According to Pezzuti, “The company claimed [Belo Monte’s] non-production of energy would make it necessary to produce energy by activating thermoelectric plants” to make up an energy shortfall, which would supposedly greatly raise costs. But, he says, Norte Energia had presented outdated data on Brazil’s hydroelectric reserves, giving a false picture of Brazil’s current hydroelectric energy potential.

In fact, in the current rainy season, Amazon hydroelectric reservoirs are full. “The majority of hydroelectric plants [in Brazil] have a good level and flows, and so less energy [coming from] Belo Monte won’t generate the [electricity] deficit that’s being threatened by the press and the government,” says Pezzuti. Norte Energia did not respond to Mongabay’s question on this matter.

Political interference and an environmental crime?

Apparently, IBAMA president Bim contradicted his own technical team’s conclusions to strike the February 8 agreement with Norte Energia’s president, Paulo Roberto Pinto, allowing the company to immediately implement Hydrogram B.

Bim is thought to have circumvented IBAMA organizational procedures and overruled his own director of licensing Jônatas Souza da Trindade, who should have made the decision, notes Pezzuti. In a note to Mongabay, Licensing General Coordinator Régis Fontana Pinto stated, “The decisions pertinent to the application of the Belo Monte [dam] hydrogram are taken in the purview of IBAMA’s president, though supplied with information by the technical team, by me as General Coordinator, and by the Environmental Licensing director.”

This agreement directly violates Article 231 of Brazil’s 1988 constitution, Pezzuti says, which states that hydroelectric plants can’t impact Indigenous lands. It also appears to violate international conventions such as ILO 169, ratified in Brazil as Decree 5,051, which protects traditional activities such as fishing as essential for cultural preservation. Further infringed regulations may include Law 11,346 ensuring Nutritional and Food Security, Law 9,985 protecting “the natural resources necessary for traditional populations’ subsistence,” and Decree 6,040 guaranteeing “traditional peoples’ access to natural resources for their physical, economic, and cultural reproduction.”

Concerning projected losses to the diets of Amazon fisherfolk, Lorena Curuaia told Mongabay, “No company has the right to take away another’s dietary sustenance. The fisher people’s culture is fish. To remove their food, is to remove their life.”

On February 18, dozens of fisherfolk organizations, all members of the Xingu Vivo Para Sempre association, formally demanded Eduardo Fortunato Bim and Paulo Roberto Pinto be “criminally prosecuted” for environmental damages resulting from IBAMA’s decision.

“In my understanding, if the president of the environmental organ takes a decision that contradicts the technical position of the institution itself, he is failing in his duty. He is committing a crime in failing to act in accordance with his function, which is to protect the environment,” Pezzuti states.

In a note to Mongabay, Norte Energia states, “There is no crime practiced — since there do not exist any environmental damages, but rather impacts [already] predicted” in the environmental licensing stage. In 2020, federal judges and IBAMA’s team documented that impacts of the dam, characterized by IBAMA as “grave and irreversible,” were greater than projected during licensing.

Norte Energia offers mitigation plans

In its February 8 IBAMA agreement, Norte Energia also committed $R 157 million (US$ 28 million) to river flow mitigation plans. Three projects were approved: to send teams to collect fruit and leaves from the forests that should have been flooded, then throw these into the reduced area of the river where fish are trapped; to build floating platforms with bushes for fish to feed from; and to breed fish in captivity and then release them into the Xingu.

Pezzuti rejects the plan as scientifically unproven: “It’s an absurd pseudo-project, impossible to be executed on a scale that compensates for the [absence of] flooding of tens of thousands of hectares.” He notes, “The first two [projects] aren’t based on any kind of precedent,” and the raising of fish in captivity in the hopes of repopulating the river “already has proven to be ineffective in several studies.”

Alexander Lees, of England’s Manchester Metropolitan University, concurs that these are unworkable solutions, “a waste of money” better spent on maintaining the ecosystem.

“Messing around with chucking fruit into rivers or floating trees is just throwing money away,” says Lees. “It just looks like good publicity,”

Bel Juruna says Norte Energia’s present efforts are ineffectual. “There are lots of companies [contracted by Norte Energia] here that go around, visit, hold meetings, but despite that, there aren’t any projects from the [original] Basic Environmental Plan that are working here.”

Pezzuti explains that Norte Energia’s fisheries mitigation plan was “signed off on by professors employed by public research universities, contributing to this scientific makeup, as if there were a solution for the tragedy that Hydrogram [B] will cause.” However, he adds, independent researchers, not paid by Norte Energia, “experts in fish ecology and aquatic turtles… vehemently protested… this bizarre proposal,” as did “IBAMA’s analysts, who rejected it” on February 2.

Ribas adds, “The research Norte Energia and its consultants do is already directed toward a certain end goal.” She believes that the company-contracted researchers’ finding that Hydrogram B is viable resulted from a conflict of interest which, she says, might explain why the firm’s experts didn’t present analysis of alternatives. “That’s not science,” she says, but Ribas is concerned the Brazilian public will accept the flawed research as valid.

What’s needed, she concludes, is independent monitoring. Ribas and her fellow scientists are seeking funding to monitor the effects of Norte Energia’s Hydrogram B on the Volta Grande in 2021.

As for the Juruna people, Bel Juruna says they will endure: “We will be here. We want to resist in this place, fighting so that we, too, won’t turn into a cemetery in our village.”

Almost half of this legislation, 27 bills, was passed during the height of Brazil’s Covid-19 pandemic, from March to September 2020.

The study also found that the issuing of environmental fines for illegal deforestation dropped by more than 70 percent during the pandemic. This is despite a 9.5 percent increase in deforestation in the Amazon over the past year. The research was led by scientists in Brazil, Britain, and the United States.

“The current administration is taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to intensify a pattern of weakening environmental protection in Brazil,” the study authors wrote. “This has the potential to intensify ongoing loss of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood of other zoonotic disease outbreaks, and inflict substantial harm to traditional and indigenous peoples.”

The study authors used data from the Official Gazette of the Union, the legal newspaper of Brazil that publishes records of all decrees and changes in legislation. They also examined monthly deforestation data from Brazil’s National Institute for Spatial Research (INPE) and records of environmental fines from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA).

In April 2020, Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told other government ministers at a meeting to take advantage of how “the media attention is almost exclusively on Covid… to open the flood gates and change all the rules and simplify the norms.” In the months following Salles’ statement, Brazilian lawmakers and officials did just that. In July, 47 pesticides had their toxicity classifications either lowered or eliminated, the study found. In June, another piece of legislation made it “no longer necessary to restore all permanent environmental conservation areas, even if they are illegally deforested,” SciDev.net reported. The amount of biodiesel added to Brazilian diesel was decreased, from 12 to 10 percent. Laws began allowing mining permits in designated areas even before final authorization and environmental reviews were complete. And several military leaders were appointed to environmental agencies.

“The effects of such changes will likely last for decades,” the scientists wrote.","Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png,"['environmental', 'brazil', 'study', 'dozens', 'toxicity', 'weakened', 'legislation', 'deforestation', 'pandemic', 'wrote', 'scientists', 'brazilian', 'laws']",

By Sophie Hares

TEPIC, Mexico, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Severe flooding on the Amazon has increased amid changing weather patterns, and is harming the health and incomes of people living along the world's biggest river, scientists said.

Analysing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years.

""There are catastrophic effects on the lives of the people as the drinking water gets flooded, and the houses get completely destroyed,"" said Jonathan Barichivich, environmental scientist at the Universidad Austral de Chile.

""Our findings unravel the ultimate causes of the recent intensification - wet season getting wetter, and dry season getting drier - of the water cycle of the largest hydrological basin of the planet,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Droughts have also become more frequent in the past two to three decades, but the rise in flooding stood out, he noted.

In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers from institutions including Britain's University of Leeds said severe flooding had affected the Amazon basin nearly every year from 2009 to 2015.

They linked the increase in flooding to a combination of warmer temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and cooler temperatures over the Pacific.

Known as the Walker circulation, this effect influences tropical weather patterns, and can partly be attributed to shifts in wind belts caused by global warming, the study said.

With temperatures in the Atlantic expected to rise more than in the Pacific, flood risks on the Amazon River will persist, the scientists predicted.

""We think that it's going to continue for at least a decade,"" said Barichivich, formerly a University of Leeds research fellow.

The paper also noted that deforestation and construction of hydro-power plants could play a role in water-level changes.

Besides disrupting cattle ranching and agriculture on the river's flood plains, heavy flooding has health consequences for communities in Brazil, Peru and other Amazon nations, as it contaminates water and helps spread disease, said the study.

Monitoring changes in river levels is important because the Amazon basin and its tropical rainforest play a major role in the world's hydrological and carbon systems, said Barichivich.

82,82,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Brazil's Amazon dam plans: Ominous warnings of future destruction (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/brazils-amazon-dam-plans-ominous-warnings-of-future-destruction-commentary/,"Brazil’s current 10-year Energy Expansion Plan calls for three more large dams in Amazonia by 2029, and Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Plan lists many more.

Both plans contain ominous passages explaining that the list of dams could expand if “uncertainty” is resolved regarding current regulations protecting Indigenous peoples and protected areas for biodiversity.

Brazil’s National Congress is considering bills to eliminate environmental licensing; a bill submitted by President Jair Bolsonaro would allow dams on Indigenous lands. Brazil’s dam-building plans to satisfy 2050 energy demand extend to neighboring Amazonian nations, including Peru and Bolivia.

The 2050 plan essentially admits that dams on Indigenous lands and within other protected areas are not necessary because the electricity could be generated by offshore wind power. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

Every year Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy publishes a “Decennial Plan for Energy Expansion,” which includes the “large” dams (since 2004 defined in Brazil as having at least 30 MW installed capacity) to be completed within the ten-year time horizon.

The number of Amazonian dams listed has steadily declined in the last few plans, a fact that the plans make clear is due to “uncertainty” about current licensing policies restricting impacts on the environment and on Indigenous peoples. The most recent plan, which is for 2020-2029, lists only three dams: Tabajara (in Rondônia), Bem Querer (in Roraima), and Castanheiras (in Mato Grosso). A longer list of dams to be completed “after 2029” is also included, but the most controversial dams are also not included in it.

The 2020-2029 plan contains an ominous paragraph (p. 264) making clear that unnamed dams could be built depending on the “treatment” of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) and Indigenous Lands. In other words, more and more-damaging dams could be built if regulations are changed, as is proposed in bills currently moving through committees in Brazil’s National Congress.

This is not a remote possibility, as Brazil’s environmental regulations have been being dismantled since the mid-2000s, and this process has accelerated enormously since Jair Bolsonaro became president in January 2019. Several proposed laws would effectively eliminate environmental licensing. There is also a proposed law introduced by President Bolsonaro that would open Indigenous lands for exploitation by non-indigenous people — hydroelectric development is one of the uses specifically mentioned, development which could be carried out without requiring consent of the Indigenous groups impacted.

In addition to the ten-year plans, Brazil also has periodic “National Energy Plans.” The most recent one, which completed its public comment period on October 13, extends to 2050. This plan also omits the most controversial dams such as the Babaquara (renamed “Altamira”) Dam on the Xingu River upstream of Belo Monte. However, the report’s list of potential dams (Figure 1) includes the Chacorão Dam on the Tapajós River, which would flood part of the Munduruku Indigenous Land, as well as other dams on the Tapajós and its tributary the Jamanxim River that would flood part of Sawré Mubyu, a Munduruku area that has had its official status as an “Indigenous land” blocked precisely to make way for these dams.

The omissions in the 2050 National Energy Plan are intriguing. For example, the map of planned transmission lines omits the line from Manaus to Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state (p. 191). It is included in the 2029 10-year plan (p. 105). This line would pass through the Waimiri-Atroari Indigenous Land and requires consultation. Yet the planned Bem Querer Dam in Roraima, which would use the line to transmit most of its output to Manaus, is moving ahead quickly and is scheduled for completion in 2028 according to the 2020-2029 10-year plan (p. 57).

Dam plans can appear out of nowhere, as with the Barão do Rio Branco project announced soon after Bolsonaro took office. This project would build a 2,000-MW dam on the Trombetas River (Figure 2) together with a road connecting the Amazon River to the border with Suriname on a route that is almost entirely composed of conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity), Indigenous Lands and Quilombola Lands. “Quilombolas” are descendants of enslaved Africans who escaped in past centuries and set up their own villages in the forest; they have the same rights as Indigenous peoples under Brazil’s 1988 constitution. Bolsonaro’s planned dam would flood Quilombola Lands.

Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador also have big plans for Amazonian dams. The 2010 Brazil/Peru agreement specified six large dams in the Amazonian part of Peru to be built by Brazilian construction firms with financing from Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), largely to export electricity to Brazil (Figure 3). Since 2010 the “Lava Jato” (“Car Wash”) corruption scandal in Brazil has tainted the main construction firm expected to build the dams (Odebrecht), as well as various political figures in Brazil and in the other Amazonian countries. In addition, Brazil’s economy has not been doing well, and BNDES has less money to invest than it once did. Nevertheless, many of these dams are listed in Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Expansion Plan as possible sources of electricity in the coming decades (Figure 4).

The dams Brazil plans to build in Peru and Bolivia would have many impacts on the environment and on the people who live along the rivers in these countries. Ironically, they also would have impacts in Brazil itself. A study by Bruce Forsberg and coworkers showed that these planned dams would retain enough sediments to significantly reduce the transport of this valuable material into the Brazilian part of the basin. Nutrients in, and associated with, these sediments represent the base of the food chain for fish. As a result, the fisheries along the entire length of the Amazon River would see reduced production.

The fact that Brazil would be “shooting itself in the foot” by building these dams does not mean that they won’t be built. After all, Brazil dammed the Madeira River with the Santo Antônio Dam in 2011 and the Jirau Dam in 2013, thus sacrificing much of what had been the world’s second-greatest riverine fishery, second only to the Mekong (which is also threatened by dams). Fish catches plummeted due to the two Madeira dams, not only in Brazil but also in Bolivia and Peru because of the blockage of fish migrations.

In Bolivia, the same type of arrangement as in Peru applies to at least two planned dams. Brazil has also considered building a dam in Guyana, which could be connected to the planned Boa Vista-Manaus transmission line. All of these dams would have major environmental and human impacts, and the other Amazonian countries generally have even weaker legal protections than Brazil. This fact appears to be part of the reason for building these dams abroad, as the secretary of planning of Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy as much as confessed in 2012 in admitting that the foreign dams had priority because they would be faster to approve and build.

As compared to previous energy plans, one improvement in the current plans is that they foresee a substantial increase in wind energy. While the plans for wind power still focuses on onshore generation, the 2050 plan has calculations of the enormous potential for wind power on the continental shelf along the Brazilian coast. The plan admits that “The total expected installed capacity of wind power in 2050 may be even greater than 200 GW… as long as the expansion of hydroelectric dams with interference in protected areas is not allowed” (p. 101). In other words, Brazil could get all of the electricity it demands by tapping this wind resource without needing to allow hydroelectric dams to be built in the country’s Indigenous Lands and conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity).

The 2050 National Energy Plan shows that by 2050 Brazil could install 89 GW of “centralized” photovoltaic solar power (i.e., not counting “distributed” panels on rooftops), and that this would make up the difference in foregone hydroelectric generation if restrictions are not removed on Indigenous land and protected areas (pp. 111-112). If restrictions on hydropower are relaxed, less centralized photovoltaic solar (42 GW) would be installed. These numbers for solar power assume that wind power will be installed on a large scale. If some restriction prevents this, then centralized photovoltaic solar power could be expanded to over 100 GW (p. 112).

For comparison, Brazil’s total potential installed capacity of untapped hydropower is only 52 GW, and of this only 12 GW (23%) does not interfere with indigenous lands and other protected areas (p. 79). The 2050 plan’s repeated inclusion of scenarios with flooding within Indigenous lands and conservation units undoubtedly reflects the expectation of Brazil’s electrical authorities that protection of these areas against flooding by dams will indeed be eliminated.

The 2050 plan assumes that hydropower is the cheapest, and therefore the most desirable option, followed by wind and then solar. However, dams are by no means cheap energy, as shown by a worldwide survey of hundreds of dams that found that most are uneconomical because they almost always cost much more than originally estimated and they routinely take longer than expected to begin generating electricity. Brazil’s Belo Monte Dam is a good example: it cost more than double the original expectation and completion took longer than planned. The importance of the high financial cost of dams pales in comparison to that of their human and environmental impacts, which are far greater than those of wind and solar power.

The plans could be more ambitious in the area of energy conservation. The 2020-2029 Ten-Year Plan calculates that 4.8% of Brazil’s projected electricity use in 2029 could be avoided through conservation measures (p. 220). The 2050 National Energy Plan has many calls for energy efficiency, but no calculations of how much electricity use could be avoided. Ever since the 2008 National Plan for Climate Change (PNMC), the government’s goal has been to end use of the electric showerheads that, according to the PNMC, consume 5% of all electricity in Brazil (p. 58), but basically nothing has been done. There is no mention in any of these plans of stopping the export of electricity in the form of aluminum and other electro-intensive products (7% of Brazil’s electricity use).

At a Glance At least 200 jaguars have been killed, injured or displaced.

They live in a state park called Encontro das Aguas.

Extreme drought, heat and wind have created a dire situation.

The largest population of jaguars in the world is under attack from wildfires burning across vast tropical wetlands in southwestern Brazil.

Firefighters, ranchers, scientists, environmentalists and local residents are banding together to try to stifle the blazes and save the jaguars.

The fires are burning in a region known as the Pantanal, which is considered one of the most biologically diverse regions on the planet. Besides the jaguars, the Pantanal is also home to thousands of other plant and animal species, including toucans, caiman, giant otters and giant anteaters, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

The jaguars are concentrated in a state park called Encontro das Aguas, or Meeting of Waters. Fires reached the park in recent days after scorching more than 8,900 square miles of land across wetlands known as the Pantanal, which starts at the southern end of the Amazon forest and stretches over parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, Agence France-Presse reported.

Two hundred of them have already been killed, injured or displaced due to the fires, according to Panthera, a big cat conservation group.

The region is used to fires during the dry season, but those who work in the Pantanal say extreme drought, combined with heat and wind, have created a dire situation.

""Very few animals survive. The ones that do often suffer very severe effects. They're burned to the bone, they often have to be euthanized, or die of hunger and thirst,"" Juliana Camargo, head of the wildlife conservation group AMPARA Animal, told AFP.

""The worst part is when the people on the ground fighting the fires tell us, 'There's nothing we can do, everything is going to burn.' The only hope is for it to rain, but that's not expected until November.""

Rafael Hoogesteijn, a veterinarian and program director at Panthera, is among those helping fight the fires. Hoogesteijn said in a blog post that the fires are five times larger than those that burned last year.

""Brazil's Pantanal is a unique ecosystem and has the world's largest flooded forested grasslands, but when I look around some areas, all I see is burned soil peppered with a few bare trees,"" he said.

Advertisement Lt. Col. Sheila Sebalhos, a spokeswoman for the region's firefighters, told the Associated Press that there is no sign of a break in the weather.

""The forecast isn’t good,"" Sebalhos, who spent weeks in the fire zone, said by phone from the state capital of Cuiaba. ""High speeds of those winds that change direction many times throughout the day are favoring the rapid spread (of fire).""

Winds were blamed for carrying sparks into Encontro das Aguas and igniting the fires that affected the jaguars.

Felipe Dias, the executive director of environmental group SOS Pantanal, said this is the driest the region's been in 47 years.

""There’s a climate problem. The rains happen in a concentrated way and then 30, 40, 50 days go by without rain,"" Dias said. ""The Pantanal is a flood plain; The soil should be soaked.""

Ranching and farming are common in the Pantanal, but many residents also depend on tourism generated by the jaguars, who have grown accustomed to people viewing them.

Hoogesteijn wrote in his blog post that he and others fighting the fires are doing their best to help both humans and animals.

""Our first priority is to protect people's lives by stopping the fires from burning their homes and communities, including their cattle corrals. After that, we focus on saving wildlife,"" Hoogesteijn said.

""Our third priority is to save as much unburnt habitat as possible, for all the surviving fauna and flora to find refuge and food.""

SAO PAULO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A rare bomb cyclone lashed southern Brazil, leaving at least 10 people dead and forcing more than 1,000 people to evacuate their homes, local Civil Defense authorities said on Wednesday.

Nine of the deaths were reported in the state of Santa Catarina, where one person has also been reported missing. The tenth victim was in southernmost Rio Grande do Sul state bordering on neighboring Argentina and Uruguay.

An atypical climate event for the region, meteorologists said the ""extratropical bomb cyclone,"" or rapidly developing storm, originated in the Atlantic Ocean and whipped southern Brazil with winds of up to 110 kilometers per hour.

The cyclone knocked out power to at least 48 towns, some 686,000 homes, in Santa Catarina.

Florianopolis, the capital of Santa Catarina, and its metropolitan region were the hardest hit, registering six deaths due to landslides and mudslides.

""We have never seen anything like it. We always believed we were far from the kind of phenomena we were used to seeing on television of the Caribbean,"" a resident of Ilhota, a community in greater Florianopolis, told local media.

Strong winds and heavy rains ripped away tile roofs and sheet roofing, and uprooted electricity poles.

Winds of up to 80 kilometers per hour reached as far as the southeast states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the meteorological service reported.

On the coast of Sao Paulo, damage to a marina caused eight boats to sink.

In Curitiba, Parana state, cellphone video captured rooftops blown away by winds of over 100 kilometers per hour.

The governments of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana issued flood warnings and evacuated more than 1,000 people.

Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday that “all means” are being made available to help the country’s largest state, Amazonas, where hospitals are running out of beds and oxygen tanks amid soaring coronavirus infections.

His claim came a day after Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello described the healthcare system in the Amazonas state capital, Manaus, as being in “collapse.”

“I would say yes, there is a collapse in healthcare in Manaus. The line to get a hospital bed has grown a lot, today we have about 480 people waiting in line. And the reality is that there is a lower supply of oxygen — not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen,” he said during a Facebook live with Bolsonaro on Thursday.

Doctors and nurses have been quoted in local news reports as saying patients are dying of asphyxiation in the city’s hospitals because of a lack of oxygen.

Bolsonaro posted on his official Facebook page Friday that “all means have been made available to the population of Manaus.”

Pazuello has been in Manaus for three days, the President said, and the federal government has provided “oxygen, supplies and patient transfers to federal hospitals.”

The Brazilian air force delivered six cylinders of liquid oxygen, totaling 9,300 kilograms, to Manaus early Friday. It also flew out nine patients and five doctors from Manaus to the city of Teresina, in the northeastern state of Piauí.

Speaking in Brasilia, Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourão said there was no way to foresee the collapse in the public health system and blamed a new variant of coronavirus that is circulating in the city.

“You cannot predict what would happen with this strain that is occurring in Manaus. Totally different from what had happened in the first half,” said Mourão.

Last September, research led by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) recommended a lockdown after confirming that Manaus was experiencing a second wave of the disease. The government of Amazonas denied the second wave of Covid cases at that time.

Manaus, globally known as the gateway to the Amazon region, also suffered badly in the first wave of the pandemic between April and May, when its public health and funeral systems collapsed.

Brazil’s Covid-19 death toll is the second highest in the world, behind only that of the United States. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 207,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Brazil and more than 8.3 million reported cases of coronavirus.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published Wednesday accused Bolsonaro of having “tried to sabotage public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19” earlier in the pandemic.

The Amazonas state government announced emergency measures Thursday — including a nighttime curfew, ban on mass transit and the airlifting of patients to other Brazilian states — as it grapples with the latest crisis.

“Today we are in the most critical moment of the pandemic, one that has no precedent in the state of Amazonas. We are facing a lot of difficulty in getting medical supplies. And as everyone is following, our main difficulty now has been getting oxygen,” Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima told a news conference Thursday.

Demand for oxygen is up fivefold over the past 15 days, according to the state government.

Some 235 patients will be airlifted to five other Brazilian states, the state government tweeted Thursday. It said the transfers were necessary due to the state’s oxygen shortages.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Thursday he had spoken with Lima and had offered immediately to send oxygen tanks. “Latin American solidarity above all!” he tweeted. Lima responded: “The people of Amazonas thank you!”

Minister: Vaccinations to start ‘in January’

Covid-19 vaccinations have yet to get underway in Brazil, despite its strong track record on national vaccination programs.

Speaking Thursday, Pazuello said Brazil would begin to inoculate people in January but did not specify a date.

“In January we will start vaccinating. In the beginning with 2, 6, or 8 million doses,” the health minister said. “And in February, we will have mass production, and our National Vaccination Program, which we’ve been doing for 45 years, will get ahead of everyone in the whole world, including the United States.”

The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) will meet on Sunday to decide whether to give emergency approvals to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines, according to the official news agency, Agencia Brasil.

Bolsonaro has publicly second-guessed the urgency of immunization, disparaging “the rush for a vaccine” in comments made last month.

“The pandemic is really reaching its end, the numbers have showed this, we are dealing with small rises now,” he said, according to CNN Brasil. “But the rush for the vaccine is not justified because you are playing with people’s lives.”

In its World Report 2021, Human Rights Watch recalled how the right-wing President repeatedly downplayed the danger posed by the coronavirus, by calling it “a little flu” and by spreading misleading information about the pandemic.

Bolsonaro “refused to take measures to protect himself and the people around him; disseminated misleading information; and tried to block states from imposing social distancing rules,” said the report.

“His administration attempted to withhold Covid-19 data from the public. He fired his health minister for defending World Health Organization recommendations, and the replacement health minister quit in opposition to the president’s advocacy of an unproven drug to treat Covid-19.”

Anna Livia Arida, Brazil’s associate director at Human Rights Watch, also recognized the role of other government institutions such as the Supreme Court and Congress in helping to “block many, although not all, of Bolsonaro’s anti-rights policies.”

Ministry defends record on rights

According to CNN Brasil, the country’s Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights issued a statement Wednesday arguing that the HRW report “ignores measures taken by the government to protect human rights during the pandemic.”

Numerous projects aimed to help children, adolescents, women and the elderly were mentioned in the statement, saying those were “a form of government aid to the socioeconomic developments that occurred in the pandemic,” according to CNN Brasil.

CNN has reached out to Bolsonaro’s office for comment.

Meanwhile, a study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, published Friday, found that “the spread of Covid-19 in Brazil overwhelmed the health systems in all the country’s regions, particularly in areas where they were already fragile.”

The findings, based on analysis of the first 250,000 patients admitted to hospital in the country, “reveal that a large percentage of Covid-19 patients that were hospitalised in Brazil required intensive care and respiratory support, and many did not survive.”

The researchers also found regional differences in mortality, with patients in the north and northeast of the country faring worse than those in the south.

The United Kingdom imposed a ban Friday on arrivals from Brazil, a dozen Latin American countries, Cape Verde and Portugal, which has strong travel links with Brazil, amid concerns that the new Brazilian coronavirus variant could spread to the UK.

British authorities are already battling to contain a more contagious variant first detected in the UK late last year.

UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said that scientists who had examined the mutation discovered in Brazil were concerned “not so much that the vaccine won’t work, in fact scientists think that it will work, but just the fact that it’s more spreadable.”","Sun, 17 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2021/01/a3d4968916ef25b3dfc01a7d9c22e56-320x180_700k-1-thumb.jpg,"['patients', 'collapse', 'surge', 'health', 'oxygen', 'brazil', 'amazonas', 'care', 'manaus', 'state', 'minister', 'brazils', 'covid19', 'brazilian', 'infections']",

Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

JANUARY

Hottest January on record

1 January

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

FEBRUARY

6 February

Record mainland Antarctic heat. The Argentinian research base Esperanza on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, measures a new high for the southern continent of 18.4C (65.3F).

9 February

Record Antarctic island heat. The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island is almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C in 1982. This has still to be confirmed by the WMO.

MARCH

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

APRIL

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

13 August

Two months of record rainfall in southern China kills 219 people, prompts the evacuation of 4 million, and causes $26bn in economic losses. The Three Gorges Dam inflow hits a record 72,000 cubic meters a second. The megacity of Chongqing is put on its highest flooding alert since 1981.

16 August

Hottest summer ever in the northern hemisphere. Death Valley records a temperature of 54.4C (129.9F), the third-highest on Earth since 1931 (and the two previous records are in question).

26 August

Record fires in California. More than 405,000 hectares burn in nine days – more than three times the average in the “normal” wildfire season. At least five people are killed, and more than 100,000 evacuated.

28 August

Record rain in Karachi of 231mm (9 in) in a single day. Pakistan has the wettest month in its history.

SEPTEMBER

4-12 September

Record flooding in the Sahel region of Africa affects 500,000 people. The White and Blue Nile burst banks. The average level of the Blue Nile reaches 17.43 metres (57.19ft), the highest since Sudan started measuring in 1912. Senegal records 124mm of rain over a seven-hour downpour – the amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season from July to September. Sudan imposes a three-month state of emergency on 4 September, after rains destroys about 100,000 houses and kills more than 100 people. In Nigeria, flooding damages 500,000 hectares of farm produce, amounting to about 5bn naira (£9.8m), according to NKC African Economics.

12 September

1 December

Record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season ends. Thirty storms grew strong enough to earn a name, beating 2005’s record of 28 storms. The WMO ran out of storm names by September, turning to the Greek alphabet for labels for the first time since 2005.

4 December

The bushfire season starts early in Australia with devastating wildfires on Fraser Island as experts worry that the months ahead could be disastrous.

12 December

The World Meteorological Agency says 2020 is certain to be among the three hottest years ever recorded. Although global emissions are likely to have fallen by 7% this year, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The UN reports global heating in on course to reach 3.2C by the end of the century because governments are not taking sufficient climate action to keep temperatures to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C to 2C. All eyes are now on the UN climate conference (Cop26) in Glasgow next year.

30 December

Almost one year on from the first reported case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, the worldwide death toll of the pandemic has passed 1.6 million people and is estimated to cause $28tn of losses. Scientists have warned such outbreaks will become more common as the world’s natural life support systems, including the climate, break down as a result of rising temperatures, deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade. The UN secretary general says humanity has been waging war on nature, and that making peace will be the defining task of the 21st century.","Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb9db4f80d4a4b71ebd3db63097319d092c6f50/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=014552998e4de138981ddd3ae07f737e,"['extreme', 'weather', 'hectares', 'million', 'fires', 'world', 'floods', 'hottest', 'searing', 'storms', 'photograph', '2020', 'record', 'records', 'average', 'heat']", 
88,88,FL-2015-000092-BRA,UPDATE 2-Brazil's central bank to flood lenders with fresh liquidity - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-banks-idUSL1N2BG0IX,"(Adds more measures, central bank president quotes)

BRASILIA, March 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank on Monday said it planned to inject 1.2 trillion reais ($233.81 billion) into the country’s financial system to counteract the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with more than half that amount comprising loans to banks.

Under the program, lenders will be able to package their loan portfolios into long-term deposits to be acquired by the central bank in a move aimed at freeing up 670 billion reais for fresh loans.

The bank loans are part of a raft of steps the Brazilian central bank announced aimed at keeping consumers and companies borrowing amid the coronavirus outbreak that it said would collectively make available the equivalent of 16.7% of Brazil’s gross domestic product in fresh cash.

“This is the biggest liquidity injection ever announced by the central bank,” Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto said in a conference call with reporters. “We understand that the acquisition of long-term deposits backed by banks’ loans will allow money to get to companies.”

New regulations governing the letters of credit backed by loans will be released soon, Campos Neto added.

Shares in Brazil’s biggest lenders were underperforming the Bovespa stock exchange index, amid concerns on credit deliquencies amid the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Itau Unibanco Holdings SA and Banco Bradesco SA down 8% and Banco do Brasil SA losing 9%.

The central bank also cut long-term reserve requirements to 17% from 25%, freeing up 68 billion reais currently in compulsory deposits with the central bank to banks.

It also announced measures allowing small and mid-sized lenders to issue up to 2 billion reais in special long-term bonds guaranteed by a privately held deposit insurance fund, limited to an amount equivalent to its shareholders’ equity.

The central bank estimates the measure will allow banks to extend up to 200 billion reais in new loans.

The central bank said it will also extend loans backed by corporate bonds to financial institutions between March 23 and April 30 to add liquidity to their investment funds.

The Brazilian central bank last week allowed lenders to offer firms and households in good financial shape increased loans and better terms over the next six months, besides lowering capital requirements.

Campos Neto added the central bank may further lower reserve requirements and announce other additional measures if necessary.

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Wed, 19 May 2021 11:30:28 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,"['china', 'debt', 'nurses', 'johnson', 'uk', 'rising', 'costs', 'prices', 'inflation', 'global', 'acknowledges', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'policy', 'huge', 'banks']", 
90,90,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact 31 million people globally - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/iu-cfw100120.php,"Study is first to assess the impact of climate change on the global population of river deltas

Thirty-one million people living in river deltas are at high risk of experiencing flooding and other impacts from tropical cyclones and climate change, according to a study by Indiana University researchers.

""To date, no one has successfully quantified the global population on river deltas and assessed the cumulative impacts from climate change,"" said Douglas Edmonds, the Malcolm and Sylvia Boyce Chair in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and lead author on the study. ""Since river deltas have long been recognized as hotspots of population growth, and with increasing impacts from climate change, we realized we needed to properly quantify what the cumulative risks are in river deltas.""

The findings are the result of a collaboration facilitated by IU's Institute for Advanced Study with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute.

The team’s analysis shows that river deltas occupy 0.5 percent of the earth’s land surface, yet they contain 4.5 percent of the global population—a total of 339 million people. Because river deltas form at the ocean at or below sea level, they are highly prone to storm surges, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise and coastal flooding.

In the study, IU researchers analyzed these geographic regions, which include cities like New Orleans, Bangkok, and Shanghai, using a new global dataset to determine how many people live on river deltas, how many are vulnerable to a 100-year storm surge event, and the ability of the deltas to naturally mitigate impacts of climate change.

“River deltas present special challenges for predicting coastal floods that deserve more attention in discussions about the future impacts of climate change,” said IU Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Eduardo Brondizio, a co-author of the study who has been working with rural and urban communities in the Amazon delta for 3 decades. “Our estimates are likely a minimum because the storm surge and flooding models do not account for the compound interactions of the climate impacts, deficient infrastructure, and high population density.”

With Edmonds and Brondizio, co-authors on the study include Rebecca Caldwell and graduate student Sacha Siani.

In addition to the threat of flooding, many of the residents in river deltas are low-income and experience water, soil, and air pollution, poor and subnormal housing infrastructure, and limited access to public services. According to the study, of the 339 million people living on deltas throughout the world, 31 million of these people are living in the 100-year storm surge floodplains. To make matters worse, 92 percent of the 31 million live in developing or least-developed economies. As a result, some of the most disadvantaged populations are among the most at-risk to the impacts of climate change.

“These communities are already dealing with health risks, lack of sanitation and services, poverty, and exposure to flooding and other environmental risks. Climate change is exacerbating all of these issues and creating more impacts,” Brondizio said.

To conduct their study, the researchers created a global dataset of delta populations and areas, aggregating 2,174 delta locations. They then cross-referenced the dataset with a land population count to determine how many people were living in the deltas. To determine the natural mitigation capacity of the deltas, researchers looked at the volume of incoming sediment deposited by rivers and other waterways flowing out to sea. The volume of incoming sediment was compared to the relative area of the delta to determine if the delta would be considered sediment starved and thus unable to naturally mitigate flooding.

Decades of engineering have expanded the habitable land area of river deltas, but they’ve also starved the regions of flood-preventing sediment. Without the sediment being renewed naturally, the shorelines will continue to recede, worsening the impacts of storm surges

“To effectively prepare for more intense future coastal flooding, we need to reframe it as a problem that disproportionately impacts people on river deltas in developing and least-developed economies,” said Edmonds. “We need better models for the climate impacts that are capable of stimulating compound flooding in densely populated areas so that exposure and risk can be mapped to more accurately assess risk and vulnerability.”

The storms have caused floods and landslides, submerging entire neighborhoods and sending homes tumbling down hillsides in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. Rains subsided by Monday, but were expected to resume later this week in some areas.

Flooded roads created violent rapids, sweeping up victims, cars and other debris.

Those evacuated were being housed in makeshift shelters in churches, schools and fire stations. Local authorities have asked for donations of clothes, sheets and mattresses for the victims.

In Minas Gerais, 15,000 people were evacuated and in Espírito Santo nearly 10,000 more, according to local rescue efforts. In Rio, at least 6,000 were evacuated, according to local news media, citing figures from various municipalities. Rio state authorities didn’t immediately respond to a request for official data.

Local authorities warned that the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area, home to nearly 6 million people, could see up to 100 millimeters (4in) of rain in the next three days.

The city had 171 millimeters (6.7in) over one 24-hour period from Thursday to Friday, the highest rainfall in 110 years.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.”

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing.”

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

94,94,FL-2015-000092-BRA,The world's largest wetlands are on fire. That's a disaster for all of us - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/americas/pantanal-fires-climate-change-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The world watched as California and the Amazon went up in flames this year, but the largest tropical wetland on earth has been ablaze for months, largely unnoticed by the outside world.

South America's Pantanal region has been hit by the worst wildfires in decades. The blazes have already consumed about 28% of the vast floodplain that stretches across parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. They are still not completely under control.

The fires have destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal's diverse indigenous communities. But their damaging impact reaches far beyond the region.

Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth's most effective carbon sinks -- ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe's wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle.

When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.

""The Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,"" said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. ""It is vital that it [receives] as much attention as the Amazon.""

Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected more than 21,200 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this year, a figure that is already 69% higher than the full-year record from 2005, when INPE recorded roughly 12,500 fires. There were 8,106 fires in September alone -- more than four times the historic average for the month.

Alberto Setzer, a senior scientist at INPE, said satellite data shows the fires are the worst since records began in 2002, both in terms of the number of individual blazes and the area burnt.

The Pantanal's distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the ""flood pulse."" During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again.

The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It's also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds.

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America -- higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon.

But this year's dry season has been the most severe since the 1970s. ""There has been a climate emergency situation, with a great drought, never seen before,"" Siqueira said.

Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires -- for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. But the unusually dry conditions this year have seen the blazes spread further and faster because there were fewer natural water barriers. Even areas that normally stay wet have turned into tinderboxes.

It's all connected

The fires ripping through the Pantanal are an example of a natural disaster that is exacerbated by climate change while simultaneously making the problem worse.

Extreme weather events, such as drought and floods, are becoming more frequent and more severe around the world, and the Pantanal is no exception. There are indications that the region is getting drier and warmer as the global temperatures rise.

A recently-burned area of the Encontro das Aguas park in the Pantanal wetlands, pictured on September 12, 2020.

This year's record dry season can be traced back to 2019, when the Upper Paraguay Basin experienced unusually low rainfall.

Biologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades, said official data showed precipitation had been below the long-term average over the past decade, but in the past two years had dropped further to just 70% of the average.

The region's rain patterns are also changing. While the amount of overall precipitation might not be dramatically different, the rains are becoming more extreme and concentrated over shorter periods of time.

Climate change is just one part of the problem. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon rainforest to the north and the Cerrado savanna to the east are also having profound effects on the Pantanal.

Ecology and conservation expert Leticia Larcher said deforestation was shortening rainy seasons and making droughts more severe in central and southeastern Brazil. She explained that it was impacting the ""flying rivers"" phenomenon, a crucial process in which a stream of moisture arising from the forest travels to other areas such as the Pantanal, where the water-filled air becomes colder and turns into rain.

""As the forest decreases and loses its ecological functions, the environmental service it provides is also being lost,"" Larcher said.

Mostly man-made

While fires ignited by lightning sometimes occur naturally in the Pantanal, Larcher, who works for environmental NGO Instituto Homem Pantaneiro, said this year's fires have mostly been caused by people. This is despite the Brazilian government's ban on fires for 120 days in the Amazon and the Pantanal that was issued in July.

But Siqueira said the ban wasn't being enforced strictly enough. ""There are extensive areas (where) livestock farmers have regularly used fire as a way to clear farm fields,"" said Siqueira. ""This year, even with the governmental ban ... these producers set fire that ended up spreading for thousands of acres due to the great drought.""

As the global demand for agricultural products rises, so commercial farmers clear more of the Pantanal's native vegetation for growing and grazing. Brazil is already the world's leading exporter of beef. As the demand for meat rises around the world, so does deforestation in the Amazon.

Sugarcane, cotton and soybeans are other lucrative options. When US President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese exports in 2018, Beijing retaliated by placing a new 25% tariff on American soybeans, forcing Chinese buyers to look for alternative sources of the protein-rich commodity.

Brazil was ready to step in. The US Department of Agriculture expects the South American country to have record soybean production this year, and the land area used keeps growing. A soy moratorium, in place since 2006, banned deforestation for the crop in the Amazon -- but those protections don't apply in the Pantanal and Cerrado.

Siqueira and many others, including global environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, Wetlands International and the WWF, blame the policies of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his Environment Minister Ricardo Salles for the devastation.

""It's a direct result of the dismantling of the Brazilian environmental agenda and its institutions under the current government,"" Siqueira said, pointing to deregulation and funding cuts for monitoring agencies.

""[There are] less actions to prevent fires, dismantling of responsible federal institutions, and omission at federal and state levels,"" said biologist Debora Calheiros, who has been researching ecosystems in the Pantanal for decades. ""Actually, it was the civil society that readily responded to rescue, save, feed and offer water to the surviving animals and help traditional riverine and indigenous people with food and mineral water,"" she added.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September, Bolsonaro refused to accept any blame for the fires, claiming instead that they were an ""inevitable consequence of high local temperature, coupled with the accumulation of decaying organic matter.""

Out of control forest fire burns the area of the Brazilian Pantanal in rural Mato Grosso.

Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly rejected criticism of his government's stance on the environment and has accused foreign actors of a ""brutal disinformation campaign"" on the issue, told the UNGA that no other country protected as much wild territory as Brazil.

Speaking to CNN's affiliate CNN Brasil last month, Salles, the environmental minister, doubled down on Bolsonaro's message. He blamed the fires on the drought and said farmers had no interest in burning the land, because they rely on it economically.

The government eventually recognized the Pantanal fires as a federal emergency and sent funding into the area, but for many, this was too little, too late.

The government's policies, Siqueira says, send a ""clear message of impunity of environmental crimes.""

Parts of the Pantanal have been designated a biosphere conservation area and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but overall, less than 5% of the region is under formal protection, according to the WWF. More than 90% is privately owned by ranchers, farmers and conservation groups, with 80% of that private land used for cattle farming, according to Brazil's environment ministry.

The fires burned millions of acres of flowering plants, starving pollinators and leaving no food for other animals.

The blazes are hurting local people too. The Pantanal is home to a number of indigenous and traditional communities, which have settled on the banks of the rivers and make their living from fishing and small-scale agriculture. ""Riverside communities, which traditionally survive on artisanal fishing, build their culture there strictly linked to the biome,"" Larcher said.

Fires are still raging in parts of the Pantanal, but recovery efforts are already underway.

The biome has gone through periods of harsh drought in the past. However, Calheiros said the ecosystems are much more fragile than they were just a few decades ago and their capacity to recover is uncertain. The environmental damage inflicted on the Pantanal is also much greater, she added.

Siqueira said it could take decades to restore what the blazes took. ""This will only be possible if we have a normal rainfall from 2020 to 2021,"" he said. If there is more drought, he added, the recovery of the plants and animals living in the Pantanal will be much more difficult.

An analysis by Indonesia’s space agency shows an area of forest twice the size of London was cleared in the past decade in the watershed area of the Barito River in South Kalimantan province.

During the same period, plantations spanning twice the size of Los Angeles have been established in the watershed area.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of licenses as well as rehabilitation of degraded areas in the region.

JAKARTA — Recent floods that inundated large areas of the southern part of Indonesian Borneo might have been exacerbated by massive deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines, activists say.

Heavy rains over the course of several days in early January battered the province of South Kalimantan, causing the Barito and other rivers to overflow. Floodwaters, in some areas as high as 3 meters (10 feet), forced the displacement of more than 112,000 people and claimed at least 21 lives. Nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) have been affected.

President Joko Widodo, during a visit to the affected district of Banjar, attributed the disaster to the heavy and sustained rainfall. But environmentalists say the rapid loss of forest in the region in recent decades contributed to the scale of the flooding.

An area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years, according to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover, while the watershed of another river in the province, the Maluka, has less than 1% of its forest cover remaining.

“It shows the carrying capacity of the forests in that region has drastically decreased,” Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Arie Rompas said.

Trees hold the soil in place, preventing erosion that results in heavy silting of rivers during rains. Silting makes rivers shallower, decreasing their water flow rate and making it more likely that they will overflow in the event of heavy rains.

The country’s disaster mitigation agency, the BNPB, has called for further studies to determine the cause of the South Kalimantan flooding.

“We also need to involve the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in [analyzing] the management of river areas and spatial planning,” BNPB disaster data, information and communications department head Raditya Jati said.

LAPAN analysis of satellite imagery shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito River’s watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres), according to LAPAN’s remote-sensing division head, Rokhis Khomarudin.

He said the analysis could provide an explanation of the possible cause of the recent flooding.

“We understand that plantations are related to the economy, but the environmental aspect has to be paid attention to,” Rokhis said.

However, the analysis hasn’t identified the type of the crops being cultivated in the area.

“Because the data is from mid-resolution satellite data, [we] haven’t been able to determine [whether the plantations are] oil palm or other plantations,” Rokhis said.

There’s conflicting data on the true extent of oil palm plantations in South Kalimantan. The Agriculture Ministry identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020. The Central Statistics Agency, BPS, lists 424,932 hectares (1.05 million acres) as of 2018.

Half of the plantation area, 227,791 hectares (562,884 acres), is owned or controlled by the 25 largest agribusiness conglomerates in Indonesia, according to a 2019 report by TuK Indonesia, an NGO that advocates for social justice in the agribusiness sector.

Among these conglomerates are Jardine Matheson Group, Triputra Group and Sinar Mas Group, which control 61,932 hectares (153,037 acres), 49,500 hectares (122,300 acres) and 48,741 hectares (120,442 acres) of oil palm concessions respectively, the report shows.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), the country’s largest green group, says it’s clear that South Kalimantan is in an ecological crisis driven by unbridled deforestation.

Half of South Kalimantan’s total area of 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) has been parceled off to the palm oil industry and the mining industry.

“Indeed, these floods are strongly suspected to be caused by the ecosystems that have lost their carrying capacity,” Walhi executive director Nur Hidayati said. “So when there is extreme weather, the carrying capacity collapses and causes disasters.”

Walhi South Kalimantan chapter head Kisworo Dwi Cahyono said the destruction of natural ecosystems in the upstream areas of the province’s rivers leads to flooding downstream.

“So this is [caused by] a disarray in the management of the environment and natural resources, and then the degradation of environmental carrying capacity,” he said.

Data from Global Forest Watch show that oil palm is not the only crop that might have contributed to deforestation in the region. In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, where 64,400 people were affected by the flooding, mixed fruit plantations occupy the largest span of plantation area, at 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres), while oil palms occupy only 200 hectares (500 acres).

In Banjar district, where floods displaced more than 51,000 people, rubber trees are the dominant crop, covering 38,500 hectares (95,100 acres), followed by oil palms at 27,900 hectares (68,900 acres).

But in Balangan district, where nearly 12,000 people have been displaced, mixed oil palm plantations cover the largest area, 19,800 hectares (48,900 acres).

While the dominant crops differ, all three districts have one thing in common: all have experienced massive deforestation. In 2000, lush natural forests in all three districts were still largely intact, occupying from 50% to 78% of the total area. By 2016, almost all of them were gone.

Mining

Besides oil palm plantations, environmentalists have also attributed the flooding to the proliferation of mines in the region. Walhi data show 814 coal mining pits left by 157 companies after they finished digging.

The Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) says there are 177 mining concessions dotted throughout the flooded districts.

According to data from the South Kalimantan provincial government, there were 13 coal companies with mining contracts and 160 firms with mining permits in the province as of 2013.

Combined, concessions for mining and oil palm plantations occupy half of South Kalimantan’s total area; 33% of the land falls under mining concessions and 17% under oil palm concessions, Walhi says.

“The biggest cause of deforestation in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo] right now is palm oil and coal,” Greenpeace Indonesia climate campaigner Hindun Mulaika said.

This is not the first time a major natural disaster in Indonesia has been linked to environmental destruction wrought by the plantation and the mining industries. In 2019, the hilly district of North Konawe on the island of Sulawesi was struck by floods that displaced thousands of people.

A report by the ombudsman of Southeast Sulawesi province said that “generally the cause [of the flooding] was land conversion for plantations, mining and illegal logging.” An analysis of the floods by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry cited “river silting” and “oil palm plantations” as among the causes of the disaster.

Extensive mining along North Konawe’s coast might also have been a factor. The mining exacerbated silting near the mouth of the Lasolo River, resulting in a “backwater effect” that intensified the flooding, the ministry’s report says.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of plantation and mining licenses in South Kalimantan as well as a moratorium on new mining permits in the wake of the recent floods.

“The current condition shows that the environmental carrying capacity [in South Kalimantan] is no longer capable [of mitigating disasters],” Hindun said.

Jatam campaign head Melky Nahar said it’s also important for the government to enforce the law by revoking mining and plantation permits in areas that play a crucial role in protecting the environment and the people who live there. He added the government should also start rehabilitating degraded areas in South Kalimantan.

“Without that, similar incidents will happen again [in the future] and we will listen to [rhetorical] statements from President Joko Widodo again,” Melky said.

Jefri Raharja, a campaigner at Walhi South Kalimantan, said the widespread deforestation in the region has also exacerbated global climate change.

“Kalimantan was once proud of its forests, but now the forests have been replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations and coal mines,” he said.

Brazil’s economy is suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic, causing a 40% slide in its currency, the real. That spurred a flood of exports of now-cheaper goods, but imports have dropped sharply, causing the imbalance in containers that has led to delays.

That’s a direct hit to Brazil, which with 30% of global coffee trade is the world’s largest exporter of the commodity.

According to shipping industry consultancy Datamar, there was an imbalance of nearly 80,000 boxes in Brazil in August, with around 251,000 containers leaving the country and only 172,000 arriving. By contrast, in January, 216,000 boxes arrived and 201,000 left.

Global shipping companies such as MSC and Maersk are fully booked for weeks to months in Brazil. Merchants say it is not feasible to currently export Brazilian coffee for prompt shipment, and what is possible can only be done at a higher cost.

“I sold coffee to a client in Spain and I’m still waiting for MSC to make containers available for the shipment,” said Nelson Salvaterra, a partner at Brazilian coffee exporter Coffee Selection.

MSC’s press office did not confirm that specific problem, and declined to comment further. Maersk said it was working to improve container availability.

“It is clear that the coffee sector is entering into the peak season. It is highly important that producers provide the proper visibility on when to move stocks in advance,” said Julian Thomas, general manager for Maersk East Coast South America.

He added that there is no more room for shipments in October.

Coffee, unlike other soft commodities like sugar, is shipped via containers rather than in dry bulk vessels.

Christian Wolthers, a partner at U.S.-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said he managed to find containers for a shipment out of Brazil, but there was no space in the ship and his merchandise was left at the port to be loaded onto another vessel.

Brazil’s trade surplus jumped to $6.16 billion in September, 38% more than a year earlier, due to the weak real. In recent months, Brazilian farmers rushed to sell their crops, boosting exports, as the weak currency means they receive more reais in dollar-denominated trade.

Foreign coffee sales that were planned ahead of time are being processed without much trouble, traders said. However, they said that some cargoes from Brazil may take longer to arrive, meaning global coffee merchants may need to substitute supply from other country.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20201014&t=2&i=1537379189&r=LYNXMPEG9D0BQ&w=800,"['delays', 'shipment', 'coffee', 'brazil', 'maersk', 'crop', 'weak', 'trade', 'wolthers', 'record', 'shortage', 'brazils', 'container', 'containers', 'shipments', 'brazilian', 'traders']", 
98,98,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Brazil mining flood could devastate environment for years - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-damburst-environment-idUSKCN0T40PY20151115,"RIO DOCE, Brazil (Reuters) - The collapse of two dams at a Brazilian mine has cut off drinking water for quarter of a million people and saturated waterways downstream with dense orange sediment that could wreck the ecosystem for years to come.

Nine people were killed, 19 are still listed as missing and 500 people were displaced from their homes when the dams burst at an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil on Nov. 5.

The sheer volume of water disgorged by the dams and laden with mineral waste across nearly 500 km is staggering: 60 million cubic meters, the equivalent of 25,000 Olympic swimming pools or the volume carried by about 187 oil tankers.

President Dilma Rousseff compared the damage to the 2010 oil spill by BP PLC in the Gulf of Mexico and Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira called it an “environmental catastrophe.”

Scientists say the sediment, which may contain chemicals used by the mine to reduce iron ore impurities, could alter the course of streams as they harden, reduce oxygen levels in the water and diminish the fertility of riverbanks and farmland where floodwater passed.

Samarco Mineração SA, a joint venture between mining giants Vale SA and BHP Billiton and owner of the mine, has repeatedly said the mud is not toxic.

But biologists and environmental experts disagree. Local authorities have ordered families rescued from the flood to wash thoroughly and dispose of clothes that came in contact with the mud.

“It’s already clear wildlife is being killed by this mud,” said Klemens Laschesfki, professor of geosciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “To say the mud is not a health risk is overly simplistic.”

As the heavy mud hardens, Laschesfki says, it will make farming difficult. And so much silt will settle along the bottom of the Rio Doce and the tributaries that carried the mud there that the very course of watershed could change.

“Many regions will never be the same,” he says.

Researchers are testing the river water and results should be published over the coming weeks, giving a better idea of the contents of the mining waste.

One cause for concern is that compounds known as ether amines could have been used at the mine to separate silica from the iron ore, in order to produce a better quality product.

According to mining industry research and scientific literature published in recent years, the compounds are commonly used at Brazilian mines, including Samarco’s.

At least some of the compounds, according to the website of Air Products, a company that produces them, “are not readily biodegradable and have high toxicity to aquatic organisms.” They can also raise PH levels to a point that is environmentally harmful.

“There will be serious problems using the water from the river now,” says Pedro Antonio Molinas, a water resources engineer and mining industry consultant familiar with the region.

Samarco did not respond to questions about whether it used the compounds or whether they were in the so-called tailings pond whose contents burst through the broken dams.

‘SWEET RIVER’

The disaster is the latest assault on the Rio Doce, or “Sweet River”, one of the main routes connecting mineral-rich Minas Gerais state with the Atlantic Ocean.

Once lined with thick rainforest and populated by indigenous tribes, the waterway has long suffered because of ravenous demand for the minerals nearby.

So synonymous is it with the mining industry that Vale, which means “valley” in Portuguese, refers to the land through which the river runs. Before a name change in 2007, the miner was formally known as the Vale of the Rio Doce Company.

Its banks now barren, and bed full of silt, the river grew prone to flooding with heavy rains that over the years devastated communities along its more than 800 km course.

More recently it was plagued by drought.

On Thursday, the river running a reddish brown, farmhands moved livestock away from its banks, afraid to let cattle drink the water. At a picnic table, Nilo Candido da Silva, 74, said he never saw devastation on this scale during a life spent by the river.

“I don’t think I’ll ever see it go back to normal,” said Silva, gazing at thick mud and shredded trees where last week the river rose but now just a brown trickle flows. A fish lay dead in the mud.

As the mud flows toward the ocean, environmentalists fear its impact on the coast too.

“Who had the brilliant idea of opening the dams along the river?” asked marine biologist Andre Ruschi in a Facebook post, referring to the decision by authorities to open dams along the Rio Doce to allow the surge to dissipate and proceed toward the ocean.

The mouth of the Rio Doce is a nesting area for endangered sea turtles, an animal sensitive to chemical changes in the water. The beaches are expected to turn a deep red.

“It’s a huge shock for nature,” said Professor David Zee, an expert in oceanography and the environment at the State University in Rio de Janeiro.","Sun, 15 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20151115&t=2&i=1095109336&r=LYNXNPEBAE0DZ&w=800,"['water', 'brazil', 'flood', 'environment', 'river', 'mud', 'devastate', 'doce', 'dams', 'vale', 'used', 'compounds', 'mining', 'rio']", 
99,99,FL-2015-000092-BRA,Fire burns Pantanal's upland heart and threatens nature's fragile balance - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/fire-burns-pantanals-upland-heart-and-threatens-natures-fragile-balance/,"After spreading for 9 months across the biodiverse Brazilian Pantanal wetlands, fires have reached the Amolar Mountains. This upland area is at the heart of the ecosystem and shelters traditional communities like Barra de São Lourenço.

Humans and animals, who thrive on the Pantanal’s seasonal cycle of rising and ebbing floods, now see their way of life menaced by an unprecedented wave of drought and fire.

The region’s inhabitants are already suffering from air and water contamination due to smoke and soot, and dread the fires’ aftermath. With the uplands devastated by the blazes, jaguars, other mammals and birds won’t have anywhere to flee during the next cycle of annual floods.

“For me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says resident Leonida Aires de Souza. But now that much of this remote area has burned, the future is uncertain.

“It has been a hard day. We are in the middle of a fight against the fire in one of the most emblematic communities of [the] Pantanal. For the first time in nine months, the fire is getting close to the houses, threatening people’s lives,” André Luiz Siqueira told this journalist in a rushed Whatsapp audio recording.

The director-president of the NGO Ecoa was in Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul, giving logistic support to nearly twenty firemen struggling to fight the flames in the Barra de São Lourenço community, along the Paraguai River.

At the same time, Denir Marques was rescuing his 80-year-old mother, nearly forced to drag her from her home. “The fire was close and the wind was really strong, and she didn’t want to get out. Lucky the firemen were able to save her house,” he says.

The scenes described by Siqueira and Marques happened on September 22. No one was hurt, thanks to the joint effort of volunteer firefighters who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with professional fire brigades from state and federal environmental agencies.

More than two weeks later, however, and the fires were still burning on the far side of the Paraguai River in the Amolar Mountains. According to the NGO the Man of Pantanal’s Institute (IHP), the fires were only controlled by mid-October after 90% of the area was consumed by the blazes (120.000 square kilometers or 2.9 million acres).

Eyewitness to a conflagration

The Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland and it straddles the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. Brazil contains the lion’s share of habitat, with the ecosystem spreading over Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states, in the Brazilian central-west.

Barra de São Lourenço is at the heart of this biodiverse territory — sitting on the border of the two Brazilian states, next to Matogrossense Pantanal National Park, and just a few kilometers from the frontier with Bolívia. The village, composed of just 25 families, sits at the confluence of the Cuiabá and Paraguay rivers, a hard to access area, reachable only by a five hour boat trip from the city of Corumbá.

“Some people say we are crazy for living here, in the middle of the bush. In the flood season, there are tons of mosquitoes. But, for me, being a ‘pantaneira’ is loving each stick, each tree, each bird. Is feeling part of it,” says Leonida Aires de Souza, president of the Renascer Women’s Association and a Barra de São Lourenço resident.

This deep sense of belonging, explains Siqueira, is firmly anchored in the founding of this community. “Barra de São Lourenço is a mixture of the cultures, [coming] from the descendants of the black slaves, the Indigenous guató and the survivors of the Paraguay War. They are the traditional Pantanal’s population,” he states.

The war Siqueira refers to was the worst armed conflict in South America, fought from 1864 to 1870 between troops from Paraguay and the Triple Alliance, formed by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The Indigenous guatós, for their turn, were among the original inhabitants of the Pantanal, along with the Bororo, Paiaguá, Guaikuru and Kayapó Indigenous groups.

Nowadays the guatós populate two Indigenous territories. One is located on Ínsua Island, a few kilometers from Barra de São Lourenço, and was not harmed by the fire. The other Indigenous reserve is the Baía dos Guató, around 200 kilometers away from there, and it had almost its entire area destroyed by this year’s fire.

“My grandmother was a guató,” says resident Denir Marques, proudly. Amid the mix of cultures, some Indigenous traditions remain strong in São Lourenço, including a handcraft in which an aquatic plant called aguapé is braided into beautiful baskets and hats. That art, along with fish and shellfish, is sold to tourists who come from Corumbá and travel up River Paraguai. In the dry season, the people plant watermelon, corn and cassava. During the flood time, they use a technique, called jirau, to increase the height of their houses with timber structures in order to escape the rising water. Now everyone wonders how the aftermath of the fires will impact these livelihoods and activities.

People and jaguars, in tune with the seasons

In the Pantanal, everyone follows the rhythmic seasonal cycle of floods (occurring from April to June) and their ebb (happening from July to December).

At the same time of year that the São Lourenço village dwellers elevate their houses, the animals from the National Park move from the wet bottomlands to the higher ground of the Amolar Mountains.

“Ninety percent of the national park is formed by lowlands that flood in the rainy season. So they [the wildlife] go to the mountains. When it gets drier, they come back to the park. It all works in a very balanced way. That is why the Amolar Mountains and the national park are both considered a natural heritage of humanity,” says Letícia Larcher, who has a doctorate in Ecology. According to the Mato Grosso Fire Department Command, 19.600 hectares (48.432 acres) have already been burnt in the national park, which represents 14% of its territory.

Big, far roaming mammals, especially jaguars (Panthera onca), are the most likely to move from one locale to the other. As a result, the Amolar Mountains possess the world’s second highest P. onca density; in one particular mountainous area, there are an average of ten jaguars per 100 square kilometers (38.6 square miles). Porto Jofre, 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the northeast, boasts the highest density anywhere, with 12.3 jaguars for each 100 km².

“Fortunately, we didn’t find any dead jaguars so far. They may have run to the protected areas of the Bolivian Chaco,” suggests Larcher, the technical coordinator from IHP, the institute that manages the four Private Natural Heritage Reserves (RPPNs) that protect the Amolar Mountains — all the RPPNs were hit by the fire.

Besides the jaguar, the Amolar Mountains are home to other mammals under threat of extinction, like the Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the queixada (Tayassu pecari, a species of pig), the tamanduá-bandeira (Myrmecophaga tridactyla, an anteater species), the tatu-canastra (Priodontes Maximus, a type of armadillo), and the ariranha (Pteronura brasiliensis, from the otter subfamily), along with the mutum de penacho (Crax fasciolata, a bird species). Of these animals the ariranha, or giant otter, is the most at risk, receiving an Endangered listing from the IUCN.

Climate change worsens fires?

Over recent weeks, about fifty men have struggled to curb the area’s blazes. But propelled by high winds, the flames were so strong they could “jump” over 40-meter (130-feet) wide containment lines — areas intentionally burned over by firefighters to deny the fires fuel to feed on.

“I am 53 years old and I was born here. I have seen huge droughts, but I had never seen a fire with such intensity,” says Leonida Aires de Souza. “It is the first time since 1974 that we don’t have a flood,” adds Marques.

According to biologist Débora Calheiros, annual rains have been below average regionally since 2010 — with 2019 and 2020 especially dry. In her view, the Pantanal may already be feeling the impacts of global warming.

“In this part of Brazil, climate change tends to let the weather [get] drier, with poorly distributed rains. In the face of it, the federal government should be working on prevention. But it is doing exactly the opposite. It has dismantled the [nation’s] environmental policy and even extinguished the Secretary of Climate Change and Forests,” notes researcher Calheiros, who has been studying Pantanal river and flood ecology for 30 years.

Larcher suggests that the unprecedented Brazilian fires result from the government’s failure to police environmental crimes across the nation, especially in the Amazon rainforest and Cerrado savanna; the Pantanal wetlands are a transitional zone between those two biomes. “The Amazon deforestation decreases the amount of rain that reaches Pantanal. And there are areas of the Cerrado, which shelter the headwaters of the main Pantanal rivers, which are totally devastated. Everything is interconnected,” Larcher points out.

Add to all these complex problems the reckless and even criminal actions of landgrabbers, irresponsible ranchers and farmers — who reportedly have set many Pantanal fires — and Brazil is looking at a formula for disaster, and one that may intensify in future.

“Everyone knows that since 2019 it has not been raining, [but still] people are setting fires to renew their pastures. Even with the [Bolsonaro government] decree forbidding it. It is a crime,” says Ecoa’s Siqueira.

In Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, ranchers often burn degraded pastures to renew grasses and reduce insect pests. But the burning for agricultural purposes is permitted only during the rainy season, and only with authorization from the State Secretariat for the Environment. In July, 2020, as a result of international pressure, the ban on fires was reinforced by a federal decree and moratorium on burning across the Pantanal and Amazon for 120 days.

That ban, however, didn’t have any practical effect. From July to September, Pantanal fires increased by 210%, soaring from 5,071 hotspots in 2019 to 15,725 hotspots in 2020, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Estimates are that over 3.3 million hectares (8.1 million acres) of Pantanal have gone up in flames so far this year. That’s about 22% of the entire region, and approximately six and a half times the size of Grand Canyon National Park. Reports show that most of the fires originated on private property.

Fire threatens future health

Even when such widespread and devastating fires end, their effects may be felt for a long time afterward by people and wildlife. Resident Denir Marques, for example, still recalls how he felt while battling the flames in his community. “We spent days and nights fighting. Those who couldn’t stand anymore would lay down on the river shore to take some rest. I felt ill, with a headache, because the smoke was too strong.”

A study by a Federal University of Alagoas laboratory found that the air in Cuaibá, Mato Grosso’s capital, reached carbon monoxide concentrations 15 times more than what’s acceptable to human health.

“This area of Barra de São Lourenço became the epicenter of the fires, so the smoke stationed there for more than sixty days. They [Firefighters and residents] couldn’t see 100 meters ahead. No one knows the effects of it on their health, especially during a pandemic, in a community that has always been forgotten by the governments and that has precarious access to the health system,” worries Siqueira.

Air quality isn’t the only concern. According to researcher Calheiros, regional water may soon be undrinkable. Excess organic matter, infused in the ashes, speeds the proliferation of bacteria harmful to human health. “When the rains start, probably at the end of October, [conditions] will get worse as more ash will be drained into the lakes and little rivers, and then to the major ones. The governments have to act with urgency to deliver drinkable water and chlorine to those [impacted] communities.”

According to Calheiros, water contamination may also prompt fish mortality. That would aggravate the crises that began in March, as the coronavirus suffocated outback tourism. Barra de São Lourenço’s people make most of their living from selling fish, shellfish and handicrafts to community visitors. Now, of the 17 participants in the Renascer Women’s Association, only four continue working with handcrafts. “We are trying to recuperate the association so our colleagues may live from our work again, from our handcraft. That is our way of living, it is inherited from our ancestral guatós,” says Leonida Aires de Souza.

The same future uncertainty applies to wildlife. Animals not killed outright by the blazes will have to survive in denuded inhospitable habitat, with potentially poisoned waters.

“The fire burned everything, from plants to the colonies of ants and termites. Even if the plants turn green again with the rains, [too] many [habitat] pieces will be missing to have a balanced environment. We still don’t know what is going to happen with these animals, because we don’t have any study that evaluates the impacts of a fire of such dimension,” Larcher concludes.
