The people of southern Madagascar are on the brink of a famine and need immediate humanitarian aid, according to United Nations food agencies. A three-year drought, exacerbated by this year's El Niño, has caused harvests to continue to fail. And people are left with no money and almost nothing to eat.

Just over half the region's population, about 840,000 people, is severely affected. And 20 percent of the population is in an emergency situation, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a standardized five-point scale used by scientists to rate the level of a region's food security. That segment of the population is in Phase 4, with Phase 1 denoting an abundance of food and Phase 5 meaning famine.

Despite its rich biodiversity, Madagascar is, in fact, one of the poorest countries in the world. According to the World Bank, nearly 60 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty and the vast majority live in rural areas, like the dry, drought-affected south. ""Ninety percent of the population in the south is living under the poverty level,"" says Jeanluc Siblot, the emergency coordinator for the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) in Madagascar. ""Forty percent of kids are suffering from malnutrition.""

Most people there are subsistence farmers, growing corn, cassava and rice. They plant around November and December, and harvest between April and June. Food is scarce each year from October to March (the lean season), when stocks from the previous harvest start to run low. Farmers do plant some vegetables, which they harvest around January and February, says Siblot.

""Agriculture there has been affected to the point that for this year the level of production was 90 to 95 percent lower than usual,"" says Dominique Burgeon, the director of the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) Emergencies and Rehabilitation Division.

""The harvest in May-June has been catastrophic,"" says Siblot. As a result, he says this year's lean season has started much earlier than usual. ""Since September, many households don't have any food stocks anymore.""

People have turned to selling their animals and other possessions – farming tools and household goods – to get some cash to buy food, which is mostly cassava. ""It is the cheapest food,"" Siblot says. ""People are eating this dry cassava, which is not a very nutritious food ingredient.""

Those with nothing more to sell, or those who live in remote areas with no markets nearby, have resorted to eating wild fruits and vegetables.

""We have even seen some people mixing clay — because there is some salt in it — with some wild fruits and wild vegetables,"" he says. They are also eating the fruits of a red cactus plant that is abundant in the area. ""The cattle, they call them zebu, are also eating this. People are removing the needles from the cactus and the cattle are eating cactus leaves.""

Many families have pulled their children out of school. ""We have also noticed that 31 percent of the households reported primary school dropouts,"" he says. ""They use their children to go to the forest to look for fruits and cactus flowers and leaves."" In places that are less remote and still have some functioning markets, many people have resorted to begging, he adds.

The WFP launched an emergency operation in June, says Siblot. The agency is giving cash and food — packages with cereals, pulses and oil — to the most affected communities. And the FAO plans to start distributing plant cuttings and drought-resistant seeds, so farmers can plant right now.

""If farmers aren't able to plant in the coming weeks, it means these people will rely on food aid until March 2018,"" Siblot says, adding that the FAO is also planning to help farmers with feed and animal vaccinations.

However, both agencies say they don't have the funds to help everyone in the region. Several countries, including the United States, have donated money to help both agencies, but it hasn't been enough. ""We need $22 million,"" says Burgeon. ""So far we have only $4.5 million."" And the WFP needs an additional $50 million, he says.

""If we don't get any additional funding, the situation will not improve,"" says Siblot. ""We have some food for the next two months. We need something more.""

Meanwhile, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network, an independent network of American agencies that forecasts food shortages around the world, the situation in Madagascar is likely to remain dire through February 2017. Without immediate humanitarian assistance, the situation could deteriorate into a famine, which means rates of acute malnutrition would soar and people would start dying from hunger.

""They're really, really struggling to survive,"" says David Orr, the communications officer at the South Africa office of the WFP. ""There's very little keeping them from falling over the edge.""","Mon, 05 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/12/05/famine-1_wide-c25a20e7f2400e33694f6272745d6d190697289d.jpg?s=1400,"['food', 'edge', 'famine', 'wfp', 'siblot', 'droughtstricken', 'jeanluc', 'eating', 'madagascar', 'population', 'southern', 'farmers', 'teeters', 'world', 'plant']", ,drought
1,1,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Madagascar drought: 330,000 people 'one step from famine', UN warns - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/25/madagascar-drought-330000-one-step-from-famine-un-food-and-agriculture-organisation,"The severe drought afflicting southern Madagascar has left 330,000 people on the brink of famine, a senior UN official has warned.



Three successive years of failed rains have left the island nation wrestling with crop failure and a chronic lack of food and clean drinking water, with agencies warning last month that nearly 850,000 people are experiencing “alarming” hunger levels.

“Three hundred and thirty thousand are on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies and rehabilitation at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

“People go from one lean season to the next, resorting to negative coping strategies. People are eating anything to fill their stomachs, selling most of their belongings, cattle and land. It shows the severity of the situation and the need for us to act.”

Farmers talk of the earth changing; of failed rains and crops, and barren land. Meanwhile, agencies are fighting a desperate rearguard action. Unicef, the UN children’s agency, reports growing demand for the high-calorie, peanut-based paste used to combat severe acute malnutrition.

“People are living under extreme conditions. We are dealing with a development crisis that has lasted for decades now, worsened by El Niño. For many, it is day-to-day survival,” said Elke Wisch, country representative for Unicef Madagascar.

Wisch emphasised the need to build resilience in the disaster-prone country, where food production has all but ground to a halt as the El Niño weather phenomenon exacerbates the effects of the drought. “We know that natural disasters will occur,” she said. “The important thing is how the local population can respond to these shocks.”

Yet mounting any kind of response is complicated by huge funding shortfalls. The World Food Programme’s (WFP) operations across seven countries in southern Africa are only 50% funded between now and April, with the total deficit at roughly $300m. The organisation’s $82m drought relief operation in Madagascar, which runs until March 2017, faces a $50m shortfall.

The FAO is also struggling, with a $17.5m shortfall limiting the distribution of emergency packages to 75,000 of the the 175,000 farming households in need.

Appealing for further donations, both organisations have stressed the importance of the forthcoming planting season. “If we miss planting season, the need for food assistance could go into March 2018,” warned Burgeon.

Either way, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult to get assistance to remote areas of the south, with journeys of more than 200km likely to take days by road.

Moreover, nutritional challenges are endemic, with more than 50% of children suffering from stunted growth, a condition caused by malnutrition over the first 1,000 days of life. The issue costs the world’s sixth poorest country an estimated $740m a year, roughly 7% of its GDP.

We're starting to see people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation Elle Wisch, country representative, Unicef Madagascar

“We have not even reached the peak yet, we are four to five months away from the next harvest,” said David Orr, the WFP’s regional spokesperson.



Madagascar’s president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, will be anxious to ensure that infrastructure issues in Antananarivo, the country’s gridlocked capital, do not impinge on the hosting of a summit for French language states this weekend. With hotel swimming pools being used for drying sheets and laundry, and the city’s river running lower than normal due to its use for bathing, washing and stone production, Antananarivo has not been untouched by the effects of the drought.

After the summit, Rajaonarimampianina will travel to the Paris headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for a donor conference.

In the absence of more immediate support, however, farmers in the region reliant on rain-fed agriculture face a precarious existence. “Worst case is another crop failure,” said Wisch. “Then you are looking at – and we’re starting to see this now – people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation.”","Fri, 25 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb22a58c75529f2ff18c5db211cde1e522a8b4c5/0_51_778_467/master/778.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fa35e469349cfd2c0bb52befb5308378,"['situation', 'food', 'step', 'famine', 'planting', 'drought', 'season', '330000', 'madagascar', 'wisch', 'warns', 'southern', 'country', 'need', 'unicef']", ,drought
2,2,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Madagascar skirted famine – barely. Now, it's boosting resilience before drought returns. - The Christian Science Monitor",https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2017/0725/Madagascar-skirted-famine-barely.-Now-it-s-boosting-resilience-before-drought-returns,"Battered by drought and civil wars, more than 20 million people from Yemen to Tanzania are at risk of starvation in what aid workers call the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. But over the past two decades, nations that once produced searing images of famine's toll have moved to thwart it by strengthening community resilience. Our reporters traveled to Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Somaliland to investigate the daunting challenges as well as the long-term efforts that are saving lives.

First, they sold their goats. Goats are precious, but not as sacred as hump-back zebu cattle. Then they sold their cattle, too. And finally they sold their kitchen pots. There was nothing to cook, anyway, besides leaves and bitter cactus fruit.

For farmers in Madagascar’s drought-stricken south, this menacing months-long countdown to impending famine last year was measured week-to-week at village markets, where they desperately tried to raise enough money to stay alive and buy seed for one more harvest.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A shepherd leads his livestock away from the Mandrare River after watering them in Amboasary. This area in the country's south has been experiencing a severe drought. The river's water level is very low.

And then the rains would not come, their cassava and sweet potato plants would wither, and the hunger in their bellies forced them back to the markets to sell whatever they had left.

“That’s the true indicator that the south is in real difficulty: when people sell their livestock and their kitchen utensils at rock-bottom prices,” says Dr. Audin Rabemiandriso, who for the past six years has run the health clinic in this dusty, ramshackle town, whose dirt streets are lined with women squatting by small piles of root vegetables for sale. “And last year was the worst that I’ve experienced.”

In international aid jargon, that meant that more than half a million people were enduring crisis-level “Phase 3” food insecurity. Another 330,000 were in even worse shape, suffering emergency-level “Phase 4” food shortages. “Phase 5” is famine.

“People were on the edge,” recalls Elke Wisch, head of the UNICEF office in the Madagascan capital of Antananarivo.

But they did not tip over. Catastrophe was averted. And now, with help from international aid donors and a little rain from the heavens, local farmers and their families are beginning to pick themselves up, rebuild their lives, and prepare to cope better with the next drought.

For a next drought there will surely be. The land in southern Madagascar is fertile: just three or four rains ensure a harvest. But farmers cannot count even on that. Droughts, once cyclical, are now semi-permanent. And last year the situation was worsened by El Niño, the weather pattern that made the rains even more irregular and insufficient.

That threw the farmers’ plight into sharper focus, reminding the world of the longer-term effects of climate change: Year by year, the lean season – from the day that villagers run out of food until the day they reap their next harvest – stretches a few weeks longer.

That is a challenge for peasant farmers across eastern Africa. But Madagascar’s success avoiding famine last year, and the lessons that it learned from its brush with disaster, point to ways in which crises might be averted elsewhere if villagers can strengthen their resilience in the face of danger.

If persistent drought is the new normal, local people are going to have to adapt to it, so as not to risk starvation again. Already, they are making changes to ward off the threat of famine, from more frequent clinic visits to keep an eye on kids’ health; to new sources of water and crops; to finding ways to earn a little extra cash, or raise a little extra protein – an egg-laying chicken, perhaps, that could mean the difference between life and death when the next climatic disaster strikes.

Spotting the crisis

If famine was averted this time round, it was partly because scattered rain has fallen on the parched fields in recent months – just enough for some farmers to gather small harvests of corn or cassava. But it was also largely because international aid agencies had long been present in Madagascar, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. They were in a position to spot the food crisis as it crept up, slowly and silently, and well-placed to quickly provide survival rations and other emergency aid.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A woman walks past a home in the small village of Ankilimanara, Madagascar. Poor infrastructure makes food aid delivery easier said than done, making cash aid more practical in some areas.

But even so, Madagascar’s pitiful infrastructure makes food aid delivery easier said than done. Roads in the south are in catastrophically bad shape, suited better to travelers on foot or on bicycles than to the rare motor vehicles that brave them. Any tarmac that was once laid through the open farm and scrubland has long since crumbled and washed away, leaving red clay highways cloven by mini-canyons that deepen with any rainfall. They are almost impossible for tractor-trailers carrying grain to navigate.

The World Food Programme has been working in the area for 30 years, meaning it could scale up quickly to feed a million people when the situation went critical. But new tactics gave added impact to its aid, circumventing Madagascar’s geographical challenges. Last year, in regions where there was still food to be had, the WFP gave an emergency $20 per month to families to buy what they could find.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mothers In Ankilimanara, Madagascar line up to sign an attendance sheet after a meeting with a nonprofit that gives them aid for malnourished children. Nearly half of the country's young children are chronically malnourished.

“You don’t need trucks to distribute cash, just mobile phone networks,” Theodore Mbainaissem, the WFP emergency coordinator in Ambovombe, says of the mobile money transfers. “It’s a lot more practical.”

WFP also handed out high-nutrition food supplements to moderately malnourished children, so fewer of them fell into the severe acute malnutrition that could kill them.

UNICEF, the United Nation’s children’s agency, saw that food was growing alarmingly scarce as early as 2015, when government doctors and nutritionists, carrying out routine health checks with UNICEF support, began reporting skyrocketing levels of child malnutrition.

Quickly, the agency expanded its nutrition programs to all 193 town and village health centers in the south, screening every child under 5 and making sure the worst-malnourished were given high-nutrition, peanut-based food supplements. “Our first priority was to prevent loss of life,” says José Más Campos, UNICEF’s emergency coordinator for Madagascar. By and large, they succeeded; few children died.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A malnourished baby cries after being weighed and measured by visiting doctors during a mobile clinic visit in Amboro, Madagascar. When the project began in this village in February, there were 22 children participating. Now 13 are still involved, the others have improved.

Generally, aid officials say, international donors reacted quickly and generously when they realized how grave the threat of famine had grown. But often they insisted their money be spent only on emergency cases – a familiar conundrum for NGOs.

That meant, for example, that UNICEF could not use some donors’ cash to treat moderately malnourished children, says UNICEF's Ms. Wisch. “We had to wait until the situation got absolutely critical,” she recalls, when children were suffering from severe acute malnutrition and their lives were at risk.

“We got a good response from emergency aid donors,” says Wisch. “But even if we got people over the hump this time we’ll have another drought in a year or two. What we need is a sustained resilience program … to stop people drifting into the next humanitarian emergency-threshold situation.”

Behind hunger, thirst

That’s the thinking behind a package of complementary measures that aid workers are now taking in southern Madagascar to build “resilience.” That is the new buzzword in humanitarian circles: It is seen as a key to ensuring that farmers have something to hold on to when drought strikes again, rather than finding themselves caught in an endless cycle in and out of disaster.

“This crisis is about food, of course, but it is mainly about water,” says Mr. Más Campos. “We are not getting enough either from the sky or from the ground.” Clean water, he argues, offers the path from emergency survival to long-term development.

UNICEF has been paying for trucks to deliver water to out-of-the-way villages, which spares residents from having to drink unsanitary surface water. But it is not a lasting solution.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Etienne Ramandimbisoa, UNICEF's water specialist, stands on part of an old pumping station by the Mandrare River near Amboasary that he is helping rehabilitate to bring water to drought-affected areas in the country's south.

Much more promising is the kind of system the government has set up with UN assistance in the village of Sihanamaro, a collection of simple wooden huts scattered among savannah shade trees, whose farmers scratch a living from land they have cleared of thorn trees.

Here, a solar pump carries clean water from a sealed well up to a water tower, from which it flows to seven community taps around the village, each set in a cement trough and protected by a picket fence.

“This has changed our lives,” says Vaha Saajinuru, a mother of eight who until recently had to walk four or five times a day to get water: down the dirt road out of town, and then across thorny grassland to a muddy pit more than a mile from her home.

The children who drank that water easily fell prey to disease that only made their malnutrition worse. “We knew it wasn’t good for our health but we had no choice,” says Ms. Saajinuru. “Now my kids have no more stomach problems, and there are three taps near my home where they can go to get water.”

A $10 difference

Water is still a problem in Ankilimanara, the tiny village where Patricia Soavenira lives in a low-roofed, cramped thatch hut with her husband and four children, sleeping on a mat on the bare earth. But at least she has something to give her family to eat.

Ms. Soavenira is one of 55,000 mothers whose malnourished children make them eligible for a $10 monthly cash handout from a local nongovernmental organization. She spends the money on weekly trips to a market an hour’s walk away, where she buys rice, corn, beans, and anything else she can afford.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mother of four Patricia Soavenira, who receives cash aid, sits inside her small wooden hut in Ankilimanara. She was able to buy one cooking pot and five spoons with her first money transfer.

“Without the cash, we’d just be eating cassava leaves and wild cactus like last year,” she says, watching a pot on a smoldering fire as she nurses her baby. “I was very, very thin then; very, very weak. And I was very frightened for my children.”

Soavenira had sold all her kitchen utensils except one pot and a spoon. Now she has bought five more spoons and another saucepan. They are only the bare essentials, but she would rather spend her money on food, she says. “We are still hungry.”

The monthly cash handouts are keeping people in Anklimanara alive, but the NGO running the program, the Foundation for Development Intervention, has an innovative, broader vision. Over the next few months it will hand out $60 grants (a small fortune in a country where few earn more than $2 per day) in “getting back on your feet” money.

Recipients will be expected to invest it in some sort of productive project – buying a goat, or planting pigeon peas that need little watering and yield crops repeatedly over three years, for example. Soavenira plans to buy some chickens, she says.

“They could save my life,” she says flatly. “We can eat their eggs, or if one of my kids falls sick I could sell them to get the money for medicine. It means security.”

Resilience made real

Security is all that sweet potato farmer Prinu Rakutunirina wants, too, as he surveys his field of spindly green shoots under a beating sun. But that doesn’t come easy in these parts.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A farmer kneels in a field of drought-resistant sweet potatoes with members of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and a local nonprofit in Andahive. The NGO's distributed seeds and tubers to the farmers so they could grow this variety of sweet potato, which is more nutritious and longer lasting – It can keep for a year.

Maybe it was faith or maybe it was desperation, but he stuck with his experimental variety through two crop failures last year, and now he is glad he did. The new strain of tuber, introduced by agronomists with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is more drought-resistant than most. But it was no match for last year’s drought: Starved of water, the plants withered in the dust in July, and then again in September.

But Mr. Rakutunirina finally brought in a harvest last February. And what a harvest. Yields were double what they used to be, he says, and what’s more, the new sweet potatoes last for nearly a year, whereas the old kind rotted after a few weeks. That means he can decide if and when he wants to sell them. It also means he will be able to carry his family through the dreaded kere, the lean season between harvests when there is normally nothing to eat. This is “resilience” made real.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A malnourished baby's arm is measured during a mobile clinic visit aimed at severely malnourished children in Amboro, Madagascar. The program is run by the national nutrition office and supported by UNICEF.

Rakutunirina was part of a pilot group using the new variety. “We all saw our crops increase and now everyone wants to plant this type,” he says, though it will be a year until the 100,000 farmers now using the improved seeds will have harvested enough to spread the variety throughout the drought-stricken south.

“If there is no rain for three months, it does not matter how many high yield seeds you plant,” points out Jean-Etienne Blanc, an FAO field worker. “You’ll get a poor harvest. But farmers are learning about good-quality seeds and how to use them, and next year they will be seeking them out.”

Rakutunirina is a convert. “Everything depends on the rain, of course,” he says. “But this plant can protect us from the return of hunger.”","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/moms-lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['returns', 'resilience', 'food', 'water', 'famine', 'stetson', 'freemanstaff', 'drought', 'boosting', 'aid', 'cash', 'skirted', 'madagascar', 'farmers', 'village', 'children', 'barely']", ,drought

Along the thirsty way, some give up and instead use plastic jerry cans to scoop up whatever they can find in potholes along the road – muddy liquid that aid workers jokingly call “chocolate water”.

This region of Madagascar has been chronically poor for decades, but a series of droughts, which government officials say are driven by climate change, have left close to a million people struggling to cope in this southern African island nation.

Drought is increasing the risk of malnutrition and could cause deaths in children younger than five, half of whom already suffer from stunting, Norohasina Rakotoarison, a spokeswoman for Madagascar’s Ministry of the Environment, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

In the south of the island, where many people farm for a living, the rainy season is getting shorter and shorter, they say. Rains that once stretched from October to March now fall only between December and February.

A recent El Nino event – a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific that often causes drought in southern Africa – aggravated already dry conditions, driving hunger not only in Madagascar but across southern Africa.

That El Nino has now ended, but many families have not recovered, and harsh weather continues, they say.

“The air is more violent. The wind is very strong,” Soja Voalahtsesylvain, the chief of AnkilibeVahavola, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Around the area, “there’s no production because the land is very dry”.

“It’s our everyday life now,” he said. “We wait for the rain because our main issue is lack of water. We don’t know when it will come.”

In Madagascar, nine in 10 people live on less than $2 a day, according to Unicef. Poverty is even worse in the dry south. Bumpy roads last paved in colonial days impede the delivery of aid, and mean even emergency transport is difficult.

Hoasie, a woman in her 40s who goes by one name, said she was forced to carry her 3-year-old son 20 kilometers to the nearest hospital in November, after large bumps broke out on his body.

It turned out he was suffering from acute malnutrition and a lack of protein. But the drought makes it difficult to feed him better, she said.

“We’re farmers, so when there is no rain we have no crops,” she said.

In September, construction began on a much-needed pipeline that will carry clean water much closer to 13 thirsty communities in this area of southern Madagascar.

The pipeline, funded by Madagascar’s Ministry of Water and Unicef and expected to be working by March, will provide household water for about 46,000 people.

“It’s an emergency to complete this pipeline,” said Heriniaina Rakotomalala, a civil engineer who works with Unicef on the project.

For now, in AnkilibeVahavola, home to about 3,000 people, families are trying to get by using a traditional lending system, in which poor families borrow water or food from neighbors and eventually pay it back when the rains come.

But this year, it’s been more difficult.

“Because of drought every livelihood has gone,” said Aova Soatoatse, a 43-year-old with 13 children. She said her family are now eating wild cactus plants to provide the bulk of their diet.

Looking for cash to buy food, they sold their wooden shelter and moved into a smaller one – but the paltry money bought food only sufficient for two days.

“Then the money was finished,” she said. Now they live crammed together into a one-bedroom wooden shack.

At the moment the family still has six chickens. But the small plot of land they own is steadily decreasing in size, as they sell off bits to buy more food.

The family isn’t the only one facing hard times.

“There’s no food and people are hungry. We only eat cactus seed and fruit. We cook it and boil it with water,” said Rafoava Ravaonimira, 65, another resident of the village.

She said it was hardest to explain to the youngest children why they can only have one meal a day. “The older the kids grow, the more they understand. They start to understand aged si

Unicef officials say there are 850,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance in Madagascar, including 391,000 children.

Jean-Benoît Manhes, Unicef’s deputy representative in Madagascar, called the situation a “silent crisis”, which gets little attention because of the island’s lack of geopolitical significance.

“(It’s) a French-speaking island in an English-speaking region. With a (something like a) cyclone you can take nice before and after photos,” he said.

But with drought, “it just gets a little bit dryer each year,” he said.

He said it’s important to understand that climate change is not the only threat to food security. Slash-and-burn agriculture techniques, particularly the burning of forests – which when left standing can stabilize rainfall – also are playing a role, he said.

“There’s climate change, but human action reinforces it. In the south they burn forests for charcoal and agriculture. That reinforces climate change,” he said.

Meanwhile, many families in the impoverished south with large families are faced with a hard decision: which of their children to feed.

“Families may prioritize giving food to the children who can work to help, leaving less to the smallest children who are already malnourished,” Manhes said.","Fri, 05 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180105&t=2&i=1219549195&r=LYNXMPEE040G0&w=800,"['hungrier', 'water', 'south', 'grows', 'food', 'thomson', 'parched', 'pipeline', 'chocolate', 'madagascars', 'madagascar', 'southern', 'left', 'families', 'unicef', 'children']", ,drought
4,4,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Drought causes extreme hunger in Madagascar - National Catholic Reporter,https://www.ncronline.org/preview/drought-causes-extreme-hunger-madagascar,"Hunger levels are so severe in drought-ridden southern Madagascar that many people in remote villages have eaten almost nothing but cactus fruit for up to four years, said a Catholic Relief Services official.

Eating this fruit leaves crimson stains on people’s faces and hands, and there is a “shame of poverty associated with these stains in Madagascar,” an island nation 250 miles off the coast of mainland Africa, said Nancy McNally, CRS information officer for East and Southern Africa.

The cactus plant “is the only thing that grows” in southern Madagascar, and the plants “are growing everywhere” in earth “that looks like white silt,” she said in a Nov. 23 telephone interview from Nairobi, Kenya.

A father of three, sitting with his wife and children outside the town of Beloha in southeastern Madagascar, “told me that his family had been living on cactus fruit for a year,” McNally said.

“With whatever money he could make” from finding something to sell, he would buy food for the youngest child, she said, noting that “this would amount to a little bit of rice once in a while for the boy, who was about a year old.”

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned in late November that 330,000 people in southern Madagascar are “on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine.”

El Nino, a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, has aggravated dry conditions in Madagascar and the entire southern African region, where an estimated 39 million people are affected by food shortages.","Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ncronline.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/stories/images/ss12302016p03phb.jpg?itok=tKgm6luw,"['fruit', 'wife', 'food', 'cactus', 'hunger', 'drought', 'causes', 'stains', 'youngest', 'madagascar', 'white', 'southern', 'mcnally', 'extreme']", ,drought

A woman squats in one of them, looking out her low door. Her small stick house is bare, but for a blanket, a mosquito net and a homemade straw mat.

Her words settle in a sigh: “I have nothing left.”

It is the lament of a parched land, where women cry for thirsty children, and farmers’ hope is spent.

In Madagascar, the island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa, a grim cycle has set in. Rains arrive late and leave early in the African country most exposed to climate change, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, floods, cyclones and extreme temperatures have wrought severe damage on agriculture in recent decades.

The worst drought in 35 years pushed families to the brink in the last year, with the harvest 95% lower than in 2015.

Fringes of prickly pear cactus run through Kobokara, yet to bear fruit. Usually it is only cattle fodder.

“It’s been one year that we have been eating the leaves of the cactus,” said the woman in the stick house, Tonelie. Like many here, she has only one name.

Nearly 850,000 people in Madagascar desperately need food aid. But the U.N.’s humanitarian appeal for the country is only 29% funded because of emergencies elsewhere. Even the most desperate families are given only half of what they need to survive.

Each year, farmers in southern Madagascar sow their seeds in November for the rainy season, but in recent years the skies have only spluttered sulkily for a few weeks, before drying up and searing the immature crops.

Some rain finally arrived late last year, but many families had no seeds left to plant and no money to buy them.

I had no money to buy water, so my children were crying. Sometimes when I see my children crying, there’s a tear in my eye too. Jocelyn Rasoanakambana, 29, a single mother of six children in Ikopoky village, southern Madagascar

With repeated crop failures, people have to sell firewood to survive, taking small sharp axes and hacking efficiently at the trees that are the lungs of their dying country — only deepening the crisis.

Tonelie, 42, has six of her eight children still living at home and no husband. She has land to farm, but it is bare.

Eight months ago, she made the long, regretful walk to market to sell her last cow. Many people in this harsh land have sold their last goat or even their last chicken.

Then week by week, they have sold everything else: clothes, spoons, tin plates, cups, pots, plastic sheets. Even their mattresses.

They cling finally to their plastic water cans, receptacles of the last drops of hope.

Tonelie even had to sell hers.

Painfully thin, she speaks with quiet resignation. She rises each morning with empty pockets and has the hours of daylight to somehow come up with something so that she and her children can live another day. She works someone else’s land to earn the equivalent of about 30 cents a day.

She took her children out of school because there was no money, so they must help in the grinding job of survival.

In Kobokara, people dig holes in the sandy ground for water, but five months ago, the water dried up. Once a week, water sellers from a village to the east drive their ox carts nine miles along the deep sandy track, and Tonelie takes out the crumpled, sweaty banknotes that will decide her week.

“If I have [enough] money I buy two cans. If not I buy only one can,” said Tonelie, referring to the plastic five-gallon cans used to store water. (She has to borrow them.) In a bad week, that leaves the equivalent of just over one soda can apiece a day.

“My biggest problem is food,” she said. The 30 cents she earns as a farm laborer buys water, “but it’s not enough to buy food.” Her family survives on prickly pear cactus and occasional handouts from an uncle in a nearby village.

Across the south, small children endure constant, pitiless thirst. Mothers go without so that their children can drink a little more.

“The biggest issue in the south is water. They don’t have rain. They don’t have access to water, even in good years,” said Elke Wisch, UNICEF’s country director for Madagascar.

In the neighboring village of Ikopoky, Jocelyn Rasoanakambana, 29, puts her six children to sleep without water on the days she has no money.

“I can borrow a bit of money to buy water,” she said recently. “But when it’s day after day after day, even my relatives don’t want to give. When we have no money, we go to bed without drinking any water.

“Last Thursday was one of the worst days. I had no money to buy water, so my children were crying. I felt so helpless, thinking about what is happening to us. Sometimes when I see my children crying, there’s a tear in my eye too.”

In her village, three children in one family died recently and the parents moved away.

Humanitarian agencies such as the World Food Program, UNICEF, Catholic Relief Services and USAID have tried to help, providing cash grants, food, seeds, water and health projects. But their efforts haven’t been enough.

World Food Program rations had to be cut in half because the agency’s fundraising target from donors fell short, and some villages were never reached by humanitarian agencies.

“Families are ashamed abut not being able to provide for their kids. They’re embarrassed,” said Joshua Poole of Catholic Relief Services. “If a child passes away they wait until night to bury them, when no one else is around.”

From Tonelie’s house in Kobokara, it’s short walk past a rare shady tree to the small house of an old farmer named Veza. He plucks a red flower from the prickly pear cactus and bites into it with crooked yellow teeth. He planted last year, but the crop died; this year he had no money and no seeds, and there was not enough rain.

He senses his life is coming to an end, gradually whittled back to nothing.

Veza’s modest wealth was the work of a lifetime: three goats and four cattle, in a culture where money and pride are counted in herds of cows and bulls. But one of the cattle died. Four years ago, after bad rains and a failed harvest, he took the bitter decision to sell the other three.

“I didn’t have any choice. I felt terrible, because I didn’t have cattle. I had nothing.” A year later his wife, calling him weak, walked out and never came back.

Then two of his three goats died. And with dwindling hope in recent months, he sold the last goat and all his plates and pots.

“I am so unhappy. I’m just waiting out the rest of my life, until I die.”

Underlying the crisis is entrenched, grinding poverty, corruption and bad governance.

“We are talking about a country with a large majority of the population being extremely poor,” said Wisch. “There is a small group of the population which is extremely rich.”

Around 90% of Madagascar’s 23 million people live on less than $2 a day and 80% survive on less than a dollar, according to UNICEF. As a result of chronic malnutrition, nearly half of the children suffer stunting, the fourth highest rate in the world.

“Where you have chronic poverty and there’s a shock, people fall straight into crisis because they don’t have any reserves. They don’t have any food,” said Jean-Luc Siblot of the World Food Program. “In Madagascar, three years of poor rains and crop failures have led to a catastrophic situation.”

The U.N.’s ambitious Sustainable Development Goals — which include urgent action on climate change and the elimination of all hunger and poverty by 2030 — are supposed to see the world humanitarian community move beyond crisis mode. The aims include boosting people’s resilience, improving education, strengthening agriculture and reversing land degradation and deforestation.

But long-term goals take a back seat in times of crisis — a withering drought caused by the 2015-16 El Niño, and humanitarian emergencies in Nigeria and South Sudan triggered by war.

“Let’s be clear. To overcome a poverty situation such as this one, a development program by a number of international organizations will not solve the problem. It is the government and good governance that will at some point change the situation or make the situation a little better,” said Siblot.

“There needs to be reforms at all levels,” said Wisch, of UNICEF. “There needs to be a focus on bringing down the levels of corruption.”

Many farmers, defeated by drought, have left to work in the wetter, less impoverished north of the country, as rickshaw cyclists or illegal miners in protected forests. They include Tonelie’s former partner, the father of her eight children, who sent her $3 last year. She doubts she will ever see him again.

When it finally rained in Berohambato village in December, Kazy Liarihee felt a stirring of hope. Her husband hurried out early in the morning to plant the few seeds of cassava, maize and sweet potato that they have left. Even if the rain does last, the family with nine children will endure months of hunger before the harvest.

“It’s very hot,” she said. “There was no rain last year and we had no crop. The wind blows all the time, and we eat only red cactus.”

Operational Updates

Food security in the south and south-east: Findings from the Government-led Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC, June 2019) indicate that 900,000 people from 13 districts in the south and south-east are in crisis (IPC 3) and emergency (IPC4) and need urgent humanitarian assistance. In the south, the damages caused by pests and irregular rainfall during the 2018/2019 cropping season negatively impacted the main harvests in May and June.

WFP emergency response: WFP will assist 220,000 people through general (food or cash) distributions. This includes 29,000 children aged 6 to 23 months and 15,000 pregnant and lactating women (PLW) who will receive supplementary feeding for the prevention of acute malnutrition. Assistance is planned for November 2019 to February 2020, in collaboration with the National Office for Risks and Disasters Management (BNGRC) and the National Office of Nutrition (ONN) and in collaboration with existing social safety nets managed by the Ministry of Population.

WFP’s response to drought and cyclones faces a funding shortfall of USD 44.6 million for one year (August 2019 - July 2020). A possible reduction of the operations due to funding limitations could lead to a deterioration of the already precarious food and nutritional security of the affected people.

WFP interventions in the south and south-east in July reached 103,241 people through general distributions (food and cash) and nutritional support for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition. Nutritional support was also provided to tuberculosis patients.

WFP, in collaboration with its partners, is conducting a technical study in view of the continuation of food assistance for assets (FFA) in the four communes of Faux Cap, Fotadrevo,

Tameantsoa and Vohilava. These communes have agricultural potential but are highly vulnerable to natural disasters. FFA activities include the installation of agrometeorological stations to monitor climate change and plan harvests accordingly.

School-feeding programme - WFP, in collaboration with the Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training, implements a school meals programme for primary school children in the southern regions of Anosy, Androy and Atsimo Andrefana. In July, 164,994 children were assisted.

A pilot cash-transfer project for 5,000 children is implemented in 12 schools in Atsimo Andrefana. The cash is used to buy fresh food locally and provide the school children with diversified menu. For September, WFP is planning review sessions of the cash transfers modality.

Nutrition

Stunting prevention: WFP in collaboration with the Ministry of Public health, ONN, FAO, UNFPA and WHO implement a joint stunting prevention project called MIARO for PLW and children aged 6 – 23 months old in the Ampanihy and Amboasary districts. Food fortification national assembly (ANFA): On 13 August, WFP participated in the Food Fortification National Assembly in Antananarivo, funded by the sEU and WFP. The meeting’s objectives were to validate the ANFA terms of reference and action plan.

Nutritional interventions mapping: A mapping exercise was officially launched on 22 August in Antananarivo under the SUN initiative. This exercise, funded by Japan, aims to improve the coordination of nutritional interventions, and improve the monitoring and evaluation system, in order to achieve the objectives of the National Action Plan for Nutrition (PNAN III). Support to market access for smallholder farmers

Food bank: The BNGRC, the Lions Club International and WFP are setting up a food bank benefiting to 2,000 households in the commune of Tanandava (Amboasary district) in southern Madagascar. The food bank will be used to stock harvests, which will be consumed during lean seasons, thus ensuring food availability and avoiding price fluctuation. In August, WFP and partners discussed and validated the management method and activities timeline.

Post-harvest loss (PHL) management: From 24 to 30 August, WFP organized a series of PHL trainings for its local NGO partner CTAS, for 53 representatives of farmers organizations in Tanandava and for WFP Staff. The objective of the initiative, funded by the LatterDay Saint, is to support farmers in improving harvests handling and reducing losses.

Local purchases: WFP is purchasing nearly 950 mt of food (pulses and cereals) from farmers associations in southern Madagascar, which will be used for the school meals programme and FFA.","Thu, 03 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1375723-WFP-0000108472.png?itok=D19fJm4z,"['brief', 'food', 'nutritional', 'south', 'wfp', 'support', 'collaboration', 'harvests', 'national', 'madagascar', 'country', '2019', 'school', 'children']", ,drought

Here, vulnerable households’ livelihoods are precarious and not diversified, and are mainly dependent on agricultural and livestock activities. In addition, more than 90 percent of the Malagasy population lives below the poverty line.

Chronic drought periods from 2012 to 2014, aggravated by the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon that caused about 80 percent crop losses, led to a deterioration in food security and populations’ vulnerability.

Since 2016/17, efforts have been made through emergency and agricultural activities, and continued throughout the 2017–2018 cropping seasons, to help protect and restore the food security of the communities in southern Madagascar. However, the cumulative effect of the adoption of negative coping mechanisms during crisis years have increased people’s vulnerability, leaving them unable to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the 2018/19 main agricultural season.

In response to these challenges, and in particular to the potentially negative effects of an El Niño-induced drought in 2019, FAO launched an early action project to protect the livelihoods of the most vulnerable, with support from the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities.

The project is being implemented in the three districts of Ambovombe, Amboasary and Taolagnaro, which are constantly affected by climatic hazards such as drought. Project activities focus on supporting producers through the provision of short-cycle quality seeds, and improved water availability and management to ensure planting during the main agricultural season. Vulnerable selected farmers will also benefit from the protection and strengthening of their productive assets through livestock restocking and vaccinations.

Nearly 3 000 households, were targeted for the assistance for the period of January–July 2019. Households who receive agricultural inputs will also benefit from training on improved farming techniques, crop diversification and its benefits, and local support, particularly on the use of fertilizers, compost, the establishment of woody fodder plants and storage. These trainings will also be provided to technicians of partner institutions in order to ensure the sustainability of gains made for better services to farmers. Throughout project implementation, FAO encourages collaboration among all relevant partners, including local communities, with the ultimate goal of strengthening their resilience to future shocks.","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/madagascar-mg2018f-ewea_1606_44025137890_o.jpg?itok=P1aaB9qU,"['supports', 'strengthening', 'agricultural', 'households', 'support', 'drought', 'project', 'activities', 'madagascar', 'response', 'fao', 'southern', 'vulnerable', 'el', 'livelihoods', 'ensure', 'niño', 'protect']", ,drought

Key Messages

• Rainfall in the 2019/2020 rainy season is forecast to be below average in southern Madagascar, but average to above average in the central highlands, and above average in the north. This is favorable for national crop production but may be challenging for agriculture in the south.

• Food prices are currently stable throughout the country due to stable market supply and the availability of households’ stocks, particularly in the South.

• Pest infestations may be a determinant of this season’s agricultural production in the south as fall armyworm is now endemic, and Malagasy migratory locusts were reported in the southwest in September.

• In October 2019, poor and very poor households in the most southwest and extreme south districts of Madagascar are experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the impact of humanitarian food assistance in Beloha are experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2!), and households in Ampanihy are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) because of below average staple production and the persistence of high rates of malnutrition.","Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1387328-Madagascar_Outlook_Oct2019.png?itok=AhwReTce,"['food', 'update', 'south', 'ipc', 'production', 'households', 'stressed', 'security', 'phase', 'stable', 'season', 'madagascar', '2020', 'southwest', 'outlook', '2019', 'average']", ,none

VAHAVOLA, Madagascar – It’s 9 a.m. and the sun is already beating down on the village of Vahavola in Madagascar’s southern region. The temperature outside is over 35°C.

Vola Lambae sits with her seven children in the family’s small hut in the middle of a cactus plantation. It’s one of the few crops that still grows easily in the area. The nearest source of water is a river more than 3 km from the village, but it’s not safe to drink.

Around noon, the whole family prepares for what will be their only meal of the day: cassava leaves. The children are already frail from the lack of consistent food, vitamins and minerals. But this is all they have to eat.

""We can’t grow rice or other crops as the land is dry and the rain is scarce here. We could not plant anything at all. The cassava leaves come from other people's plantations, but they fill our bellies and help us sleep,” says Vola.

Vola’s youngest child, seven-month-old Mosa, is skinny and fragile. He is still breastfeeding, but Vola doesn’t produce enough milk because she herself eats so little, and she does not have enough clean water to drink.

A crisis of malnutrition

Vola and Mosa’s situation is reflective of a larger problem across Madagascar. Nearly half of all children under the age of five are stunted (low height for age) because they aren’t getting the nutrients they need to grow.

Children like Vola’s who aren’t getting enough food, both in terms of quantity and variety, are more susceptible to infectious diseases. They are also at risk of developing severe acute malnutrition – dangerously low weight and severe muscle wasting – which is a major cause of death for children under five.

Since 2014, the southern region has been particularly hard-hit by decreased rainfall, taking a toll on crop production. The ongoing El Niño weather phenomenon has compounded the drought, leaving 1.1 million people food insecure in 2018, including nearly 500,000 children. The number of children who are acutely malnourished is expected to rise in 2019.

Getting treatment before it’s too late

Today, community health workers are visiting Vahavola village. The UNICEF-trained staff travel to remote areas to identify children in the early stages of severe acute malnutrition. As soon as they see Mosa, they know he needs help. They decide to bring him to the Sampona health centre, the nearest health facility a 30-minute walk from Vahavola.

Once he arrives in Sampona, health worker Ericka Razafimbelo measures his weight and height. She also measures his upper arm with a special tool called a mid-upper arm circumference band. Mosa is in the red zone, meaning he needs urgent care or he might die.

Ericka gives Mosa ready-to-use therapeutic food, a tasty peanut-based paste that is designed to help children gain weight quickly. The paste is ideal for treating children in remote areas, not only because it provides all the nutrients children need to recover, but also because it has a good shelf life and isn’t water-based, so there’s little risk of bacterial growth and it doesn’t need refrigeration.

Ericka will send Vola and Mosa home with enough therapeutic food for a full course of treatment. She says that his situation is common in this area, but with continued treatment, he will be in good shape in few weeks.","Thu, 30 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/1489Vahavola.jpg?itok=yJte5pGv,"['malnutrition', 'food', 'help', 'mosa', 'village', 'drought', 'severe', 'weight', 'face', 'madagascar', 'treatment', 'southern', 'need', 'health', 'children', 'plant', 'chronic']", ,drought

Madagascar’s “forgotten crisis” continues. The January 2017 nutrition assessment of children under 59 months indicated a deterioration as compared to the last quarter of 2016, as expected given the current period of the lean season. Current estimates for 2017 are that 35,000 children will suffer from severe acute malnutrition (21,750 alone in the South).

A rapid health assessment in four districts of Androy Region indicated that the vulnerability of children under 5, and the overall population in particular is aggravated, the lack of access to quality health care being one of the main unaddressed concerns.

Out of the 850,000 people with the most acute needs, 740,000 people (87 per cent) remain without potable water. However, since January 2017, UNICEF has provided 12 per cent of this population, living in the eight most affected districts, with access to sustainable safe potable water and an additional 13 per cent will gain access during the first quarter of 2017.

All sectors remain widely underfunded, except Nutrition. Therefore, UNICEF is unable to meet the needs of 391,000 children in need of humanitarian assistance

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Tropical Cyclone season has commenced with two tropical storms (Carlos and Dineo) which formed in the Indian Ocean and Mozambique Channel, however due to the trajectory, neither storm made landfall therefore damages were minimal. An Intense Tropical Cyclone, Enawo, struck northeastern Madagascar on the morning of 7 March, travelling at two to three hundred kilometers per hour. On 8 March, Enawo weakened from an “intense” to a “moderate” tropical storm, with an average speed of 80km/hour with peaks of 112km/hour. As Enawo moves further inland, the Government’s disaster management agency (BNGRC), the United Nations and NGOs are evacuating affected populations, passing on life-saving information to affected communities and responding to growing humanitarian needs.

Water remains the key factor in the crisis taking place in the southern region of Madagascar, especially in Taloagnaro where the first rains have not yet fallen. Since mid-December, rain has fallen intermittently throughout Grand Sud, raising hopes that sufficient crops can be harvested by the end of March. However, harvests are still at stake if the pluviometric pattern is not sustained. With the weather patterns changing, the use of surface stagnated water has further increased, while the demand for water trucking has reduced, therefore increasing the threat of higher incidence of malaria and transmissible water borne diseases like acute diarrhoea. Although the rain is welcome, humanitarian assistance delivery has been delayed due to flooding and cut off roads. Local isolated cases of floods in Tulear – Fiherenana have been reported and assessed by a joint Mission, with flood response provided by the National Office of Disaster Risk Management (BNGRC) and local authorities.

The nutrition situation in the southern regions of the country remains a concern. In January 2017, a widespread nutritional screening took place, using mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and oedema assessment, and covered 7 of the 8 affected districts. A total of 231,241 children aged 6 to 59 months were assessed, represents 94 per cent of all children in the target area. The results indicate that the proportion of children with MUAC below 115 mm or oedema (severe acute malnutrition or SAM) by district ranged from 0.7 per cent to 1.8 per cent. The proportion of children with MUAC between 115 mm and 125 mm (moderate acute malnutrition or MAM) ranged from 2.7 to 11.8 per cent and Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM), identified through MUAC less than 125 mm or oedema, ranged from 3.4 to 13 per cent. Overall these results indicate that the nutrition situation has deteriorated in January as compared to the last quarter of 2016 (October screening) when SAM rates ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 per cent, and GAM rates between 2.5 and 7.4 per cent.

A rapid health assessment addressing morbidity and mortality was carried out by UNICEF and its partner Médecins du Monde in four districts of Androy Region, whose final conclusions were that the vulnerability of the general population and mainly children less than five years of age is far aggravated. Access to quality health care remains one of the top challenges, and only an integrated response combining emergency interventions, capacity building and health system strengthening actions could alleviate the current situation.

The school year started on 3 October, but negative coping mechanisms have been employed in some areas such as parents taking their children out of school to look for water, earn money or find food. At the end of 2016 there was a reduction in the number of students attending schools in the nine districts of the south (the most affected by the drought plus Betroka, in Anosy). Between October 2016 and November 2016, there was an average 2.5 per cent increase, however, in December, there was an average 12 per cent decrease, with Androy reaching figures of a 24 per cent decrease. In January 2017, there was a 3 per cent increase in December 2016. Absenteeism remains high in 2017, with the average for the nine districts averaging 15 per cent and particularly high for Anosy at 21 per cent. The region of Atsimo Atsinanana has particularly high rates of absenteeism at 29 per cent, a consequence of the extreme weather conditions affecting this region whereby families have been unable to plant crops due to the lack of rain. Teacher absenteeism is also high despite improvements on 2016. The average is 30 per cent for Androy (44 per cent for female teachers) and 24 per cent for Anosy (29 per cent for female teachers).

For protection issues, the vulnerability of population and especially adolescents living in urban areas was regularly underlined. Key informants and protection actors both from rural and urban communities stressed that families who are the most affected by drought were often the ones who were obliged to leave their community and migrate to towns. Once there, they often have no other alternatives than to rely on negative coping mechanisms such as begging or sexual and economic exploitation of their children.","Tue, 28 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/737004-UNICEF%20Madagascar%20Humanitarian%20SitRep%20-%20February%202017.png?itok=glqLS5Km,"['situation', 'acute', 'water', 'unicef', 'affected', 'ninodrought', 'districts', '2017', 'report', 'madagascar', '28', 'humanitarian', 'cent', '2016', 'el', 'children']", ,flood_and_drought

Final results of UNICEF-led nutrition SMART surveys in the Grand Sud show Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence classified as “high” (>10%) in three districts according to WHO standards. The most recent Integrated Phase Classification for Acute Malnutrition exercise (IPC AM, July 2017) classified these same districts in “serious” acute malnutrition phase 3.

UNICEF has provided water access to an additional 70,000 people since April 2017, bringing the total number of drought-affected people accessing water since January 2017 to nearly 200,000. UNICEF continues to conduct hydrogeological surveys for future water infrastructure construction, water system repair and other temporary water provision interventions to provide access to the additional 520,000 estimated water-insecure people living in very difficult hydrological environments.

While the food security situation might temporarily stabilize, significant humanitarian threats remain such as pockets of malnutrition, large proportions of the population living greater than 10km from health facilities and overall insufficient access to safe and sustainable water remain.

The response to meet the needs of 189,000 children in need of humanitarian assistance remains less than 50 per cent funded, jeopardizing UNICEF’s ability to boost recovery in a fragile context, where children remain extremely vulnerable.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

Based on the IPC assessment results from June 2017, UNICEF estimates that 189,000 children are in need of humanitarian assistance, a reduction from 391,000 as reported in the previous situation report. Despite this improvement, significant work is still needed to provide humanitarian assistance to the remaining children. Furthermore, while slightly more cases of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) were detected in the most recent screenings compared to the last reporting period (3,520 in May compared to 3,455 in February), 2,435 fewer cases of MAM were detected over the same period (17,269 in May compared to 19,704 in February).

Final results of eight SMART nutrition surveys supported by UNICEF and conducted by the National Nutrition Office and ACF-Canada, show a range of prevalence of SAM between 0.4 per cent in Betioky and 2.7 per cent in Beloha. None of the eight districts covered by the survey had GAM prevalence above “very high” (>15%) according to WHO classification.

Thanks to increased rainfall and water infrastructure construction during the reporting period, the percentage of the population that have access to less than 10 litres/person/day declined by nearly 4 per cent, from 68.9 per cent to 65.1 per cent, mainly in Ambovombe.1

While hydrogeological studies to identify sustainable water sources are ongoing, more than 73 per cent of the population in the eight affected districts in the Grand Sud continue to use an unimproved water point increasing their risk of water-borne diseases. An increase in the percentage of the population using stagnant water in some districts has been observed, mainly in Amboasary (from 44.8 per cent to 67.8 per cent), Beloha (from 2 per cent to 28 per cent), Bekily (from 45.2 per cent to 61.7 per cent) and Ampanihy (from 5 per cent to 34.5 per cent). Almost 20 per cent of the population still pay high prices for water ($US 0.3 for 20 litres) due to limited water availability in some areas, mainly in Taolagnaro and Tsihombe.

In April and May, the rate of student absenteeism declined to an average of 11 per cent for the eight districts, which is in line with other regions. The rate in Anosy, however, remains considerably higher at 19 per cent. As a negative coping strategy, children of families who are struggling to recover their livelihoods are often pulled out of school so that they can work in agricultural fields or otherwise support their families. The average rate of teacher absenteeism for the three regions has declined since the start of the year, remaining stable since March 2017 at 37 per cent. In Androy, the situation has worsened since the start of the year, increasing from 43 per cent to stabilize at 57 per cent during March, April and May, which is exceptionally high if one considers that the average absenteeism rate is around 30 per cent in a sample of non-drought-affected regions.","Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/918729-UNICEF%20Madagascar%20Mid-Year%20SitRep%2C%20June%202017.png?itok=O8jzuXlB,"['situation', 'malnutrition', 'water', 'ninodrought', 'districts', '2017', 'report', 'madagascar', 'population', 'humanitarian', 'cent', 'rate', 'high', 'el', 'children']", ,drought

· March marks the peak of the lean season across many countries impacted by last year’s El Niño-induced drought (source: FEWS NET).

· The rainfall season has been continuing to bring rain to the Grand Sud. While welcome, these rains are still hampering the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the access to local markets.

· Some communities have opted for migration as a survival strategy because of the ""Kere"", this has affected until 35% of the population in the village of Beloha South (cumulated figure).

· Preliminary results of SMART nutrition surveys in four districts in the South show GAM rates: below 10 per cent in Tsihombe and Toalagnaro districts and between 10 and 15 per cent in Beloha and Amboasary districts, just below the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. No excess child mortality was observed.

· Except Betioky and Tsihombe districts, severe food insecurity rates decreased significantly compared with both the situation in March 2016 and August 2016. The national IPC exercise to be conducted in June 2017 will inform on the effective humanitarian situation.

Situation Overview

As opposed to the below-normal rains received by the rest of the country, the Grand Sud has benefited from close to normal rains from November 2016 onwards, with good rains recorded until April 2017. March and April is the peak of the hunger-gap season in the Grand Sud, and all the districts are classified at stressed phase (IPC 2) in April/May by FEWS NET. At the national level, two main surveys were conducted in order to assess the food security and nutrition situation as planned in the emergency response plan.

Preliminary results of four SMART nutrition surveys supported by UNICEF in four districts and conducted by the National Nutrition Office with UNICEF and ACF-Canada, show a prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) ranging from 13.9 per cent in Beloha to 8.1 per cent in Taolagnaro and rates of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) between 2.7 per cent in Beloha to 0.7 per cent in Taolagnaro. While none of the four districts covered by the survey has rates of GAM above the emergency threshold (15 per cent), two districts (Tsihombe and Amboassary) have rates of GAM above the alert threshold of 10 per cent. These results also show high rates of chronic malnutrition, which ranges from 31 per cent in Beloha to 47.7 per cent in Amboasary. Overall mortality rates are within non-emergency range except for crude mortality in Tsihombe. Signs of improvement of the nutrition situation are starting to show with decreasing trends in mass screening results and number of SAM admissions in the treatment facilities.

Preliminary results of the food security survey conducted in March 2017 in 8 affected districts show an evident improvement of the food insecurity situation compared with the situation in 2016 at the almost same period (February 2016) and in October 2016. Except the situation in Betioky district where the high rate of the Severe Food Insecurity is chronic during the hunger-gap season, and Tsihombe where this rate has persisted at 50%, all the Severe Food Insecurity rates are relatively low (between 3% and 40%). However, Moderate Food Insecurity rates are remaining high, this situation requires a continued support via the early recovery activities. A food security IPC is planned in June 2017, the findings of this exercise will inform on the real humanitarian situation.

Regular monitoring of the situation by UNICEF, in collaboration with the decentralised services of the Ministry of Education, shows that since January 2017, the rate of absenteeism of pupils in Anosy and Androy has continued to increase, most particularly in Anosy (from 19 per cent in February to 21 per cent in March) and Androy (from 6 per cent in February to 27 per cent in March). In Atsimo Andrefana, there was a small decrease in absenteeism, from 14 per cent to 12 per cent, for the same period. Children are often pulled out of school so that they can work in the fields or otherwise support their families as a negative coping strategy of families who are struggling to recover their livelihoods. Teacher absenteeism in the three regions declined from February to March due to the arrival of teachers’ salaries/stipends, but still remains high: 71 per cent in Anosy, and 43 per cent in Androy.

On the other hand, the long-term effect of the erratic climatic conditions, some communities have opted for migration as a survival strategy. The community in Andragnarivo (which is not targeted by humanitarian response) said that 10 to 20 people leave every week. In the fokontany of Beloha South, 35% of people have emigrated and in the fokontany of Avaradrova, 8 homes have left because of the ""Kere"". Migrants have unstable, low-skilled and low-paid jobs, and are exposed to different forms of exploitation and their children are not in school. The main challenges are remaining the same: i) limited access due to rainfall damaged roads, which has affected all sectors and all interventions; ii) weak transport capacity, making operations more costly; and iii) the sustainability of the local presence of the coordination office, as its running costs are still not covered.","Sun, 30 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/773809-madagascar_grand-sud_drought_sitrep_n6_final_english.png?itok=j9-emdcG,"['beloha', 'resident', 'districts', 'madagascar', 'nutrition', 'cent', 'office', 'drought', 'sud', '2017', 'tsihombe', 'coordinator', '2016', 'grand', 'situation', 'results', 'report', 'food', 'rates']", ,drought

Operational Updates

Food security in the south and south-east: Findings from the Government-led Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC, June 2019) indicate that 900,000 people from 13 districts in the south and south-east are in crisis (IPC 3) and emergency (IPC4) phase and need urgent humanitarian assistance. A new IPC exercise was carried out during the week of 21 October. Results are expected soon.

WFP emergency response: WFP plans to assist 229,000 people through general distributions of food or cash. This includes 27,000 children aged 6 to 23 months old and 13,500 pregnant and lactating women (PLW) who will receive supplementary feeding for acute malnutrition prevention.

Assistance is planned from November 2019 to February 2020, in collaboration with the National Office for Risks and Disasters Management (BNGRC), the National Office of Nutrition (ONN), the Ministry of Population and local NGOs.

Due to funding limitations, WFP’s lean season response will only reach 37 percent of the planned number of recipients. Resource mobilization is ongoing to increase the response coverage.

WFP interventions in the south and south-east in September reached 38,847 people through nutritional support for acute malnutrition prevention, for moderate acute malnutrition treatment and to malnourished tuberculosis patients.

School-feeding programme - WFP, in collaboration with the Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training, implements a school meals programme targeting 300,000 primary school children in the drought affected southern Madagascar.

The annual school feeding programme review session took place from 21 to 25 October 2019 in Tuléar, in the south. The session consisted of discussions on topical issues and the development of a programme performance improvement strategy, in line with Government priorities and WFP’s Country Strategic Plan.

On 24 October 2019, WFP launched the Share the Meal campaign, which aims to raise USD 300,000 for the support of 10,000 children through the school feeding programme in southern Madagascar. The Share the Meal campaign launch took place ahead of the official start of the school year, on 28 Contact info: Volana Rarivoson volana.rarivoson@wfp.org October 2019.

Food fortification: WFP is working on a community-based fortification project funded by Monaco and Andorra, in collaboration with DEFIS - an IFAD programme - and the Government. WFP is also working on rice fortification, based on the recommendations.

Stunting prevention: WFP, in collaboration with ONN and a consortium of French NGOs, will implement an integrated stunting prevention project in two communes of the Antananarivo region which have high level of stunting. In the Ampanihy and Amboasary districts, in the south, WFP provides supplementary feeding to children under the age of two and PLW. This is part of the stunting prevention approach, “MIARO”, which also includes community school gardens and social behaviour change communication activities.

Support to market access for smallholder farmers

Purchase for Progress (P4P): WFP’s objective in Madagascar is to purchase 4,000 tons of food commodities locally either from farmers organizations (FO) or local suppliers. In October, a workshop between P4P stakeholders took place in Fort Dauphin, southern Madagascar, to discuss past experiences and programme improvement. The workshop also enabled linkage between FOs and WFP’s local suppliers to increase market opportunities for them.

Food bank: The BNGRC, the Lions Club International and WFP are setting up a food bank benefiting to 2,000 households in the commune of Tanandava (Amboasary district). The food bank will be used to stock harvests for consumption during lean seasons, thus ensuring food availability and avoiding price fluctuation.

Despite an overall improvement in the food security situation compared to last year, several fragile pockets remain, especially in the south. An estimated 730,500 people are severely food insecure (IPC phase 3 and 4) from June to July 2019. About 916,200 people (26 per cent of the rural population) are projected to be food insecure in the southern regions from August to December 2019, compared to 1.3 million in the previous year. The multi-sectoral humanitarian response and the good rainfall during the growing season have contributed to this decrease.

About 188,550 children under age 5 are likely to suffer acute malnutrition due to inadequate food intake, low food diversity, poor access to safe drinking water and high prevalence of diseases. Madagascar also continues to record widespread Fall Armyworm infestations and drought across the south-west of the island.","Wed, 31 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1352778-SADC_Madagascar_snapshot_July2019.png?itok=ikTU_V5E,"['results', 'vulnerability', 'food', 'water', 'suffer', 'south', 'madagascar', 'southwest', 'committee', 'compared', 'southern', '2019', 'assessment', 'widespread', 'insecure']", ,drought

The estimated output is below the 5-year average due to a severe drought in the central and northern regions of the country where nearly 80 percent of Madagascar’s rice is grown (Figures 1 and 2). Area is estimated at 2.2 million hectares (mha), down 0.2 mha from last year due to the drought. Seasonal rainfall during the first half of the rice growing season (November 2016 through February 2017) was the lowest in the past 36 years. The drought in the central and northern parts of the country reduced planting and significantly reduced yields. In addition, cropland was flooded in the north and northeast when Cyclone Enawo, the largest cyclone (Category 4) to strike Madagascar since 2004, hit landfall in early March 2017.

Madagascar’s Ministry of Agriculture will perform a Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) survey in July with assistance from the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Program. The CFSAM results should be released in September 2017, along with a final rice production estimate. The final national output could be less than the current 3.5 mmt estimated if impacts from the drought and floods were worse than expected. Significant yield reductions have already been reported in many of the regions within the large drought area shown in Figure 2.

In early May, personnel from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service and USAID’s Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) traveled to southern Madagascar where the agro-climate is very dry and food assistance has been distributed for the past two consecutive drought years in the southern Anosy, Androy and Atsimo Andrefana regions (Figures 3-5). Farmers in the arid south also received agricultural-input support for the 2016/17 growing season, but production prospects for this year’s crops were well below average in Tsihombe and Ambovombe districts due to delayed rains during the planting season, lack of seeds, and insect infestations. Small locust outbreaks were also observed throughout Tsihombe and Ambovombe districts (Figure 6).

Madagascar is known for its lemurs, the enchanting monkey-like creatures unique to the island nation. But one region in southern Madagascar has no lemurs left. In fact, there is very little wildlife to speak of. It’s a place where people can no longer find food.

“All we’ve eaten for 4 years is red cactus fruit,” says Chief Voasaotsy, who lives in Anjampaly, a remote village in one of the worst-hit areas. He says it has not rained one drop there in all that time.

More than half of people don’t have enough to eat in the villages scattered across the sandy hinterland of Androy, Anosy and Atsimo-Andrefana, three southern regions in Madagascar. Five years of poor harvests mark what is now the country’s worst drought in 35 years, magnified by the effects of El Nino weather upheavals.

In a country where more than 90 percent of the population lives on less than US$2 per day, drought is particularly dangerous. It has affected 1.4 million people, with about 850,000 needing immediate humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations. Without help, the UN warns the situation could deteriorate into famine. This would mean high rates of sickness and death among vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and young children, who rarely get enough to eat even when it does rain.

Chief Voasaotsy says that everyone in his village was suffering, so when people started to die, they weren’t prepared. Amid so much hunger, it was hard to differentiate between who was hungry and who was on the brink of death.

“We began to hear that people were dying in Anjampaly back in January,” says Sister Josiane Manjakaray of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, which has worked across southern Madagascar for decades. “So we decided to go see what was happening, to see if it was true with our own eyes.”

They brought drinking water and pots of beans and rice. In the village they discovered people were wasting away. When they measured children’s forearms to check for malnutrition, they found many were already in advanced stages.

The sisters brought 11 extremely malnourished children to their clinic in Tsihombe, the next closest town, where they cared for them. Over the following months, the sisters cared for more than 100 children and their mothers, all of whom were suffering from acute malnutrition.

“The bush taxis took pity on the hungry and brought them into town for free,” Sister Josiane says of the large public buses that navigate the South’s almost non-existent roads.

To meet the demand for help, the sisters sought support from one of Caritas’ US member organisations, Catholic Relief Services (CRS). By March, they were working together in villages across the region.

Food is also being distributed by the sisters in a network of open-air cafeterias known as “village canteens.” Knowing that people have little access to water for cooking and had sold off their pots and spoons to buy food, the sisters supply everything necessary for cooking and help prepare meals.

But the sisters still have to ration the food as there isn’t enough for everyone. Sister Josiane says the village canteens have to be managed so they can be sure no one is left without some assistance. But other villages are asking the sisters for aid and they can’t support all of them.

“No one else listens to the poor,” she says. “But we hear them, and they need our help.”

In addition to food, CRS and Caritas are distributing seeds across southern Madagascar so farmers are ready for the planting season, which should begin now, although the rains are late. They are also organising seed fairs, where farmers receive vouchers to choose from a variety of drought-resistant seeds. They would otherwise have no seeds to plant, since successive failed harvests left no seeds for future use.

CRS and Caritas are repairing wells and encouraging the planting of different vegetables to supplement staples like corn. The work includes introducing drought-hardy livestock and using dairy products in their diets or to sell for some income.","Thu, 22 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['help', 'sisters', 'village', 'crisis', 'hunger', 'seeds', 'josiane', 'madagascar', 'southern', 'villages', 'sister', 'left']", ,drought

Madagascar

Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world – nearly 78 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line of US$1.90 per day – and is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. Due to its low vaccination rates and poor sanitation and hygiene, Madagascar is regularly hit by epidemics. Following a plague epidemic in 2017, the country faced an unprecedented measles outbreak in 2018–2019, with more than 204,000 registered cases and over 900 measles-related deaths. While the measles epidemic is now mostly under control, there is a high possibility that a new epidemic could begin at any time, especially during the rainy season. In the south of the country, prolonged drought has hindered access to water and worsened food insecurity and acute malnutrition. Nearly 12 per cent of the population lacks adequate access to water; 42 per cent of children under 5 years are suffering from malnutrition; and more than 916,000 people are affected by acute food insecurity. Madagascar is also extremely vulnerable to seasonal cyclones. An average of 1.5 cyclones affect Madagascar every year – the highest rate in Africa – with each event affecting an average of 700,000 people.

Humanitarian strategy

In 2020, UNICEF will increase disaster risk reduction capacities in Madagascar to enable a more efficient emergency response. This will involve supporting the Government to build national and regional disaster contingency plans; raising public awareness through communication campaigns and other activities such as life-skills education; and integrating disaster preparedness into regular activities. When disasters strike, UNICEF will provide life-saving assistance through timely and effective interventions, in collaboration with the Government, other United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and as co-lead for the nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and education clusters. UNICEF supported mobile teams will provide health, nutrition and WASH interventions in remote areas affected by disasters. UNICEF will also support access to basic education through temporary learning spaces, teaching and learning materials and school rehabilitation. Protection services for vulnerable children will include psychosocial support and child-friendly spaces. UNICEF will strengthen national capacities to prevent and mitigate risks for vulnerable people exposed to gender-based violence in emergencies, and ensure continued access to comprehensive quality support for all survivors of gender-based violence in emergencies. To strengthen the linkages between humanitarian action and development programmes, UNICEF will also promote longer-term responses in emergencies, rather than short-term measures.

Results from 2019

As of 31 August 2019, UNICEF had US$5.3 million available against the US$8.2 million appeal (66 per cent funded). In response to the measles epidemic, UNICEF worked with the Government and other partners to implement a nationwide vaccination campaign that surpassed the target of immunizing 7.2 million children aged 6 months to 9 years. The vaccination campaign was accompanied by communication for development activities, such as advocacy, social mobilization and communication for behavioural change. In the drought-stricken south, the nutrition response included supporting the quarterly nutrition surveillance system; supporting outpatient and inpatient services for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in health facilities and through mobile teams; training parents on the early detection of acute malnutrition; and promoting optimum feeding and hygiene practices for infants and young children. UNICEF also supported water trucking and the construction and rehabilitation of boreholes to provide water to 76,000 people in the south. Pedagogical supplies were donated to vulnerable children, including those living in regions experiencing drought, epidemics and landslides.","Thu, 05 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1417933-2020-HAC-Madagascar.png?itok=anmJ8bEw,"['malnutrition', 'access', 'water', 'madagascar', '2020', 'epidemic', 'humanitarian', 'nutrition', 'action', 'vulnerable', 'unicef', 'children', 'reached']", ,drought
18,18,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar: Humanitarian Snapshot (as of July 2018) - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-humanitarian-snapshot-july-2018,"Overview

About 1.26 million people are expected to be severely food insecure in the Grand Sud and Grand Sud-Est regions of Madagascar between July and September 2018, according to the results of the Integrated Phase Classification food insecurity analysis conducted in June 2018.

This includes about 400,400 people likely to face Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4), and nearly 860,900 people expected to be in Crisis (IPC phase 3). This represents an increase from the IPC results from March to June, when about 1.06 million people were estimated to be severely food insecure.

The food insecurity situation is particularly critical in the Grand Sud, where some 950,000 people are projected to be severely food insecure. Grand Sud is an arid zone and was severely affected by El Nino in 2016. Beloha is projected to be the only district in phase 4 but Ampanihy will also see a serious deterioration. While northern and southeast Madagascar have received above-average and average rainfall respectively this year, southwest and far south Madagascar have received below average rainfall. Furthermore, Fall Army Worm (FAW) has damaged 15 to 65 per cent of Madagascar’s maize crops, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), with the southwest hardest hit due to the combination of the pest infestation and below-average rainfall.

In Beloha district, many households have not recovered from the 2015 to 2017 droughts and are selling livestock in higher numbers and at lower prices than usual. Those who are extremely poor are adopting negative coping strategies, including eating more red cactus fruit and non-mature cassava, as well as eating their seeds.

More than double the number of people in Behola district reported eating their seeds this year (32 per cent) compared to in 2017 (14 per cent), according to the In-Depth Multisectorial Assessment conducted in March and April. There are also reports that households are traveling long distances in search of work, and that very poor households who rely on charcoal or firewood for a living are traveling longer distances to collect them. This heightens protection concerns due to the distances travelled and insecurity in some of the areas being visited to obtain them.

The second quarter of 2018, however, saw a lower number of acutely malnourished children (around 19,000) compared to the first quarter (around 23,600). The number of severely acutely malnourished children also decreased from 2,305 in the first quarter to 1,580 in the second. In seven out of eight drought-prone districts assessed by the newly piloted Nutrition Surveillance System, proxy global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates were less than 10 per cent, while in Ampanihy they were above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent (17.4 per cent). Proxy severe acute malnutrition (SAM) rates ranged from 0.3 per cent to 1 per cent. About half of children identified as malnourished are in Ampanihy and Ambovombe.","Wed, 08 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1145004-Madagascar_Humanitarian_snapshot_July2018.png?itok=JEciOZVH,"['food', '2018', 'phase', 'sud', 'madagascar', 'snapshot', 'humanitarian', 'number', 'quarter', 'severely', 'malnourished', 'cent', 'grand', 'insecurity']", ,drought
19,19,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Drought in Africa leaves 45 million in need across 14 countries - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2019/06/10/drought-africa-2019-45-million-in-need,"NAIROBI

Failed rains across eastern Africa, southern Africa, and the Horn of Africa are seeing another dire season for farmers, increasing food prices and driving up the aid needs of tens of millions of already vulnerable people across the three regions.

All told, more than 45 million people will struggle to find enough food across 14 countries in 2019, many feeling the compounded effects of years of drought.

It’s the second time in three years that an El Niño event has disrupted weather patterns. In 2017 – a year in which the UN labelled the crisis the worst in decades – some 38 million people were in need.

Drought again in 2018 was followed by significantly below-average rains at the beginning of this year – down by 50 percent in parts of southern Africa.

In the Horn and eastern Africa, delayed rains finally arrived in May, allowing some regrowth of pasture for grazing. But it has not been enough to offset the damage to people’s livelihoods and overall food security.

“We need to move to a system where we act much earlier on the warning signs of drought and hunger so that we can cut response times and costs, and reduce deaths and human suffering,” the UN’s Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, said in reference to the drought in the Horn.

The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has released $45 million to encourage major donors to do more to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

With an El Niño forecast more than six months ago, World Food Programme climatologist Jesse Mason argues there should have been time for governments and aid agencies to put in place risk-reduction measures: drought-resistant seeds, irrigation systems, and cash transfers to cushion the impact on farmers.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt.”

It can no longer be business as usual, Mason told The New Humanitarian. Southern and eastern Africa are on the front lines of climate change, and mitigation measures must now be much more data-driven, comprehensive, and innovative.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt,” said Mason, project manager at WFP’s forecast-based financing initiative. “The pieces need to come together, from the global forecasting to the way we interact with farmers on the ground based on that information.”

The following is a snapshot of needs across southern, eastern, and the Horn of Africa.

The term “food crisis” The term “food crisis” means households that are just about able to meet their basic food needs, but only by selling some essential assets like livestock. There may also be cases of malnutrition. A “food emergency” refers to very high levels of malnutrition and some deaths. All assets are liquidated, making recovery so much harder.

Angola

In need: 2.3 million

The government declared an emergency in the three southern provinces of Cunene, Huila, and Namibe in January. Angola has been pursuing a humanitarian self-reliance policy but the response has been inadequate and the situation is deteriorating.

Ethiopia

In need: 8.3 million

The most vulnerable communities have suffered consecutive years of drought. This season’s Gu long rains (March to May) were poor or delayed. Although a late burst of rainfall has helped replenish pasture in the south and southeast, it came too late for some crop-producing areas and the food security situation is expected to deteriorate. Numbers in need are exacerbated by mass internal displacement as a result of inter-communal violence – affecting some 2.6 million. Concerns are also rising over potential food aid pipeline breaks that could interrupt life-saving operations. It’s $1.3 billion aid appeal is only 15 percent funded.

Kenya

In need: 2.5 million

The long rains were similarly poor – less than half the expected amount fell by April. By July the number of severely food insecure is projected to more than double from the current 1.1 million to 2.5 million. Below-average terms of trade and reduced household incomes during the July to September dry season could push parts of eastern Kenya into crisis by August.

Lesotho

In need: 640,000

Four districts are at crisis or emergency levels – Mohale’s Hoek, Maseru, Quthing, and Qacha’s Nek. A total of 640,000 people are projected to be food insecure over the next 12 months. Lesotho has a population of 2.2 million.

Madagascar

In need: 1.3 million

By March, 1.3 million people were severely food insecure. Although the vulnerable southern region received fair rainfall this season, the harvest is forecast to be well below average. The south is yet to recover from the effects of the 2015/16 El Niño and the 2017/18 drought, and the number of children who are acutely malnourished is expected to rise in 2019.

Malawi

In need: 3.3 million

Some 2.8 million people are projected to be in crisis and 450,000 at emergency levels of food needs during the October to March lean season in the country’s southern and central districts.

Mozambique

In need: 1.85 million

More than 1.7 million people were identified as in crisis between September and December 2018 across 11 provinces. As a result of Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth in April, an estimated 1.85 million are now in need of aid.

Namibia

In need: 550,000

At the beginning of May the government declared a drought-induced state of emergency – the third time in six years. All regions of the country are affected, with 24 percent of the 2.3 million population facing food shortfalls.

Somalia

In need: 5.4 million

After two consecutive poor rainy seasons Somalia is facing yet another drought. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) have failed, on top of a poor 2018 Deyr season (October to December), contributing to widespread crop failure and lower livestock productivity. Pastoral communities in the worst-affected areas – in the north and centre of the country – are facing acute food insecurity. Drought-related displacement is underway and malnutrition rates are rising. Food aid levels have “significantly declined” compared with last year. A $700 million drought response plan has been launched.

South Sudan

In need: 7.1 million

Conflict and drought has created a disastrous situation. Some 6.9 million people – close to 60 percent of the population – are currently facing severe food insecurity with an estimated 50,000 in “famine-like” conditions. In many areas, malnutrition levels remain critical, with some 860,000 children under the age of five estimated to be severely malnourished. Out of the overall 7.1 million people in need, only 5.7 million are targeted for aid. The aid appeal stands at $1.5 billion, but so far only $346 million has been received.

Sudan

In need: 5.6 million

Around one million people are facing emergency conditions – concentrated in the states of Khartoum and South Darfur. The Darfur region accounts for 45 percent of all Sudanese in need (crisis and emergency levels). Sudan’s crisis is less weather-related and more a consequence of food price rises. Overall, prices of grains were at record or near-record levels in March despite an above-average 2018 harvest. The depreciation of the local currency, fuel shortages and input costs combined to push up the cost of living - one of the triggers for the protests that led to the toppling of former president Omar al-Bashir in April.

Uganda

In need: Unknown

The arid Karamoja region – bordering Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia – has been hit by a second failed rainy season. Numbers in need are not yet known, but staple food prices are expected to remain high through to September, well above the five-year average.

Zambia

In need: 1.3 million

Maize producing areas in the south experienced their worst drought since 1981. Maize production is estimated to have dropped to two million tonnes from approximately 2.4 million tonnes last season and exports have been banned – which will impact prices in the region. The projected number of households needing food aid from July to February 2020 is 220,000 – a 38 percent increase from last season.

Zimbabwe

In need: 5.3 million

Total cereal production this season was estimated at 852,000 tonnes, against a national requirement of 1.8 million tonnes for human consumption and 450,000 tonnes for livestock. Compared to the 2017/18 season, the provinces of Manicaland, Matabeleland South, and Matabeleland North all saw their maize production drop by more than 70 percent. Climate shocks have compounded severe economic difficulties. By September, most of the country is expected to be in “crisis”.

20,20,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Madagascar: Humanitarian Situation Report, June 2019 - Madagascar - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-humanitarian-situation-report-june-2019,"Highlights

Madagascar has faced an unprecedented measles epidemic affecting all 22 regions (since September 2018), due to low measles vaccination coverage (58 per cent nationwide before the epidemic broke out). As of 2 June, there were 146,750 registered cases, of which 20,894 cases were reported complicated. Since the nationwide vaccination campaign, the number of new cases is decreasing, and no death has been reported since April 2019.

In response, UNICEF supported the vaccination of more than 3.8 million children under 5 years old against measles. UNICEF also pre-positioned emergency stocks (medicines and basic equipment) in five targeted regions.

The Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) released in July indicates that 970,000 people are in a food security crisis or emergency. The number of municipalities classified in Alert or Emergency increased from 40 municipalities (27 per cent) in the last quarter of 2018 to 97 (63 per cent) in the first quarter of 2019 – confirming a deterioration in the nutrition situation.

From January to May, with UNICEF support 12,168 severely malnourished children were treated in the south. A total of 35,000 mothers were trained on screening techniques and equipped with Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tapes to conduct active and frequent “home-based” screenings and a referral of their children if found to be acutely malnourished.

UNICEF also helped more than 71,100 people gain access to safe water through water trucking and rehabilitation of boreholes.

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

Measles

The measles outbreak began on 3 September 2018 and resulted in 146,750 cases as of 2 June 2019. It is a nationwide epidemic, with cases reported across all 22 regions in Madagascar and even exported to Comoros and La Reunion. Since the Government of Madagascar and its partners including UNICEF implemented a nationwide vaccination campaign and provided free medical care, the number of new cases decreased significantly, and no deaths has been recorded since April. International support has been critical in the fight against the measles epidemic as the country does not have the capacity to react to health emergencies of this scale with its weak health system and limited financial and human resources. Continued international attention is indispensable not only to finish the measles epidemic, but also to improve the overall health system so that the recurring health epidemic can be prevented in advance.

Drought (nutritional crisis) in the South

The first 2019 round of the screening exercise - part of the Nutrition Surveillance System (NSS) - in the eight droughtaffected districts was completed in March 2019 and the results confirmed a severe deterioration of the nutrition situation. Between the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, the number of municipalities classified in Emergency increased from 22 (15 percent) to 73 (47 percent) and the ones classified in Alert6 increased from 18 (12 percent) to 24 (18 percent). Districts worst affected by acute malnutrition are Ampanihy, Bekily, Betioky and Ambovombe, where around 190,000 children under five years old live (Map 1). As such, there was a sharp increase in the number of admissions in the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme from January to April 2019, well above the previous three years’ admission trends (Figure 1). The deployment of eight Mobile Nutrition Teams (MNTs) in municipalities worst affected have partly contributed to this sharp increase (30 per cent of the total CMAM admissions from January to April 2019).","Sun, 30 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1330193-UNICEF%20Madagascar%20Humanitarian%20Situation%202019%20Mid-Year%20Report.png?itok=D_BTQRAd,"['situation', 'vaccination', 'measles', 'nationwide', 'report', 'madagascar', 'epidemic', 'humanitarian', 'number', 'nutrition', 'quarter', '2019', 'cases', 'unicef']", ,drought
21,21,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar fights the subtler side of hunger: chronic malnutrition - The Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2017/0726/Madagascar-fights-the-subtler-side-of-hunger-chronic-malnutrition,"Battered by drought and civil wars, more than 20 million people from Yemen to Tanzania are at risk of starvation in what aid workers call the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. But over the past two decades, nations that once produced searing images of famine's toll have moved to thwart it by strengthening community resilience. Our reporters traveled to Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Somaliland to investigate the daunting challenges as well as the long-term efforts that are saving lives.

You can tell right away that there is something different about Rova. For a start, the 5-year-old is more than a head shorter than her playmate Jiana, though the girls were born only a month apart.

And where Jiana is solid – you can feel her presence as she and Rova chase each other around a health center in this highland farming town – there is a fragile, ethereal sense to the impish Rova.

Rova, like nearly half of under-fives in Madagascar, was chronically malnourished as a baby. Her mother, Rasoatahina Lovasoa, gave her only rice and the water it had cooked in. “It makes me feel sad to see how much shorter she is,” says her mother. “I’m trying to give her a better diet now.”

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Rova (l.), a chronically malnourished almost-5-year-old girl, stands next to her friend Jiana Rakuturammambason, who is 'normal' sized for age 5, at a local health clinic in Antsirabe, Madagascar. 47% of children in Madagascar are chronically malnourished - the percentages are higher here in the highlands despite a good variety of food being available.

Droughts and famines tend to afflict countries in cyclical fashion. But where chronic malnutrition is endemic, such as Madagascar, they strike harder – sharply increasing the risks for already-vulnerable children, according to research led by professors at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University.

Rova is a lively girl, but studies show that undersized children are not only weaker, but they tend to do less well in school – a slow start that can complicate adulthood. The UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, estimates the cost of this barrier to development at $740 million a year, 7 percent of Madagascar’s GDP.

The situation is “sad, overwhelming and unacceptable,” says Prime Minister Olivier Mahafaly.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Intervention comes at a fairly low price: $400 million – not much more than one of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films – would pay for a 10-year program to iodize salt, fortify wheat flour and oil with micronutrients, and teach pregnant women and young mothers what to feed their babies, says UNICEF’s nutrition investment plan. If the plan were put into action, chronic malnutrition would end up affecting just 15 percent of Madagascar’s toddlers instead of nearly half of them, the agency says.

But the challenge – and potential solution – lies not just in funding, but in changing attitudes. Health education is a strong start. But in this heavily agricultural country, where 92 percent of the population lives on less than $2 per day, parents may well feel that any extra bit of food not needed for survival is most useful if it can be sold for money. Persuading them that there is greater long-term value in providing their children with a healthy diet is key.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mothers with malnourished babies attend a nutrition class in Antsirabe, Madagascar. 160 mothers are taking courses. The women learn how to care for their babies - including nutrition, hygiene, and health.

Nirina Razafiarisoa, a young woman with a nine-month-old son at her breast, says she has been getting nutrition advice from women at her local health center for the past 18 months. “I’ve learned lots of things” about how to feed her son and 2-year-old daughter, she says.

But she makes a living by selling soup from a tureen that she drags around her neighborhood on a cart – and that living is thin. “I do what they tell me to do when I’ve got the money, and don’t when I haven’t,” she explains. “I cook the sort of meals they recommend about twice a week, I suppose.”

Empowering parents

For other families, however, ignorance about nutrition is the first hurdle. “When they eat rice and a leafy vegetable or a potato, people think they have eaten properly,” says Leonide Rasoahenikaja, a nutritionist working with UNICEF. “And they have no idea how good soybeans are for kids,” Dr. Rasoahenikaja adds. “Farmers feed it to their cattle and their pigs, and they see milk production go up and their pigs getting fat, but it does not occur to them to give it to their children.”

That’s why a dozen or so mothers – and one young father – were lined up on benches along the walls of a simple clapboard, cement-floored room on the outskirts of Antsirabe one recent morning, their babies in their arms. They were listening to a woman give a nutrition class.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Midwife Rindra Ramarijaona (l.) measures Larissa's height with help from her mom, Aveline Rafanoherantsoa, at a community health clinic, funded by the EU and UNICEF, in Ambohimanarizo, Madagascar. Larissa is receiving treatment for malnutrition.

The women chanted the advice in unison, reading it from an illustrated poster on the wall, before lining up to have their babies weighed and measured. Most of them were doing well, but it is the babies whose mothers do not attend this kind of class that worry Rasoahenikaja. The chronic malnutrition rate among under-fives in Madagascar has hovered around the 50 percent mark for more than a decade, she says, and nothing yet has budged it.

Step by step

If the UNICEF plan gets off the ground, that might make a difference. But in the meantime, it is more a matter of small-scale projects at the village level teaching mothers what to do and helping them to do it, one day at a time.

In Ambohitrimanjato, for example, a sleepy village of mud-brick houses overlooking rice paddies, women are learning to use solar dryers – simple glass boxes fitted with slatted trays – to desiccate fruits and vegetables so that they can be stored and eaten long after they have been harvested.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff People examine a food drier that was donated by a local nonprofit and funded by the World Bank in Ambohitrimanjato, Madagascar. Dried fruits and vegetables will keep until out of season.

“We’ve dried taro, squash, carrots, and bananas,” says local villager and nutrition outreach worker Razafi, a wizened lady who goes by one name. “It’ll be good for the children’s diet, too. We can dry potatoes and grind them up to make flour, and then we can make potato fritters.”

That’s the kind of talk that warms Rasoahenikaja’s heart. “The area around Antsirabe is the breadbasket of Madagascar,” she says. “Everything grows here but farmers often prefer to sell their vegetables than give them to their children.”

“If we are going to get rid of chronic malnutrition, kids’ food needs to be a priority,” she insists. “It isn’t for a lot of families, and that is not going to change in just a year or two.”","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/07/class.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['malnutrition', 'fights', 'subtler', 'babies', 'stetson', 'hunger', 'women', 'mothers', 'madagascar', 'nutrition', 'malnourished', 'unicef', 'health', 'chronic']", ,none

As part of the World Food Programme (WFP) relief plan, they will also receive food or cash to ensure they are sustainable until the next harvest in March and April.

Since June, WFP has been distributing food to people in areas with the greatest need, as well as providing cash in areas with functioning markets.

“The planting season offers a small window of opportunity for local farmers to restore agricultural production,” said FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva in a joint news release. “Thousands of families are already facing hunger. Missing the planting season now will result in a serious food and livelihood crisis and render their situation even more desperate.”

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) findings, some 850,000 people, or half of the population in southern Madagascar, are facing hunger and in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The findings are an indication that food and nutrition security could worsen in the coming months unless humanitarian efforts are rapidly scaled up. In southern Madagascar, some 1.4 million people are considered food insecure.

FAO is sourcing sweet potato and cassava cuttings, as well as a variety of drought-tolerant seeds and tools for smallholder farmers. Families with livestock will receive additional support.

WFP’s Executive Director Ertharin Cousin said following a recent visit that farmers are in a “dire situation.”

“But, through a joint response, [FAO and WFP] can begin to turn this situation around, not only by providing immediate relief but by giving communities the means they need to feed themselves,” she noted.

Ongoing droughts in Madagascar have led to significant declines in the production of maize, cassava, and rice production in the southern parts of the island. Moreover, rising prices are reducing peoples’ purchasing power and eroding food security of those who are most vulnerable. Many households have already adopted survival strategies, including eating less frequently, selling animals, agricultural tools, and even land.

WFP and FAO have secured funds to launch the initial stages of their joint planting assistance programme, but cannot reach all drought-hit farms without additional financing. FAO has received $4.5 million of the $22 million needed. WFP’s drought relief operation, to continue until March of next year, is $50 million short of the $82 million required.

FAO’s immediate plan is to target 850,000 people, including 170,000 small-scale farming households in areas most-affected. Their assistance includes support for the planting season and livestock production. WFP will continue with food and cash relief operations to reach some one million vulnerable people by the end of November.

The agency is also expanding its nutrition programme to prevent and treat malnutrition among more than 200,000 pregnant women, as well as nursing mothers and children under the age of five. Some 230,000 school children are being provided with daily hot meals.","Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2016/11/26121/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['food', 'agencies', 'wfp', 'support', 'crisis', 'relief', 'deepening', 'million', 'production', 'planting', 'madagascar', 'fao', 'southern', 'assistance', 'immediate', 'amid']", ,drought
23,23,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Crisis in Madagascar as price of vanilla nears that of gold - FRANCE 24,https://www.france24.com/en/20180420-magagascar-vanilla-price-trade-crime-crop-weather,"Vanilla is one of the world’s most popular seasonings and an important ingredient in products ranging from perfume to ice-cream; but it is no longer the staple it was around the world. Madagascar, the world's main producer, is facing a crisis.

The great chefs are now turning their backs on vanilla. Famed French chef Gilles Marchal, whose restaurant is in Montmartre, Paris, declared with regret that he now works much less with the black and bean-shaped pod.

The reason being that the price is now equivalent to that of gold per kilo, and is eight times the price it was just a few years ago. The price per kilo has jumped from $50 (€42) in 2012-2013 to $400 (€340) in 2016-17, according to a 2017 Cyclope report (the bible of commodities traded internationally).

Several factors explain this price spike including uncontrolled market speculation and a vanilla crop failure in Madagascar, which produces 80% of the global supply. The island was also hit by Cyclone Enawo in March 2017, which destroyed many of the vanilla orchids which produce the seed pods, and this was followed by a major drought.

""Vanilla today costs $600 per kilo (€485 euros), it's huge,"" says Georges Geeraerts, president of the group of vanilla exporters from Madagascar (GEVM).

'Vanilla crime wave'

In the northeast of the island, where the majority of vanilla plantation are located, this price rise stands in stark contrast with living standards, with workers earning just one euro a day.

Violent thefts of the highly valued crops have hit such a level that locals are calling for armed police guards. But many Madagascans are taking matters into their own hands.

""We are constantly on the alert,"" says Dominique Rakotoson, producer and manager of an export company in Madagascar, who was robbed in 2017. ""Many of us sleep in the middle of the plantations to monitor our crops. Last week, a man tried to steal plants in our area… he was stoned to death.”

Dozens of thieves have been apprehended in recent weeks; and such is the anger some have ended up being brutally murdered.

""People trust only the people's justice,"" explains Geeraerts of GEVM.

Adding to this crime wave is the connection between money laundering via rosewood trafficking. Rosewood has become the world’s most trafficked wildlife commodity, almost all of its illegal, and sales from Madagascar alone are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""It's a fact: vanilla is being used to launder money illegally obtained from sales of rosewood,"" says vanilla producer Rakotoson.

""A criminal gang is behind all of this and [some of its members are] close to our government,"" he said, blaming the country’s political instability.

'Substitute or synthesised vanilla'

To try and avoid the manifold risks facing the crop, producers are forced to harvest and sell before the pods hit full maturity. This has impacted the quality of the pods.

""I have no choice but to pick at eight months,"" Rakotson says. ""We all do the same."" However, vanilla takes nine months to mature and if it is picked too early you end up with a pod without the distinctive perfume. The famous perfume and flavour from the pods only manifests in the final month.

Experts do not hide their concern about this sector which now faces high demand, poor quality and low production.

""Unlike the crisis of 2003, which passed after a few months, this seems well established. Today, the sector is really in danger,"" says Geeraerts.

Aromas

The impact is widespread in the food industry: some pastry chefs – industrial or artisanal – have replaced natural vanilla with a synthetic version, which sell for a more reasonable €10 to €15 per kilo.

""If agri-food professionals adopt these substitutes, it will be difficult to get them to return to the natural flavors,"" explains Geeraerts.

The vanilla sector is mobilising, they have re-introduced an official harvest date and improved the traceability of the product. This should all aid the sector in restoring the image of the queen of the seasonings.

""These steps should help to clean up the industry and reduce crime,"" said the president of the GEVM.

• Madagascar is facing an unprecedented measles epidemic due to low measles vaccination coverage (58 per cent nationwide). As of 3 of April there were 122,840 registered cases, and 1,233 reported deaths. The measles epidemic affects 107 out of 114 districts across all 22 regions of Madagascar.

• For the first quarter of 2019, UNICEF vaccinated over 1.9 million children under 5 years against measles. UNICEF also prepositioned emergency stocks consisting of medicines and basic equipment in five targeted regions.

• The nutritional status of the population of southern Madagascar remains precarious. The October 2018 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) results revealed that 970,000 people would be in a food security crisis or emergency between November 2018 and March 2019. From January to March 2019, a total of 6,767 severely malnourished children were treated in the UNICEF programme. While, 17,365 mothers were trained in nutrition screening techniques.

• More than 59,166 people gained access to safe water through ongoing water trucking supported by UNICEF and the rehabilitation of 129 boreholes and construction of six new boreholes.

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs

Measles

The measles outbreak, which began on 3 September 2018, has resulted in 122,840 cases as of April 3, 2019. It is a nationwide epidemic, with cases reported across all 22 regions in Madagascar. The epidemic has a national attack rate which is currently 3,3042 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants; demonstrating a high rate of spread. Of concern, measles cases have been exported to Comoros and La Reunion. This epidemic is occurring in a context of poor immunization performance. Two-thirds of cases are either unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. There have been 1,233 deaths reported among the people with measles. Of these, 640 deaths have been notified in health facilities, and 593 at the community level, of which 191 are measles related and 402 non-classified by the community agents.

In Madagascar, there are basic measures to combat measles as well as good testing expertise, particularly through the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM). However, due to an overall weak health system, the country does not have the capacity to react to health emergencies of this scale without additional international support.

Nutrition

According to the October 2018 IPC exercise, led by the National Risk and Disaster Management Office (BNGRC), the humanitarian situation deteriorated in the last quarter of 2018 in the eight southern drought districts. For the period November 2018 to March 2019, there are 973,202 people projected to be living in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency), which represents 45 per cent of the population, including more than 175,000 children under five years old. The main cause has been a pluviometry (rainfall) deficit during the second half of 2018 resulting in the failure of the major harvests (rice, maize and cassava). A 60 per cent decrease in production has been registered to the average of the previous five years. In addition, crop losses due to armyworm infestation severely affected the area.

Information from the Nutrition Surveillance System (NSS) - fourth quarter of 2018 - revealed that out of the 146 municipalities in the eight drought-affected districts, 18 (12 per cent) have been classified in alert3 and 22 (15 per cent) in emergency4 . The district affected worst by acute malnutrition is Ampanihy West with 10 municipalities classified in emergency (59 per cent) and two in alert (12 per cent) – Map 1.

The deterioration in the nutrition situation from late 2018 in the eight drought-affected districts is reflected in the sharp increase in the number of new admissions in the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme as the lean season progresses. As shown in Figure 1, the level of admissions at the end of 2018 was well above the ones recorded during the 2016/2017 El Nino drought emergency. While there was a decrease in December 2018, it increased again from January to March 2019 (above the 2016/2017 levels). Results from the NSS - first quarter of 2019 will be reported in the next Situation Report.","Thu, 09 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1291768-UNICEF%20Madagascar%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20-%20Q1%202019.png?itok=SQ3FDLM6,"['situation', 'unicef', 'measles', '2018', 'report', 'madagascar', 'epidemic', 'reported', 'humanitarian', 'quarter', '2019', 'cases', 'cent', 'emergency']", ,drought
25,25,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar forest destruction wiping out humans' tiniest relative - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-madagascar-environment-idUSKCN1VR1AX,"KIRINDY FOREST, Madagascar (Reuters) - As a shocked world watches fires ravage the Amazon, slash-and-burn farmers are wreaking proportionally worse destruction half a world away in Madagascar, driving humanity’s smallest relative - the Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur - to extinction.

Frustrated conservationists hope Friday’s arrival of the environmentally-conscious Pope Francis will spotlight the island that lost 2% of primary rainforest last year, the highest of any tropical nation according to the World Resources Institute.

“He should say that this forest is God’s creation. He gave it to us and for our own benefit,” said Anselme Toto Volahy, researcher from Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.

“If we don’t manage it well, we will destroy ourselves.”

The Kirindy forest, on the west of the island, spans 100,000 hectares (245,000 acres) but has lost almost half its size in two decades. Wastelands of blackened stumps are broken only by scorched trunks and twisted boughs of baobab trees resistant to fires.

Kirindy is home to a multitude of rare species, including the tiny Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur, the world’s smallest primate, which only exists there. Bug-eyed and weighing just 35 grams (1.25 ounces), the lemur’s habitat may be completely destroyed in three years, said Volahy, though the animal might go sooner.

Matthias Markolf, a lemur specialist at the German Primate Centre in Kirindy, has not spotted it for two years.

“We do not find Berthe in places that we used to find it before,” he said. “It might go extinct in the next couple of years if deforestation continues.”

‘THE SOIL IS DYING’

With more than 80% of its species native, Madagascar has more unique plants and animals than the rest of Africa together.

But as well as farmers’ fires, the island is facing increasingly powerful storms and extended droughts at the sharp edge of global climate change.

When a 2016 harvest failed in the south, thousands of farmers migrated to the west - to Kirindy - accelerating the forest’s destruction.

Unscrupulous businessmen linked to local politicians pay around 50,000 ariary ($13.40) for every hectare of forest cleared, say village elders. It is backbreaking labor, but there is no shortage of workers in a nation where 90 percent of people survive on less than $2 per day.

“We had to eat cactus and mango, from the morning to the evening,” said 24-year-old Sonlinde Nathaly, recalling the drought that drove her and others from the south in a migration wave that coincided with a massive spike in deforestation.

Satellite data shows Kirindy lost 4% of its area in the last two years, said Volahy, pacing through a clearing scattered with singed maize husks and giant snail shells bleached white by the blaze.

After trees are felled, the area is torched to clear land for maize. Middlemen take the crops to big cities, where the kernels become untraceable, potentially entering the supply chain for big companies.

“Since 2013 we have worked with people from the government. The deal was, we cut (the forest) and grow maize,” said Nahità, vice president of the local administration in Lambokely, a dusty village that used to hug thick forest.

Now the wooden houses cluster forlornly in a barren landscape. The shallow soils are worn out after three harvests of maize and peanuts, driving farmers further into the forest.

“The soil is dying,” said Phrosalia Soriana, a 36-year-old farmer. “The people in charge of the forest tell us that we are doing wrong.” But, she asks, how else can she feed her family?

UNTOUCHABLES?

In the past nine months, the government has made some efforts to slow the destruction, arresting several farmers and destroying corn in the protected area.

But bigger players remain free.

“To totally eradicate the problem, we have to touch the untouchables,” said Liana Rakotoson from Fanamby, a local conservation group investigating the maize business in Kirindy.

Prosecutors want to go after politicians involved and big companies that buy the maize.

But Andrianirina Francis, deputy prosecutor for Menabe region, said building a case is hard because farmers’ maize crops are mixed before being sold on.

“The product passes through many hands,” he said.

However, big companies, like national brewery the STAR group, have a responsibility to know their suppliers, he insisted. “Tons and tons and tons of corn come from the destruction of the forest,” Francis said, but “STAR never asks where their product comes from.”

Since 2011, French beverage company Castel has owned STAR, which is also Coca-Cola’s Madagascar bottling partner.

Castel and Coca-Cola did not respond to requests for comment. Francis Ambroise, the general manager of STAR in Madagascar, said the company accounted for only around 2% of the maize market. Most went to feed cattle, he said.

“The company has supply contracts preventing sellers from sourcing their maize from the forest or any other protected area,” he told Reuters.

“We work with (environmental group) Fanamby to control our suppliers, respect the contracts’ clauses and to ensure the traceability of our maize supply ... using maize from protected areas would be against what we consider to be our society responsibility.”

But Tiana Andriamanana, executive director of Fanamby, said “the chaotic market makes traceability impossible.”

“Everybody sees the trucks of maize coming back and forth, usually at night, but nobody records where they go.”","Fri, 06 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426890495&r=LYNXNPEF850ZB&w=800,"['destruction', 'volahy', 'star', 'humans', 'forest', 'wiping', 'madagascar', 'maize', 'big', 'relative', 'farmers', 'kirindy', 'world', 'francis', 'tiniest']", ,none

AD2M participants saw improved agricultural productivity, largely through being able to grow crops in more than one season.

Productivity increases translated into greater income potential, with AD2M participants experiencing a 13.6 per cent increase in the value of crop production per capita.

AD2M also improved participants’ perceived food security, with programme recipients reporting less anxiety about having access to food.

Agriculture accounts for 28.2 per cent of Madagascar’s gross domestic product1 and is the country’s most common source of livelihood, employing more than 75 per cent of its rural population. Madagascar has an overall poverty rate of 76.5 per cent, with more than 50 per cent of the population affected by environmental and weather-related shocks. These environmental challenges are particularly acute in the Menabe and Melaky regions, where farmers are primarily dependent on rice production and related activities, and where rates of poverty and malnutrition are especially high.

In an effort to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in these regions, the International Fund for Agricultural Development funded the Appui au Développement du Menabe et du Melaky (AD2M) programme. The programme combined land titling with improved irrigation infrastructure to increase productivity levels and reduce farmers’ susceptibility to weather and climate shocks.

American Institutes for Research and LEAD Analytics used propensity score matching to measure the programme’s impact and explore whether and how large-scale infrastructure projects could benefit smallholder farmers.","Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1295823-brief-TW4.2.02-Irrigation-access-Madagascar-web_0.png?itok=ce4D1vh8,"['smallholder', 'programme', 'access', 'participants', 'improved', 'regions', 'production', 'madagascar', 'irrigation', 'poverty', 'improving', 'farmers', 'cent', 'productivity']", ,none

• The measles epidemic, the main humanitarian disaster in Madagascar for the first semester of 2019, came under control thanks to nationwide vaccination campaigns reaching more than 7,2 million children. The number of new cases has significantly decreased and no death has been officially reported since April.

• UNICEF Madagascar is now concentrating its humanitarian responses to disaster risk reduction and to the vulnerable people in the drought-prone south who are suffering from malnutrition and lack of access to safe water.

From January to August 2019, 17,800 severely acute malnourished (SAM) children were treated with UNICEF support, exceeding the 2019 target of treating 17,000 SAM children.

94,894 people in the south gained access to safe water through water trucking and rehabilitation of boreholes.

• During the third quarter, UNICEF also intervened to address the problem of water scarcity in the capital city of Antananarivo through a 30-day water-trucking operation which delivered water to up to 16,800 people.

Funding Overview and Partnerships

UNICEF Madagascar made an appeal of US$ 8.26 million to meet the humanitarian needs of children and their families, but only 62 per cent has been secured despite the contributions from major donors such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Measles and Rubella Initiative (MRI). In some cases, especially Communication for Development (C4D) and Education, UNICEF Madagascar had to use its Regular Resources and other development funding, in accordance with the New Way of Working recommendations, to support emergency response activities to reach the most vulnerable people. Such a significant funding gap will however hamper UNICEF Madagascar’s ability to respond quickly to emergencies. Therefore, UNICEF calls on donors to provide flexible and timely support for the continued humanitarian responses, especially in the sectors of Education, Child Protection,

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and C4D.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The vulnerable southern regions of Madagascar continue to be faced with the negative impacts of climate change such as drought in recent years, leading to increasing numbers of children affected by acute malnutrition and lack of access to basic social services such as safe water, education and health care. To fight this silent and chronic emergency, UNICEF Madagascar is responding not only with direct humanitarian responses such as treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, but also with more fundamental and systematic approaches such as the launch of the Nutrition Surveillance System (NSS), construction of water pipelines, and capacity-building of the government authorities and community workers to support enhanced resilience of communities and systems .

The most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Acute Malnutrition Classification has projected a slight improvement of the nutrition situation during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 1 The increase of admissions of SAM cases in Q3 can be partially explained by the increase in the number of Nutrition Mobile Teams (MNTs) supported by UNICEF from eight to 10 since July.","Tue, 29 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1390764-UNICEF%20Madagascar%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20-%20for%20January%20-%20September%202019.png?itok=o7WemEYV,"['situation', 'reporting', 'malnutrition', 'water', 'acute', 'support', 'period', 'sam', 'report', 'madagascar', '30', 'humanitarian', '01', '2019', 'vulnerable', 'unicef', 'children']", ,drought

Severe drought conditions during southern Madagascar’s rainy season from November 2017 to April 2018 has led to nearly dry dams in many parts of the south. This dryness has affected livestock’s access to water and pastureland, which has led to poor livestock body conditions as many are subsisting on burnt cactus leaves in the absence of viable pastureland. This has similarly affected crop development, with many areas experiencing failed or near failed harvests. Only Ambovombe commune received favorably heavy rains in July that allowed some farmers to plant new maize and potato crops.

In the south, cereal prices are increasing by 6 percent compared to June for local rice and maize, which is mainly from Ambovombe. Prices of substitute foods like imported rice, dried cassava and sweet potatoes remained stable. Dried cassava prices are 7 percent lower than the 5-year average because of greater supply from Betroka. Pulses are mainly from Tulear and prices are also higher than normal.

Households are currently highly dependent on markets because most of them were not able to harvest. For those who harvested, stocks of maize, cassava and sweet potatoes are only expected to last for one month and will be depleted this month. To afford food, poor households are selling wild foods like tamarind to nearby cities like Tulear, or farmed sugar cane which is mostly consumed locally. They are also selling small ruminants and poultry, or charcoal and firewood at below normal prices because of the increased supply at markets. Others near the Onilahy river in the district of Betioky are selling handcraft products and water by the jerrycan. Some villages near Beloha also are benefiting from cash for work.

Poor and very poor households in MG23 (the Mahafaly plains) in the southwest of Madagascar are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity because of poor or failed agricultural production and the resulting early dependence on markets for food. In Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24), food security is deteriorating following the harvest period as stocks deplete and poor and very poor households are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Ambovombe where the situation is better. Food insecurity is less severe in the Southeast (MG 19) and Rice and lima bean (MG 20) which remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).

ADRiFi is intended to strengthen Madagascar’s country's resilience and increase its capacity to manage climate-related disasters. Over the next five years it will also strengthen the country's capacity to evaluate disaster risk and provide early warning systems and contingency plans.

It would also support its participation in the African Risk Capacity sovereign risk transfer mechanism. The Bank has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ARC to join forces to prepare, develop and implement projects and programmes in climate change and risk resilience in member countries. As a key partner, ARC will assist member countries with policies on drought risk pools and other sovereign disaster risk measures.

Madagascar’s geographical location makes it very vulnerable to climate shocks, which in particular cause severe droughts in the south of the country. Over the past 20 years, it has been hit by more than 63 natural disasters, which have badly affected the country's economy.

""Natural disasters exercise considerable pressure on the public finances and on the growth of the country's real GDP. In 2017, the cost of damage caused by natural disasters was estimated at around 4% of GDP, that is, some $420 million,” Général Mamy Nirina Razakanaivo, Executive Secretary of Madagascar’s Emergency Prevention and Management Unit said.

More than 13 million people, or close to one third of the country’s population, have been affected by these disasters, usually among the most vulnerable groups. The Bank is working to fight fragility and build resilience, thus contributing to strengthening the country’s institutional capacity in order to promote better economic, social and political management.

""Through this programme, we will strengthen the capacity of the agencies responsible for the management of disaster risks. This will benefit small farmers and vulnerable populations in the Grand South part of the island. Particular attention will be paid to women and children,"" said Mohamed Chérif, African Development Bank country manager for Madagascar.

The Bank's portfolio in Madagascar, with a net total commitment of some €333.4 million, covers 16 active operations across three broad sectors: transport (52.6%), agriculture (37.5%) and governance (8%).

Food security has improved across Madagascar compared with last year, but pockets of fragility remain, especially in Ampanihy district in the south. An estimated 727,900 people will be severely food insecure (IPC phase 3 and 4) from November 2019 to March 2020, including about 508,800 in the Grand Sud (compared to 1,279,700 from November 2018 to March 2019, including 945,900 in the Grand Sud ). From July to October, the situation improved due to multisectoral humanitarian response packages implemented through the Flash Appeal (funded at 63 per cent), and good rainfall during the agricultural season from January to June 2019. However, Madagascar is now in the hunger gap season and parts of the country—particularly in the Grand Sud—have received below-average rainfall in November and December 2019, which may cause the situation to deteriorate.

The number of measles cases and deaths reported has continued to decline. Since the onset of the measles outbreak on 3 September 2018, 244,631 cases have been recorded in the country. However, the number of cases reported has dropped in recent months, with 280 cases reported between September and October 2019 , and only 38 cases since November 2019. Meanwhile, the number of plague cases reported in 2019 has remained below the 5-year average. Since 5 August 2019, 88 plague cases have been reported in 14 districts with a majority of bubonic form (77 cases). Health actors continue to strengthen the response in districts where plague and measles are still active.

31,31,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Funding crunch deprives 120000 children of school meals in drought-ridden Southern Madagascar - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/funding-crunch-deprives-120000-children-school-meals-drought-ridden-southern,"Antananarivo – Lack of funding for the UN World Food Programme’s school feeding operation in drought-ravaged southern Madagascar is threatening deeper hunger in the poorest parts of a country where one in two children are chronically malnourished.

Forty percent of the 300,000 primary school children in Anosy, Androy and Atsimo Andrefana regions who should receive a daily hot meal from WFP have had to go without since the start of the academic year last November, aggravating already low enrolment and high dropout rates.

For many recipients, the daily WFP meal, which consists of cereal, pulses and vegetable oil fortified with micronutrient powders, is their only one, and often a powerful incentive for parents to send their children to school instead of to work.

WFP is seeking US$4 million to resume the provision of meals to those children presently missing out and ensure full implementation of its programme through July when the school year ends.

Although Madagascar has the world’s fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition – 47 percent – a mere seven percent of its children receive meals at school.

“It’s beyond tragic that our already limited coverage has been further curtailed, depriving some of the country’s most vulnerable children of essential help – even the prospect of a decent future”, said Moumini Ouedraogo, WFP’s Representative in Madagascar. “It costs only US$50 to feed a child for a year. I appeal to the international community to promptly help us fully restore the programme.”

Recent research conducted by WFP and others shows that school feeding is not just an important social safety net, but also a high-return investment in human capital and local economies that disproportionately benefits the poor and malnourished.

Southern Madagascar’s long running hunger crisis derives from its susceptibility to natural disasters, including drought and floods, which are set to become more frequent and severe as its temperatures continue to rise twice as fast as the global average. A key WFP priority is to render vulnerable communities, including smallholder farmers, more resilient to climate shocks.

With a score of 38.3 on the 2017 Global Hunger Index, Madagascar is among the eight countries suffering from alarming rates of hunger. In support to the Government of Madagascar, WFP’s interventions aim at providing food and nutritional support to disaster affected communities and strengthening their resilience to future shocks.

The southern regions have been suffering from the impacts of the El Nino induced drought that affected Southern Africa in 2015/2016. Due to a prolonged dry spell since the beginning of 2018, communities have lost the majority of their crops expected during the May/June harvest season.

WFP’s Response Plan to the drought in the south In coordination with the Government of Madagascar and the humanitarian community, WFP’s response plan will focus on providing food and nutritional assistance to the populations that are classified in IPC crisis and in emergency phases from September - December 2018 (relief phase) and January to March 2018 (early recovery phase). Out of 1.3 million people classified in IPC crisis (3) and emergency (4) phases, WFP aims to provide food assistance and nutritional support to 849,000 people using a combination of food and cash-based modalities. It is expected that other actors in the food security sector (government and NGOs) will provide assistance to 35% of the population in IPC 3 and 4 phases. During both response phases, WFP will work closely with FAO and other food security and livelihoods cluster members to ensure that the assistance provided is complementary.

Without new confirmed contributions, WFP will not be able to meet the needs of food insecure communities in IPC 3 and 4 phases, risking a deterioration in food security for the already vulnerable communities, many of which are still recovering from the impacts of the 2015/2016 El Nino induced drought.

Emergency Food Assistance and Nutritional Support

To provide life-saving, early recovery food assistance, and nutritional support to 849,000 food insecure people, WFP appeals to donors for immediate support towards Strategic Outcome 1 (relief assistance and early recovery) which require USD 43.6 million from September 2018– June 2019.

Nutrition Prevention Activities

For implementing nutrition prevention activities in the south, WFP requires USD 4.8 million from September 2018-June 2019. As part of the prevention of acute malnutrition programme, WFP will distribute specialized nutritious foods to 83,600 children 6-23 months and 41,800 pregnant and lactating women on a monthly basis, accompanied by nutritional education and malnutrition screenings. For the prevention of chronic malnutrition component implemented in 2 districts of the south jointly with WHO, UNFPA and FAO, WFP aims to reach 85,600 children below 2 years of age and PLW/G until June 2019.

School Meals Interventions

In southern Madagascar, school meals are often the only regular meal that school children receive. A disruption of the programme would lead to an increase of school dropouts and to a deterioration of children’s nutritional status. The cost of the WFPsupported school meals programme is estimated at USD 30 per child per school year. The funding shortfall for the 2018-2019 school year stands at USD 6 million to provide support to 197,047 schoolchildren.

Resilience strengthening

WFP is targeting 4 communes in the southern, southeastern and south-western regions to strengthen communities’ resilience to future shocks.

33,33,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Malagasy women take on drought - Mail & Guardian,https://mg.co.za/article/2017-12-01-00-malagasy-women-take-on-drought/,"In rural southern Madagascar, the battle against a devastating drought is fought by women. They walk long hours to a dry river bed, where they must dig for water. They have been doing this for years, part of the increasing toll climate change is exacting on vulnerable communities in this arid area.

Tovoe has never known her surname but she knows the route to the Mandrare River well. Since she was 10 years old, she has walked the three-hour distance with a large empty plastic container in her arms, her mouth dry.

In the region of Amboasary Sud, near the southern tip of the island, many villages rely on this river for their water. But it has begun to dry up. In the dirty sand, there are patches of brown water. It is all that remains of a once-flowing river, which began to dwindle when rainfall started decreasing. In 2013, a drought was officially declared. By 2016, the El Niño phenomenon, which causes warm water to build up in the eastern Pacific Ocean and changes rainfall patterns, was in full swing. What little water was left all but dried up.

“The land is so dry we don’t have anything to do. Before, we farmed cassava and sweet potato, but now there is nothing, so I sell my wood,” Tovoe says.

The vegetables are staples in Madagascar. Tovoe and her family have a small farm in their village, Belitsary, but it no longer yields much food.

So, on the days when she doesn’t collect water, she walks to a forest, where, wielding an axe, she cuts down trees from morning until evening. She sells the wood at a market for 1 000 Malagasy ariary (MGA) (about R4.30) per bundle.

Her husband died several years ago and she is on her own. But the income is enough to buy food and send her children to school.

“My dream when I was a child was I wanted to study. But my parents didn’t have money. They didn’t support me going to school,” she says, as she stands at the river.

Collecting water is a task reserved for women. Men often stay at home, waiting. In times when they could plant crops, they would work on their farms, which have yet to recover from El Niño.

Tovoe’s family is typical of many in the region. She was the eldest sibling in her family and from an early age she had to work. She started harvesting wood when she was 10 years old.

[On the days when she doesn’t collect water, Tovoe cuts down trees to sell the wood at a market, a task she has performed since she was 10 years old (Ra’eesa Pather)]

She was married off young so her family had one less mouth to feed.

Child marriage is illegal in Madagascar but aid agencies such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) have noticed that young girls are married off as a way of coping with poverty.

According to government statistics in 2012, 50% of all Malagasy women aged 20 to 24 were married before they turned 18. Many become pregnant when they are only 14.

Because people accept child marriage, it is difficult to prohibit it.

“It seems simply absurd to people to make that change. The cultural concept of what is an adult is different to the West. In many countries, children take on adult roles much younger,” says Nicolette Moodie, Unicef’s chief of child protection in Madagascar.

From these young marriages, large families are born. Tovoe has 10 children in her house — six boys and four girls. The youngest is one year and four months old and the eldest is 20 and recently began junior school.

“My life is so different from my mother because now I take care of my children and send them to school,” she says.

Tovoe collects 20 litres of water at a time, which has to last her family for the next day, when she will be chopping wood. The water is boiled for cooking and drinking. Laundry and washing has to be sacrificed for long periods.

In Madagascar, 91% of the population earns less than $2 a day. The drought has exacerbated the prevalent poverty, and now 47% of children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition. According to Unicef, this will stunt them physically and mentally. After the age of five, the damage is irreparable.

“For me, that’s a crisis,” Moodie says.

The Malagasy government’s ministry of population says initiatives to minimise the effect of drought over the years were “scattered” and ineffective. It is now trying to make changes in the face of an emergency, including helping aid organisations and international donors, such as the UK’s department for international development, to target communities that need to be prioritised.

Health workers are bringing primary care to areas that are generally difficult to reach.

Ranavoarivony Ihaingo travelled 1 000km from Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo to set up a clinic in the Ampasindava village, which is also near the Mandrare River.

Ihaingo was born and raised in Antananarivo. She lived in a double-storey home with three bedrooms and running water, but she left it because she knew how badly doctors are needed in other parts of the country, and particularly in villages.

By being there, patients “avoid long kilometres to reach a health facility, and that is the best thing I have brought to the people”, she says, sitting in her outdoor clinic.

In a day, Ihaingo will diagnose and treat 40 young children aged from six months to four years. On a hot Wednesday afternoon in November, she has already seen two children suffering from malnutrition.

In some communities, the Malagasy government, with the help of foreign donors, has set up a cash payment system. Last year, families could receive 60 000 MGA (R254.66). After a cyclone earlier this year brought some relief, that amount is now 30 000 MGA (R127.33).

According to Unicef, women spend money more responsibly than men do to help their families, which is why the women are issued with cards on which the amounts they are paid are recorded.

It is one of the initiatives funded by the World Bank, which pumped $35-million into the project.

But it hasn’t managed to reach every community. In Ampasindava, Ihaingo has heard of the system but her village is not yet part of the project. She believes it will help families to buy food, although the most pressing need is more difficult to solve.

“The government has to bring water here,” she says.

There are just two tanks of clean water, supplied by Unicef, in the community. One is for Ihaingo’s patients, and the other is for pregnant women and young children.

When she arrived in Ampasindava, Ihaingo had never known what it was like to be without water. The village also introduced her to a world of women she never knew existed.

“I have admiration for the women here. They are very courageous. Of course, they didn’t go to school like me but they are strong. They walk seven hours just to get water for their children,” she says.

The Malagasy government has validated a policy to end child marriages and Unicef has also begun work on a pipeline that will deliver water to an estimated 4 600 people by the end of 2018.

But, in these little-known villages of southern Madagascar, the burden will still be on women and children to ensure survival until water becomes more readily available.

“I am lonely in my work,” says Tovoe. “I need something good from my children. When they are successful, maybe they will reward me.”

Ninety percent of the population lives below the international poverty line and nearly 50 percent of children ages five years and younger are chronically malnourished, representing the fourth highest chronic malnutrition prevalence in the world, according to the UN.

SITUATION

• Nearly 730,000 people will likely experience Crisis (IPC 3) or worse levels of acute food insecurity in parts of southern Madagascar from November to March, a period that coincides with the lean season when food is most scarce, according to a November IPC analysis.* Low household income and purchasing power have reduced access to food, while crop loss due to irregular rainfall and crop pests— including Fall Armyworm—has limited food availability.

• According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), harvests beginning in March will likely improve food security for households in southern Madagascar; Stressed (IPC 2) levels of acute food insecurity will likely persist in Androy, Anosy, and AtsimoAndrefana regions through May 2020. Vulnerable households— including in Atsimo-Andrefana’s Ampanihy District—who have not recovered from the previous poor agricultural season will likely continue to face Crisis levels of acute food insecurity through the same period.

• In Amboasary-Atsimo, Ampanihy, and Toliara II districts, the prevalence of global acute malnutrition is above the World Health Organization’s emergency threshold of 15 percent. Additionally, an August IPC analysis designated the malnutrition situation in Androy’s Bekily District as critical—the fourth highest of a five-tier alert scale classifying the severity and magnitude of acute malnutrition. Major contributing factors to the deterioration of the nutrition situation in the district are disease, low dietary diversity, and suboptimal infant and young child feeding practices.

RESPONSE

• USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Androy to provide emergency food assistance and complementary nutrition training to vulnerable households affected by natural disasters and crop failure. With FFP support, CRS also implements food-for-assets activities, through which households receive food assistance in exchange for a family member helping to construct water points for agricultural, household, and livestock use.

• Through the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), FFP provides emergency food assistance in southern Madagascar, sourced from local and U.S. markets, as well as specialized nutritious foods for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition in children ages five years and younger.

• Additionally, FFP partners with CRS and Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) to implement multi-year development activities, which aim to improve maternal and child health, strengthen resource management, and increase household income to address the underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1431928-FFP%20Fact%20Sheet_Madagascar_12.19.19.png?itok=pNqzEoQe,"['sheet', 'acute', 'food', 'malnutrition', '19', 'likely', 'ipc', 'households', 'madagascar', 'assistance', 'updated', '2019', 'ffp', 'world', 'insecurity', 'fact']", ,none

Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.

“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.

“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”

Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.

Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.

Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.

“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”

Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.

The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks.

KEY MESSAGES

• Livestock herd sizes and prices are increasing in South Madagascar as pastoralists have reduced sales further improvement in food availability both for human and animals. Nevertheless, livestock robberies reemerged in the districts of Ambovombe and Amboasary.

• Huge quantity of tubers are currently sold at very low prices in many markets of the South, except in Amboasary district. This may run out producer stocks very quickly and leads to an early lean season than the normal although a better production compared to last year.

• Rice production has doubled in South-Central peneplain further a favorable rainfall, an increase of planted areas and the absence of major hazards.

Meanwhile, Fall Army Warm impact on maize production has reduced compared to last year. However, locust and other pests damaged rice crops particularly in Center-South.

• Food security has improved in vulnerable zones of Madagascar.

Madagascar is a country highly exposed to many hazards such as cyclones, floods and drought because of its geographical situation and its climatic conditions. Its location in the Southwestern Indian Ocean basin puts the country in a first position of nation most exposed to cyclones in the African continent. Every year, the damage and losses caused by disasters have negative impacts on the country's development. In view of this situation and in order to comply with the new international guidelines on disaster risk reduction, the government of Madagascar has amended the national disaster risk management act wich lays out the government’s new policy to disaster risk management and updated the national disaster risk management strategy, with a view to consistency with the national development plan and its implementation plan. This updated strategy sets new goals and upholds a holistic vision, which are focused on reducing existing risk and strengthening resilience. It is also aligned with the goals of the Sendai Framework and takes into account not only the prevention of new risks related environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks, but also to climate change and the gender – sensitive approach. It is a framework document which presents an opportunity from which we can develop and ensure better and effective implementation and coordination and harmonization of strategic actions for disaster risk reduction and building resilience of the Malagasy population. In addition, in order to building spatial, sectoral, community and infrastructure resilience to the climate change impacts, Madagascar has also developed and implemented the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). Finally, the disaster risk financing mechanism for drought with the African Risk Capacity (ARC) is already operational to cover the population affected by drought in the far south of the country","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1327949-66376_f346finalrandriamanalinamadagascarr.png?itok=IK4DaTqZ,"['management', 'resilience', 'climate', 'protected', 'hazards', 'damage', 'drought', 'national', 'madagascar', 'resilient', 'effects', 'risk', 'disaster', 'view', 'country', 'sustainable', 'updated', 'development']", ,flood_and_drought

Farmers, traders and consumers across East and Southern Africa are feeling the impact of consecutive seasons of drought that have scorched harvests and ruined livelihoods.

The El Niño-driven crisis has increased the malnutrition rates of rural children, and driven up food prices for urban residents. Livestock deaths and fire sales have slashed the asset wealth of pastoralists, and cumulative bad harvests will make recovery all the harder for small-scale farmers.

In the worst cases, where conflict has made farming impossible and reduced humanitarian access, there will be famine. That currently applies only to South Sudan, but could also include Somalia if the emergency response falters.

What makes food price spikes all the harder to bear is that there is rarely a corresponding increase in people’s wages. And when the drought is over, prices often stay stubbornly high, note researchers Paul Adams and Edward Paice.

A number of countries wrestling with the impact of El Niño have still recorded decent macro-economic growth rates, but food price inflation means those benefits are rarely felt by ordinary citizens.

There are a number of strategies governments could adopt to address the situation: from improving the tradability of food, to coordinated climate change adaptation strategies, to meeting the African Union target of allocating 15 percent of budget spending to agriculture.

“No miraculous discoveries are required,” suggest Adams and Paice. “But the start point is recognition of the unsustainability of a relentless rise in the cost of food throughout Africa; and the fact that while droughts and conflict may create price spikes, the root causes of this phenomenon lie with government.”

The following is a list of 17 countries struggling to come to terms with the impact of two consecutive years of drought, which has left more than 38 million people at risk this year.

Angola

At risk: 1.2 million

The southern regions of Cunene, Huila and Namibe have been hard hit. As granaries empty and people sell off livestock, there are concerns over their ability to bounce back this year. Food prices are high and government services are limited.

Burundi

At risk: 3 million

Poor rains last year, a one-month delay in the harvest, above average food prices, and reduced income from agricultural labour is expected to hurt poor households. But food insecurity – affecting a quarter of the population – is also driven by the country’s economic crisis as a result of ongoing political violence.

Djibouti

At risk: 227,463

Djibouti is one of the world’s most arid countries. Some 227,463 people are threatened with food insecurity in the hardest-hit areas of Ali Sabieh, Obock and Dikhil.

Eritrea

At risk: 450,000+

Eritrea strictly controls humanitarian access, so the extent of the crisis is difficult to gauge. The government denies there is a problem. But UNICEF has noted that malnutrition has increased over the past three years in four out of the country’s six regions, where rates already exceeded emergency levels. UNICEF plans to reach 450,000 children this year with nutritional support. That is likely to underestimate the extent of the problem.

Ethiopia

At risk: 5.7million

The strongest El Niño phenomenon on record led to an extreme drought in 2016, with 10.2 million in need of food aid. A new drought means 2017 could be just as dire, throwing an additional 5.7 million people into crisis. Farmers and herders found their resilience tested to the limit last year. They have very limited resources left to cope with the current crisis.

Kenya

At risk: 2.6 million

Widespread crop failure and falling terms of trade for pastoralists have affected farming and agro-pastoral communities in the northwest, northeastern and coastal strip of Kenya. The two main rainy seasons failed in 2016. There are growing reports of conflict as a result of displacement and water shortages. Four million people could be in need of aid by July if the long rains fail.

Lesotho

At risk: 159,959

Ninety percent of people in need received in-kind and cash aid. Without the ongoing assistance, Lesotho would be in a food security crisis. With good rains this season, an average harvest is forecast.

Madagascar

At risk: 978,000

Maize, cassava and rice production dropped by as much as 95 percent in the south of the country last year. Some 845,000 people are in immediate need. Of those, 330,000 are facing emergency conditions. Countrywide, rice prices were up by 25 percent and maize prices had doubled by the end of January.

Malawi

At risk: 6.7 million

Half of Malawi’s rural population – 6.7 million people – are receiving food aid after two consecutive years of drought. In 2016, food prices were up 172 percent above the five-year average. The harvest this month should ease needs, and food prices are already falling as aid reduces pressure on the markets. But cash crop farmers are expected to see a fall in income this season after reducing the area they planted.

Mozambique

At risk: 2 million+

The impact of last month’s cyclone Dineo is expected to add an additional 300,000 to those in need. Drought has exhausted household food stocks, and aid is reaching only 45 percent the vulnerable. Dineo, which hit coastal Inhambane Province, affected nearly 551,000 people and destroyed 27,000 hectares of crops. Food aid and seeds are urgently needed.

Rwanda

At risk: unknown

Rwanda did not escape last year’s drought. Media reports said that between 50,000 and 100,000 families suffered severe crop losses, especially in eastern and southern districts.

Somalia

At risk: 6.2 million

Half of all Somalis are facing acute food insecurity. Of these, nearly three million need urgent life-saving aid. The worsening drought has led to widespread water and pasture shortages for livestock. Displacement, malnutrition and drought-related diseases are all on the rise, and famine could be declared in parts of the country. Access is complicated by the al-Shabab insurgency.

Sudan

At risk: 4.6 million

Sudan experiences unpredictable rainfall and desertification. The 2015 El Niño event was particularly severe and continued to be felt in the east of the country in 2016. Food insecurity is also driven by conflict, particularly in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

Swaziland

At risk: 638,000

The 2016 drought scorched Swaziland, leaving an estimated 638,251 people in need of aid. Basic food prices remain high at the peak of the lean season. The rainfall forecast is for average to above-normal rains, but household productivity is expected to be lower than normal.

Tanzania

At risk: unknown

There have been media reports of failed harvests and livestock deaths. In response, a senior government official in the northern Manyara region released emergency food stocks onto the market. The government is resisting calls for a declaration of emergency.

Uganda

At risk: 390,000+

Food stocks are critically low in northeastern Karamoja. Between July and November last year, 390,000 people were at crisis/emergency levels. Of those, only 200,000 were receiving aid. Conditions are also bad around Arua in the northwest. Two consecutive seasons of poor rains have hit production across much of the country. Staple food prices are rising.

Zimbabwe

At risk: 4.1 million

Consecutive El Nino-related droughts has left half the rural population in need of food aid until the end of the lean season in March. The crisis is compounded by low purchasing power, reduced remittances from South Africa and high food prices. There have been good rains over the past two months but there is a national shortage of fertilizer. There has also been an outbreak of the hard-to-control Armyworm pest throughout the country.

She is also a Girl Guide and actively involved in its nutrition advocacy program.

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar, Oct 24 2018 (IPS) - As much as 80 percent of Madagascar’s population of 24 million people is involved in agriculture and the country’s economy largely depends on the sector, yet 48 percent of households are faced with food insecurity according to the National Nutrition Office (NNO). Over 70 percent of households live below the national poverty line of 535,603 Malagasy ariary per year (1 U.S. dollar equals 3,447.50 ariary).

In rural Madagascar, where subsistence farming is the primary economic activity, as high as 86 percent of households live in poverty. For most of these households, there is a predictable gap of four to five months each year in which staple food production (mainly rice) is not enough to cover the demand.

During this time, the rice yield is low or destroyed by cyclone or flooding. Cassava or sweet potatoes replace the rice, providing mostly carbohydrates in the diet.

Madagascar is the fifth most malnourished country in the World, the NNO says. Slightly more than 47 percent of children under five years are stunted meaning nearly one in two children are malnourished.

According to the DHS Survey in 2010, acute malnutrition affected 27 percent of young women 15–19 years old in 2009, especially in rural areas. Anemia is present in 35 percent of women 15–49 years old.

A lack of direct access to food and production more seriously disadvantages women than men the World Food Program says, and good nutrition is especially critical for adolescence girls.

During this critical growth period, they need more iron, for example, to compensate for blood loss from menstruation. Good nutrition also helps to provide immunity against diseases and provides the energy they need to help them thrive.

However, there are not enough projects or programs supporting women and girls’ nutrition. Most projects support the first 1000 days of life through nutrition intervention at national nutrition sites located mostly in rural areas or in areas vulnerable to malnutrition.

These are common spaces in communities reserved for training mothers on breastfeeding, how to monitor and evaluate the growth of the child from birth to two years, and on nutritious baby food and the importance of colored-diversified food. These programs are an important part of Madagascar’s attempt to fight malnutrition.

This strategy is guided by the National Action Plan on Nutrition III. Launched in 2005, the first phase outlines nutrition activities with 14 goals. Eight of these have been implemented: 1) promotion of breastfeeding and complementary food, 2) integration of the community in nutrition, 3) fight against micronutrient deficiency 4) integration of nutrition intervention in primary healthcare, 5) care for acute malnutrition, 6) improvement of household food security, 7) integration of school nutrition, and 8) improvement of communication on nutrition.

Madagascar has partially implemented the four remaining strategies: 1) preparation and intervention for nutrition emergency, 2) a national system of nutrition and food supervision, 3) development of the national capacity building, and 4) nutrition intervention relating to emergent problem (HIV/AIDS) and non-communicable disease.

The remaining two interventions have not started. These focuses on integrating development initiatives and providing legislative framework around food and nutrition.

Phase two of the plan outlines steps to address malnutrition, the food and nutrition security for vulnerable households, and the coordination and improvement of the nutrition sector growth.

Phase three was launched in 2017 (NNO, 2017) and focuses on deepening the phase two interventions as well as improving access to health services and safe drinking water and sanitation, with special attention on pregnant and lactating women and adolescent girls.

Raising public awareness of the National Plan of Action on Nutrition is key to its overall success. This is being addressed, in part, by community sensitization through television, radio, and print media.

Madagascar is among the pilot countries in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts Nutrition Programme, and as agents of change, Girl Guides in Madagascar are joining the campaign to fight malnutrition through advocacy and communications. We have taken part in the design of the nutrition curriculum, and currently, 80, 000 members in all 22 administrative regions (even in extreme rural areas) are involved in the movement in Madagascar

The youth advocates pool, a group of Girl Guides involved in nutrition advocacy in Madagascar, will help promote sensitization through online portals and in-person meetings in communities. The pool will help deliver public education from the nutrition program curriculum and speak at relevant nutrition events in our country.

Media support on nutrition will be important to change community behavior and influence decision-makers and policymakers. In addition to its members, Girl Guides plans to use media to sensitize another 40,000 people in the community.","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['malnutrition', 'food', 'involved', 'rich', 'households', 'women', 'national', 'madagascar', 'girl', 'suffers', 'nutrition', 'rural', 'agriculture', 'extreme']", ,flood

The Food and Agriculture Organization says poor rains caused by El Nino, has caused a significant decline in production of maize, cassava and rice leaving millions hungry.

The World Food Program has been distributing food aid and cash relief to those affected.

Overall, some 1.4 million people in the south are food insecure, with at least 600,000 severely food insecure.

“We suffer from the famine. Children and old people have no food. We need help to install water pumps, even a small aid will help”, said Zoetsoa, President of the Tsarampioke farmers association.

Various Agencies have joined forces, to get thousands of farmers to grow drought resistant crops and care for their livestock in the worst-affected districts.

The World Food Programme has warned hunger is expected to reach emergency levels by the end of the year in the region.

Patrice Talla Takoukam, an FAO representative, in Madagascar explained,“We have been trying to respond to emergencies but also at the same time to build the resilience capacities of the communities, to be able to take care of themselves. One example like in the seed sectors, FAO has provided the capacity for the communities to be able to produce themselves”.

U.N. agencies are calling for urgent action to address the worsening situation which needs about $67 million in food and farming support.

Many Malagasys struggle to eat enough food in relatively normal times.

Nine in 10 people live on less than 3 dollars a day, and the country has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the world.

the World Food Programme says in southern Madagascar, one in three households has already been forced into desperate measures such as selling their house or land, begging or migrating.

The methodology consisted of a compilation and review of relevant literature and a qualitative field study in the Androy and Anosy regions with the support and collaboration of the Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes (BNGRC).

There is an apparent correlation between the latest episode of severe drought and a significant migratory flow – beyond the well-documented phenomena of traditional mobility from the region since the 1970s. According to the results of the rapid assessment, 88 per cent of respondents believe that the main reason for out-migration was the drought.

The study recommends a targeting of humanitarian aid that integrates migration indicators among the vulnerability criteria. Short-term responses are proposed, including tracking of displacement and migration trends through the deployment of tools such as the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) to ensure reliable and regular data on migratory movements and related multisectoral needs is available to stakeholders. In the medium term, the implementation of stabilization and recovery programs for drought-affected communities and the facilitation of the migrants’ integration in destination areas are to be achieved. Lastly, the long-term goal would be to seek and ensure that communities are well prepared to droughts and that Government and other actors have strengthened capacities to respond to drought-induced migrations.","Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/911699-IOM-Madagascar-Southern-Madagascar-Assessment-Report-EN.png?itok=O2yPW3mY,"['study', 'impacts', 'migratory', 'evidencing', 'grand', 'sud', 'madagascar', 'tracking', 'migration', 'southern', 'sectors', 'humanitarian', 'outmigration', 'linkages', 'qualitative', 'multisectorial', 'droughtinduced']", ,drought
44,44,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar: No more fish? We'll farm seaweed instead - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/madagascar-no-more-fish-well-farm-seaweed-instead/a-39311040,"Landing his wooden canoe on the coral-sand coast of Madagascar, just a few steps from his home, fisherman Samba Lahy recalls his childhood: ""I started fishing with my parents when I was 18,"" he told DW. ""We used to return home with the pirogue packed with fish.""

Today, life in Tampolove - a small village in the south of Madagascar - has changed for Lahy and his family. ""Resources are rare,"" he said. For 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of fish per day, fisherman can earn $1 (.87 euros). ""On lucky days, a catch goes up to 20 kilograms,"" Lahy explained.



Fishermen have seen fish stocks dwindle over the course of their lifetimes

Fish stocks around the world are being put at risk by climate change, overexploitation, pollution and habitat destruction.

In Madagascar, this is particularly worrying, as fishing contributes more than 7 percent of the national gross domestic product - and is the backbone of the economy in rural areas.

Fish are also the main source of protein for coastal populations.

In the face of looming food insecurity, Madagascar's fishers are getting creative in their quest for alternatives.

Farmers and fishers in trouble

If fisheries continue to decline rapidly, it could have a serious effect in Madagascar, leading to further food shortages and economic problems in one of the poorest countries in Africa.

Compounding this are the effects of climate change, which people are experiencing across the country. Long-lasting drought has led to failing harvests, leaving 850,000 people in a state of severe hunger. As a result, starving families from inland communities have been forced to move to the coast - putting increased pressure on coastal resources.

The changing climate has put major pressure on communities across Madagascar

Add to the equation that coastal communities like Tampolove are experiencing changing weather patterns. ""We are well into the rainy season, but have yet to receive rain,"" said Richard Badouraly, president of the aquaculture community in Tampolove. ""Both farmers and fishers are in trouble.""

Gildas Todinanahary, of the Institute of Fisheries and Marine Science, University of Toliara, warns that fisheries in Madagascar are further threatened by declining coral reefs.

""Over the past 50 years, 65 percent of the corals of reef off the coast of Toliara have died,"" he said.

Creating sustainable resources

Living from the sea also means living with the sea

To prevent ecosystems from collapsing, the Velondriake - an association of several villages all falling within the same marine protected area - was created by the government.

The name means ""to live with the sea,"" and the program is managed by locals. ""Fishers understood that they needed to look for alternatives to fishing,"" said community leader Badouraly.

The marine reserve stretches over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) along the coast of Madagascar, and includes a total population of 7,500 people.

The reserve includes coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, baobab forests and thornscrub. Local community members farm sea cucumbers and seaweed, and conduct monitoring.

Thanks to PACP (Projet d'Appui aux Communautés de Pêcheurs), local people manage much of the project, both governing and establishing alternative activities in the reserves.

Thus, villagers have become both managers and guardians of their own coasts. Management decisions are discussed and agreed upon as a community.

Fishers in Madagascar see new commercial opportunities in sea cucumbers

Sea cucumbers, coral and seahorses

In Tampolove, where people's diet consists mainly of fish and rice, fishers have started farming seaweed.

With the support of Blue Ventures, a UK-based marine conservation group, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the University of Toliara, the village has started to grow seaweed for the European market.

In the last few years, the community has also begun testing the cultivation of sea cucumbers (Holoturia scabra), and of elkhorn sea moss (Kappaphycus alvarezii). Sea moss is a type of red algae, from which carrageenan - a gel used in the food and cosmetic industry - is extracted.

Algae farming is proving a success in the village; production has risen from 13 tons in 2013 to 187 tons in 2016. ""And we expect to reach 250 tons this year,"" Badouraly added.

Worried about declining fish stocks, some farmers have turned to harvesting seaweed

Family life is also being affected. Women have been financially liberated since becoming the main algae farmers, often working with men, many of whom remain fishers. As a result, the birth rate in the area has decreased.

Next, the community is looking to cash in on sea cucumbers, which have high commercial value. And the fishers are even investigating whether coral and seahorses can also be farmed.

But Todinanahary points out that the real natural riches are in the community. ""When we say as scientists, as the government: You should change the way you live - they will give us the solution themselves.""

More than 52 million people in 18 countries across southern, eastern and central Africa are facing up to crisis levels of hunger as a result of weather extremes, compounded by poverty and conflict.

Some areas are facing a second extreme drought in four years and worse than that sparked by El Nino in 1981.

In the South, parts of Zimbabwe have had their lowest rainfall since 1981 which has helped push more than 5.5m people into extreme food insecurity. Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been decimated and exports are now banned; 2.3m people there are food insecure. The situation is worsening including in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar, Namibia and Zimbabwe. There are reports of farmer suicides in South Africa.

Drought has also hit the East and Horn of Africa particularly Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. At the same time, record-breaking temperatures in the Indian Ocean have dumped ultra-heavy rainfalls into Kenya and South Sudan, causing flash-flooding especially along major river arteries. South Sudan has declared a state of emergency with more than 900,000 people hit by floods.

In Africa extreme weather events have hit many countries already suffering from ongoing conflict. Across the continent, 7.6 million people were displaced by conflict in the first six months of 2019, and another 2.6 million by extreme weather. In the Horn, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan have simultaneously faced over 750 000 people displaced by conflict and 350 000 displaced by extreme weather.

Scientists have demonstrated how climate change is increasing the frequency or severity of many extreme weather events. Over the last decade, these 18 African countries have collectively suffered average annual losses of $700m from climate-related disasters– and this is without counting the cost of these latest crises, says Oxfam. However, there has been minimal progress globally in raising funds specifically to address loss and damage from climate change. Africa contributes less than 5% of total global emissions but is suffering some of the most severe impacts of the climate crisis.

Officials will meet at the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Durban Nov 11-15 to discuss the future of Africa’s “environmental sustainability and prosperity”. Oxfam urges ministers to demand that industrial nations honour their promises to avoid escalating human and financial costs and to pay for damages.

“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently. The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering,” said Oxfam’s Southern Africa Regional Director Nellie Nyang'wa.

“In western Kenya, the crop harvest is 25% down and in parts of Somalia up to 60%. Livestock in many rural areas are emaciated and milk production is down. Cereal prices in some areas have rocketed up to five-year highs, pricing out poorer people. Nearly 7m people in the region are living just below the catastrophic hunger line,” said Oxfam’s Horn, East and Central Africa regional director Lydia Zigomo. “It is a vicious cycle where poor and marginalized communities, mostly women and girls, are more exposed to the climate crisis and less able to cope and recover from its harm.”.

Mithika Mwenda, chief executive of Oxfam’s partner PACJA, said “communities at the frontline of this climate crisis are overstretched and may be facing potential annihilation. But local people are doing everything that can to overcome the challenge. There are unprecedented levels of organization happening where governments have let local people down.”

“We’re seeing people trying to cope with shifting seasons and erratic rainfall by finding new ways to make a living off-farm. Women are coming together to pool their resources through small internal lending communities, buying food together, growing sweet potatoes instead of maize – all without outside support. Local people have the solutions but what they lack is resources, especially funding.

“Our leaders should look to support these community solutions to build up people’s resilience to climate change. For 35 years AMCEN has been a very important platform with impactful policies that have helped to create awareness of environmental sustainability. It needs to move away now from policy making to policy implementation.”

Oxfam is currently reaching more than 7 million people in ten of the hardest hit countries with food and water support, and long-term development projects to help people cope better with climate-related shocks. Oxfam plans to reach 10% of those most in need in these ten countries and is trying to raise $65m to do so.

Oxfam is calling on African ministers at the AMCEN meeting to:

• Insist rich industrialised countries decrease their CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global heating to below 1.5C, and honour their commitment to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries;

• Demand governments agree to develop a new funding mechanism for “loss and damage” from climate change at the upcoming UN climate conference (COP25);

• Invest more into universal, high-quality and gender-responsive public services and strengthen tax systems in African countries to close the gap between rich and poor;

• Improve their disaster warning and management systems, and commit to re-greening and agricultural policies that target women and men small-scale farmers;

• Invest in “social accountability” projects that ensures climate finance can reach the communities that need it most, and empowering them in their own decision-making

• Engage women and girls in the planning, design and implementation of early warning systems and climate mitigation and adaptation programs

• Protect people who are forced to move so that they are able to do so in safety, dignity and on their own terms.

46,46,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar: Humanitarian Snapshot (August to November 2018) - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-humanitarian-snapshot-august-november-2018,"OVERVIEW

There are currently some 1.26 million people estimated to be severely food insecure in the Grand Sud and Grand Sud-Est regions of Madagascar. This number is projected to decrease to about 1.2 million between November 2018 and March 2019, according to the results of the Integrated Phase Classification food insecurity analysis conducted in October 2018. The slight improvement in food security is attributed to a multisectorial humanitarian response.

However, the situation continues to be critical in the Grand Sud with about 256,750 people likely to face Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4), and nearly 631,900 people expected to be in Crisis (IPC phase 3) as the area has not been able to recover from the drought effect of the El Nino in 2016 and has received below average rainfall during the 2017-2018 agricultural season unlike the rest of the country. As a result, according to the Inter-cluster multi-sector assessment conducted in October in Beloha district, many households are selling livestock in higher numbers and at lower prices than usual affecting their ability to pay for and access basic services including school fees and potable water.

According to a newly piloted Nutrition Surveillance System, 20,234 children are acutely malnourished in the drought-prone districts. 1,419 of these children suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The nutrition cluster has strengthened the management of GAM services in the pockets of malnutrition, increasing the number of mobile teams to reach children in remote villages and providing continuous nutrition supplies in health facilities and community nutrition sites.

Early action is urgently required to avert a greater loss of life due to the plague outbreak ahead of an expected seasonal peak between November 2018 to March 2019. The timing also coincides with a Presidential elections period of October-December which will significantly increases the risk of transmission due to daily meetings of large crowds in all major cities in the country. A number of pneumonic cases have already been recorded in several districts close to the Capital and Pneumonic plague is highly transmissible (person-to-person) and can quickly cause death in the absence of treatment.

Since 19 August the cumulative number of confirmed and suspected cases in the country is higher than the average and the maximum of 2012-2016. From August to 05 November 2018, a total of 106 cases of plague have been reported, in 23 out of 114 districts in the country; out of which, 36 are confirmed in 12 districts and 8 regions. To date, 9 deaths (case fatality rate 9.4%) have been registered, among which 6 cases were pneumonic and 4 of bubonic form. It is important to note that all of these deaths occurred in the community, highlighting weaknesses in the early warning system and low community awareness, both of which increase the risk of the outbreak spreading.

Since 3 October 2018, a measles outbreak has been reported in 4 regions and 8 districts, including 4 urban districts of Antananarivo. To date, a total of 1, 662 cases have been reported among which 79 are confirmed. No death has been reported so far. According to surveillance reports, 80% of cases are among children between 1-14 years. Given immunization rate of only 58%, there is a risk of a wider spread of the outbreak. WHO/UNICEF continue to support the MoH to mobilize resources to undertake emergency vaccinations in 4 affected urban districts and high risk districts.","Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1201063-Mdg_Humanitarian_snapshot_Nov2018.png?itok=uYGwqWIq,"['food', '2018', 'districts', 'madagascar', 'snapshot', 'risk', 'reported', 'humanitarian', 'number', 'nutrition', 'country', 'cases', 'outbreak']", ,drought
47,47,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Southern Africa Food Security Alert: December 13, 2019 - Democratic Republic of the Congo - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/southern-africa-food-security-alert-december-13-2019,"2018/19 severe drought and current below-average forecast to drive significant assistance needs in 2020

Across Southern Africa, the October 2019 to March 2020 season started poorly with widespread rainfall deficits. International forecasting models anticipate a high probability of below-average rainfall through March (Figure 1), including in surplus-producing Zambia and South Africa. This follows the poor 2018/19 season, during which widespread drought resulted in poor agricultural production and deteriorated livestock conditions. These trends are compounded by flooding and conflict in DRC and very poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. The population expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes across Southern Africa through the March 2020 peak of the lean season will be well above average, and needs are expected to only rise further in late 2020, at the start of the next lean season. Donors and humanitarian partners should prepare for atypically high food assistance needs throughout 2020.

Large-scale crop losses occurred at the end of the 2018/19 rainfall season, which was characterized by severe drought and abnormal dryness across much of the region and tropical cyclones that hit the eastern coast. Regional maize grain supply for the current marketing year is slightly below the five-year average, reaching their lowest levels since the 2016/17 marketing year. As a result, maize prices are significantly above average across the region. Many poor agropastoral households depleted their food stocks atypically early, resulting in earlier than usual reliance on market purchases.

The start of the 2019/20 rainy season has been erratic, with early season deficits, and international forecasts are all indicating January to March 2020 rainfall is expected to be below average. Recent heavy rainfall over areas of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Angola lessened but did not eliminate early season deficits. Regional pasture and vegetative conditions have improved gradually with recent rains, though livestock body conditions are well below normal. Planting is ongoing, although at below average rates due to erratic onset of rains. The combination of atypically high food prices coupled with limited incomes (from low livestock prices and agricultural labor opportunities) have reduced household purchasing power. Rainfall during the December to March period is critical for crop development and likely below-average rainfall is expected to have negative impacts on rainfed crops, pasture, and water availability. Irrigated crops are also expected to be negatively impacted due to the multiple years of poor rainfall that have resulted in below-average groundwater levels. Late season rainfall may be average but would only slightly reduce cumulative rainfall deficits and potentially improve water and pasture availability, while having no significant impact on crop production.

Below-average production is anticipated in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and average to below-average production is likely in South Africa and Mozambique. Since Zambia and South Africa produce more than 70 percent of regional maize grain, regional maize grain supply for the 2020/21 marketing year is expected to be below 2019/20 and the five-year average. As a result, maize grain prices across the region in 2020 are anticipated to remain high and exceeding 2019 prices.

Lower than average access to labor opportunities are anticipated throughout 2020. Livestock body conditions are anticipated to improve in the short term as pastureland slowly regenerates, although grazing conditions are expected to deteriorate atypically early. Higher than average livestock deaths are again anticipated in the latter half of 2020 until the start of the 2020/21 rainy season. These trends, coupled with above-average staple food prices, will limit poor households’ ability to purchase sufficient food to meet their needs across much of the region. The exceptions include northern Madagascar and northern and central Mozambique and Malawi where average to above average rainfall is anticipated to support normal crop production, livestock conditions, and labor opportunities. In DRC, although favorable rainfall is forecast, conflict continues to limit income-earning opportunities and agricultural production.

The population in need of humanitarian assistance across Southern Africa will remain high throughout 2020. Food security outcomes in most areas of the region are anticipated to temporarily improve with the harvest in April/May; however, these improvements are expected to be short-lived. In worst-affected areas of the region, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes will likely persist during the post-harvest period. In late 2020, at the start of the 2020/21 lean season, FEWS NET anticipates regional food assistance needs will increase even higher than needs during the first quarter of 2020, and some poor households in the worst-affected areas are expected to face large food consumption gaps in the absence of humanitarian food assistance. Donors and humanitarian partners should prepare for considerable food assistance needs throughout 2020, with the likely need to further scale up humanitarian assistance in late 2020 with the start of the lean season.","Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1424598-SA_Alert_2019_12_13_2.png?itok=JScXgpmJ,"['alert', 'season', 'democratic', '2020', 'average', 'poor', '13', 'needs', 'africa', 'rainfall', 'security', 'expected', 'southern', 'republic', 'food', 'congo', 'assistance', '2019', 'conditions']", ,flood_and_drought

Four main hazards affect the country almost every year: cyclone, floods, drought—which always deteriorates into food insecurity—and epidemics, mainly plague.

CYCLONES

161k affected people by the tropical cyclone Ava in Jan 2018

15k displaced people (as of 17 January 2018)

The Tropical Cyclone Ava struck early in January 2018 before the country had recovered from the devastation caused by Cyclone Enawo in early 2017, when 434,000 people were affected. Even if the capacity of the emergency stocks reduced four times during the past 10 years, the immediate needs could be covered for the 161,000 people affected by Ava, of which nearly 15,000 are still displaced.

However, humanitarian actors will not have capacity to immediately respond to a future cyclone, unless these emergency stocks are replenished quickly. The current cyclone season from November to April is likely to be very active, with three or four cyclones expected to hit directly the country, of which at least one will be very strong.

A recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis found that the food security situation remains very fragile—810,000 people would be in IPC Phases 3 and 4 between November 2017 and March 2018. In addition, SMART surveys indicated some pockets of malnutrition which reached the emergency thresholds.

PNEUMONIC PLAGUE

2,603 cases (August 2017 to January 2018)

*225 deaths (August 2017 to January 2018) *

The ongoing plague season is very active. It started earlier than usual, in August 2017, and became a pneumonic plague in urban areas—in the past it was usually a bubonic plague in rural areas. At least 225 people have died to date (compared to an average of 50 deaths in the past seasons) and 2,603 cases have been reported. On 25 November 2017, the Ministry of Health of Madagascar officially announced the containment of the urban pneumonic plague outbreak, after three months of an acute epidemic phase, although more cases of bubonic and sporadic pneumonic plague are expected to be reported until April 2018. WHO has requested an additional US$4 million to sustain response operations over the next three months. Plague outbreaks are endemic in Madagascar.","Fri, 19 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1032339-Mdg_Humanitarian_snapshot_19Jan2018.png?itok=l_xst9gD,"['past', 'plague', 'food', '19', '2018', 'cyclone', 'madagascar', 'snapshot', '2017', 'humanitarian', 'country', 'pneumonic', 'emergency']", ,flood_and_drought
49,49,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Joint Call for Action to Address the Impacts of Climate Change and a Deepening Humanitarian Crisis in Southern Africa - Zimbabwe - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/joint-call-action-address-impacts-climate-change-and-deepening-humanitarian-crisis,"Current Situation

There are more than 11 million people now experiencing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) in nine Southern African countries1 due to deepening drought and climate crisis. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken, the number will likely rise in the coming months, according to the Regional Interagency Standing Committee Africa (RIASCO).

In Zimbabwe, 3.58 million people are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or Phase 4 (Emergency). In Zambia, 2.3 million people are currently estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or worse. In southern Angola, 1.6 million people are impacted by the drought with at least 562,000 in IPC Phase 3 or worse. By September 2019, 1.6 million people in Mozambique faced difficulties in accessing food as a result of agricultural losses, internal displacement and destruction of infrastructure and livelihoods stemming from two cyclones that devastated in the country in March and April 2019. In southern Madagascar, 916,201 people are facing severe acute food insecurity.

Climate shocks and climate change. Climate change is a central force driving a continued rise in global hunger, with both droughts and flooding negatively impacting food production. Evidence shows children suffer disproportionately from the impact of climate change. In fragile states and low-income communities, including in Southern Africa, the poor and marginalized will be most affected. Persons in low-income quintiles of society – and particularly children, women and the elderly who are less capable of coping with the negative effects of climate change – will be the most severely affected.

• Western and central parts of the region are experiencing poor rainfall and bad drought conditions, with some parts of Southern Africa facing the lowest rates of rainfall since 1981. Namibia received its lowest recorded rainfall in 35 years leaving 40 percent of its 2.4 million people characterised as severely food insecure.In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock. The region has had only two favourable agricultural seasons since 2012 and many areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño season.

• At the same time, the eastern part of the region saw unprecedented back-to-back cyclones (Idai and Kenneth) impacting Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Comoros and southern Tanzania.

• Southern Africa is currently at the forefront of the climate crisis and facing the consequences of it first-hand. Mitigation (reduced emissions) and adaptation (increased resilience) are required to reduce the impact of climate change in the coming years. A multisectoral and joint approach between UN Agencies with a focus on immediate life-saving response, as well as longer term systems strengthening is needed to address the complexities of climate change at the country level.

Access to water. In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock.

Lake Kariba, a critical water resource for Zambia and Zimbabwe, is only 16 per cent full at present, down 7.5 meters from the same time last year. In Zimbabwe, the fragile economic situation and cuts to electricity have impacted access to water, curtailing the ability of local authorities to pump water and procure water treatment chemicals for urban areas while in rural areas only 30 per cent of rural water sources have water, are functioning and are protected.

Nutrition. While Southern Africa does not report the critical levels of acute malnutrition seen in East Africa, any incremental increase in acute malnutrition, is an additional stress on the individual child and household. It also presents a stress on health system, which are often poorly equipped to deal with increasing numbers of acutely malnourished children. In addition, considering the high burden of stunting already present across Southern Africa, children that are both stunted and wasted have the highest risk of death compared to those who are stunted or wasted alone.

• In Zimbabwe, national global acute malnutrition (GAM) has risen to 3.6 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2018, and eight districts have GAM rates above 5 per cent, which is rarely seen in Zimbabwe and signifies a deteriorating situation. Doctors in Zimbabwe have been on strike for the previous two months, which has led to an ongoing human resources crisis and may lead to additional challenges for the management of children with acute malnutrition or other resources if no urgent solutions are found.

• In Mozambique, an estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). More than 250 cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Sofala province, which was hardest hit by Cyclone Idai.

• In Huíla and Cunene, in the south of Angola, between 70 and 80 per cent of the population are currently affected by food insecurity with increasing numbers of children identified as acutely malnourished through screening and programme admission data.

• Acute malnutrition continues to be of concern in the most drought affected districts of southern Madagascar, with 17,800 children treated for SAM with UNICEF support in 2019 to date, compared to 8,643 during the same time in 2018, largely due to a scale up in outreach screening and referral activities. An additional threat is the likely pipeline break for commodities for treating moderately malnourished children, which will likely lead to an increase in the numbers of severely malnourished children.

• A continuing challenge across Southern Africa relates to the lack of representative quality and up to date nutrition information in the most vulnerable communities and most drought-affected areas. This limitsthe ability to highlight the severity of the situation in terms of nutrition outcomes and can mean that a deteriorating situation may not be recognized in time to protect children from becoming malnourished. Representative and quality nutrition assessments in the most affected areas are key to support evidence-based targeted and timely responses.

Agriculture and livelihoods. The aggregate regional cereal output in 2019, including a production forecast for the winter wheat crops, to be harvested from October, is estimated to be nearly seven per cent below the 2018 production. The largest yearly decreases were registered in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Production of maize, the main staple in the region, is estimated at nearly 10 per cent below the previous five-year average. Livestock rearing and production—a key coping and resilience pathway and a contributor to national GDP in Southern Africa—is also being impacted by reduced water availability and degradation of pastures, as well as increased outbreak of transboundary animal diseases.3 In the southern region of Angola, the drought has affected 2.2 million cattle and 1.2 million sheep, leading to the death of 27,767 animals. The continued presence of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease, a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia, are presenting additional risks to crop production in the region. Macro-economic volatility, including high levels of inflation, rising unemployment and eroded household purchasing power have further compounded the high levels of food insecurity in several countries.

Health. During 2019, climate shocks have exacerbated outbreaks of measles in several countries across the Southern African region, including Angola (3,127 cases with 64 deaths, of which 73 per cent are from Lunda Sul, and 17 per cent from Moxico, with 85 laboratory confirmed as of 30 June 2019); Comoros (132 cases with no deaths, 56 confirmed by 11 August 2019) and Madagascar (a total of 202,692 cases with 966 deaths reported from 7 October 2018 to 10 Sept 2019). Namibia is facing an expansion of transmission of hepatitis E and has been experiencing an outbreak since 2017 in informal settlements with poor access to safe water and sanitation, with 6,527 cases and 55 deaths (including 1,585 confirmed cases) reported by 6 October 2019. These countries also have a significant HIV burden. Food insecurity and resulting malnutrition in people living with HIV, especially children, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

During the 2016/17 drought, a reduction in outpatient consultations and admissions in some countries of Southern Africa like Lesotho, (including for deliveries) were reported due to closure of health facilities as water was depleted, leaving communities without access to critical health services. Approximately 135/404 health districts in Angola, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and Zimbabwe reported increased caseloads resulting from upsurges of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria, which put pressure on health facilities (RIASCO 2017). Outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurred against the backdrop of severe water shortages resulting from the drought.","Thu, 14 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/Cunene%202019%20%28259%29_0%20%281%29.jpg?itok=G-3Rgaaq,"['impacts', 'climate', 'water', 'crisis', 'including', 'deepening', 'region', 'joint', 'humanitarian', 'southern', 'change', '2019', 'cent', 'zimbabwe', 'children', 'africa']", ,drought

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique. (OCHA, 26 Nov 2018)

Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019)

Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. (OCHA, 22 Jan 2019)

FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time. (FEWS NET, 1 Feb 2019)

President Hage Geingob [of Namibia] yesterday declared the current drought affecting 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas a national disaster. Since 2013, most parts of Namibia recorded below normal rainfall, thereby leaving the grazing land exhausted and with little recovery. (New Era, 7 May 2019)

An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. (SADC, 11 Jul 2019)

The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique.

A record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be severely food insecure in the next six months, United Nations food agencies have warned ... There are more than 11 million people now experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho ... The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease.

The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. The US support, confirmed in December 2019, comes at a moment of increasing needs, after drought and prolonged dry spells have left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of assistance. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government’s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need.

Between October 2019 and March 2020, an estimated 430,000 people are facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) and require urgent humanitarian action. (IPC, 23 Jan 2020)

More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country’s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. (IPC, 30 Mar 2020)

According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho’s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3 ) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. (IPC, 28 Aug 2020)

Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia’s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. IPC, 01 Dec 2020)

By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. OCHA, 19 Jan 2021)

According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. IPC, 12 Mar 2021)

Around 27.3 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world. IPC, 30 Mar 2021)

Angola has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Huíla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall.

Meat and vegetable oils lead FAO Food Price Index upwards, while cereal prices dip amid record output even as weather weighs in Africa

5 December 2019, Rome - World food prices rose significantly in November, reaching their highest point in more than two years, driven by jumps in the international prices of meat products and vegetable oils.

The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly-traded food commodities, averaged 177.2 points over the month, up 2.7 percent from October and 9.5 percent from the same period a year earlier.

The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index rose by 10.4 percent in November, as palm oil price quotations rose amid robust global import demand, increased use for the production of biodiesels and expectations of possible supply shortages next year. Rapeseed and soy oil values also rose.

The FAO Meat Price Index increased by 4.6 percent, its largest month-on-month increase in more than a decade. Price quotations for bovine and ovine meats rose the most, buoyed by strong import demand, especially from China ahead of year-end festivities. Pig and poultry meat prices also rose.

The FAO Sugar Price Index rose by 1.8 percent from October, buoyed by mounting indications that world sugar consumption in the coming year will surpass production - which is being hampered by less-than-ideal growing conditions in Thailand, India, France and the United States of America.

The FAO Cereal Price Index, by contrast, declined by 1.2 percent amid stiff competition among the world's leading wheat exporters. Rice values also fell while U.S. maize export prices remained under downward pressure even as those for Argentina and Brazil were generally firmer.

The FAO Dairy Price Index rose marginally from October, nudged up as milk production in Europe entered its seasonal low and global demand remained strong.

Record cereal production expected for 2019

FAO also released a new worldwide cereal production forecast for 2019, anticipating an all-time high harvest of 2 714 million tonnes, which would be 2.1 percent higher than in 2018.

The latest upward revision, contained in the new Cereal Supply and Demand Brief also released today, reflects higher-than-previously predicted coarse grain yields in China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

World output of coarse grains including maize is now forecast at 1 433 million tonnes, marginally short of the record level registered in 2017. After an upward revision for the European Union, global wheat production in 2019 is now forecast to rise by 4.8 percent from 2018 to reach 766.4 million tonnes. World rice production is likely to reach 515 million tonnes, a mere 0.5 percent drop from the record set in 2018, with Egypt, Madagascar and Nigeria all poised to spearhead a rebound for African rice production this season.

FAO's world cereal utilization forecast for 2019/20 stands at 2 709 million tonnes, up around 21 million tonnes from the previous season. World cereal stocks at the close of seasons in 2020 are now expected to reach 863 million tonnes. At this level, the global cereal stock-to-use ratio would approach a relatively high level of 31 percent, underscoring a comfortable global supply situation.

World trade in cereals in 2019/20 is forecast at 416 million tonnes, some 1.1 percent higher than in 2018/19.

Weather hits cereal harvests in East and Southern Africa

There are 42 countries today in need of external assistance for food, according to FAO's quarterly Crop Prospects and Food Situation report, also released today.

Compared to the September issue of the same report, Zambia, affected by drought conditions and record-high staple food prices, has been added to the list, which includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen, Zimbabwe.

The report also provides details on floods that followed earlier severe dryness, cutting harvest expectations in East Africa, and adverse weather conditions that caused a steep production decline in Southern Africa. Unfavorable harvests and significantly high staple food prices in Zimbabwe, set against an economy that has sharply deteriorated, will likely almost double the number of food-insecure people in the country during the first three months of 2020.

While the cereal output of Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) in Africa is expected to decline due to adverse weather that of LIFDCs in Asia is projected to increase, notably in Afghanistan and Syria.

Catholic News Service

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNS) — Hunger levels are so severe in drought-ridden southern Madagascar that many people in remote villages have eaten almost nothing but cactus fruit for up to four years, said a Catholic Relief Services official.

Eating this fruit leaves crimson stains on people’s faces and hands, and there is a “shame of poverty associated with these stains in Madagascar,” an island nation 250 miles off the coast of mainland Africa, said Nancy McNally, CRS information officer for East and Southern Africa.

The cactus plant “is the only thing that grows” in southern Madagascar, and the plants “are growing everywhere” in earth “that looks like white silt,” she said in a Nov. 23 telephone interview from Nairobi, Kenya.

A father of three, sitting with his wife and children outside the town of Beloha in southeastern Madagascar, “told me that his family had been living on cactus fruit for a year,” McNally said.

“With whatever money he could make” from finding something to sell, he would buy food for the youngest child, she said, noting that “this would amount to a little bit of rice once in a while for the boy, who was about a year old.”

“It’s the worst poverty I’ve seen,” McNally said, noting that the severe drought in southern Madagascar has led the U.N. to warn of potential famine, “a word that is very rarely used for fear of raising a false alarm.”

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned in late November that 330,000 people in southern Madagascar are “on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine.”

In Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital, “begging is very aggressive,” McNally said, noting that “poverty is very deep, and it seems that people’s survival instinct has kicked in.”

El Niño, a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, has aggravated dry conditions in Madagascar and the entire southern African region, where an estimated 39 million people are affected by food shortages.

“I saw a baby so thin who had already spent a month being fed” by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in the town of Tsihombe, Madagascar, McNally said.

Tsapasoa Fedraza’s 20-year-old mother had taken him to the nuns, who run an emergency shelter in the town, after neighbors in her nearby village put her in an oxcart and told her to get him help before he died of malnutrition, she said.

His mother “didn’t have the resources to get there on her own, which is the situation of so many people” in southern Madagascar, she said.

More than 90 percent of Madagascar’s population lives below the $2 a day poverty line, McNally said.

“People are dying in remote villages,” such as Ajampaly, she said, noting that, “we don’t know how bad it is.”

Poor or no infrastructure makes it extremely difficult to reach remote areas in the south of the country, McNally said.

“The chief in Ajampaly told me that the closest water point” was about four-and-a-half miles away, and most people have to walk to get water, she said.

“Those who suffer most are people who don’t have family to help them — children and the elderly,” she said. While there is some food in the markets in towns, “it is too expensive for most people.”

The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul have “a pervasive network in the communities” of southern Madagascar and are helping CRS provide food aid to the worst-hit villages, she said.

Madagascar needs a much stronger international response to this crisis, she said, noting that some areas of the island have had no rain at all for four years.

53,53,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar needs agroforestry businesses in its response to climate change - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-needs-agroforestry-businesses-its-response-climate-change,"As in many African countries, Madagascar’s forests are under increasing pressure from agricultural expansion as growing populations seek to produce more food in an increasingly erratic climate. After a recent visit to the country, Duncan Macqueen reflects on how agroforestry could be a key part of a response.

Madagascar’s expanding population needs food. Changing climates make crop production risky. The South East Asian ancestry of Madagascan people is seen in the meticulous rice paddy terracing outside Antananarivo, the country’s capital.

Above those valleys the hillsides are almost completely devoid of natural tree cover. A few community-planted pines and eucalypts dot the slopes, but local people prune even these trees to their very tips for fuel wood for cooking. Very little biodiversity remains – and that includes lemurs.

My visit was to Ambohiboahangy, 30 kilometres from Antananarivo. The destination, two local farm cooperatives – Coop Tsinjo and Coop Taratra Ambohiboahangy. The field trip was part of a series of regional training-of-trainer sessions for forest and farm cooperative leaders, organised by the Forest and Farm Facility. This training, led by IIED, was in risk management and sustainable business incubation. Most of the participants from Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Togo and Zambia represented forest and farm producer organisations.

Collectively, these organisations and their businesses are made up of millions of farmers, providing an ideal route to spread training and know-how to achieve landscape-scale solutions.

Collective forest and farm businesses are central to climate action

It goes without saying that collective forest and farm businesses must overcome climate risks (and many other types of risk) if they are to secure food and improve livelihoods for farmers. Their activities are also critical to sequestering carbon within climate-resilient landscapes through forest restoration.

But what are the prospects for that? Africa’s population is set to double by 2050 and most of the food comes from subsistence farming, with average yields per unit area barely increasing in decades.

The bigger picture in Madagascar, for instance, is troubling. Demand for food has driven the loss of 3.5 million hectares of forest from 2001-18 (more than 16% of Madagascar’s total remaining forest). The average rate of forest loss was 105,000 hectares per year between 2001 and 2010. This trebled to 321,000 hectares per year from 2011-18.

Soil erosion above the terraced rice paddy I saw looks fierce. This is not all bad, as the fertility is swept into the terraced rice fields. But in the fight to maintain crop yields most farmers we interviewed were also applying chemical fertilisers and heavy doses of pesticide. Some organic compost was also dug in, though the denuded landscape offers little in the way of biomass.

Taking the first steps into agroforestry

There is a way to change this through agroforestry. Both Coop Tsinjo and Coop Taratra Ambohiboahangy have developed new businesses. They sell more than 30 varieties of vegetable seed in small packets to other farmers in and around Antananarivo. They grow and sell chickens and eggs from several smallholder poultry growers. Both sectors are highly competitive and dependent on intermediate traders.

To diversify its products, Coop Tsinjo has invested in a fruit drying and processing centre, with the support of the NGO, Amadea. The centre sells dried fruit (Cape gooseberry (locally called pok pok), banana and pineapple) and jam made from fruit waste. One entrepreneurial farmer is running a fruit seedling nursery. He stocks and sells more than 40 types of fruit tree to broaden future planting and sales options.

But it is perhaps in a new youth network SOA-Mitsinjo, operating under the parent Coop Tsinjo umbrella, that the most interesting developments are taking place. In one pilot site, the network is establishing a mixed agroforestry system with Arabica coffee intercropped with citrus trees and, in the early phase, vegetables such as carrots and pumpkin. Diversity brings climate resilience while the tree components sequester carbon.

Agroforestry is not yet widespread in Madagascar. Early pilots include those using indigenous species by NGOs such as Ny Tanintsika, or more commercial plantings by the forest and farm producer organisations mentioned above.

These pilots show how farmers can benefit from the use of tree crops: the trees not only diversify product sales but also improve soil organic matter content, fertility and the production of a farmer’s main crops.

A strong business case for agroforestry can improve its contribution to climate action

Agroforestry must surely form a central part of Madagascar’s climate action – such as its commitment to the Africa Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative 100 (AFR100). AFR100 aims to restore forest cover on 100 million hectares of land across Africa as a contribution to the 2011 Bonn challenge.

Madagascar’s own promise is to restore four million hectares by 2030. It’s not yet clear to me how such targets are to be delivered and measured. The promise is to undo all Madagascar’s deforestation since 2001 (and more) in less time than the original destruction occurred. That is some pledge.

Madagascan forest and farm producer organisations will have to see opportunity in agroforestry businesses if the commitment is to be met. In that light, the Forest and Farm Facility’s support is well placed to make sure that these producer organisations understand how to incubate sustainable businesses and manage business risks (including those linked to climate change).

The facility’s vision is of climate-resilient landscapes and improved livelihoods, and its unique approach of investing directly in the capabilities of forest and farm producer organisations will help Madagascan farmers take, what is in my view, this vital step in the right direction.

An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.

Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.

""We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,"" said Nellie Nyang'wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.

""The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.""

Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.

Zambia's rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.

Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

""The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn't enough drinking water, which means that people and animals—both livestock and wildlife—are having to use the same water points,"" said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.

""This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.""

Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.

The drought has also affected the region's wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe's National Parks.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) are calling for urgent funding to avert a major hunger crisis and for the international community to step up investment in long-term measures to combat the impact of climate shocks and build the capacity of communities and countries to withstand them.

There are more than 11 million people now experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho.

“We’ve had the worst drought in 35 years in central and western areas during the growing season,” said Margaret Malu, WFP’s acting Regional Director for Southern Africa. “We must meet the pressing emergency food and nutrition needs of millions of people, but also invest in building the resilience of those threatened by ever more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms.”

While southern Africa has experienced normal rainfall in just one of the last five growing seasons, persistent drought, back-to-back cyclones and flooding have wreaked havoc on harvests in a region overly dependent on rain-fed, smallholder agriculture.

The growing hunger crisis, affecting urban as well as rural communities, is being aggravated by rising food prices, large-scale livestock losses and mounting joblessness. It is also worsening levels of acute malnutrition in particularly at-risk communities.

The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease.

“Late rains, extended dry periods, two major cyclones and economic challenges have proved a recipe for disaster for food security and livelihoods across Southern Africa,” said Alain Onibon, FAO’s Sub-Regional Coordinator for Southern Africa. “As it could take many farming communities at least two to three growing seasons to return to normal production, immediate support is vital. Now is the time to scale up agricultural emergency response. We need to ensure farmers and agropastoralists take advantage of the forecasted good rains, assuming they happen, as this will be crucial in helping them rebuild their livelihoods.

Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and the region includes six of the nine African countries set to be hardest hit by adverse weather in coming years: DR Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

“With the region so prone to shocks and afflicted by high rates of chronic hunger, inequality and structural poverty, climate change is an existential emergency which must be tackled with the utmost urgency”, said Robson Mutandi, IFAD Director for the Southern Africa Hub. “Governments have the biggest role to play, but we must all step up because it affects each and every one of us.”

Bridging humanitarian action and longer-term development is crucial to overcoming recurrent crises and tackling the root causes of poverty and food insecurity. With sustainable sources of funding, communities and countries can build their resilience to future shocks.

Power outages are widespread in affected areas.

More than 760,000 people in nine regions are expected to be directly affected by the strongest cyclone to strike the island nation in 13 years. Conditions are comparable to Cyclone Gafilo in 2004, which left 250,000 Malagasies displaced and 100,000 homes damaged in its wake. Another recent major tropical storm, Cyclone Ivan, affected more than half a million people and displaced nearly 200,000 in 2008.

According to the national meteorological authority, threat levels remain highest (Red Alert) in the following regions: Diana, Sofia, Savan Analanjirofo, Atsinanana, Alaotra Mangoro, Boeny, Betsinoka, and Ny Faritanin’ Antananarivo.

Madagascar also suffers from severe and chronic drought, particularly in the south of country. More than 850,000 people are severely food insecure.

Overview

Intense Tropical Cyclone Enawo struck northeastern Madagascar on the morning of March 7, travelling at two to three hundred kilometers per hour. On March 8, Enawo weakened from an “intense” to a “moderate” tropical storm, with an average speed of 80km/hour with peaks of 112km/hour.

As Enawo moves further inland, the Government’s disaster management agency (BNGRC), the United Nations and NGOs are evacuating affected populations, passing on life-saving information to affected communities and responding to growing humanitarian needs.

Many whose homes have been flooded or destroyed are staying with relatives in more secure areas, while thousands of IDPs are sheltering in schools, churches and gymnasiums.

Heavy winds, floods and landslides have wounded seven people and killed five so far. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown due to poor communication and difficulty reaching affected areas.

The northeastern Sava region has sustained significant damage to housing and agriculture. Antalaha port is inaccessible and more than half of the city’s homes have been destroyed, with northern areas particularly affected. Farahalana commune is flooded by Lohoko River, with half of all housing under water. Farms along the famous Vanilla Coast have been hard hit, while ricefields in Antalaha and Sambava are submerged.

Carcasses of migratory birds have washed up on the shores of Fenerive Est in the Analanjirofo region, where more than 10,000 people are displaced. Two school buildings have collapsed, an airport road blocked, and more than 500 houses flooded in the districts of Mananara Nord, Maroantsetra,

Vavatenina and Soanierana Ivongo. Flood waters in Maroantsetra have attained a height of four metres.

The Malagasy Red Cross reports that evacuations are underway in the flood-affected cities of Brickaville and Toamasina I & II in Antsinanana region.

At midday local time on Wednesday, the eye of the cyclone was situated in the Tsaratanana district in Betsiboka region, and was moving South-Southwest, approaching the capital Antananarivo. Flooding and water stagnation for days on end in Antananarivo, where more than a million people live, could lead to outbreaks of life-threatening waterborne diseases.

In the same year, tropical storm Mayak uprooted 6,500 islanders of the Federated States of Micronesia, including Detora and her family, who have lived on the island of Chuuk state for generations.

For several years now, the threat of drought and famine in southern Madagascar has forced farmers like Amadou Botokeky to burn their fields and look for livelihoods in other parts of the country.

Meanwhile, in the vast expanse of the Mongolian grasslands, T S Munkhsukh worries about the harsh winters and summer droughts, and the future of nomadic herders and their livestock.

The stories of Daw Lawng Hngel, Detora, Amadou Botokeky and T S Munkhsukh are part of a growing group of migrants on the move because of climate change. They may live thousands of miles apart from each other, but they share a common reality: accelerated climate change is threatening their homes and drastically altering their way of life.

Hazards such as floods, storm surges, droughts, cyclones and heavy precipitation, accentuated by climate change, take a huge toll on communities and force millions of people out of their homes every year.

Climate migration is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Unless action is taken, by 2050, there will be over 143 million people forced to migrate due to climate change across these three regions alone. Migration due to environmental changes is not a new phenomenon – what is new is the intensity and severity of these drivers due to our changing climate.

Find A Way is IOM’s global initiative focusing on the resilience and strength of those migrating due to climate change and embodies IOM’s commitment to finding solutions in the face of adversity. Through dedicated operational, research, policy and advocacy efforts, IOM brings climate and environmental migration to the heart of international, regional and national efforts. Whether it is preparing communities to be more resilient in the face of climate change or working with governments to manage internal migration and prepare for when climate migration occurs, IOM will always Find A Way to support vulnerable communities and leave no one behind.

IOM is at the forefront, helping people who have already suffered the impacts of climate change, to rebuild their lives with dignity, and be resilient to future shocks. But more needs to be done to preserve, protect, and often rebuild communities affected by climate change and migration. IOM calls on greater participation by the general public to take action and invites all concerned citizens to join its on-going efforts in supporting climate migrants.

Ninety percent of the population lives below the international poverty line and nearly 50 percent of children under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished, according to the UN.

SITUATION

• To date in 2019, three cyclones have caused heavy rainfall in parts of Madagascar, flooding fields and rendering roads inaccessible. Weak agricultural production and heavy dependence on poorly supplied markets in southern Madagascar will likely lead to Crisis (IPC 3) and Stressed (IPC 2) levels of acute food insecurity for poor households through May, with humanitarian assistance preventing further deterioration of food security for many households, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).*

• Food availability will likely improve following the March-to-May harvests, FEWS NET reports. However, many poor farmers lack the resources to buy agricultural inputs—such as seeds—resulting in roughly half of the available agricultural land in the southern areas of the country going unplanted in December and January.

• Humanitarian organizations continue to express concerns regarding the nutrition situation in southern Madagascar. The prevalence of global acute malnutrition is above the World Health Organization’s emergency threshold of 15 percent in 22 communes within southern Madagascar. Additionally, 47 percent of children younger than 5 years of age suffer from chronic malnutrition in Madagascar, representing the fourth highest chronic malnutrition prevalence in the world.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a standardized tool that aims to classify the severity and magnitude of acute food insecurity. The IPC scale, which is comparable across countries, ranges from Minimal (IPC 1) to Famine (IPC 5).

RESPONSE

• USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to provide emergency food assistance and complementary nutrition activities to vulnerable households in southern Madagascar. ADRA also implements food-for-assets activities, in which families receive food assistance in exchange for a household member helping to construct water points for agricultural, household and livestock use. With FFP resources, CRS has also helped communities affected by natural disasters and crop failure due to Fall Army Worm infestations.

• Through the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), FFP provides emergency food assistance, sourced from local, regional and U.S. markets, as well as specialized nutritious foods for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition in children under the age of 5. WFP also implements early recovery activities and strengthens the capacity of national government systems to lead emergency response efforts through technical and logistical support.

• Additionally, FFP partners with CRS and ADRA to implement multi-year development activities, which build community resilience, protect and enhance livelihoods opportunities, and improve the food and nutrition security of vulnerable households. These activities aim to improve maternal and child health, strengthen resource management and increase household income to address the underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition.","Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1261748-FFP%20Fact%20Sheet%20Madagascar%2003.19.2019.png?itok=IU6SCOfD,"['sheet', 'malnutrition', 'food', 'acute', '19', 'ipc', 'households', 'activities', 'madagascar', 'southern', 'assistance', '2019', 'ffp', 'insecurity', 'fact']", ,flood

In early March, people who live along Mozambique's long coastline began to hear rumors about a cyclone.

The storm was forming in the Indian Ocean, in the narrow band of warm water between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Overnight on March 14, 2019, the storm struck Mozambique head-on, barreling over the port city of Beira and flooding an enormous swath of land as it moved inland toward Zimbabwe.

In low-lying, rural Buzi district, the wind arrived like an explosion. It tore the roofs off homes and schools and churches. It ripped trees out by their roots. When the floodwaters came the next day, there were perilously few high spots left where people could escape.

Those in some of the worst-hit areas were cut off for weeks. Neighbors rescued each other and did their best to help each other survive. At least 600 people died in Cyclone Idai, according to the United Nations.

Mozambique's long coastline, sprawling river delta and changing weather patterns make it susceptible to multiple hazards as the climate changes. Flooding, heat waves, cyclones and drought are all getting more frequent and severe as the Earth gets hotter.

Five weeks later, a second cyclone — this one dubbed Kenneth — hit a less populated area on the border between Mozambique and Tanzania. It was the strongest cyclone to ever make landfall in Africa.

In all, the back-to-back storms seriously affected about 2 million people.

""The example of Mozambique must be an alert for all,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said when he visited Beira over the summer.

The disasters put Mozambique's government and citizens in the unenviable position of responding to an onslaught of climate-driven disasters while also doing their best to prepare for an even more dangerous future. They also have made clear that, absent international climate action, there's only so much that vulnerable countries can do to adapt to extreme weather.

The Front Lines

Long before the cyclones of 2019, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had realized that flooding was a serious problem in the country. In 2000 and again in 2013, rivers overflowed and hundreds were displaced by water.

But far fewer people died as a result of the 2013 floods. In the intervening years, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had studied where and how people were vulnerable to floods and other disasters, then asked community leaders to volunteer to serve on Disaster Risk Reduction Committees for their towns and neighborhoods.

Such a decentralized approach to disaster preparedness is something that the Red Cross and others argue for around the world. The idea is that local leaders learn how to prepare for disasters and help their neighbors stay safe during extreme weather events.

Such programs are not a replacement for national and international climate action, but they are nonetheless an important part of building climate resilience in many places.

By 2017, more than 14,000 people were serving on more than 1,000 local committees around Mozambique, according to the World Bank.

""I'm responsible for making sure everyone knows where the high ground is,"" explains Luis Josine, who has lived in the farming community of Mondiane since 1961 and became the leader of his local disaster committee when it was founded five years ago.

The tools and training he received were relatively basic: a handheld radio for weather warnings, an orange vest, a whistle and three flags of different colors.

Mondiane is near a river that's prone to flooding. In 2000, dozens of people who lived in this area drowned, Josine says.

Today when there is a flood warning, Josine goes through town blowing a whistle and waving a flag. If the flag is blue, it means a flood is likely in two or three days, he explains. If it's yellow, it means one day. If the flag is red, it's an emergency, and people should evacuate immediately.

""It is good,"" he says. ""People listen. They know to leave and go up the road."" That makes him feel proud, especially since he has noticed that the flood risk in the town of Mondiane is increasing.

""We've been noticing the climate changing here since around the year 2000,"" he explains. ""The floods are getting bigger and more severe. The droughts are getting longer.""

Climate scientists say that's in keeping with trends in the whole region and that extreme weather is expected to get more common as the Earth continues to heat up.

'We Are Really Suffering'

More extreme weather can also lead to less resilience.

""Disasters put people back into poverty,"" says Michel Matera, a senior analyst at the World Bank in the capital of Mozambique, Maputo. Without efforts to decrease the damage from floods and other disasters, he says, people will be ""continuously trapped into poverty.""

It's particularly challenging to avoid that vicious cycle when climate change drives more than one disaster in a short period of time

In the months after the cyclones drew international attention to Mozambique, another disaster was unfolding more quietly: a drought.

toggle caption NicholeSobecki/VII for NPR

The rain from the cyclones had come all at once, in a torrent, but the more moderate, continuous rain that farmers rely on didn't fall in much of the country. Disaster Risk Reduction Committees worked to lessen the drought's blow.

""We collect the water, we do our farming very carefully,"" explains Juliet Fernando Chaque, a member of the local committee in the town of Xidwaxine.

She says the community has done a lot in recent years to cope with extreme weather, including drought. For example, the town now has a communal silo to store food, and farmers plant crops that are tolerant of drought, like sweet potatoes.

toggle caption NicholeSobecki/VII for NPR

But this ongoing drought has been so extreme, it has overwhelmed their efforts. It began in 2018, and at this point, any food that residents managed to store is long gone. The soil is dry and cracked. Planting season came in September and still there was no rain. So there's almost no planting.

Women from Xidwaxine have started walking three hours to a lake where water lilies grow to harvest the plants and eat the bitter tubers at the base of the roots.

""We are really suffering,"" Chaque says.

Adapting to drought here will likely require comparatively big, expensive infrastructure projects to bring water out to the fields. Putting the brakes on climate change in general will require a global shift away from fossil fuels that has been slow at best.

That's a difficult reality for local leaders like Chaque, who have proudly, persistently pushed their communities to become more resilient to global changes that they cannot control.","Fri, 27 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/12/19/no_fish4sex-x-36_wide-27be2647535a8e737d1ad1af7e57e693ab52e76b.jpg?s=1400,"['racing', 'climate', 'winning', 'drought', 'weather', 'disaster', 'caption', 'local', 'international', 'nicholesobeckivii', 'change', 'adapt', 'mozambique', 'extreme']", ,flood_and_drought

Once a week dozens of mothers gather at the Nikoly health centre carrying their babies in need of assistance. A nurse is here to treat severely malnourished children. The drought has left its mark on the population.

""Chronic food insecurity""

""Here in the south of Madagascar there is really chronic food insecurity that has lasted for several years,"" says Marie-Claude Désilets, from UNICEF_. She adds: ""Each season we see peaks of food insecurity that have become more and more serious depending on the year. Now these peaks have been very intense for several years in a row. This means that households no longer have the capacity to withstand any shocks. People have sold their goods, their cattle, their land. Some have even sold their cooking pans. So we have to deal with a very vulnerable population that needs support to get by and manage in their daily lives.”_

""When I can't find anything, he doesn't eat""

UNICEF, financed by EU Humanitarian Aid, supports all the health centres located in the eight southern districts of Madagascar, the ones most hit by drought.

""We have no money to buy food. I give my baby anything I can find, but when I can't find anything, he doesn't eat,"" insists one mother while holding her son.

Acutely malnourished children

UNICEF supports around 14,000 children in Southern Madagascar, out of around 25,000 who are in need.

""We offer ready-to-eat therapeutic food. It comes in little bags that need no preparation. We also give antibiotics. Children come here every week for eight weeks.

62,62,DR-2020-000231-MDG,2019: Natural disasters claim more than 1200 lives across East and Southern Africa - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2019-natural-disasters-claim-more-1200-lives-across-east-and-southern-africa,"The climate crisis contributes to at least 33 million people in the region – or 10% of the population across ten countries – being at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse[1]. Over 16 million are believed to be children [2].

New analysis from Save the Children shows over 1200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[3].

Southern Africa is warming at twice the global rate [4] and many countries have been buffeted by multiple shocks, including Mozambique experiencing two strong cyclones in the same season for the first time in recorded history.

As world leaders meet this week at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25), Save the Children calls on them to commit to greater action to reduce the impact of the climate crisis on children, in East and Southern Africa and globally, who will be living with the impact of their decisions.

2019 will be remembered as the year the climate crisis devastated parts of east and southern Africa, with floods, landslides, drought and cyclones leaving at least 33 million people at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse, according to new analysis by Save the Children.

A recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows increasing evidence that climate change is contributing to higher temperatures in the region, and that these temperatures are exacerbating the impacts of drought and flooding[5]. These climate shocks decimate livelihoods, leaving households desperate for food and putting children at risk of acute malnutrition - a life threatening condition requiring urgent treatment. Children also bear close to 90 per cent of the burden of disease attributable to climate change, such as malaria and dengue fever[6].

Repeated erratic and extreme weather events in east and southern Africa has meant that in 2019:

At least 1,200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[7]. This figure does not include the thousands of lives lost to drought, and Save the Children fears that soaring hunger levels over the past 12 months will have contributed to further loss of life as well as malnutrition, particularly amongst infants.

Ten countries across East and Southern Africa - Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya – are experiencing ongoing weather-induced crises, with an average of 10% of people living in these countries currently experiencing serious hunger [8]. With high populations of children – a total of 162 million under 18 year-olds across the ten countries - Save the Children estimates these figures include over 16 million children now at crisis or emergency levels of hunger [9].

Massive movements of people have created additional risks of children being exploited, separated from their families, or dropping out of school. By June 2019[10], over 1 million people across seven of the ten countries had been newly displaced by climate-related shocks[11]. Over half of these displacements were the result of Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in March 2019, and was followed six weeks later by Cyclone Kenneth, which was the first time in Mozambique’s recorded history of two strong tropical cyclones in the same season. The storms were also the strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent[12].

By June 2019, the number of people forced to flee their homes as a result of climate shocks in the region was already the same as for the whole of 2018[13], and does not count more recent displacements from floods which have struck Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan over the past three months. These disasters have currently displaced at least an additional 1.1 million people[14], compared to 1021600 at the end of 2018. Based on the current trajectory, this figure could double by the end of 2019.

Save the Children is urging the international community to take greater steps to tackle the climate crisis and its impact on children around the world, which is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda Pledge to Leave No One Behind and ultimately the rights of all children as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As part of this, the international community needs to work with governments in east and southern Africa and across the globe to support the development and implementation of national action plans on climate change.

Amran is a 13 year old girl whose home was flooded when the banks of the Shabelle River broke in Beledweyne, Somalia. Amran is now living in a tent with her parents and three siblings. Amran said:

_ “I was very horrified when I heard the water is coming and will be reaching our house. I did not know what would happen to me and my family. We were all very scared.”_

Save the Children’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, Ian Vale, said:

“The findings of this analysis are grim, and show that the climate crisis is further entrenching inequality, poverty and displacement across East and Southern Africa. The climate crisis is happening here, it’s killing people, it’s forcing them from their homes, and it’s ruining children’s chance of a future.

“With these overlapping, unrelenting emergencies, the humanitarian system is also being stretched to breaking point. Repeated cycles of food insecurity from climate-related shocks is resulting in significant funding shortfalls and unmet humanitarian needs. We are reaching a crisis point in this region.

“As world leaders come together for COP25, we call on them to take strong decisions to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure the lives and futures of our children is protected. We call on donors to increase and sustain funding for humanitarian assistance across East and Southern Africa, with initiatives linked to existing measures to increase children's protection, access to health and education, and livelihood support. And most importantly, children need to be actively involved in international, national and local efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.”

Save the Children is the global leader in protecting children in emergencies and natural disasters, working with communities to set up evacuation routes, pre-position emergency supplies, fight against the effects of drought, and access clean water.

63,63,DR-2020-000231-MDG,The 'shame of poverty' is colored by cactus fruit in Madagascar - America Magazine,https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2016/11/29/shame-poverty-colored-cactus-fruit-madagascar,"Hunger levels are so severe in drought-ridden southern Madagascar that many people in remote villages have eaten almost nothing but cactus fruit for up to four years, said a Catholic Relief Services official.

Eating this fruit leaves crimson stains on people's faces and hands, and there is a ""shame of poverty associated with these stains in Madagascar,"" an island nation 250 miles off the coast of mainland Africa, said Nancy McNally, CRS information officer for East and Southern Africa.

The cactus plant ""is the only thing that grows"" in southern Madagascar, and the plants ""are growing everywhere"" in earth ""that looks like white silt,"" she said in a Nov. 23 telephone interview from Nairobi, Kenya.

A father of three, sitting with his wife and children outside the town of Beloha in southeastern Madagascar, ""told me that his family had been living on cactus fruit for a year,"" McNally said.

""With whatever money he could make"" from finding something to sell, he would buy food for the youngest child, she said, noting that ""this would amount to a little bit of rice once in a while for the boy, who was about a year old.""

""It's the worst poverty I've seen,"" McNally said, noting that the severe drought in southern Madagascar has led the U.N. to warn of potential famine, ""a word that is very rarely used for fear of raising a false alarm.""

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned in late November that 330,000 people in southern Madagascar are ""on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine.""

In Antananarivo, Madagascar's capital, ""begging is very aggressive,"" McNally said, noting that ""poverty is very deep, and it seems that people's survival instinct has kicked in.""

El Nino, a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, has aggravated dry conditions in Madagascar and the entire southern African region, where an estimated 39 million people are affected by food shortages.

""I saw a baby so thin who had already spent a month being fed"" by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in the town of Tsihombe, Madagascar, McNally said.

Tsapasoa Fedraza's 20-year-old mother had taken him to the nuns, who run an emergency shelter in the town, after neighbors in her nearby village put her in an oxcart and told her to get him help before he died of malnutrition, she said.

His mother ""didn't have the resources to get there on her own, which is the situation of so many people"" in southern Madagascar, she said.

More than 90 percent of Madagascar's population lives below the $2 a day poverty line, McNally said.

""People are dying in remote villages,"" such as Ajampaly, she said, noting that, ""we don't know how bad it is.""

Poor or no infrastructure makes it extremely difficult to reach remote areas in the south of the country, McNally said.

""The chief in Ajampaly told me that the closest water point"" was about four-and-a-half miles away, and most people have to walk to get water, she said.

""Those who suffer most are people who don't have family to help them—children and the elderly,"" she said. While there is some food in the markets in towns, ""it is too expensive for most people.""

The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul have ""a pervasive network in the communities"" of southern Madagascar and are helping CRS provide food aid to the worst-hit villages, she said.

Madagascar needs a much stronger international response to this crisis, she said, noting that some areas of the island have had no rain at all for four years.

""A 70-year-old man I talked to said he had farmed with his father when he was young, and every year (they) had a rainy season that could be counted on, but those times are gone and are not coming back,"" McNally said.","Tue, 29 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_750_x_503_/public/main_image/20161129t1014-1021-cns-southern-madagascar-hunger_800.jpg.png?itok=7LlPRdg4,"['fruit', 'cactus', 'shame', 'food', 'remote', 'madagascar', 'southern', 'villages', 'poverty', 'told', 'town', 'noting', 'mcnally', 'colored']", ,drought

Madagascar

Although the impact of the El Niño-induced drought has lessened, lack of access to water and related nutrition and health issues continue to threaten the lives of children throughout southern Madagascar . An estimated 1 million people will need food-related assistance in the first quarter of 2018, and an estimated 140,000 children under 5 years will require treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM).

More than 770,000 people are in need of water , sanitation and hygiene (W ASH) services due to the impact of disasters.

The cyclone season is expected to commence in early 2018, threaten critical infrastructure, including health facilities and schools, and potentially generate additional displacements. Existing and new emergencies have the potential to lead to education interruptions for more than 100,000 children.

Thousands of children are at increased risk of abuse and exploitation through prostitution, child labour and child marriage—risks that are compounded by the impacts of recurring disasters. Since August 2017, a severe outbreak of bubonic and pneumonic plague has resulted in 2,1 19 detected cases and 172 reported deaths.

A resurgence throughout the plague season is likely and will require enhanced preparedness. Socio-economic tensions are expected to increase before the presidential and legislative elections in 2018.

Humanitarian strategy

UNICEF and its partners will respond to the needs of populations affected by emergencies and will mainstream resilience and early recovery strategies. UNICEF will contribute to an integrated nutrition, health, education, Communication for Development (C4D), social protection and WASH response in affected areas through a multi-sectoral approach that will address the most acute needs. SAM prevention and treatment will target children under 5 in drought-affected areas in southern Madagascar . The health system will be strengthened at the national and sub-national levels, including through social mobilization and community engagement, to support preparedness and response to health emergencies and epidemics. UNICEF will contribute to improving and sustaining access to safe water in disaster-prone areas, and support communities affected by water-borne diseases. Cash-based assistance will be prioritized to facilitate a quick response to disasters and prevent families from adopting negative coping mechanisms that give rise to malnutrition, child exploitation and school dropout. UNICEF will support continued access to basic education during disasters through the provision of temporary learning spaces and teaching and learning materials, as well as school rehabilitation and protection services for vulnerable children.

UNICEF will also support the Government to strengthen institutional capacity on disaster management and social protection.

Results from 2017

As of 31 October 2017, UNICEF had US$10.4 million available against the US$31 million appeal (33 per cent funded).

Although significant results were achieved, urgent needs remain for 2018 and vulnerability is high, with 90 per cent of the population living under the poverty line. In 2017, 1 1,700 children under 5 with SAM received treatment, accounting for 33 per cent of the sector target. More than 512,000 children under 5 received treatment for common childhood illnesses and disease outbreaks through health/nutrition outreach services in disaster-af fected areas, the provision of essential supplies, technical support and C4D. Through UNICEF support, more than 400,000 people gained access to safe water . Some 12,000 drought-af fected children facing protection concerns were identified and reached with case management support, including family psychosocial support and referral to medical care. More than 46,500 cyclone-af fected children were able to access education through school rehabilitation and the provision of learning spaces and catch-up classes through programmes supported by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education.

65,65,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Forecasting, commodity futures, new crops needed to break Southern Africa's cycle of hunger - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-drought-idUSKBN13Y24C,"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Breaking the cycle of drought and hunger in Southern Africa, where 39 million people are suffering a drought-induced food crisis, will need better early warning systems, switching to new crops and hedging commodity prices, food experts said on Friday.

After the region’s worst drought in 35 years, people across Southern Africa are pulling their children out of school, eating vital seed stocks, and selling their possessions.

Some 13.8 million people need international aid, mainly because of rising needs in Madagascar - where hunger has reached emergency levels - Malawi and Zimbabwe, according to the latest U.N. figures.

“(Trying to) help the countries to break the cycle of drought-induced emergencies ... is really important but it is also very difficult,” said Timo Pakkala of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

The seven most vulnerable countries are preparing national strategies and policies for resilience against future droughts.

“Governments ... need to have that political leadership, and resources and long term planning and policies,” said Pakkala, OCHA’s El Nino coordinator for Southern Africa.

He was speaking ahead of the release of an updated action plan by aid agencies for the region, which also looks at how to stop the next major drought becoming a crisis.

The recommendations include grain marketing boards that function transparently, helping to stabilize prices, better management of water, and planting more drought-resistant crops.

Others include improving early warning systems in Madagascar, and expanding social safety nets like pensions and free school meals that can be scaled up in a crisis.

“We hope if we invest in these issues we can break the cycle of drought emergencies,” Pakkala said.

Most people affected by the drought are small farmers growing maize, producing bumper harvests in a good year, but a crop susceptible to poor rainfall. Some farmers may be reluctant to switch, Francesco Del Re, senior adviser to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Southern Africa response.

“I can propose to the farmer a drought resistant crop, like a certain type of bean,” but people may not like the taste and farmers will find them hard to sell, he said.

GRAIN IMPORTS

Southern Africa experiences frequent droughts, which developed into major hunger crises in 1992 and 2002.

Some $1 billion in international aid was spent on the 2002 hunger crisis, said Steve Wiggins, research fellow of the London-based think tank, Overseas Development Institute (ODI).

Since 2005, Malawi has offered subsidized fertilisers to all small farmers, helping improve harvests. Zambia has also ramped up its maize production, and built up a large national grain reserve which helped it in the current crisis, Wiggins said.

Keeping big food stocks is an old measure to prepare for drought, but it is also an expensive way to do it, he said.

Cheaper alternatives include buying options on commodity exchanges so, when the harvest fails, a country can buy food at a locked-in price, or keeping dollar reserves in an offshore account that can subsidize the cost of grain imports, he said.

Better forecasting can also play a role. Last year, meteorologists gave several months notice of the drought and warned of severe drought within a month of the planting season.

“One of the obvious things is (to say) don’t plant maize this time, plant sorghum, millet,” said Wiggins, while NGOs and governments can arrange imports and support for the most needy.

“In the world of better forecasts we should now be able to go into action a good three months earlier than we ever did in the past and thereby do a lot more good,” he said.","Fri, 09 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['food', 'forecasting', 'crops', 'hunger', 'drought', 'cycle', 'commodity', 'break', 'futures', 'wiggins', 'southern', 'maize', 'need', 'africas', 'farmers', 'needed', 'pakkala', 'africa']", ,drought

A range of climate- and health-related emergencies continue to affect Madagascar and pose serious risks for vulnerable children and their families. The ongoing El Niño weather phenomenon in southern Africa has resulted in lower than average rainfall in Madagascar, especially in the south, leaving 1.1 million people food insecure in 2018, including nearly 500,000 children.1 Due to evolving climatic stresses that have deepened food insecurity and made water increasingly scarce, an estimated 1.2 million people will be food insecure in 2019, including over 366,000 people facing emergency levels of food insecurity.2 The number of children suffering from acute malnutrition is set to increase, with the majority of cases expected to occur in the food insecure southern districts.3 Madagascar’s 2019 cyclone season will affect an estimated 270,000 people, including nearly 130,000 children.4 Health emergencies affecting Madagascar include the plague outbreak, as well as the recent measles outbreak, with some 15,000 measles cases reported as of December 2018, and 74 per cent of reported cases among children aged 1 to 14 years.5 In addition, socio-economic tensions are expected to increase following the 2018 general elections.

Humanitarian strategy

UNICEF will work with partners, including the Government of Madagascar and other United Nations agencies, to respond to the needs of emergency affected populations and mainstream humanitarian preparedness planning and response within the regular development programme. In 2019, UNICEF will provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in Madagascar, through a timely and effective integrated package of nutrition, health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection and education services, in collaboration with government line ministries and international/non-governmental organizations. UNICEF-supported mobile teams will continue to provide life-saving health and nutrition interventions in remote disaster-affected areas. In line with the Government’s national multihazard contingency plan, UNICEF’s cluster leadership6 will enable strategic planning, coordinated response, capacity building of partners and advocacy.7 UNICEF will ensure access to basic education during disasters through the provision of temporary learning spaces, teaching and learning materials and school rehabilitation and protection services for vulnerable children. Cash-based assistance and protection initiatives will be used to facilitate a quick response to disasters and prevent families from adopting negative coping mechanisms that give rise to malnutrition, child exploitation and school dropout. UNICEF will continue to support the Government to adapt its nutrition, health, WASH, child protection, education and social protection systems to humanitarian situations.8

Results from 2018

As of 31 October 2018, UNICEF had US$4.4 million available against the US$13.5 million 2018 appeal (33 per cent funded).9 Despite the 67 per cent funding gap, UNICEF was able to respond to emergencies on time by leveraging core funds and pre-positioning supplies for health, WASH and education. UNICEF worked closely with government counterparts to integrate humanitarian response with government disaster resilience systems. Nearly 9,900 children under 5 years with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) were admitted for treatment across the country. The roll-out of the nutrition surveillance system facilitated more effective targeting of SAM cases and the provision of SAM treatment. WASH targets were met through the effective pre-positioning of supplies and strong cluster leadership, and using carry-over funds and regular resources. The target for psychosocial support was not met due to the reduction in needs after the milder than anticipated cyclone season. Communication for development reached the maximum caseload through the effective coordination of communication activities through national and decentralized communication networks. Lessons learned from previous cyclone responses helped UNICEF and partners, including the Government, respond more quickly in 2018.","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1233454-2019-HAC-Madagascar.png?itok=XGIQQbxj,"['protection', 'food', 'including', 'million', '2018', 'madagascar', 'wash', 'humanitarian', '2019', 'action', 'unicef', 'health', 'children']", ,none

Madagascar faces a number of humanitarian challenges, including recurring natural disasters, disease outbreaks, banditry, pest infestations and acute food insecurity. According to the UN, 90 percent of the population lives below the international poverty line and more than 50 percent of children under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished.

Dry spells in 2018 have led to poor harvests and low food production, particularly in the south. Flooding caused by Cyclone Ava and severe tropical storm Eliakim further damaged crops. According to the June 2018 IPC analysis, approximately 1.26 million people will face Crisis (IPC 3)* or worse levels of food insecurity in the south and southeast regions of Madagascar from July to September 2018.

The nutritional situation in the south also remains worrisome. According 2018 nutrition surveys, two districts in the south, Amboasary and Ampanihy, have a global acute malnutrition (GAM) prevalence above 10 percent, exceeding the ""serious"" threshold established by the World Health Organization.

69,69,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Hundreds of thousands face starvation and death in Africa in the growing crisis no one is talking about - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/africa-drought-starvation-crisis-international-aid-zimbabwe-malawi-madagascar-horn-of-africa-a7493221.html,"During the drought that devastated the Horn of Africa in 2010 and 2011, women bound their waists with rope to deaden the pangs of hunger as they gave what little food they had to their children.

In stark contrast to such selfless acts, the international community stood back and watched until it was too late for the 260,000 people who starved to death.

Now aid workers are increasingly concerned that 2017 could see a tragedy on a similar scale with droughts – and floods – meaning some parts of southern and east Africa have not had a significant harvest for three years.

The Government is leading calls for the world to take effective action this time – just as right-wing politicians and newspapers call for David Cameron’s flagship pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on aid to be scrapped.

The Department for International Development (DfID) has already committed £362m in aid over this year and next, and is understood to be considering increasing its contribution further.

“As we enter 2017, over 37 million people across Africa are without food,” International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said in a statement sent to the Independent. “Families face losing their homes and livelihoods as the effects of widespread drought worsen.

“That is why ‘Global Britain’ is leading the response to the escalating crisis by providing life-saving food, water and shelter.”

Warning the crisis could force many people in the region to become refugees, Ms Patel appealed to other countries to “step up to prevent people from going hungry”.

“Tackling the global challenges of our time such as drought and disease which fuel migration, insecurity and instability is the right thing to do and is firmly in Britain’s interest,” she said.

A source in the international aid community told The Independent that there was a danger of a repeat of “the desperate conditions and extreme hunger that killed hundreds of thousands in 2010”.

“Certain population groups are now in the third year of having very limited household input,” the source said.

“They will have already sold off household assets, livestock will have died or are likely to be unhealthy and not productive.

“That’s when you start to see changes in mortality that we shouldn’t be seeing in populations.”

The source said during the previous drought “there was an issue around a slow response by the system” and efforts had been made since then to try to pick up on the warning signs sooner.

But, with the world focused on events in the Middle East, the current refugee crisis, Brexit and the US presidency, there are fears an unfolding disaster could go unnoticed once again.

The problem has been caused by a particularly severe El Niño weather system, a natural recurring effect that has been exacerbated by climate change. While the El Niño has ended, there are suggestions that the next harvest could be in trouble.

Rebecca Sutton, Oxfam’s global El Niño campaign manager, said: “The vegetation cover index in parts of the Horn of Africa area is lower now than it was at this stage in the 2010/11 drought. That indicator is looking worse now than it was then.

“With drought, it’s a slow-onset crisis. It doesn’t attract media coverage and very unpleasant pictures of people and animals in a very bad way come only once it’s way too late.

“By the time you get headline media coverage, things are extremely bad and way too many people have suffered more than they needed to.”

She praised the UK Government, saying it had “responded quite well to this crisis”, but warned that “something of this scale is more than a handful of donors can deal with”.

As part of its aid package, DfID has now given £16.9m to Unicef to help countries in southern Africa, which are approaching the “peak of the lean system”, the United Nations aid agency said in a statement.

It said this year had seen the “worst El-Niño induced drought in decades”, and the money would be used for “life-saving interventions to prevent the escalation of malnutrition and child illness or death in Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe”.

Increasing numbers of children have been dropping out of school due to a lack of water or more pressing problems at home, Unicef said, while all four countries were seeing outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea.

The money will allow 456,000 children to be checked for severe, acute malnutrition and more than 65,000 to be treated for several common diseases. A further 194,000 people will get access to safe drinking water.

Leila Gharagozloo-Pakkala, Unicef’s regional director for eastern and southern Africa, said: “As already vulnerable children and their families enter another lean season, these funds are critical for helping them to cope with the ongoing impacts of this chronic emergency.

“We greatly appreciate – and applaud – DfID for leading the way in ensuring that communities are significantly supported to become further resilient to the recurrent climatic crises we are seeing across much of the region.”","Sat, 24 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/05/22/zimbabwe-drought-ap-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['hundreds', 'crisis', 'rising', 'drought', 'aid', 'face', 'growing', 'pictures', 'gestalten', 'way', 'death', '2016', 'thousands', 'starvation', 'africa', 'talking', 'photography']", ,drought

Madagascar is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Situated in the southwest of the Indian Ocean and separated from the southeast coast of Africa by the Mozambique Channel, the country has recorded 50 natural disasters over the past 37 years. These have cumulatively affected more than 12 million people and caused an estimated 1 billion USD in damages.

Madagascar is hit by an average of 1.5 cyclones per year. Cyclones are often accompanied by torrential rains and floods, threatening lives and community livelihoods. Some regions of the country are also vulnerable to severe droughts and epidemics such as plague.

Madagascar is ranked amongst the world’s poorest countries. Chronic food insecurity and malnutrition are inherent, and more than 50% of the population lives below the poverty line .

At the national level, the Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes(BNGRC) is the highest authority in place to coordinate risk reduction and disaster response activities. In addition to the role of emergency response coordination lead in Madagascar, the government body is also responsible for implementing activities primarily aimed at promoting disaster resilience of vulnerable Malagasy communities across the country.

Madagascar is exposed to a variety of weather and climate phenomena that have wide-ranging impacts on human health and safety, natural resource availability, economic activities, and homes and other infrastructure. Southern Madagascar frequently experiences drought, while the northeastern regions of the island are predominantly exposed to cyclones and heavy rainfall from November to April. In addition, significant migration to and between the capital and largest city, Antananarivo, rapidly expanding secondary cities, and emerging urban centers are outpacing municipal capacity to address existing vulnerabilities caused by years of political turmoil and widespread poverty. Despite the commitment to decentralization from the national to local governments articulated and reaffirmed in the Government of Madagascar’s laws and policies, technical and financial capacity to support urban management and delivery of basic services remains limited.

This assessment examines the institutional, legal, and regulatory environment, climate change adaptation (CCA) capacity (and urban management capacity more generally), and financial resources and mechanisms available to address adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) priorities in Madagascar’s growing cities.

KEY FINDINGS

• Explicit efforts to move adaptation forward are relatively new in Madagascar. Disaster risk management (DRM) has been the focus of relevant policy and activity on the ground, with priority given to disaster response and early recovery over preparedness and DRR.

• The functions of DRM, DRR, and CCA are distributed between government agencies at the national level. This siloed effect often causes confusion about roles and responsibilities and creates competition among national agencies for international climate finance.

• Years of political upheaval coupled with undercurrents of civil unrest have produced vague and sometimes conflicting guidance regarding the decentralized system of governance, including the appropriate governing structures, and their roles and responsibilities. Weak coordination between the national and local level constrain the ability of urban and peri-urban areas to adequately plan for, respond, and adapt to climate variability. These challenges stemming from the incomplete process of decentralization continue to be a topic of national debate.

• Accessing and interpreting localized weather and climate information is a challenge for municipalities with limited climate change expertise. In addition to material and human resource constraints, the channel for relaying weather and climate data from local stations to Antananarivo for analysis by the national meteorological agency is inefficient and incomplete.

• The practice of local development planning is inconsistent and varies widely across Madagascar’s municipalities. Local plans are often developed by consultants when municipalities can afford to engage them, resulting in plans that fail not only to articulate a strategic vision that resonates with residents, but also to propose feasible adaptation solutions and detailed budgets. The resultant plans are too vague to be a useful framework for local development and improved resilience.

• The realities of limited capacity and finance as well as the immensity of the challenges that Madagascar faces in providing for even the most basic development needs mean that the role of DRM, community development, and service provision is simply delegated to development partners working across the country, with little oversight from local governments.

• Supporting municipalities to identify options for collecting revenue, and accessing external resources and financing is a critical part of investing in urban resilience. Local governments collect only a fraction of their potential revenues due to an unclear legal framework, poor awareness and enforcement of tax and nontax revenue regulations, and challenges in tax collection. Capacity of municipalities to prepare proposals and provide financial and technical information to support grants or loans is extremely limited.

This FEWS NET Enhanced Market Analysis (EMA) report presents findings to inform regular market monitoring and analysis in southern Madagascar. The information can be used to support the design of food security programs, including but not limited to informing a United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bellmon determination in advance of an FY 2019 USAID Funded activity.

The Madagascar EMA involved a mixed-method approach, combining the collection, review, and analysis of primary and secondary data from various stakeholders. Primary data were collected through a field assessment between June 24 and July 8, 2018, by a team of FEWS NET staff and international and local consultants, supported by local guides. The team met with stakeholders in Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa, and the prioritized areas of interest (AOI) in Atsimo-Andrefana and Androy Regions (“Grand Sud”) and Vatovavy Fitovinany and Atsimo-Atsinanana Regions (“Sud Est”) (Figure 2). The EMA assessment was done in the context of longstanding arid drought conditions in the Grand Sud and at least one cyclone per year in the Sud Est.

The EMA analyses five main commodities; rice, sorghum, pulses, edible oil, and Corn Soya Blend (CSB), henceforth referred to as the focus commodities. A relatively coarser analysis was undertaken for other staple foods and wild foods, as relevant by region. Livestock (meat and milk) markets were analyzed in Androy and Atsimo-Andrefana regions and fish markets were analyzed in Vatovavy Fitovinany, Atsimo-Atsinanana, and Androy regions.

The findings indicate that several modalities are likely feasible at scale as part of a future program across the AOI in Madagascar. These include: In-kind Title II assistance in the form of rice, pulses, edible oil, and Corn Soya Blend; cash transfers (including vouchers) in areas with easily accessible and well-supplied markets, adequate beneficiary (vendor) capacity, and access to financial services; and food-for-assets (FFA)/cash-for-assets (CFA) in areas where community asset needs can be met through such activities.

Crop sales and casual agricultural labor are among the most prominent income sources among poor and very poor households across the AOI. Agricultural production in the Grand Sud is composed mainly of staple food production (e.g., cassava and maize), while agricultural production in the Sud Est is more diverse and includes cash crops (e.g., banana, coffee, litchi, cloves, vanilla). More regular and diverse casual labor opportunities exist in the Sud Est, contributing up to 30–50 percent of annual cash income there, versus 15–30 percent in the Grand Sud.

Household expenditures follow seasonal patterns and are similar across the AOI. Food purchases are highest during the lean period from October to March (August to March for the poorest households) and account for 50–80 percent of average annual expenditures in the AOI. Health expenses are notable from February to June when malaria and waterborne diseases are more common. Social ceremonies such as funerals take place throughout the year but are most common September and October in the Grand Sud. Circumcisions, another important social ceremony, typically take place between June and August.

Rice is the main staple food in Madagascar, but actual household consumption varies across the AOI based on accessibility and/or availability. Important localized consumption patterns arise based on local production and price trends. In the Grand Sud, households typically consume yellow maize, dried cassava, sweet potato, and cowpeas. Beef (zebu) and goat meat are the most consumed animal protein, although eaten in small quantities and on rare occasions. Households in the Sud Est consume local rice (including red and white varieties), substituting imported rice when local rice is scarce and relatively more expensive; fresh cassava (available year-round); and white beans (substituted with cowpeas when prices increase). Fish is the most consumed animal protein according to household surveys.

The self-sufficiency status of the AOI varies by commodity and by region. The entire AOI is structurally deficit in terms of rice, relying on imports from other areas of the country and international markets to fill local gaps. Maize and cassava production from both southern and central Madagascar (Ambovombe, Ambalavao, and Ankaramena in Haute Matsiatra Region) supply the Grand Sud. Sorghum production is minimal, and very limited quantities are sold on markets. Many varieties of pulses are produced and consumed in the AOI, such as white and red beans, mung beans, black-eyed peas, and cowpeas, among others, with minor localized preferences for one variety over another depending on the area. In general, cowpeas and black-eyed peas are more consumed in the Grand Sud whereas different varieties of pulses are consumed in the Sud Est. Local pulse production in the AOI is complemented by supplies from Toliara and Morondava in the Sud Est and Bekily and Toliara in the Grand Sud. Most households purchase imported, refined edible oil that is readily available on markets but not fortified.

A range of wild foods are commonly consumed by poor and very poor households in the AOI, providing between one to two months of total annual food consumption. In the Grand Sud, yellow cactus fruit is consumed in February and March, at the end of the lean season, contributing up to 30 percent of consumption during those specific months. Red cactus fruit and cactus leaves are consumed only as a coping mechanism. In the southeast, poor and very poor households consume both wild and cultivated breadfruit between January and June.

Artisanal, small-scale fishing takes place from September to March in the Sud Est. Lower-quality fish are consumed domestically either fresh, smoked, or dried and salted. Fish and seafood purchases account for, on average, 7 percent of annual household expenditure. Fish consumption in the Grand Sud is very limited as fishing is not common due to strong winds, cultural tendencies, and distance from the ocean in inland areas. Culturally, zebus are raised for breeding rather than consumption, as wealth is displayed by the number of cattle owned, particularly in the Grand Sud. Zebu are often the target of banditry in Madagascar, causing insecurity. Some poor households own zebu for manual labor (e.g., pulling carts and plowing fields). Many poor and very poor households raise goats, sheep, and chickens mainly as a source of income rather than for their own consumption. Few households in the AOI raise pigs. Households in the AOI spend up to 5 percent of annual expenditures on meat consumption, typically only for special occasions.

The Grand Sud and Sud Est face distinctly different hazards that result in food insecurity.

Households in the Grand Sud report prolonged dryness for the past 10 to 12 years, resulting in consecutive years of poor production. The Grand Sud has been classified as IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) or higher in more than 90 percent of FEWS NET analysis cycles in the past three years. The Sud Est suffers from cyclones from January to April, resulting in yearly flooding and destruction of infrastructure.

The availability of infrastructure and other supporting services necessary for the management and distribution of in-kind commodities is generally a challenge. Three main ports serve the AOI: Toamasina, serving the Sud Est, and Toliara and Taolagnaro, serving the Grand Sud. The Sud Est is also regularly served by the Port of Taolagnaro and in exceptional circumstances by Toliara. Delayed and lengthy berthing procedures are challenges faced at the Ports of Toamasina and Toliara. Insecurity is an issue on a few roads in the Grand Sud, particularly the RN 13. Road conditions deteriorate rapidly during the rainy season (November–March). Internal transport costs are high throughout the country, particularly in the Grand Sud and remote areas of the Sud Est. Insufficient trucking capacity and in-transit commodity losses due to poorly adapted packing were cited as common challenges in the Grand Sud. Implementing partners in Madagascar have a network of quality central delivery point (CDP) storage warehouses. Storage losses caused by pests and heat are common; humidity is an issue in the Sud Est specifically.

Financial service providers (FSPs) including commercial banks, microfinance institutions (MFI), and mobile money operators are present in the main towns of the AOI. Airtel money, Orange money, and Telma mVola are the main mobile carriers and money operators and have the greatest rural FSP presence, but often face connectivity and liquidity constraints in remote locations. The national post office (Paositra Malagasy) offers savings and money transfer services.

Madagascar lacks a current central food security policy, and the most up to date National Action Plan for Food Security dates to 2005. Cognizant that rice has far-reaching consequences for food access, imported rice has been VAT-exempt since 2005. The Government of Madagascar (GoM) establishes price limits for imported rice in consultation with the private sector, but they are not frequently enforced beyond urban areas. Specific government ministries and bodies involved in the implementation of food assistance activities include: The National Office of Risk and Catastrophe Management for emergency programs; the Ministry of Population, Social Protection and Women Empowerment for cash transfer and social protection activities; and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries for agriculture-related programs. The Action Plan for Rural Development (PADR), the National Office of Nutrition (ONN), and the Development Intervention Fund (FID) are involved in development food assistance programs.","Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1227999-Madagascar_EMA_Report_20180930_508%20compliant.png?itok=hSdRP02I,"['food', 'poor', 'households', 'production', 'analysis', '2018', 'sud', 'market', 'madagascar', 'rice', 'grand', 'est', 'consumed', 'aoi', 'enhanced']", ,flood

Climate Risks increasing worldwide - even for High-Income-Countries

Global Climate Risk Index: Japan and Germany hit hardest by heat waves and drought in 2018 / Philippines on rank 2 struck by tropical cyclones / Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti with highest weather-related losses 1999 - 2018 / Nearly 500,000 people killed as a result of more than 12,000 extreme weather events that caused 3.5 trillion US-Dollars in damages

Madrid (4th Dec. 2019). Severe heat waves, drought and flooding: Extreme weather events are massive challenges especially for poor and vulnerable countries - but also high-income countries are threatened more and more by climate risks. The Global Climate Risk Index, published today by the environmental think tank Germanwatch, shows that in 2018 industrialized countries like Japan and Germany were hit hardest by heat waves and severe drought. The Philippines were hit by the most powerful typhoon recorded worldwide in 2018.

Looking at the years from 1999 to 2018, poor countries had to face much higher impacts: Seven of the ten countries most affected in this period are developing countries with low or lower middle income per capita. Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti were most affected, according to this long-term index. In the past 20 years, globally nearly 500,000 fatalities were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events. The economic damages amounted to approximately US-Dollars 3.54 trillion (calculated in purchasing-power parity, PPP).

""The Climate Risk Index shows that climate change has disastrous impacts especially for poor countries, but also causes increasingly severe damages in industrialized countries like Japan or Germany"", says David Eckstein of Germanwatch. ""Countries like Haiti, Philippines and Pakistan are repeatedly hit by extreme weather events and have no time to fully recover. That underlines the importance of reliable financial support mechanisms for poor countries like these not only in climate change adaptation, but also for dealing with climate-induced loss and damage.""

Renato Redentor Constantino, Executive Director of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (Philippines), adds: ""Those who are least responsible for the problem, are the ones who are suffering the most. This is unacceptable.""

Heat waves were one major cause of damage in 2018. Of the ten most affected countries last year, Germany, Japan and India were suffering from extended periods of heat. Recent science has confirmed the long established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat. In Europe, for example, extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago. Furthermore, due to a lack of data, impacts of heatwaves on the African continent may be under-represented.

""The climate summit needs to address the so far lacking of additional climate finance to help poorest people and countries in dealing with losses and damages. They are hit hardest by climate change impacts because they lack the financial and technical capacity to deal with the losses and damages"", Laura Schaefer of Germanwatch emphasizes. ""The climate conference therefore needs to result in a decision to regularly determine the support needs of vulnerable countries for future damages. Furthermore COP25 has to decide upon necessary steps to generate reliable financial resources to meet these needs. Nevertheless, implementation of adaptation to climate change must be strengthened too.""

About Global Climate Risk Index:

Germanwatch receives its data for annually calculating the Global Climate Risk Index from the NatCatSERVICE database of the reinsurance company Munich Re, as well as the socio-economic data of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Even though the evaluation of the rising damages and fatalities do not allow for simple conclusions on the influence of climate change on these events, it shows the increase of heavy disasters and does give a good impression of the affectedness of states and territories. Since 2006, Germanwatch has presented the index at the annual UN climate.","Thu, 05 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1418473-20-2-01e%20Global%20Climate%20Risk%20Index%202020_10.png?itok=BUzrubHd,"['index', 'climate', 'events', 'hit', 'global', '2020', 'risk', 'damages', 'change', 'heat', 'world', 'extreme', 'countries']", ,flood_and_drought
77,77,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Report on the RIASCO Action Plan for the El Niño-induced drought in Southern Africa 2016/2017 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/report-riasco-action-plan-el-ni-o-induced-drought-southern-africa-20162017,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

El Niño conditions during the 2015/16 planting season caused Southern Africa’s worst drought in 35 years, representing a second consecutive failed harvest. This created severe food and water shortages and compounded existing vulnerabilities in all humanitarian sectors. While governments led the response, the scale of needs overwhelmed national capacity. Five countries declared national emergencies: Lesotho (22 December 2015), Zimbabwe (04 February 2016), Swaziland (18 February 2016) and Malawi (13 April 2016). Mozambique declared a Red Alert (12 April 2016), while Madagascar issued a message of solidarity (26 August 2016); All called for urgent international assistance.

Members of the Southern Africa Regional Inter-Agency Standing Committee (RIASCO) deployed staff to the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC)’s El Niño Logistics and Coordination Team (established in May 2016) to provide technical assistance. On 26 July 2016 SADC declared a regional emergency and launched a 13-country, US$2.4 billion appeal to assist 41 million El Niño-affected Southern Africans. In support of SADC’s appeal, RIASCO launched its Action Plan on 27 July, which was revised in December 2016. The Action Plan prioritized seven countries: Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

The Action Plan was based on three pillars: a humanitarian pillar, setting out immediate needs in the seven priority countries; a resilience pillar undertaken in parallel to humanitarian efforts; and a macro-economic pillar, which sets out policy options for governments to address the long-term impacts. The plan requested $1.3 billion to provide humanitarian assistance (pillar 1) for 13.8 million people up to April 2017, of which $900 million has been received (70 per cent).

Critical funds from international donors including USAID, DFID, ECHO, CERF and the Governments of China and Japan enabled a significant humanitarian response, especially in stabilizing regional food security. National and international NGOs, as well as the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and local Red Cross societies, played an indispensable role in the response. With the concerted efforts of governments and the humanitarian community, more than 10.6 million people were reached with food assistance at the peak of the response (January to April 2017). More than 360,000 children under age 5 with acute malnutrition were admitted for treatment, and 1.5 million people were provided with safe water. Coordination among various partners enabled the provision of emergency education programming, such as school meals and life-saving messaging on hygiene practices. Education and Protection partners collaboratively achieved significant results for 451,000 children, demonstrating the key role the sectors play in promoting resilience and disaster risk reduction (DRR). With hopes pinned on an agricultural recovery, more than 1.6 million drought-affected households were reached with programmes to boost agricultural production.

With climate change predicted to bring more frequent and intense natural disasters to the region, the RIASCO Action Plan included a range of practical options to build resilience, based on the idea that while droughts cannot be prevented from occurring, they should not result in humanitarian emergencies. These options included the development of sound national policies and strategies, expanded and strengthened social safety nets, promotion of climate smart agriculture, reinforced early warning systems and improved management of water and other natural resources. These must be combined with solid risk management and fiscal instruments at national and regional levels. A $150 million World Bank project in Botswana to protect water sources is a current example; as well as the recent availability of longer term disaster risk insurance products.","Wed, 12 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/903924-report_on_the_riasco_action_plan_2016-2017_july2017.png?itok=QxUj3QGr,"['water', 'el', 'drought', 'million', 'regional', 'national', 'report', 'plan', 'response', 'pillar', 'southern', 'riasco', 'humanitarian', '2016', 'action', 'niñoinduced', 'world', 'africa']", ,drought

Poor rainfall distribution since the beginning of the Short-Rains season has caused large moisture deficits in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

Insufficient rainfall since October has resulted in early-season drought across South Africa, Lesotho, and Botswana.

Several weeks of poor rainfall have caused dryness in central and western Madagascar.

Highlights

Climate change is affecting daily life in ways previously unimagined. Across the world, extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, heat waves and storms are getting more severe and frequent. This is having a devastating impact on living conditions in many parts of the world, particularly where the world's poorest and most vulnerable children live.

With its extensive coastline and location in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar is especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and natural disasters. It is also one of the world's poorest nations, with just over three quarters of the population living in extreme poverty. The country continues to rank at the bottom of many international child and maternal indices, with children and families facing multiple deprivations in well-being and living

81,81,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Water carriers in Madagascar bear brunt of global crisis - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2017-03-carriers-madagascar-brunt-global-crisis.html,"Water carrier LŽo (left) fills up a jerrycan in Antananarivo. Campaign group WATERAID says 65 percent of Madagascar's rural population live without access to clean water

As usual, they get up before dawn and, one by one, place their cans in a neat row at the base of the water pump, ready for another long day of waiting and carrying.

For the water carriers of Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, distributing water is a daily physical struggle that has been worsened by regional drought and climate change.

""Today I arrived here at 5:00 am. It is now 8:30 am and I have only been able to fill two cans,"" Olivia Hanitriniaina Razafinirina, 24, told AFP, ahead of World Water Day on Wednesday.

""Water is life. People need water every day, if there is none everyone suffers.""

For the last 10 years, Razafinirina has been heaving water through the slums of the city.

Across the poverty-stricken and undeveloped island of Madagascar, drinking tap water at home is a luxury only few can afford.

After a long wait, Razafinirina fills her two 20-litre (five-US gallon) cans at the unreliable water pump and descends into the maze of cobbled streets of the Andranomanalina Isotry district of the city.

Carrying the heavy cans, she delivers them to shops, businesses and homes.

Some days she will make 20 trips to the public pump and back—carrying a total of 800 litres of water, and leaving her no time to linger with her customers before rushing back to join the long line.

On a good day, Razafinirina will earn just about $1.20 (1.30 euro) in local currency.

Water carrier LŽo, 38, has been doing the job for 13 years. Daily wages for such people can be around $1.20

""It just allows me to buy something to eat, some rice to cook. There is no other work,"" she said.

Despite such dire pay, water carriers play a crucial role in Madagascar.

""Only 10 percent of households have a water supply in their house,"" said senior district official Jean Marc Randriamanga.

""Everyone else must get their water from the pump because there are no wells here.""

Water is life

Even at the pump, a small fee must be paid for water, further weighing on the scant resources of local people.

""The price is still expensive, considering the purchasing power of people here,"" said Randriamanga.

The money goes to the Madagascan utilities company and the local water association, which are jointly responsible for maintaining the supply network and each pump.

""In total, 134 people use this connection,"" said Sabine Raharimalala, head of the local Tsimialonjafy water users association.

Despite the pumps and the daily exertions of the water carriers, Madagascar is one of the world's worst countries for rural access to clean water.

People stand beside 20 litre jerrycans waiting to be filled at a public fountain during a period when the public water supply has been cut off, in the Isotry district of Antananarivo

A WaterAid report released to mark World Water Day said that Papua New Guinea, Madagascar and Mozambique are at the bottom of the table.

In Papua New Guinea, 67 percent of rural people live without access to clean water, in Madagascar it is 65 percent and Mozambique 63 percent.

All three are among the nations most vulnerable to climate change and that are least ready to adapt, the report said.

""It is largely due to lack of funding provided for the needs of drinking water,"" WaterAid's Lovy Rasolofomanana told AFP, saying about $9 million is spent each year when $200 million is required to achieve ""universal access"".

""We lose 14,000 children each year to diarrhoea,"" he said, revealing the grim toll of the island's extreme poverty.

""Lack of water causes so much illness due to poor sanitation.""

Severe drought over recent years has also left Madagascar in a food crisis, with nearly a million people hungry and in urgent need of food aid in the south of the island alone, according to the World Food Programme.

Back at the water pump in Antananarivo, the flow slowed to a tickle as the supply network struggled to cope.

A can left in line at 10:00 am will not be full until 3:00 pm.

KEY MESSAGES

• An outbreak of Fall Army Worm (FAW, Spodoptera Frigiperda) is affecting maize production with the MoA and FAO reporting an estimated 60 percent infestation rate nationwide, based on data from a small sample (61 sites) collected early in the production season. Yields are expected to reduce by 47 percent, which will impact cereal availability and livestock profitability.

• Around 16,000 MT of imported rice were sold by local authorities at the subsidized price of 1,000 Ariary per kilo, 40 percent of market price, in March/April 2019 in Antananarivo, which allowed each household to purchase up to 3 kilos to help to alleviate the stress of the lean season. Additional imported rice is expected to arrive in Tulear within the next few months to be sold in the more vulnerable southern regions.

• Livestock herd sizes are gradually increasing in southern Madagascar with the current slow improvement of food availability compared to previous months, and People are starting to save and to restore their livestock. The availability of green pastures also encourages pastoralists to return to these areas. At the same time, the price of livestock is stabilizing. Cattle thefts are resurfacing in southern rural areas now that livestock body conditions have improved.

• According to the first round of the VAC Assessment, undertaken in early April, the main sources of income in the South are currently typical, like sales of agricultural products, sales of animals and sales of charcoal. Nevertheless, most households still adopt stress coping strategies to meet their food needs such as harvesting cassava before maturation.

• Most parts of Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24) are in Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) with the exception of Beloha that remains in Crisis (IPC Phase 3!) with the important contribution of humanitarian assistance. Food consumption in Mahafaly Plain: Cassava, Goats and Cattle (MG 23) also improved for very poor households with the new harvests and recent rains and are experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) acute food insecurity. In the Southeast: coffee, litchis, cassava (MG 19), and in Rice and lima bean - Tulear II (MG20), the situation will likely remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity from April-May. For other households throughout Madagascar, Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity is expected.","Wed, 01 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1286333-Madagascar_FSOU_Avr2019_Final.png?itok=mQoYSHnf,"['food', 'update', 'livestock', 'ipc', 'stressed', 'security', 'phase', 'madagascar', 'sales', 'southern', 'cassava', 'outlook', 'rice', '2019', 'price']", ,none
83,83,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar: African Development Bank helps transform agricultural production methods - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-african-development-bank-helps-transform-agricultural-production,"It's market day in Tsianisiha, a rural town in the district of Toliara in south-west Madagascar. In the central square, the stalls are overflowing with the thousands of products that attract an ever-greater throng of shoppers every Monday. And for good reason: in just five years, Tsianisiha has been completely transformed, much to the benefit of its inhabitants.

""Since they built the secondary irrigation channels and concreted the old ones, agricultural production has doubled or even tripled,"" said Mr Mamanjisoa, the mayor of this large market town with some 20,000 inhabitants and which each Monday welcomes members of the Federation of Water User Associations, among whose interests the management and upkeep of the irrigation canals feature prominently.

The commercial activity of Mr Razafimandimby, president of the Federation, epitomises the stunning agricultural growth in the region of Atsimo-Andrefana. Mr Razafimandimby practises crop rotation on his five-hectare plot: rice, lima beans, cassava, maize and cotton. And with increased quantities of irrigation water supplying his plot more often, he has been able to double his production. In under five years, for example, he has passed the threshold of two tonnes of maize per year. While half of his production goes to feed his family and to anticipate future contingencies, the other half is sold to buy livestock - the Madagascar farmers’ preferred way to save . With his additional income, he has been able to send his children to school in Tsianisiha.

Toliara district can boast many success stories like Mr Razafimandimby's. They are the result of the funding programme launched in 2013 by the African Development Bank with the goal of improving local agricultural infrastructure. At the time, the Bank had two goals: the first was to compensate for the budget cuts made by the Malagasy Government that particularly hit the poorest after Madagascar’s political crisis between 2009 and 2013; the second was to mitigate the impacts of the region's extreme vulnerability to climate change.

By the end of December 2018, the district of Toliara had 74 km of canals and 40 km of protective dykes covering 5,800 hectares of irrigated land, as well as three warehouses.

To support this expansion of local agriculture and to reduce poverty, the African Development Bank also financed the refurbishment of a 107 km section of the RN9 highway. Since then, Tsianisiha has been just an hour and a half's drive from the neighbouring town of Analamisampy. Before the refurbishment work, it took up to five hours to travel between the two towns. ""Since the renovation of the RN9, not only can we sell our products faster, but we can also accommodate more traders and carriers,"" said the chair of the town council, Mr Mamanjisoa.

The three warehouses are used to store large equipment and production offered for sale in a particularly innovative way. Thanks to recommendations made by the African Development Bank, women's groups obtained exclusive management rights, promoting the empowerment and emancipation of women in the region.

Délicia Zaname, president of the Tsianisiha warehouse management committee, elected by its 45 member associations, can vouch for this. Her quality of life has improved, but especially as a woman her responsibilities have transformed her:

""Before, I wasn't thought of as anyone in particular, and I didn't talk to anyone. Now, I negotiate with the men and protect the interests of the warehouse. I feel stronger,""

she said, not without a certain pride, adding,

""And I can send my children to school too, because it is school that will help them to develop.""

The warehouses are managed in a participative manner: the district's farmers are required to pay a contribution - a few euros per year - to the women's groups for storing their produce or equipment in the three warehouses at Tsianisiha, Tsiafanoka and Ankilimaliniky. All three sites are managed in the same way: the warehouse's member associations elect a 6-woman management committee, responsible for the upkeep and management of the warehouses.

84,84,DR-2020-000231-MDG,More than 200 elephants in Zimbabwe die as drought crisis deepens - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/drought-kills-more-than-200-elephants-in-zimbabwe,"Hundreds of elephants and tens of lions in Zimbabwe will be moved by the country’s wildlife agency as part of a major operation to save the animals from a devastating drought.

More than 200 elephants have died over the last two months due to a lack of water at the country’s main conservation zones in Mana Pools and Hwange National Park.

Residents of Jutshume village, near to Hwange National Park, shared a video of an elephant calf that had fallen into a well last month after desperately searching for water. Residents managed to rescue the calf, which later fled into the wild, but believe its leg was broken in the process.

A second adult elephant, which had collapsed near to the village, was fed by residents until it was strong enough to walk.

Animals near to Jutshume village, by the border with Botswana, used to drink from the Maitengwe dam, known locally as Mabhongane or “roaring lion”. But the wall of the dam collapsed in 2005 and has not been repaired, leaving stretches of barren land.

The country’s wildlife agency plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lion, a pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalo, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impala, according to reports by Agence France-Presse.

Parks and wildlife authority spokesperson Tinashe Farawo told AFP that the operation will begin during rainy season, when pastures flourish, usually around the middle of November. Farawo described the mission as “the biggest translocation in our history”.

The animals will be moved from Savé Valley Conservancy, a major park in southeastern Zimbabwe, to three other reserves in the north of the country.

Conservation experts have warned that the country could lose more elephants to drought if there are not enough rains this season.

A recent drought has left more than five million rural Zimbabweans, nearly a third of the population, at risk of food shortages before the next harvest in 2020, according to the UN.

Zimbabwe has 85,000 elephants but the country’s national parks and conservation areas can only cope with 55,000. Grazing lands and water have fast depleted as the country is experiencing its worst drought in years.

Charles Jonga, director of Campfire, a leading conservation organisation, says the El Niño induced drought had worsened the already dire water situation in the country’s parks.

Farawo said the wildlife agency was in dire need of water pumping equipment to save the elephants. “We are in desperate need of resources to provide water. We are desperately waiting for the rains.”

Wildlife lovers have donated bails of hay for elephants in a bid to save the world’s largest land mammal.

Many desperate animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water, a situation that has increased human–wildlife conflict.

Over the past five years, 200 people have reportedly died in “human–and–animal conflict”.

“We are likely to lose even more elephants, especially if the rains are late. The world must know that Hwange relies on underground water, and it has never been easy for parks to maintain this overpopulated park,” Jonga said.

Zimbabwe and other southern African nations have been calling on the global watchdog to relax terms of wildlife trade.

But Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia’s fresh appeal to lift restrictive measures on the trade in raw ivory was rejected at a conference held by Cites, the watchdog, this August. Cities prohibits unregulated commercial trade in endangered species around the world.","Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2223a7268e13a44a978b2d34a6c4d35dafe0d4d9/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0adae7bf6b615b5c2a90ab26adafeafc,"['elephants', 'save', 'water', 'wildlife', 'village', 'crisis', 'drought', 'countrys', 'park', 'die', '200', 'parks', 'deepens', 'zimbabwe']", ,drought

Key Messages

Imported rice prices in April stabilized or decreased compared to March throughout Madagascar. Particularly in the South: Ampanihy, Betioky and Tulear II, local authorities have sold subsidized imported rice at 300 Ariary per cup since early May. This is 40 percent below the market price, which is 500 Ariary. Each household is able to purchase up to 10 cups (approximately 3kg), but unfortunately this only contributes to 2 percent of the average monthly food needs of a very poor or poor household.

The main rice harvest in underway and production is expected to be better than last year particularly in the Southwest and Southern Highlands of Madagascar due to favorable rainfall. Rice production in western Madagascar is expected to be similar to last year, despite local rainfall deficits, because rice fields benefitted from water from dams in northern regions where rainfall was near normal. Maize and pulse harvests are completed, and production is better than last year and near normal in the Southwest because of near normal rainfall. The wetness of the season also reduced the impacts of fall armyworm. Cassava and sweet potatoes are still growing, and production is expected to be near normal.

Cattle body conditions are good, and farmers are restoring their herds. Few livestock sales are reported due to the improvement of food availability – as a result, livestock prices are increasing. On average in April/May, a cow cost 750,000 MGA, a goat 100,000 MGA and a sheep 120,000 MGA. Those prices are around 50 percent higher than in early 2019 and 20 percent higher than in last quarter of 2018. Cattle are mainly eating sweet potato leaves and dried maize leaves as pasture starts to be dry.

Overall, poor and very poor households in Mahafaly Plain: Cassava, Goats and Cattle (MG 23) are experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) acute food insecurity due to the harvests and the effects of humanitarian assistance from WFP and ASOTRY programming that covers more than 80 percent of households in their areas of intervention. Nevertheless, a minority is still adopting more drastic coping strategies such as migrating. Around 20 displaced households who left their villages during the 2018 drought period remain in the Chef-lieu of Ampanihy, though ground partners report that their numbers have decreased since January/February 2019. The men mainly worked as agricultural laborers while their women mainly sell cactus at 50 Ariary the pile of 5 pieces.

Households in Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24) are in Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) in May 2019, expect Beloha where the situation is worse following failed maize harvests due to FAW infestation. In the Southeast: coffee, litchis, cassava (MG 19), and in Rice and lima bean - Tulear II (MG20), the situation remains in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity. Other households throughout Madagascar are experiencing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity.","Sat, 18 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1297473-Madagascar%20-%20Key%20Message%20Update_%20Fri%2C%202019-05-17.png?itok=VyWQSmhH,"['food', 'update', 'rainfall', 'message', 'production', 'phase', 'prices', 'madagascar', 'maize', 'near', 'rice', '2019', 'key', 'poor']", ,drought

Despite these events, deadlier or costlier disasters in Asia and North America often overshadow disasters in Africa. However, with a rapidly growing population and increasing impact of climate change, the disaster impact in Africa will likely increase in the coming decades. Therefore, CRED Crunch 56 will focus on disasters across the African continent in the past 20 years.

With over 50 countries across approximately 30 million square kilometers of land, the threat of natural hazards in Africa varies greatly by geography and season. Figure 1 demonstrates the type of disaster that affects the highest number of people in each African country. Regions of southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel have been most affected by drought, while much of central Africa and western Africa has been most affected by floods. Countries in south-eastern Africa (some of which are not featured on the map) face an annual cyclone season leaving them most affected by storms.

Although disasters occur across the entire continent, some countries are more affected than others. Since 2000, Kenya (60 events), Mozambique (55 events), and South Africa (54 events) experienced the highest number of disasters as they regularly face storms, droughts, and flooding. The 3 most populated subSaharan countries, Nigeria (49 events), Ethiopia (43 events), and D.R. Congo (41 events), also fall into the top 10. In terms of death tolls, as seen in Figure 2, Somalia ranks first primarily as a result of the 2010 drought, while Algeria ranks second with most deaths occurring from a single earthquake.

As seen in Figure 3, floods and droughts were the most prevalent and impactful type of disasters on the continent. From 2000-2019, floods were responsible for 64% of disaster events, followed by storms at 15%. Unlike other continents, such as Asia, earthquakes and volcanoes are not prominent types of disasters. As well, due to relatively poor health surveillance, the impacts of extreme temperatures are considered to be under reported.

So far in this century, droughts have been the deadliest disaster type, followed by floods. In fact, most of the drought deaths can be attributed to a single event, namely the one in Somalia in 2010 when approximately 20,000 people died. This drought, along with the Somali Civil War, lead to a famine declaration due to high mortality and malnutrition.

In terms of people affected, droughts make up by far the largest share of disasters in Africa. This figure may be attributed to various climatic and geographic features, as well as the reliance on rain-fed agriculture by large portion of the population in low resource rural areas. The most impactful drought events so far this century by number of people affected were the 2003 and 2004 South African drought (15 million & 12.6 million people affected respectively), 2015 Ethiopian drought (10.2 million people affected), and 2009 Niger drought (7.9 million people affected).

In recent years the share of global events, deaths, and people affected occurring in Africa has risen; as seen in figure 4.

This trend will likely continue as Africa’s share of the global population rises from approximately 13% in the year 2000 to 26% by 2050 (1). In absolute terms, the population of Africa is projected to increase from the current 1.3 billion inhabitants to 2.5 billion by 2050, thus nearly doubling the potential population affected by disasters (1). Additionally, rapid growth in population increases the likelihood of urbanization in areas exposed to natural hazards and resource shortages. In addition to population growth, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2) has stated that Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced more frequent and intense climate extremes in previous decades as a result of climate change, a trend that is likely to continue as the impacts of climate change intensifies. Regions across the continent are expected to face increased extreme temperatures, droughts, and increases in heavy rainfall (2).","Mon, 18 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1404848-CredCrunch56.png?itok=PXRzCIUz,"['review', 'events', 'continent', 'affected', 'drought', 'million', 'issue', 'cred', 'figure', 'population', 'droughts', 'newsletter', 'crunch', '2019', '56', 'world', 'africa', 'disasters']", ,flood_and_drought
87,87,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Madagascar embarks on multi-sectoral nutrition mapping with the support from the UN Network for SUN - Madagascar - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-embarks-multi-sectoral-nutrition-mapping-support-un-network-sun,"Nearly one in two children under five years old suffer from chronic malnutrition in Madagascar, according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report. Malnutrition is more prevalent in some parts of the country due to economic disparities, lack of resources and increased poverty. For example, children in the highlands are most affected by stunting, where levels exceed 60 percent (UNICEF Country Profile, Madagascar, 2016). To put that into perspective, consider that such levels more than double the highest public health threshold set at 30 percent. The costs associated with stunting represent 14.5 percent of the country’s GDP according to estimates of the Cost of Hunger study (2016). This nutritional situation remains a concern for the most vulnerable populations and contributes to the persistence of poverty.

To combat this issue, the Government of Madagascar has long been committed to a multi-sectoral approach at the highest level since its early adherence to the SUN Movement in February 2012. For the first time, nutrition has been included in the ‘*Plan Emergence’*, a strategic document of the General Policy of the State that will soon be released. The National Office of Nutrition (ONN) is responsible for monitoring the inclusive implementation of the National Nutrition Policy (PNN) and its Nutrition Action Plan (PNAN). Its attachment to the Prime Minister makes it an institution particularly well-placed to coordinate and monitor the contribution of different sectors to nutrition, provided that ONN has the tools and means to do so.

Within this framework, the ONN made a request for technical assistance on the UNNNAM III (Nutrition Action Plan III – 2017-2021) to help ensure that its implementation is on track, looking to the UN Network Secretariat. Madagascar joined a list of 25 other countries which have undertaken the Nutrition Stakeholder and Action Mapping exercise to gage the coverage levels of nutrition actions on the path to scale up. Additionally, this was the first time that Japan financed a UNN-supported mapping exercise.

The mapping will bring an accountability framework putting beneficiaries at the center of programs and actions. It is also catalyzing capacity building at the sub-national level with the participation and training of more than 50 M&E regional assistants. “Mapping addresses the need to involve and build the capacity of decentralized institutions for strong multi-sector coordination from the community to the central level,” said Dr. Lucie Solofonirina, National Coordinator of the ONN and SUN Government Focal Point after the launching workshop in Antananarivo.

The multi-sectoral approach of the mapping included 27 actions that engage sectors including health, agriculture, WASH and social protection. The national mapping team included technical focal points from the ONN, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, National Institute for Geography and Hydrography, National Statistics Institute as well as UN colleagues from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP). This not only ensures ownership of the exercise but also helps to institutionalize the mapping within government institutions.

The first phase took place over 6 days, in late August 2019, including all stakeholders involved in the field of nutrition in Madagascar. More than 100 participants attended the launching workshop, where technical and financial partners undertook a prioritization exercise to identify which nutrition actions would be mapped. The process was initiated by the National Coordinator of the ONN, the Deputy Secretary of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Country Representative of WFP and the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of UNICEF. A mapping specialist from the UN Network Secretariat travelled to Antananarivo to join these actors and introduce workshop participants to the mapping tool’s objectives, process and methodology, expected results, and other features.

The mapping team spent three days building capacity for the supervision of data collection and data capture. One of the days focused on the mapping module, using the District Health Information (DHIS2) software for customization, data collection, data entry and basic analysis. During this period, the team proposed a preliminary long list of nutrition actions, target groups, implementation mechanisms and geographical levels that was validated during the workshop.

The mapping exercise itself will take roughly four months to be completed, including the data collection phase, data cleaning, analysis and dissemination of results. This will make it possible to reframe and deliver the package of priority interventions with a proven impact by targeting the geographical areas not previously covered. The goal is to identify existing gaps among the different demographics to boost coverage for hard-to-reach populations.","Sun, 29 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['embarks', 'support', 'levels', 'network', 'madagascar', 'national', 'data', 'exercise', 'actions', 'nutrition', 'mapping', 'onn', 'health', 'multisectoral']", ,none

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

Southern Africa continues to experience the negative effects of El Niño-related drought conditions that began in 2015. Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe have declared national emergencies or alerts due to drought conditions and requested international assistance to mitigate the effects of drought on vulnerable populations. Critical needs within drought-affected communities include emergency food assistance, as well as livelihoods; nutrition; and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) support.

In mid-October, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) revised its forecast models to indicate a heightened likelihood of La Niña conditions in late 2016. Forecasters predict that if La Niña develops, it will likely remain weak, and conditions may not persist for long.

More than 400,000 people across the region have been affected by floods and cyclones in 2018.

There is a 65-70 per cent probability of an El Niño event between December and February, as compared with a 90 per cent probability ahead of the same period in 2015 - 2016.

People in two districts in Madagascar and three in Zimbabwe are facing Emergency food insecurity.

KEY MESSAGES

More than 9.6 million people in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe are expected to face severe food insecurity (IPC phase 3 and above) in the coming months. Both Madagascar (Beloha and Ampanihy Districts) and Zimbabwe (Kariba, Binga and Rushinga) have populations facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity.

The highest numbers of severely food insecure people are projected to be in Malawi (3.3 million), Zimbabwe (2.4 million people just in rural areas), and Madagascar (1.3 million). Increases in food insecurity are closely linked to heightened protection risks for the most vulnerable. In Madagascar, there are reports that households from Grand Sud are traveling long distances in search of work, and that very poor households who rely on charcoal or firewood for a living are traveling longer distances to collect them, exposing them to insecurity.

The risk of an El Niño phenomenon between December and February, which coincides with the cropping season in Southern Africa, is currently 65-70 per cent. This is lower than at the same time in 2015, when the probability was 90 per cent. However, there is still a need to closely monitor the situation and ensure that preparedness actions are undertaken, building on the lessons learned from the 2016-2017 El Niño-induced drought. El Niño is historically associated with depressed rainfall in the southern half of the region. According to the most recent Southern African Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF) report a possible El Niño event could therefore lead to a further deterioration in food insecurity in the region in 2019 - 2020, particularly following the low and erratic rainfall recorded to date in 2018.

At least 400,000 people across Southern Africa were impacted by floods and cyclones during the 2017/2018 season. This includes 212,000 people who were impacted either directly or indirectly by Tropical Cyclone Ava (161,000 people) and Tropical Storm Eliakim (51,000) in Madagascar. Northern Mozambique was affected by heavy rainfall in January, affecting more than 73,200 people and damaging over 14,400 houses and 422 classrooms. Meanwhile, Mauritius and La Reunion impacted by both Tropical Cyclone Berguitta (January 2018) and Tropical Cyclone Dumazile (March 2018). Localized floods caused displacement and infrastructure damage in Botswana, Malawi, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

Over 10,000 cholera cases have been recorded in the region to date in 2018, including in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Tanzania saw double the cases recorded from January to August 2018 (3,739) compared to the same period in 2017 (2,466), while Zambia accounts for nearly 40 per cent of all cases in the region. Of particular note, a new outbreak has started in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 6 September, with 3,349 suspected cases reported and 32 deaths as of 14 September. The major risk factors propagating the Zimbabwe outbreak are unsafe burial practices, erratic water supply, burst sewer pipes and the use of unprotected water sources. Other communicable diseases are also present in the region, including Hepatitis E in Angola and Namibia,

Guinea Worm in Angola (first case confirmed in June 2018), measles in Mauritius and Zambia, typhoid in Zimbabwe, listeriosis in South Africa and dengue fever in the Seychelles and Tanzania.

Protection, particularly of refugees, migrants and children, continues to be a regional challenge. The number of refugees and asylum seekers hosted in Southern Africa has decreased to 878,000, primarily as a result of the repatriation of Burundian refugees from Tanzania. Some 44,000 Burundian refugees have so far been assisted to repatriate voluntarily to Burundi, citing improved overall security in the country, desires to reoccupy farmland, and to reunify with family. However, an average of 1,000 Burundian refugees continue to arrive in neighbouring countries each month, citing insecurity, harassment, and fear. Ahead of the elections in DRC in December more people may seek protection in neighbouring states. In Northern Mozambique the risk of new attacks by non-state armed actors remains high and clashes with security forces from October 2017 to July 2018 have reportedly resulted in deaths and displacement of civilians, although numbers have not been verified. Children living with albinism in Southern Africa face discrimination and abuse, often culminating in abduction, murder or human trafficking.

Under-funding is negatively impacting the delivery of protection and assistance to refugees arriving in Southern Africa, including from the DRC and Burundi. The DRC Regional Refugee Response Plan requires US$211 million for 2018, of which only $27 million has been received, leaving Angola 7 per cent funded, Tanzania 14 per cent funded and Zambia 18 per cent funded as of July 2018.

Remaining Southern African countries in the appeal have not yet received any funding.","Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1178129-ROSEA_181001_RIASCO_KeyMessages_SouthernAfrica.png?itok=3Nk24Z-Z,"['food', 'zimbabwe', '2018', 'million', 'madagascar', 'region', 'messages', 'humanitarian', 'southern', 'cent', 'refugees', '08', 'key', 'africa']", ,flood_and_drought
90,90,DR-2020-000231-MDG,What Caused One of Madagascar's Largest Lemur Die-Offs? - Pacific Standard,https://psmag.com/environment/what-killed-these-lemurs,"Teams of researchers are trying to uncover the cause of death for 31 Verraux's sifakas Lemurs—which could spell the end for the critically endangered species.

(Photo: Gerhard Mauracher via Creative Commons)

Lemurs in Madagascar have been under pressure from deforestation, poaching, drought, and other challenges for years. Now, in the much-visited Berenty Reserve near the island's southern tip, one species faces a mysterious new threat.

In the last month and a half, at least 31 Verreaux's sifakas have died in the reserve. Most were found already dead; others were found gravely ill and later died from respiratory failure. Berenty staff and local scientists have reached out to veterinarians and primatologists across the world. The experts believe that a parasite or tick-borne disease is likely to blame, but the exact cause remains unknown.

This is the one of largest lemur die-offs that scientists in Madagascar can remember. ""We haven't seen something like this before,"" says Patricia Wright, a lemur expert and the founder of Centre ValBio, a research center in eastern central Madagascar.

Verreaux's sifakas were struggling long before this outbreak. The white, fluffy lemurs were already listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The population is highly fragmented and has been declining for decades, according to the IUCN. The species is found in the dry areas and spiny forests of southwest Madagascar.

By coincidence, a large IUCN Red List Primate Specialist Group meeting took place last week in Antananarivo, Madagascar's capital, and re-assessing the endangerment status of all lemur species was a top agenda item. The group decided to uplist all nine sifaka species from endangered to critically endangered, according to people in attendance. The status change is not yet official, but during the meeting the Facebook page of the specialist group's Lemur Conservation Network project mentioned it: ""We are very sad to announce that all sifaka species are now under the Critically Endangered criteria.""

Verreaux's sifakas travel in groups of up to 14 individuals, and at least two of these groups have been killed off in Berenty since late March. Berenty is a private reserve run by a French family that owns a local sisal business. For decades, it has been a research site and a popular ecotourism destination. Lemurs are the main attraction.

Scientists have pieced together clues about the cause of death by assessing the afflicted sifakas that were found still alive. Several of those sifakas had paralyzed hind legs; to move, they had to drag themselves by their hands on the forest floor. (Normally, Verreaux's sifakas have powerful hind legs that allow them to bounce sideways on the ground or jump as far as 10 feet from tree to tree.) Within a day, in most of the cases, the paralysis moved up the body and into the lungs, causing death from respiratory failure.

Most of the dead sifakas were found covered in ticks, which scientists say may have caused the paralysis by transmitting a neurotoxin or some type of infectious rickettsial bacteria to the sifakas. However, in 2014, scientists found many other Verreaux's sifakas covered in ticks, and they showed no signs of disease.

Another possibility is that the recent deaths were caused by single-cell toxoplasma parasites, which affect the nervous system and which, like rickettsial bacteria, could have been brought to the area by humans. The parasites could have been in the local soil or in cat dung. Tissue and organ samples from the dead sifakas' bodies have been sent to the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, in Antananarivo, but the test results have not yet come back.

Almost all of the dead sifakas were male, and this at first led scientists to believe that perhaps the deaths were due to aggressive territorial disputes. Because outside threats have forced Verreaux's sifakas and other lemur species to crowd into small areas, this wouldn't be surprising. ""When we found the first nine [dead sifakas] we thought it might be due to an overpopulation,"" says Claire Foulon, the reserve manager. However, the dead bodies showed no signs of violence, and that theory has now been ruled out. Experts are not sure why most of the dead sifakas are male.

Whatever the cause of the illness turns out to be, other types of lemurs do not appear to be as vulnerable to it as the Verreaux's sifakas. So far, none of the many ring-tailed lemurs in the same area have been affected. However, one brown lemur was found dead, apparently from the same illness.

No sifakas have been found sick or dead since April 30th, so experts are hopeful that the worst may be over. ""As most of the news has been pointing to this localized event within a timeline, I am hoping that whatever has caused the 37 deaths (which is the number that was discussed at the IUCN meeting) has ridden its course,"" Edward Louis, director of the non-governmental organization Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and director of conservation genetics at the United States-based Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, writes in an email. (Louis and other experts cited a death toll in the high thirties, but Foulon, the reserve manager, later said that only 31 sifakas had died in the outbreak.)

A team of veterinarians from Germany is now on site to support the Malagasy veterinarian working on the case.

91,91,DR-2020-000231-MDG,FAO: El Niño 2018-19 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/fao-el-ni-o-2018-19,"High risk countries and potential impacts on food security and agriculture

In view of the potential impact of the 2018/19 El Niño on food security and agriculture, high risk countries in Southern Africa, Horn of Africa, Asia and the Pacific and Latin America should be prioritized for further monitoring, analysis and early action.

This Advisory on the 2018/19 El Niño, issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), provides a historical impact overview and latest forecasts for a better understanding of the El Niño patterns and its potential effects on the agricultural sector in the different regions globally. It also offers specific early action recommendations to promote the understanding that impacts of El Niño can be mitigated before they generate large scale food security emergencies.

What is El Niño?

El Niño is a recurrent global atmospheric-oceanic phenomenon associated with an increase in sea surface temperatures in the central tropical Pacific Ocean and a sustained weakening of the trade winds. An El Niño event develops approximately every two to seven years and lasts anywhere from 6 to 24 months.

A global El Niño event is declared after the central Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere show signs of certain atypical conditions for a prolonged period of time, usually over a period of three months. Even if an El Niño event does not fully develop, sea surface temperatures and other large-scale climatic patterns can be put into motion, potentially driving extreme weather events in certain areas of the globe.

An El Niño event increases the risk of heavy rainfall and flooding in some parts of the world, while in others, it increases the risk of drought through reduced rainfall. The impact of El Niño on agriculture and food security can be severe. For example, the 2015/16 El Niño – one of the strongest on record – affected over 60 million people worldwide, resulting in 23 countries appealing for international humanitarian assistance worth over USD 5 billion.

The extent of impact of El Niño on agriculture and food security depends on a complex interplay of meteorological, seasonality and vulnerability factors.

As a result, impact patterns of global El Niño events are variable and do not necessarily materialize during every occurrence. While there is generally a relationship between the global impacts of El Niño/La Niña events and their intensity, there is always potential for even a weak or moderate event to generate serious impacts in some regions. To address this uncertainty, it is therefore crucial to consult regional and national early warning systems for a systematic analysis of weather forecasts, vulnerabilities and potential risks.","Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1201233-CA2530EN.png?itok=1K4_j-hK,"['food', 'impacts', 'potential', 'security', 'global', '201819', 'fao', 'impact', 'risk', 'event', 'el', 'world', 'niño']", ,flood_and_drought
92,92,DR-2020-000231-MDG,"Madagascar Supply and Market Outlook, January 2018 - Madagascar - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/madagascar-supply-and-market-outlook-january-2018,"Key Messages

Between October and November 2017, a series of market assessments were conducted across Southern Africa by FEWS NET, in collaboration with key national and international partners. The findings from the assessment in Madagascar are key inputs to this report, which provides an update to the May 2017 Supply and Market Outlook report.

Staple food production in Madagascar was below average in 2017. This was due to a combination of factors including Cyclone Enawo in the northeastern parts of the country, atypical dryness in many northern regions, which reduced crop yields, and relatively high cash crop prices (vanilla), which affected area planted. Harvests in southern Madagascar, were near average this year, following consecutive years of drought. At the national level, rice and maize harvests were each approximately 20 percent below 2016 levels and 11 to 21 percent below the five-year average. Cassava harvest saw a modest recovery compared to 2016 but remained similarly below-average.

Rice imports continued to play an important role in staple food supply in 2017. In response to above-average domestic supply gaps, more than 400,000 metric tons (MT) of rice were imported during the first ten months of 2017, which is 78 percent above-average and double the amount imported in 2016.

Staple food and cash crop prices are above-average. In main cities like Antananarivo, Toamasina and Antsirabe, local and imported rice prices have been particularly high since October 2017 peaking over 2,000 Ariary (MGA) per kilogram. Average local harvest and the availability of imports contribute to relatively stable prices in structurally deficit southern Madagascar.","Thu, 01 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1033684-Madagascar%20Supply%20and%20Market%20Report_Jan%202018_final_0.png?itok=EpiQWCOq,"['food', '2018', 'prices', '2017', 'market', 'madagascar', 'imported', 'southern', 'outlook', 'rice', 'supply', 'key', 'average']", ,drought
93,93,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Did tiny algae fell mighty dinosaurs? - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/did-tiny-algae-fell-mighty-dinosaurs,"Did tiny algae fell mighty dinosaurs?

Seventy million years ago, they all came to drink in the rapidly drying river: long-necked sauropods, fierce theropods, crocodiles, lizards, and raven-sized birds. They never left. The giant and the tiny were entombed together in the riverbed, forming what is now a spectacular series of mass graves in northwestern Madagascar. Last week, researchers proposed a culprit behind this ancient mystery: harmful algal blooms (HABs), in the very water that had lured the animals.

The remains of such algal blooms “should be more common in the fossil record,” says vertebrate paleontologist Nicholas Pyenson of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who was not part of the study. But he cautions that they are tough to prove.

Bone beds always come with a mystery: Why did so many animals die at once? Floods and volcanoes are sometimes invoked, and for years researchers suspected that drought killed the animals whose fossils accumulated in the Maevarano Formation of Madagascar. Torrential rains punctuating periods of drought might have created turbulent rivers choked with sediment that buried skeletons intact.

One chunk of this formation “is the most fossiliferous package of rock I’ve ever seen,” says Raymond Rogers, a geologist at Macalester College in St. Paul, who has been studying the site for 2 decades. He and his colleagues have so far cataloged nearly 1200 specimens from a single bed a third the size of a tennis court.

Over time, the team grew skeptical of drought as the only explanation. Large and small animals nestle against each other, suggesting that the bodies were buried where they died and that the killer struck all kinds of animals without discrimination. In addition, whatever killed these animals “was fast-acting,” Rogers says, “dropping birds in their tracks.” And it happened again and again, creating multiple layers of bone beds.

Last week, at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology here, Rogers noted the arched-back posture of the dead, which suggests neck convulsions; an unusual carbonate crust, similar to those left by algae in other sediments; and the sheer number of dead birds. Taken together, he says, these clues suggest that the killer was “almost certainly harmful algal blooms,” which can develop repeatedly in the same place in late summer.

HABs have been implicated in mass deaths before. In 1878, a Nature paper noted a peculiar hyperextended neck posture—similar to the postures of the Maevarano creatures—in dead livestock near a lake; testing confirmed that the animals had ingested toxic cyanobacteria. And in a 2014 paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Pyenson and others suggested that toxic algae periodically killed hundreds of whales and other marine animals off the coast of what is now Chile, starting 11 million years ago.

Algae even might be implicated at Germany’s famous Messel Pit, says paleontologist Wighart von Koenigswald of the University of Bonn in Germany, who was not involved in the new study. That series of Eocene mass graves is full of birds and bats, he notes, making one explanation—sudden carbon dioxide degassing from an ancient lake—unlikely. Moreover, the beds include turtles caught in the act of copulation as well as pregnant mares, suggesting that the deaths happened during mating season across different years. years. Toxic algae are “the most plausible explanation,” Von Koenigswald says.

In Madagascar and elsewhere the smoking gun—direct evidence of algae—is still missing, Rogers acknowledges. He plans to hunt for chemical traces or biomarkers of algae in the rocks and fossils. If such evidence is found in Madagascar, says Smithsonian vertebrate paleontologist Kay Behrensmeyer, this “very provocative” idea might help explain other fossil troves. “It opens up a possibility that we probably have not been considering seriously enough.”","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/bone%20beds.jpg?itok=bUIXzBy6,"['dinosaurs', 'mighty', 'killed', 'paleontologist', 'birds', 'fell', 'animals', 'madagascar', 'vertebrate', 'toxic', 'algae', 'mass', 'rogers', 'tiny']", ,flood_and_drought

For each FEWS NET country and region, the Price Bulletin provides a set of charts showing monthly prices in the current marketing year in selected urban centers and allowing users to compare current trends with both five-year average prices, indicative of seasonal trends, and prices in the previous year. To learn more about markets in Southern Africa, consult the FEWS NET Regional Maize Market Fundamentals Summary Report.

Maize is the single most important cereal crop in Southern Africa, accounting for almost 70% of total cereal production in the region. Most households in Southern Africa depend on maize (grain and meal/flour) for their main source of food and energy, with tubers (cassava), rice, wheat, sorghum, and millet serving as the main substitutes. Madagascar is the exception, where rice (imported and local) is the main staple food consumed across the country, with cassava and maize serving as key substitutes. Cassava is not traded in significant quantities across Southern Africa, while beans are an import protein source with annual consumption ranging between 2 - 8 kg on a per capita basis. Both white and yellow maize are produced in the region, but South Africa is the only country where yellow maize is grown in significant quantities and it is primarily livestock feed. South Africa is also the region’s major producer used as livestock of maize and is a major exporter to international markets. In years of relative maize surplus, sizable amounts of both formal and informal cross border trade occurs between neighboring countries. Maize trade flows in the region largely reflect trade in white maize. For most of Southern Africa, wheat grain is imported, milled, and consumed primarily in the form of bread. While South Africa produces substantial amounts of wheat, it is in quantities that are insufficient to meet domestic requirements.","Fri, 01 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1251478-Southern_Africa_2019_02_PB.png?itok=d6ethQwE,"['bulletin', 'food', 'south', 'trade', 'prices', 'madagascar', 'maize', 'region', 'wheat', 'southern', 'price', 'trends', '2019', 'africa']", ,none

Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), Rise Against Hunger (RAH), and Islamic Relief USA (IR USA) are spearheading a 3-year* school feeding initiative in Southern Africa to provide relief to communities devastated by the El Niño drought and support them on their road to recovery. The initiative targets Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe.

School feeding programs help curb school dropout rates during times of drought. Baseline assessments conducted by ADRA revealed key challenges in school attendance and participation that adequate and nutritious meals cannot address alone. The complexity of the situation calls for activities complementary to school feeding if we hope to overcome these challenges. They include improving school infrastructure such as kitchens, food storage, and latrines, increasing access to clean water, and establishing school and community gardens. This holistic approach aims to significantly magnify the impact of the program.

Major Challenges

• High percentage of children attending schools while hungry and struggling to stay focused

• High level of absenteeism (teachers and students due to illness, family emergencies, work, and access to school

• Decrease enrollment in higher grades seen with both genders

• Inadequate and infrequent access to clean water

• Inadequate school infrastructures and facilities that compromise school safety, learning, and health

Key Project Interventions

• Improving nutritional status of 50,546 primary school-going children by establishing on-site school feeding

• Increasing enrollment and attendance across 186 schools

• Establishing school and community gardens

• Building essential sanitation facilities, increasing access to clean water, conducting hygiene and nutrition sensitizations and establishing WASH clubs

• Ensure sustainability through local staff, community, and private sector involvement

97,97,DR-2020-000231-MDG,From thorny to tasty: UN agriculture agency looking at cactus as climate resilient food - UN News Centre,https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/11/637911,"“Climate change and the increasing risks of droughts are strong reasons to upgrade the humble cactus to the status of an essential crop in many areas,” said Hans Dreyer, the Director of Plant Production and Protection Division at FAO, noting the plant’s potential.

According to the UN agency, cultivation of cactus pear is slowly catching on, in part, boosted by growing need for resilience in the face of drought, degraded soils and higher temperatures.

This was evident during the recent intense drought in southern Madagascar, where the plant – once viewed as a worthless invasive species – provided a crucial supply of food, forage and water for local people and their animals.

While most cacti are inedible, the Opuntia species – also referred to as prickly pear – has much to offer, especially if treated like a crop rather than a weed run wild.

“Today the agriculturally relevant Opuntia ficus-indica subspecies – whose spines have been bred out but return after stress events – is naturalized in 26 countries beyond its native range,” says FAO, adding: “Its hardy persistence makes it both a useful food of last resort and an integral part of sustainable agricultural and livestock systems.”

Historically, cactus’ culinary qualities have been a prominent feature in Mexico as well as the Italian island of Sicily, renowned for its gourmet tradition.

In Mexico alone, the yearly per capita consumption of nopalitos – the tasty young pads, known as cladodes – is 6.4 kilograms and the plant is grown on small farms (as primary or supplemental crop) and harvested in the wild on more than three million hectors.

Cactus as source of water and to lower greenhouse gas emissions

Aside from providing food, cactus also stores water in its pads, providing up to 180 tonnes of water per hectare – enough to sustain five adult cows.

This usefulness is all the more important during droughts, when livestock survival rate has been far higher on farms with cactus plantations.

And with pressure on water sources only projected to rise in the future, cactus could become one of the important crops for the 21st century.

Furthermore, there is evidence that yields in barley – a major cereal grain globally – rise when cactus is grown alongside it as a soil-improving alley crop, and there is research showing that use of cactus in cattle diets reduces the ruminants’ methanogenesis (production of methane in the guts of animals, especially cattle and other ruminants), thus contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions.","Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2017/11/28511/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['food', 'climate', 'cactus', 'water', 'thorny', 'production', 'rise', 'crop', 'agency', 'providing', 'resilient', 'tasty', 'looking', 'ruminants', 'species', 'agriculture', 'plant']", ,drought
98,98,DR-2020-000231-MDG,Southern Africa: Drought (Food Insecurity) - Emergency Appeal n° MDRZA009 - Botswana - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/botswana/southern-africa-drought-food-insecurity-emergency-appeal-n-mdrza009,"This Emergency Appeal seeks a total of 7,7 million Swiss francs to enable the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to support four National Societies in Southern Africa (Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia) to deliver assistance to 81,000 people (16,200 households) affected by a worsening drought for 14 months with a focus on Livelihoods and Basic Needs. The planned response reflects the current situation and information available at this time of the operation.

The four targeted countries were selected bearing in mind that Red Cross Red Crescent network has ongoing operations in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, which are all addressing food insecurity. The additional four countries would expand the Federation network humanitarian response to eight countries in southern Africa. The selection of target communities is based on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and National Vulnerability Assessment (NVAC) reports. In consultations with the respective National Societies and in-country partners, the areas selected are where other non-Red Cross Red Crescent partners are not operational.

The Appeal is designed in coordination with in-country Red Cross/Red Crescent partners and seeks to build on existing programmes implemented by the National Societies, to implement emergency response activities and recovery interventions in the face of worsening food insecurity in southern Africa.

The operational strategy

Needs analysis (a) Regional overview Southern Africa currently has over 11 million people1 experiencing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and above) in nine countries (Angola, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe). As of the beginning of November; Angola, Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia declared states of drought emergencies, requiring international assistance to address the worsening food insecurity.

The 2018/19 rains were largely poor and latest forecasts indicate that several countries will be seriously affected by the continuation of the current dry conditions during the 2019-2020 production season. These include Eswatini and Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, parts of Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Earlier forecasts by the Southern African Regional Climate Outlook (SARCOF) indicated a 25% likelihood of below average rainfall. However, more recent forecasts indicated a much more serious situation of 70-80% likelihood of a consecutive below average rainfall season.

In response to the increasing food insecurity situation, governments across the region developed national mitigation and response plans, are allocating emergency response funds, and calling on the humanitarian community to provide additional support. In-country, government-led coordination mechanisms have been set up to ensure any response interventions address the most in need communities, and that resource mobilisation efforts are properly managed.

The Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have supported their respective governments with additional assessments and consultations to determine areas and sectors for potential interventions. This multi–country Emergency Appeal is designed to cover Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia, as the Red Cross Red Crescent network already has ongoing emergency operations in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, reaching 207,055 people (41,411 households) with food security related interventions. In addition, governments and other external partners are responding in other geographical areas and this Appeal focuses on areas where humanitarian gaps exist.

The UN agencies have developed a multi–sectoral Regional Appeal to address emergency needs in 103 countries over a period of 9 months (October 2019 – June 2020). In some countries the UN agencies have accessed the Central Emergency Response Funds (CERF) and humanitarian response are planned/ongoing. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is working with national governments to explore sub regional and regional funding opportunities such as through the Africa Development bank (AfDB) and the World Bank.","Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1422933-MDRZA009ea.png?itok=s8PbrDKr,"['mdrza009', 'food', 'crescent', 'drought', 'appeal', 'botswana', 'national', 'regional', 'response', 'southern', 'societies', 'red', 'n', 'emergency', 'africa', 'insecurity', 'countries']", ,drought

All his life, 56-year-old Jeanpier Marolahy has been growing rice in eastern Madagascar, on the steep hills that slope down from the central highlands toward the Indian Ocean.

The thin, weather-beaten Marolahy knows that rice production is all about water and timing. The grain needs a lot of water at first, but if torrential rains fall at harvest time, they can destroy the crop.

Rice is a hugely important part of life on the island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa. At times, it shows up for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In much of the country, it dominates the landscape, planted in small plots across millions of acres of land.

But erratic rains and powerful storms are threatening rice production in parts Madagascar and putting the livelihoods of subsistence farmers like Marolahy at risk.

For years, Marolahy says, the wet and dry seasons arrived in his fields in a relatively predictable pattern. But that is no longer the case.

The weather has clearly changed, Marolahy says, from when he was a boy.

Ankle-deep in the mud of a rice paddy, Marolahy notes that when he was a kid, this part of eastern Madagascar might get hit by a cyclone once every five years. Now, he says, he can get five big storms in a single year.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Samantha Reinders for NPR Samantha Reinders for NPR

Complicating matters even more, this area was plagued by a four-month drought last year that Marolahy says was the worst he has ever seen.

Marolahy has two small rice paddies in a narrow valley just outside the Ranomafana National Park. He also has two smaller plots of rice and vegetables terraced into an adjacent hillside. These four fields are the only source of income for his family.

This year, the rains have been steady, but he says it has been abnormally cold and the seedlings are growing very slowly.

""Look,"" he says, pointing to a 10-foot-by-10-foot plot of bright green rice shoots. ""They are like this."" He holds open his thumb and forefinger. ""But they should be like this,"" he says, holding his hands about 6 inches apart. At night, he covers the seedlings with banana leaves to try to keep them warm.

Marolahy isn't just another farmer complaining about uncooperative weather. Climate scientists say weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable.

Researchers tracking the temperature in the adjacent national park say the highs and lows in this part of Madagascar have become far more extreme over the past two decades.

In 2014, Celia Harvey, a scientist with Conservation International, helped conduct a study looking at how changing climatic conditions are affecting 600 small-scale farmers on the island nation.

""We found that farmers are experiencing very variable rainfall and very variable crop production,"" Harvey says.

The study also found that small-scale farmers in Madagascar are ill-prepared to deal with climatic fluctuations.

""They have large families. They have very small areas of land. They're very poor. They lack access to basic services. They're really living on the edge in many ways,"" she says. ""So they depend almost entirely on rice production for both their food security and for income generation. So anything that affects their rice production ultimately very quickly undermines their livelihood.""

According to the World Bank, three-quarters of the population of Madagascar lives in poverty. Most of those people survive by growing their own food.

In Madagascar, these small, subsistence farms are particularly vulnerable to tropical storms. Madagascar is as long from tip to toe as Texas. Its 1,000-mile-long east coast stands as a long, straight bulwark protecting southern Africa from storms that barrel west across the open Indian Ocean. As ocean temperatures rise, climate scientists expect that more powerful and more frequent tropical storms will buffet Madagascar.

""Madagascar is one of those countries that are very exposed to cyclones, and when cyclones come through, farmers typically lose most of their rice crop,"" Harvey says.

Marolahy, the rice farmer, says he has few options on how to deal with the erratic weather. His land is the most valuable thing he owns. He can't just move somewhere else or find another job. His strategy to deal with the fluctuations in his rice yields is to expand. Later this year, he plans to burn the bushes off a hillside above his rice paddies and try planting cassava and beans.

Not far from Marolahy's fields, another family of rice farmers is also diversifying. Perline Ramaniandaibe and her two daughters are panning for gold in a small stream that serves as both the sewer and the spring for the village of Kelilalina in eastern Madagascar.

Ramaniandaibe says some days they don't find any gold, but other days, they find a few flecks of the precious metal. They use the gold to support their rice farm.

""We don't have any other way to make money, only this, this gold,"" she says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Samantha Reinders for NPR Samantha Reinders for NPR

One of the benefits of panning for gold, Ramaniandaibe says, is that when flooding makes it impossible to work in their fields, the rising water cuts in to the hillsides, exposing soil that potentially could yield more gold. She concedes that ripping up agricultural land to search for gold is a problem over the long term, but at least it can bring in some cash when crops fail.

And there may be another silver lining to climate change for some parts of the island. While researchers say storms and erratic rainfall will make it harder to grow rice in eastern Madagascar, rising temperatures might boost rice production in the central highlands of the country, where lower temperatures currently limit the growing season.","Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/08/04/samantha-reinders_ricefarming_062-84_wide-7a7b22242b2ed8c448f9447bd9725551d7f158d0.jpg?s=1400,"['marolahy', 'livelihood', 'gold', 'production', 'samantha', 'weather', 'madagascar', 'reinders', 'threatens', 'storms', 'rice', 'farmers', 'erratic']", ,flood
