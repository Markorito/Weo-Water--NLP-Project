The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has predicted that this year's dry season may last until September.

In Central Java, it is estimated that 1,235 villages in 266 districts will endure clean-water shortages during the dry season, according to the Central Java Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD).

At least three reservoirs in the province have dried up and six others have very low water levels, cutting supplies of water for irrigation and clean water for domestic use.

Water volumes in the reservoirs have steadily declined since the dry season arrived in the province in July.

The dried-up reservoirs are in Gebyar and Botok in Sragen regency, as well as Uling in Wonogiri regency.

""The six reservoirs that have very low water levels are in Kembangan and Brambang in Sragen, Krisak in Wonogiri, Cacaban in Tegal, Gunungrowo in Pati as well as Lodan in Rembang,"" Central Java Water Resources Management (PSDA) Agency head Prasetyo Budhie Yuwono said on Monday (Aug 28).

However, the provincial administration has downplayed the situation, claiming that the overall water volume of all the reservoirs in the province was still sufficient.

The administration previously expected a minimum water volume of 1.0 billion cubic meters in all 41 reservoirs in the province during the dry season. As of Monday, the volume was 1.2 billion cubic meters, said Prasetyo.

Nuswantoro SP, the secretary of the Central Java Plantation, Agriculture and Dissemination Coordination Agency, said the impact of the dry season in August was still manageable.

""We've received reports of drought from Temanggung, Demak and Tegal regencies. A total area of 13 hectares suffered light drought conditions while a moderate drought is reported to have hit 39 ha of and severe drought in 14 ha,"" he said, adding that farmers had reported failed harvests. In Tegal, for example, 10 ha of rice failed.

BPBD Central Java has earmarked Rp 600 million (S$60,876) for the distribution of clean water to 46 villages in 22 districts.

In East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), acting Sabu Raijua regent Nikodemi Rihi Heke has issued a decree to cope with the ""drought emergency"" in six districts.

""The six districts are Hawu Mehara, Raijua, West Sabu, Sabu Liae, Central Sabu and East Sabu,"" BPBD Sabu Raijua chief Pither Mara Rohi told reporters in Kupang.

Pither said that based on agency monitoring, almost all districts in the regencies had suffered from water scarcity and drought since July.

The agency has started to distribute clean water to residents in 63 villages in six districts, using 335 water tankers.

However, Pither said supplies were still inadequate to compensate for the drought.

On average, one village would only get supplies from five to six water tankers per day, each only sufficient to cover the needs of 10 to 12 families.

Therefore, for a long-term solution, the Sabu Raijua administration plans to build embung (artificial lakes) in every village in the regency.

""There are currently two big embung in Sabu Raijua, which can only supply a few villages around them,"" Pither said.

Drought and water scarcity are also reported in other areas, such as Karawang, Cianjur and Sukabumi in West Java; Bantul in Yogyakarta; and Bima in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB).","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2017/08/30/lwx300817_indo.jpg?itok=2Xksecz4,"['worsening', 'agency', 'sabu', 'reservoirs', 'season', 'central', 'water', 'java', 'millions', 'dry', 'raijua', 'affect', 'drought', 'indonesia', 'clean', 'scarcity']", ,drought
1,1,Drought_Indonesia,How Indonesia's President monitors food security - GovInsider,https://govinsider.asia/inclusive-gov/pulse-lab-jakarta-indonesia-derval-usher/,"Indonesia is under threat of food insecurity and undernutrition, and faces “alarmingly high” stunting levels. In 2007, an estimated 7.7 million children under five were stunted, according to the Food Security Portal.

And when climate change is in the picture, things become much more complex.

To keep abreast of what’s happening, the President has a platform in his situation room that tracks drought and its effects on agriculture in real time. It was developed by Pulse Lab Jakarta (PLJ), a big data analytics lab which emerged from a partnership between the United Nations and the Government of Indonesia.

Derval Usher, PLJ’s Head of Office, hopes to support development and urbanisation efforts through “better use of data and new digital data sources”. “People are starting to understand the use of evidence for policymaking, and the better use of new data sources for solving inherent problems,” she says.

Usher shares with GovInsider four ways PLJ is using big data analytics to help Indonesia and other countries address development issues.

1. Getting ahead of drought

Over 22 million Indonesians rely on agriculture for their livelihood, according to the UN, and the El Niño climatic event, which brings oscillating extreme temperatures, led to drought in several districts last year.

PLJ joined forces with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation to develop a platform that identifies affected communities in need of help, says Usher. The VAMPIRE visualisation tool combines data in several layers: users can view where food-insecure and agriculture-dependant communities live; data on rainfall anomalies and vegetation health; and crowdsourced prices of staple foods in these areas.

The Indonesian government can take a closer look at how drought is affecting crops, and adjust their response accordingly, Usher explains. “You start to see that it hasn’t rained in some time, and food prices are going up.”

“You start to see that it hasn’t rained in some time, and food prices are going up.”

She adds that VAMPIRE, which is installed in the President’s situation room, is “an early warning system” for authorities to manage food security and better allocate resources. Following VAMPIRE’s success in Indonesia, WFP is now in discussions with the Sri Lankan government to have it installed there too, Usher shares.

2. Haze be gone

Environmental issues are another area where data analytics can help, especially when these issues are transborder ones. The annual blight of the haze is a sore spot for Indonesia – and its often-disgruntled neighbours.

PLJ set out to use data to help locate the agricultural fires that are to blame. “We’ve developed a platform [which] started off as a social media project to see whether we could capture, map out instances of fires in Indonesia,” Usher explains.

Essentially, the Haze Gazer platform helps disaster management authorities to provide quicker responses, Usher says. It is also installed in the Indonesian President’s situation room, she adds, “so you’ve got the citizens reporting directly into the President’s situation room”.

The PLJ team drew from various sources of publicly-available social media data, such as tweets, Instagram posts and Youtube feeds, and combined them with satellite imagery to create a dynamic visualisation tool. They also trawled the internet for the keywords kabut asap (haze in Bahasa Indonesia) and if they were used together with phrases related to poor health or not going to school. “You can get the citizen impact of haze,” Usher explains.

3. Crowdsourcing translations

Data analytics can help governments speed up their response in the event of a disaster. Translator Gator is an online language game – a “brainchild of our data science team”, Usher says – that invites people to create taxonomies, or collections of keywords, in lesser-known languages and dialects.

Eventually, these crowdsourced taxonomies can be used to better understand how affected populations are responding to a disaster on social media and other channels, according to a PLJ blog post on the UN Global Pulse website. Response teams will also be able to better communicate with them. This is particularly important for countries such as Indonesia, where there are several local dialects and even slang.

How it works is that users can choose to translate disaster-related keywords and phrases from English to their native language; evaluate others’ translations; suggest alternative words or phrases; or classify words and phrases into categories, says Usher. “It was a playful game where we were incentivising people and offering them phone credit for every translation that they gave us.”

Translator Gator proved so successful that PLJ extended the initiative to ten ASEAN countries and Sri Lanka, according to Usher. The second phase just wrapped up this year, and at last count, there were over 1.8 million activities across the 11 countries, she adds.

The project has caught the attention of other countries in the region as well. Thanks to the “overwhelming success” of Translator Gator in Vietnam, PLJ has been approached by UN colleagues in Vietnam to extend the competition, and include more ethnic languages than originally planned on, Usher shares.

4. Data for better transport

Jakarta is the “tweeting capital of the world”, and all of that social media data poses interesting possibilities for unconventional use. PLJ is working with the Jakarta Smart City Unit to analyse publicly-available tweets of commuters taking TransJakarta buses, which can help improve on urban planning and decision-making around transport, Usher says.

“We are looking at better optimisation of the buses based on where people are getting on the buses in the morning; where they are starting off their journey; where are they getting off; what are peak times for people to travel,” Usher explains.

Interestingly, the Indonesia Institute of Statistics carried out a study in 2014 that looked at the origins and destinations of commuters in Jakarta, and “the official statistics are very similar to what came through on Twitter,” Usher notes.

Certainly, mining tweets is “a lot cheaper than doing a costly survey”, she believes, and in a “fast-moving” city like Jakarta, the situation could turn out very differently in the five years before the next survey.

All things considered, “big data can give you a ‘snapshot’ of what’s happening on the ground this time, rather than relying on data collected maybe five years ago,” concludes Usher, and “complement the traditional statistics” that are already available.

“Big data can give you a ‘snapshot’ of what’s happening on the ground.”

With data, governments can respond faster and more efficiently to drought, haze, and other issues as they are happening. As Indonesia urbanises, data is likely to be an essential part of its development journey.

Innovation Labs World will be hosting a dedicated data stream on 26 September 2017 for government officials to share lessons and best practices. Register today.

2,2,Drought_Indonesia,Amazing facts about Indonesia - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/indonesia/articles/indonesia-facts/,"Indonesia is celebrating 72 years of independence today. So why not learn a little more about the world's fourth biggest country?

1. It covers a lot of ground

This vast place extends 5,120 kilometres from east to west. That's longer than the distance (as the crow flies) from London to Tehran (4,403km).

Indonesia dwarfs Europe

2. And is made up of 18,307 islands

That’s according to a 2002 survey by the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (the CIA World Factbook seems to think it’s 17,508, however, while a more recent survey, by a different agency, put the figure at 13,466). Only Canada, Norway, Sweden and Finland have more.

3. It’s heaven for animal lovers

According to Conservation International, just 17 countries are considered ""megadiverse"". Each possesses a vast number of different species – many found nowhere else. And Indonesia is one.

4. And home to the world’s largest lizard

The Komodo dragon lives on just five Indonesian islands – Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar. They are truly fearsome, weighing up to 150lbs and possessing toxic bites, allowing them to hunt and kill far bigger animals – even humans.

Don't mess with these lizards

Stanley Stewart visited the islands for Telegraph Travel last year. He wrote: “Our guide Harry Christensen, a proper ocker Aussie who has been sailing these waters for years, told us how the Komodo’s venom induces shock and heart failure in its victims, how it dislocates its jaws like a snake to devour large prey, how it is a miniature replica of a much larger Jurassic ancestor. ‘AMAZING!’ Harry raved, flapping his arms like a man trying to escape his own body. ‘These dragons inspired the legends of King Kong!’”

5. Indonesian airlines have a chequered history

Since 2001, there have been at least 45 air accidents on Indonesian soil that resulted in fatalities, according to the website aviation-safety.net. They include Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, which crashed into the Java Sea in 2014, killing 162 people, and a Trigana Air Service crash in 2015 that killed 54. By comparison, there have been just six on UK soil during that time – all involving small jets with fewer than six individuals on board.

Due to safety concerns, the EU currently permits just seven Indonesian airlines (Airfast Indonesia, Premiair, Garuda Indonesia, Citilink, Batik Air, Lion Air and Indonesia AirAsia), to fly within its airspace. That leaves 55 on its banned list.

6. But they are expanding fast

Lion Air, a budget Indonesian operation that flies predominantly in and around South-East Asia, is set to quintuple the size of its fleet. It has 443 aircraft on order, to add to its current stock of 113. No airline in the world is waiting on so many planes.

7. It has 139 volcanoes

Indonesia has the third most volcanoes in the world, behind the US and Russia, according to the National Museum of Natural History’s Global Volcanism Program.

The volcanic island of Krakatoa, between Java and Sumatra, is perhaps the most famous. It was responsible for one of the world's biggest modern eruptions; when it blew in 1883, it unleashed two huge tsunamis that killed more than 36,000 people and emitted what is considered to be the loudest sound ever heard.

8. Some of which you can climb

A base for trips to the summit of Mount Bromo, Cemoro Lawang appears to sit on the edge of the world. The landscapes are spectacular – many say the most spectacular in Indonesia – and the region is home to the fascinating Hindu Tengger community, distinct from the predominantly Muslim lowland Javanese. Hike, admire the scenery or visit during the annual Kasada ceremony, when the Tengger climb to the crater's edge to cast offerings into the hissing, seething inner crater.

9. There are eight Indonesian World Heritage Sites

10. It is the world’s shortest country

The map below shows 98 nations colour-coded according to the average height of its male residents (no reliable data is available for those countries that appear in grey). The Netherlands, where the average adult male is 1.838m tall, tops the table. Indonesia props up the rest, with an average height of just 1.58m.

11. But has a very tall mountain

Lorentz National Park, another of the country’s Unesco World Heritage sites, on the island of Papua, is vast – covering 9,674 square miles – and home to a huge array of ecosystems, including mangroves, rainforest, alpine tundra and equatorial glaciers. Its highest point, Puncak Jaya, is the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

A post shared by Zeal Optics (@zealoptics) on Apr 29, 2017 at 11:47am PDT

There are 123 mammalian species and 630 species of bird, including many that are endemic to the region. But much of the park remains unexplored – so scientists believe more are waiting to be discovered.

12. And a very large flower

Rafflesia arnoldi, endemic to Sumatra, is noted for producing the largest individual flower on Earth. But don’t pick one for your lover – it is said to smell like decaying flesh, earning it the nickname ""corpse flower"".

13. There’s a lot of coastline

Love to be beside the seaside? Then you won't be disappointed in the destinations that appear in darker colours on the map below - they can boast the longest coastlines in the world. Indonesia is second overall, with a staggering 54,716km.

14. And a lot of people

261.1m people call Indonesia home, making it the fourth most populous country on the planet. It is also home to the world’s biggest Muslim population (around 225m).

15. It still has the death penalty

Indonesia still enforces the death penalty - by firing squad. In 2015 it executed eight drug traffickers, including two Australians, in a case that triggered an international outcry, while Lindsay Sandiford, a British woman, is currently on death row after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into Bali in 2012. Her case is particularly baffling: she claims she was coerced into carrying the drugs by a criminal gang, and helped police with a sting operation to catch her accomplices. She was then sentenced to death while others involved were only given jail time.

Indonesia is by no means alone. More than 50 countries still have the death penalty, including Vietnam, one of the world’s biggest executioners, according to Amnesty International (429 prisoners were killed there between August 2013 and June 2016), Thailand, Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago.

16. There’s an eerie abandoned hotel

The French photographer Romain Veillon recently explored the remains of the abandoned PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Resort in Bali to capture these images.

The best hotels in Bali

17. Its capital is the most Instagrammed on Earth

Instagram recently revealed that Jakarta is the city most frequently geotagged in its Stories format.

“10 million people call this metropolis home and another 8 million pour into the city to work every day,” writes Simon Parker in his guide to Jakarta. “The traffic and vastness of Jakarta might seem daunting, but this is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines - seeking them out is part of its allure. The old town of Batavia will transport you to Indonesia’s Dutch colonial past while the fashionable Menteng district is a hive of live music venues, exclusive restaurants and hip hotels. World-renowned restaurants, bars and nightclubs perch on top of towering skyscrapers, while shoppers can choose from dozens of gargantuan shopping malls.”

18. The flag might catch you out

Monaco, Poland and Indonesia have very similar flags. Do you know which is which?

Nope, that's Poland

This is actually Monaco's flag

This is Indonesia's flag – the same as Monaco, just a little wider

19. Best of all - it’s cheap

The biennial World Economic Forum (WEF) Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report was released earlier this summer. Based on factors including safety, infrastructure, health and cultural resources, Spain is the greatest destination, it says, followed by France and Germany. But the top 20 for ""price competitiveness"" is very different. Indonesia is fifth best value, behind only Algeria, Malaysia, Egypt and Iran.","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Asia/Indonesia/indonesia-bali-mushroom.jpg?impolicy=logo-overlay,"['including', 'biggest', 'amazing', 'credit', 'worlds', 'stock', 'death', 'haven', 'world', 'confusing', 'air', 'indonesian', '19', 'flag', 'indonesia', 'facts', 'wildlife']", ,none

Sebastian Partogi

The Jakarta Post/Jakarta

The ancient Indonesian kingdom of Sriwijaya in the southwestern part of Sumatra Island played a significant role in the spice trail. The kingdom, which possibly originated in Palembang, South Sumatra, rose to power in the seventh century and retained control over the trade of spices – which grew in abundance in the region – for around 500 years thanks to its strong navy.

According to National Archaeological Research and Development Center researcher Bambang Budi Utomo, for around five centuries, Sriwijaya was the trading hub where middlemen from the Middle East and China went to get commodities – which had been shipped from the Maluku islands to Sumatra – in order to sell them to Europeans.

He said that because of limited navigation technology in the seventh century, European traders or middlemen could not easily reach the Maluku islands, which were located in the archipelago’s easternmost area. The islands were home to lucrative endemic spices, such as clove, nutmeg and mace.

Bambang said that thanks to Indonesia’s fertile soil, local farmers could maintain the high quality of their spices, leaving overseas customers begging for more.

Pepper, for instance, was also a popular commodity in the spice trade at that time. “Although pepper originated in India before it was cultivated in Indonesia, the pepper grown in our soil was somehow hotter than the one grown in India. This was why customers in the Middle East like Persia [now Iran] and even India itself preferred Indonesian pepper at that time,” Bambang explained.

Also take camphor as an example. China and Thailand also produced the commodity at that time, but traders preferred Indonesian camphor, which originated in the Barus area of North Sumatra, because of its higher quality.

From all the foreign spice consumers at the time, Europeans remained the ones most hooked on the Indonesian spices as a result of religious tradition and scriptures.

“Thanks to middlemen, the ancient spice trade before Sriwijaya had reached Italy before Christ. In 75 to 79 AD, the Roman bishop received a gift of 150 pounds of cloves from Emperor Constantine. In the Old Testament of the Bible, there is the story of the queen of Sheba presenting spices as gifts to King Solomon,” Bambang told The Jakarta Post in a recent telephone interview.

Bambang said the Sriwijaya kingdom was able to sustain its hold on the spice trade for hundreds of years thanks to its maritime military strategy and technology.

“Sriwijaya made use of suku laut [maritime tribe] at that time to guard the spice trade in the area. Although their main operational field was the sea, they were also great warriors,” he explained. This strong military base helped the kingdom maintain its maritime sovereignty.

Aside from the military strategy, Sriwijaya’s ship technology also played a vital role in making it a successful maritime hub.

“They had phinisi [schooners] that helped them navigate the ocean thanks to the design. That, however, is just one example of Sriwijaya’s outstanding maritime technology,” Bagus said.

Separately, historian JJ Rizal, who runs publishing company Komunitas Bambu specializing in history books, said part of the secret of the kingdom’s survival was its rulers’ strategy in turning financial accumulation into intellectual capital through a sound educational system.

“The port city of Barus gave birth to intellectuals in the seventh century, including Hamzah Fansuri,” he told the Post recently in his office. Hamzah Fansuri is a well-known Islamic literary writer.

“Power was demonstrated not through weaponry but through the grandeur of artistic performances and negotiations,” Rizal said.

The great Sriwijaya kingdom started to decline in the 12th century before its ultimate collapse in the 14th century.

“There came a time when Sriwijaya became too greedy with traders and middlemen who came to Sumatra through high taxation. Furthermore, internal conflicts and corruption also contributed to its end,” Bambang said.

Along with Sriwijaya’s decline, Indonesia’s maritime sovereignty and technology have not risen far from the ruins.

“For instance, until the 1980s, we still had a traditional sailing and trading route from Kalimantan to Java using phinisi. This tradition has since died. We also have to ask why almost all of the ships that navigate Indonesian waters fly foreign flags. The government needs to create a few regulations in order to preserve our tradition,” Bambang said, concluding the interview.

A story on this subject will also appear in the paper edition of The Jakarta Post on Aug. 18.

4,4,Drought_Indonesia,First real test for Jokowi on haze as annual fires return to Indonesia - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2017/08/indonesian-president-jokowis-first-real-test-begins-as-annual-fires-return/,"Land and forest fires have broken out in pockets of Indonesia since mid-July.

Last year the country caught a break, when a longer-than-normal wet season brought on by La Niña helped mitigate the fire threat.

This year, hotspots have started appearing in regions with no history of major land and forest fires, like East Nusa Tenggara and Aceh.

The government has responded by declaring an emergency status as well as deploying firefighters.

JAKARTA — Fire season has returned to Indonesia, marking the first real test of President Joko Widodo’s efforts to prevent a repeat of the 2015 haze crisis.

Land and forest fires have broken out in pockets of the archipelago country since mid-July, with the majority of fire-linked hotspots detected in the provinces of West Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara and Aceh.

On Aug. 6, the number of hotspots reached 282 nationwide, compared to just 239 detected the previous week, according to Indonesia’s space agency.

Since late July, West Kalimantan has had the most hotspots, with 150 on Aug. 6, followed by South Sumatra (23) and South Sulawesi (18).

“The forest and land fires in West Kalimantan keep raging on even though fire-extinguishing attempts keep going on. The number of hotspots is still high,” National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.

Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said that the number of hotspots in July was 49 percent higher than last year.

Meanwhile, U.S. weather satellite NOAA-19 detected 1,341 hotspots this year to Aug. 6, up from 1,233 during the same period last year.

“In the field, the number of hotspots is likely to be larger [than recorded] because there are some regions that are not passed by satellites during the land and forest fires,” Nugroho said.

Following the uptick in hotspots, the government has declared an emergency status in five provinces: Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan and South Kalimantan.

So too have five West Kalimantan districts: Kubu Raya, Ketapang, Sekadau, Melawi and Bengkayang.

“But districts that have many hotspots, such as Kapuas Hulu [23], Sanggau [45], Sintang [22] and Landak [13], haven’t declared red-alert status,” Nugroho said.

Challenge for Jokowi’s presidency

Indonesia has in the last two decades become prone to widespread fires during dry periods, thanks to the industrial-scale drainage of its vast peat swamp zones by palm oil and paper interests. The dried peat is highly combustible, and peat fires can be extremely difficult to put out.

2015 posed a tremendous challenge for the government when thousands of forest and peat fires raged across the country during the prolonged dry season brought on by the El Niño weather phenomenon.

While the scope of this year’s fires is still a far cry from 2015, analysts have predicted a return of the haze after a mostly haze-free year of 2016, when the rainy season lasted longer due to La Niña.

Arief Wijaya, senior manager on climate and forests at the World Resource Institute, a thinktank with an office in Jakarta, cited a University of Columbia project that has predicted a drier season this September to October than in the same period last year.

“Therefore, the probability of fires is bigger, maybe not as big as 2015 which was affected by El Niño strong swing, but surely this year’s fire risks are bigger than 2016,” he said in an interview.

He believes 2017 will present the first real test for the Indonesian government since 2015 because this time, La Niña is not around to help out.

“I think the impact of a policy would be tested when the condition is there to test the success or failure of the policy,” he said.

On the heels of the 2015 fires, Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, responded with some unprecedented measures, such as declaring a moratorium on peatland conversion even within existing concessions, and banning new oil palm plantation permits.

Last month, he extended the moratorium on the issuance of new conversion permits for primary forest and peatlands, the third extension of the moratorium, which was established in 2011 under then President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

“The government is on the right track in terms of policies,” Wijaya said. “But the devil is in the implementation. The biggest enemy is how to implement those policies.”

At the same time, Singapore, which lies just downwind of Indonesia, is keeping an eye on its neighbor in anticipation of major fire breakouts which could send toxic haze its way.

From July 25-28, Maliki Osman, Singapore’s senior minister of state for defense and foreign affairs, visited Riau and Jambi provinces, two frequent sources of the fires.

During the visit, Maliki reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to work together with Indonesia on haze, while applauding Riau’s efforts to mitigate fires.

“Efforts to manage and prevent forest fires that have been done by the Riau provincial government have been very impressive,” he told Indonesia’s Antara news agency during his visit to Riau.

New forest-fire trend

In Indonesia, fires usually break out in regions with large plantation areas and big concessions — land granted to developers — especially in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

“The plotting of hotspots’ locations from 2015 until 2017 shows that land and forest fires are happening over and over again every year in places like Tesso Nilo National Park [in Riau], Ogan Komering Ilir district [in South Sumatra] and the border between Riau and Jambi,” said Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman.

But this year, hotspots have started appearing in regions with no history of major land and forest fires, like East Nusa Tenggara and Aceh.

“This morning, I saw [hotspots appearing] in Bangka Belitung,” Bakar, the environment minister, told reporters in Jakarta recently. “These are new regions. For me, this is worrying because these regions are unlike other regions which already have task force [to handle forest fires].”

In Aceh in July, fires engulfed 222 hectares of land, an area the size of Monaco. As many as 241 West Aceh residents suffered respiratory infections from the smoke.

“We have repeatedly reminded [the public] not to burn waste or throw cigarette butts, especially on dry soil, because it’s the peak of the dry season in Aceh now,” said Zakaria, Aceh spokesman for Indonesia’s meteorology agency, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.

Officials and environmentalists are also bewildered by fires in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia’s southernmost province, part of an island chain north of Australia.

“The fires in East Nusa Tenggara are weird because there’s mostly savanna in the province,” Wijaya said. “So the types of forest are different from those in the western part of Indonesia and in Papua, which have tropical forests.

“Second, the soils in East Nusa Tenggara are infertile, making them unfit to be planted with oil palm trees. Therefore, if there are fires, they must be caused by natural hazards because it’s dry, not because of oil palm conversion.”

Bakar said this year’s fires are mostly caused by slash-and-burn activities by small farmers.

“Truthfully, lots of persuasion need to be done to the public because most of the fires are caused by traditional public land clearing done simultaneously,” she said.

Meanwhile, recent observation from Indonesia’s peatland restoration agency (BRG) shows that more than half of the manmade fires occurred in concession areas, many of them owned by large companies.

“Data from the end of July until this August shows that lots of the fires occurred in industrial forest areas, not palm oil plantations. This is a bit surprising,” Nazir Foead, head of Indonesia’s Peatland Restoration Agency, told reporters in Jakarta.

He added that 26 percent of the fires occurred on peatlands.

Nugroho, on the other hand, said that the fires occurred in company concessions, local lands and national parks, hinting that there are multiple underlying causes.

But efforts to engage local villagers in preventing forest fires seem to be having some effect.

In recent years, both big companies and local governments have been trying to create “fire-aware communities” in which villagers are equipped with firefighting skills and given incentives for keeping their land from burning.

“Regions with many fire-aware communities and disaster-prone villages have fewer hotspots throughout 2017,” Nugroho said. “On the other hand, places with few of them have more hotspots. This shows that regions with lack of monitoring are prone to fires.”

Government’s response

The government has responded to the return of forest fires by declaring an emergency status as well as deploying firefighters.

Jokowi also summoned the environment minister twice in the second week of August to discuss how to handle the fires.

After the first meeting with Jokowi, Bakar said she planned to hold a coordinating meeting with all regional heads to anticipate escalating forest fires, which are expected to peak between August and September.

“If we look at last year’s weather, the peak [of dry season] was in August. And in 2015, it was in September. So we have to anticipate this. That’s why I am suggesting for a coordinating meeting,” Bakar explained. “I will send letters soon to ask for a coordinating meeting with all regional heads, especially those of fire-prone areas, because there are new areas [with fire outbreaks], such as Aceh, Southeast Sulawesi, North Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara.”

The environment ministry has also launched joint patrol in three provinces — Riau, South Sumatra and West Kalimantan — as well as a firefighting operation with the military, the police and regional disaster mitigation agencies in North Sumatra, Riau and Jambi.

As the threat of forest fires looms, officials in Jambi have resorted to extreme measures with the head of the province’s land and forest fire task force, Refrizal, ordering his subordinates to “shoot on sight” when spotting people setting fires in the province.

“It won’t be a fatal shot,” he told BBC Indonesia. “First, of course it will be a warning shot.”

Indonesia and Google have agreed to implement the Trusted Flagger program, which reviews flagged content and removes content deemed inappropriate for the internet on websites such as YouTube.

Trusted Flagger is a program in which volunteers, who have been accepted through an application process, are given the authority to flag content that violates the terms of service or community guidelines of Google's websites. Google then reviews the flagged content and determines whether to remove it.

Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara said that, currently, the program was being tested and that he expected it to be launched within the next two to three months.

He said the government would involve several non-governmental organizations such as Wahid Institute, ICT Watch and Anti-Defamation Society of Indonesia (Mafindo) as content moderators.

""With such a transparent panel system that involves the public, there is no room for someone to abuse their authority,"" Rudiantara said during a press conference in Jakarta on Friday, adding that the program would increase the response time of removal requests.

""Based on our experience, only 50 percent of the take down requests were responded to quickly. We do not want the rest of the 50 percent to snowball.""

Google policy and government affairs director for Greater China and Southeast Asia Ann Lavin said the Trusted Flagger program was implemented in June in the US and some European countries.

""We have seen this program in the US and a number of European countries but this might be the first time [it is implemented] in Southeast Asia,"" Lavin said.

As part of Indonesia’s 72nd Indonesian Independence Day celebration, President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo presented on Tuesday honorary awards to eight figures, three of whom have passed away, for their distinguished service to the country.

The government awarded Bintang Mahaputra Adipradana medals, the highest civilian honor after the Bintang Republik Indonesia medal, to former Supreme Court chief justice Bagir Manan and late Presidential Advisory Board (Wantimpres) member Hasyim Muzadi.

Meanwhile, a Bintang Mahaputra Utama medal was bestowed on former Supreme Court deputy chief justice Marianna Sutadi.

President Jokowi presented a Bintang Jasa Utama medal to former West Kalimantan deputy governor Christiandy Sanjaya, while former General Election Commission (KPU) commissioner Hadar Nafis Gumay received a Bintang Penegak Demokrasi medal.

Three Bintang Budaya Parama Dharma medals were granted to philosopher Soejatmoko and painter Dullah, both of whom have passed away, and Toety Heraty Noerhadi Roosseno, a philologist.

The medal awarding ceremony award was conducted at the State Palace and was attended by Vice President Jusuf Kalla, People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) Speaker Zulkifli Hasan and Regional Representatives Council (DPD) Speaker Oesman Sapta Odang.

7,7,Drought_Indonesia,Indonesia to start work on £150m 'rich guy' cruise terminal as it seeks '10 new Balis' - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/indonesia/bali/articles/new-cruise-terminal-benoa-port-new-balis/,"Indonesia is weeks away from dredging a bay on Bali to build a £150 million port facility in an effort to attract ""the rich guy"".

After five years of planning, work is expected to begin next month. The resulting marina and cruise terminal on Bali’s southern tip will become the nation’s largest port, able to accommodate three cruise ships at once, each carrying as many as 5,000 passengers. Ari Askhara, chief executive of state-owned Pelindo III, the company behind the development, said he wants to lure luxury travellers from the yacht clubs of Singapore.

“At the moment people have Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai [to sail to] but Bali is very rare because the infrastructure is not there yet,” he told AAP, adding that he wanted to invite “the rich guy” to Bali.

The exclusive One°15 marina, membership of which costs $60,888 (£47,230), has been cited as inspiration for the development at Benoa Port. The Singapore club boasts 3,850 members - a target it met in 2007; it has since closed to membership applications - who enjoy an “unprecedented lifestyle destination” in the shape of pools, spa, restaurants, tennis courts, “swanky boathouses”, and luxury accommodation.

It is this clientele that tourism bosses on Bali are keen to attract. Indonesian tourism minister Arief Yahya says that the cruise industry presents an untapped market for Bali. He said though more than 3 million tourists travel via cruise ship every year in the East Asia-Australia region, Indonesia only welcomes 200,000.

“With the availability of this new terminal facility, it is hoped that the target of 500,000 foreign tourist arrivals from cruise ships for the year of 2019 can be achieved,” he said.

Plans are also afoot to develop a cruise terminal at Celukan Bawang, to the north of Bali, capable of accommodating seven ships at a time, each with a capacity of up to 1,000 passengers.

The new facilities are part of Indonesia’s drive to increase its annual visitor numbers from 11.4 million last year to 15 million in 2017 and 20 million by 2019. But at what cost?

The problems associated with vast numbers of cruise passengers flooding ports and cities has been well documented in Europe over the last 12 months, with Barcelona, Venice and Dubrovnik all struggling to balance the desire for tourism with the necessity of protecting local cultures and ways of life.

Chairman of the Bali Tourism Board, Isa Bagus Partha Adnyana, told Telegraph Travel an environmental impact study had been undertaken.

“We are supporting the establishment of the Benoa Port,” Adnyana said. “Benoa is located in Bali which perfectly acts as a hub as Bali sits in the middle of Indonesia and also being the central of tourism activity.”

He welcomed the increasing number of cruise visitors and potential to benefit other ports in the Indonesian archipelago.

But Ida Bagus Surakusuma, former chairman of the Bali Chapter of the Indonesian Congress and Convention Association (INCCA), said the government needs to be “cautious” in its pursuit of visitor targets.

“Which passengers are the target? Back then, cruise ships were definitely rich people,” he said. “But now people coming to Asia, including Bali, are second-class passengers. Rich people tend to choose the Mediterranean or Europe.”

Last month, Indonesia announced Australia was helping fund the creation of “10 new Balis” to help spread tourism investment across the country’s 34 provinces to the tune of $850million (£660m).

The mooted destinations include Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara, and Yogyakarta in Java.","Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2017/August/bali-GettyImages-567969903.jpg?impolicy=logo-overlay,"['cruise', '150m', 'work', 'port', 'terminal', 'balis', 'guy', 'ships', 'million', 'seeks', 'passengers', 'rich', 'indonesia', 'start', 'bali', 'tourism']", ,flood
8,8,Drought_Indonesia,Indonesian Researchers Discover New Species of Ghost Orchid - Netralnews,https://www.en.netralnews.com/news/currentnews/read/10287/indonesian.researchers.discover.new.species.of.ghost.orchid,"BANDUNG, NETRALNEWS.COM - Destario Metusala, researcher from Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), and Jatna Supriatna, researcher from Universitas Indonesia (UI), have published the discovery of a new species of ghost orchid group (holomikotropik) with the name of Gastrodia Bambu.

Destario Metusala said to Antara on Saturday (8/26/2017) that Gastrodia Bambu is thought to require very specific ecological conditions. This new orchid species is also sensitive to environmental changes.

This orchid is very sensitive to drought, excess light intensity, and also changes in the growing medium. Disturbance to its habitat; Such as the opening of bamboo clumps, are expected to have an impact on moisture changes, the intensity of light and also the biological properties of the growth medium, thus disrupting the growth of this orchid population.

Due to its high sensitivity, this group of holomikotropic orchids is an interesting object to observe the vulnerability of the tropical orchid community to the effects of climate change.

The species name is derived from the Indonesian word ""bamboo"" referring to its specific habitat around the bamboo groves. Based on record population records, this species is an endemic orchid that only exist in Java, especially West Java and Yogyakarta. The population is also limited and faces high habitat degradation pressure.

A description of this new species of orchid has been published in the international scientific journal ""Phytotaxa"" in mid-August 2017.

This orchid group is called a ghost because of its often unexpected appearance and without having leaf organ (vegetative phase).

""Moreover, this orchid loves dark, humid habitat and is always adjacent to an old bamboo grove.It is not surprising that this species has the impression of 'haunted' connotation,"" said the researcher who is based in the Center for Conservation of Botanical Garden Purwodadi - LIPI .","Thu, 02 May 2019 01:15:58 GMT",http://www.netralnews.com/foto/2017/08/26/370-anggrek_hantu_holomikotropik_jenis_anggrek_yang_terancam_punah-696x341.jpg,"['researcher', 'species', 'sensitive', 'habitat', 'published', 'bamboo', 'population', 'ghost', 'discover', 'indonesian', 'orchid', 'specific', 'group', 'researchers']", ,drought

Congratulations ASEAN! Today, the ASEAN celebrates its 50th anniversary. It is an amazing feat that ASEAN has been able to maintain its international presence for five decades, while also uniting the region and spurring regional economic growth.

ASEAN is regarded as the world’s second most successful regional grouping after the European Union (EU), although many of its citizens tend to belittle its progress. For many Indonesians and likely other citizens of the region, ASEAN is just a toothless body with little impact on their lives — even though Jakarta is the de-facto capital of the trade bloc.

For this reason, ASEAN strives to make itself much more relevant through becoming an “ASEAN Community” in almost all spheres of life.

However, ASEAN is often perceived by the international media as a weak organization, or worse, a puppet of much stronger powers, such as the United States and China. It has faced conflicts among members, and has even confronted the danger of extinction.

Its two basic principles — consensus and non-interference — are undoubtedly its fundamental sources of weakness, but also its strengths. Critics insist ASEAN could be much more progressive if members took more democratic procedures in making decisions. Often a decision or policy could not be made or implemented just because one member raised an objection.

Today, as the foreign ministers of the 10-member grouping commemorate ASEAN’s 50th anniversary in Manila, they must have the courage and political determination to progress much further.

When foreign ministers of the five founding members — Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand — signed the Bangkok Declaration on Aug. 8, 1967, one of the most crucial reasons for them to unite was to block the sweeping power of communism in Southeast Asia.

Today, apart from becoming the engine of multilateral economic cooperation with the outside world, ASEAN has become a key factor behind the political and security stability in this territory.

Yet ASEAN must find ways to move forward. For instance, for too long members have been bogged down by differences in getting China to agree on a code of conduct in the South China Sea, given their economic interests in the northern neighbor. Without a clear code of conduct, our fishermen, for instance, are still unable to operate without fear in waters bordering China’s claim of its vast “nine-dash-line.” Even agreeing to a “framework” for the code on Sunday is hailed as a major achievement.

ASEAN should consider ending rigid consensus and non-interference practices. In selected issues, voting should be allowed, though following consultations.

Indonesia, as the largest founding member both in economic size and population, should take a leading role in determining ASEAN’s new direction, given its status as primus inter pares (first among equals) in the grouping.

Furthermore, members should contribute to ASEAN in accordance with their economic weight, and not pay equal contributions as they currently practice.","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2017/08/08/2017_08_08_30730_1502154960._large.jpg,"['golden', 'editorial', 'progress', 'economic', 'asean', 'regional', 'jakarta', 'china', 'political', 'code', 'jubilee', 'region', 'members']", ,none
10,10,Drought_Indonesia,Is Duterte's War on Drugs Migrating to Indonesia? - The News Lens 關鍵評論網,https://international.thenewslens.com/article/77381,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s murderous “war on drugs” may now be claiming victims beyond his country’s borders: suspected drug dealers in Indonesia.

A recent University of Melbourne analysis indicates that Indonesian police killed an estimated 49 suspected drug dealers in the first six months of 2017. That is a sharp rise from 14 such killings in all of 2016 and 10 in 2015. Ominously, more than one-third of the total police killings from January to June 2017 occurred after the suspects had surrendered to police.

That increase in police killings of drug suspects has coincided with a series of public statements by senior Indonesian government and National Police officials expressing support for Duterte’s anti-drug campaign. But what Indonesian government and police officials overlook in their full throated support of a Duterte-style drug war is the horrific damage it has inflicted on Philippine society.

Indonesia’s National Narcotics Agency (BNN) head, Comr. Gen. Budi Waseso kicked off those expressions of support in September 2016 by calling for Indonesian police to adopt Duterte-style “drug war” methods. Using language reminiscent of Duterte’s public disparagement of the humanity of drug users, Waseso sought to justify such a lawless approach by stating that “The life of a [drug] dealer is meaningless.” He reiterated that stance in July with praise for Duterte’s drug war, saying that it “shows he is taking care of his citizens.”

Waseso is no outlier. On 20 July, the National Police chief, Gen. Tito Karnavian, made an explicit reference to Duterte’s campaign when unveiling a new approach to combating drugs in Indonesia: “shooting drug dealers.” The next day, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo issued the equivalent of a “shoot to kill” order by instructing police who encounter foreign drug dealers who resist arrest to “Gun them down. Give no mercy.”

Those views seem to have been persuasive. On 9 August, Jakarta’s police chief said that when dealing with suspected drug dealers, “sending them to God” would take priority over arrest and prosecution. Inspector General Idham Azis’ not-very-veiled threat to summarily execute drug suspects was compounded by his pledge to “take responsibility for his subordinates’ actions if they shoot alleged drug traffickers during raids.”

Duterte boasts that the more than 7,000 victims of the drug war have been “drug lords,” but Indonesia’s officials should take note that the profile of the vast majority of those victims indicates it’s more accurately a war on the poor. Human Rights Watch field research found that government claims that the deaths of suspected drug users and dealers were lawful were blatant falsehoods.

Our research painted a chilling portrait of mostly impoverished urban slum dwellers being gunned down in state-sanctioned “death squad” operations that ignore rule-of-law protections. Interviews with witnesses and victims’ relatives and analysis of police records exposed a pattern of unlawful police conduct designed to paint a veneer of legality over extrajudicial executions that may amount to crimes against humanity. The investigations revealed that police routinely execute drug suspects and then cover up their crimes by planting drugs and guns at the scene.

Efforts to seek accountability for drug war deaths have gone nowhere. Duterte and some of his key ministers have praised the killings as proof of the “success” of the anti-drug campaign, making them potentially culpable for incitement and instigation of crimes against humanity. Duterte and his supporters have also threatened, harassed and intimidated any institutions and individuals—including United Nations officials—who have sought accountability for abuses linked to the drug war.

On August 16, Duterte extended that campaign to human rights organizations, calling for police to shoot human rights activists “who are part of [drug activity]. If they are obstructing justice, you shoot them.”

Indonesia is already wrestling with the toxic legacy of impunity for the mass killings of least 500,000 people in 1965–66, when the government gave free rein to soldiers and local militias to kill anyone they considered a “communist.” Unless Jokowi speaks out forcefully against a Duterte drug war model of crime control, he risks being responsible for a mass killing campaign that could demolish Indonesia’s fragile and hard fought-for rights and freedoms.

11,11,Drought_Indonesia,Indonesian Cave Reveals Nearly 5000 Years of Tsunamis - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/indonesian-cave-reveals-nearly-5000-years-of-tsunamis,"The cave didn’t look that promising from the outside, Charlie Rubin remembers. But when the earthquake geologist and his colleagues walked in and started digging, “our jaws dropped,” he said. The researchers noticed that a depression in the floor of the cave—near Banda Aceh, Indonesia—contained distinct stratigraphy: dark layers of organic material separated by clearly defined layers of lighter-colored sand.

“We looked at each other and wondered if the sand was tsunami sand,” Rubin said. After closer examination, the team members realized they had found a natural record of tsunamis sweeping sand repeatedly into the cave over thousands of years. By radiocarbon dating the sandy layers, the researchers were able to achieve what’s often thought of as a holy grail in tsunami science: a reconstruction of when previous tsunamis occurred thousands of years in the past.

The massive waves were not regular in time: Periods of calm ranged from millennia to merely decades. Rubin and his colleagues showed that at least 11 tsunamis had swept over the region over a span of about 5,000 years. But the massive waves were not regular in time: Periods of calm ranged from millennia to merely decades. This finding—that tsunami recurrence intervals are highly variable—is proof that regional hazard mitigation plans should be based on the high likelihood of future destructive tsunamis rather than estimates of recurrence intervals, the team suggests. That’s particularly important in the Indian Ocean, a region that’s prone to megathrust earthquakes and, accordingly, large tsunamis. Those massive waves include the deadliest tsunami in history, which was unleashed in 2004 not far offshore from where the cave is located and which killed more than 200,000 people.

The geological record contained within the Banda Aceh cave is “extraordinary,” said Brian McAdoo, a tsunami scientist at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. This study also represents the first time that cave data have been used to measure tsunami recurrence intervals, McAdoo said.

A Layer Cake

In 2011 and 2012, Rubin and his colleagues excavated six trenches at the rear of the 120-meter-long coastal cave. Beneath a crust of sand topped with bat guano they dug into alternating layers of sand and organic material that reached depths of 2 meters in some places. The scientists carefully collected tiny pieces of charcoal and shells from the layers and radiocarbon dated the material in the laboratory. Using these radiocarbon measurements, the team calculated the most likely age of each of the 11 buried layers of sand and therefore the approximate date of each tsunami.

Powerful waves from the 2004 tsunami triggered by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake may have swept into the cave, literally erasing the geological record laid down after 900 BCE. The researchers found that the 11 sand layers spanned roughly 4,500 years, from about 7,400 to 2,900 years ago. However, the guano-encrusted 12th and uppermost sand layer—which contained shreds of clothing, suggesting it was deposited very recently—differed from the stack of alternating deposits beneath it: Its bottom face was jagged and irregular, unlike the smooth boundaries between the deeper layers.

The scientists suspect that this irregularity resulted from powerful waves from the 2004 tsunami triggered by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake sweeping into the cave, scraping away previously deposited material, and literally erasing the geological record laid down after 900 BCE. The older layers of sand were probably never disrupted in a similar way because they’re located in a natural depression in the cave, Rubin said. “They’re packed down and they’re protected.”

The research team reported its findings last month in Nature Communications.

Far from Constant

Rubin and his team showed that the time span between successive tsunamis is far from constant: Although 10 intervals within 4,500 years breaks down to an average of 450 years between the events, the researchers found evidence of one 2,000-year period free of tsunamis and also a single century that saw four tsunamis. “This study provides new evidence that tsunami recurrence can be highly variable,” said Katrin Monecke, a geoscientist at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass.

The researchers, who included experts in earthquake science, hypothesized that the thickness of each sand layer reflects the magnitude of the tsunami-causing earthquake because a larger earthquake would produce a larger tsunami and therefore plausibly transport more sand into the cave. According to this theory, the thickest sand layer, measuring roughly 25 centimeters, should correspond to the strongest earthquake that occurred within the nearly 5,000 years of history recorded in the cave.

“The only way to get at tsunami older than historical records is with geology.” The scientists inferred that no tsunamis occurred for more than 2,100 years after this thickest layer of sand was laid down. This extremely long interseismic gap is consistent with a period of reduced stress along faults—and therefore of a lower probability of another quake—after a massive temblor released a large amount of energy, the team suggests. Conversely, the researchers found that the four sand layers corresponding to the four tsunamis that occurred within 100 years of each other were all thin (fewer than 10 centimeters), which makes sense, they argued in their paper, because short interseismic periods are consistent with weaker earthquakes.

Rubin said he and his colleagues hope to find additional caves containing evidence of past subduction zone earthquakes. Although other complementary techniques exist for determining that tsunamis occurred in the past, for example, oral histories and chemical analysis, Rubin and his team are excited to literally dig into the past. “The only way to get at tsunami older than historical records is with geology,” Rubin said.

Police have received information that Malaysian national Tee Kok King, who escaped from Bali’s Kerobokan Penitentiary in June along with three other foreign inmates, may be in his home country.

Another escapee, Australian national Shaun Edward Davidson, was still believed to be in Indonesia, Bali Police chief Insp. Gen. Petrus Reinhard Golose said on Tuesday.

""We have been coordinating with Malaysian authorities, as we suspect he is already in Malaysia,"" Petrus told journalists.

The police chief said Malaysian authorities were willing to help find Tee. However, should the inmate really be in the country, he could not be extradited to Indonesia, given that Malaysian law prohibits citizens from being extradited from the country, Petrus said.

""It is a real obstacle that the inmate is [probably] already in his country, but we will continue to cooperate with Malaysia,"" he said.

As for Davidson, who is believed to still be in Bali, Petrus said police would intensify monitoring at the Timor-Leste border in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT).

Two other inmates, Bulgarian Dimitar Nikolov Iliev and Indian Sayed Muhammad Said, were arrested in Timor-Leste four days after their escape.

The four inmates escaped on June 19 through an old unused tunnel.

Three former presidents on Thursday joined President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo in celebrating Indonesia’s Independence Day at the State Palace.

The country's third president Baharuddin Jusuf Habibie, fifth president Megawati Soekarnoputri and her successor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accompanied Jokowi for the Palace’s flag-hoisting ceremony to mark the country's 72nd anniversary.

The three former leaders, who wore traditional attire from across the country, also joined him for lunch.

Also present at the celebration were Vice President Jusuf Kalla, former vice president Boediono and wife of the country's fourth president, Sinta Nuriyah Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur' Wahid. Gus Dur passed away in December 2009.

It was the first time Yudhoyono joined the celebration at the State Palace after leaving office in 2014. He chose to celebrate Independence Day at his home town of Pacitan, East Java, in the past two years.

Megawati, meanwhile, skipped the event during Yudhoyono’s 10-year tenure and only made an appearance at the Palace after Jokowi — who is a member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), of which she is chairwoman — was elected president in 2014.

Speaking after the ceremony, Yudhoyono told reporters: ""I hope Indonesia will stay united and that we can develop this nation together.

Our most popular apple variety is the Fuji apple, which we export to the whole of far East Asia. The Fuji apple is the most popular variety in these countries. The consumers prefer sweet, juicy and crispy apples. In addition, Fuji apples keep better in high temperatures, which is very suitable for markets with limited a cold chain infrastructure,” explains Richard, Alfa Fruit Packers’s GM. “Demand for Fuji apples is growing in the Far East, as well as on the Chinese domestic market. Chinese production of this variety is increasing as well.”“Historically, Southeast Asia is a large trading partner. In recent years, some markets have become increasingly difficult to supply. Indonesia has introduced a quota system that is affecting our sales in that country. In addition, it is mandatory for SGS to approve each shipment before it can be sent.

18,18,Drought_Indonesia,'Spongy' Soil Can Help Farmers Combat Climate Change - InsideClimate News,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09082017/climate-change-agriculture-farm-soil-soybeans-cover-crop-water-drought/,"Droughts are expected to worsen and intense storms to become more frequent across much of the country in coming decades as the planet warms, but their impact on agriculture could be blunted if American farmers focus on their roots.

A new study, released Wednesday, examines the benefits of cover cropping—planting soil-enriching plants between crop cycles—and other soil-boosting practices used around the world, with a close look at Iowa, one of the Midwest’s top-producing agriculture states. The study determined that farmers could help their land better withstand some of the effects of a warming climate by making their soil more “spongy.”

“Spongy soil holds more water,” said Andrea Basche, the study’s author and a Kendall Science Fellow in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program. “What we found to be the most effective and consistent way to get more porous soil is keeping roots there.”

That certain practices help build soil health—including cover-cropping or “no-till,” in which farmers refrain from plowing soil—has long been understood in agriculture. But in the American Midwest, where corn and soybeans are the most widely grown crops, few farmers have embraced these practices. As little as 2 percent of growers in the Mississippi River basin plant cover crops, despite evidence suggesting they not only boost yields but also make soil more resilient to increasingly volatile weather.

Basche set out to understand the specific impacts of soil-building practices, in part to make a clear case to farmers and the architects of farm policy.

“I see this as being the first [study] to quantify how some of these simple steps can make a big difference,” she said. “Do we understand what the benefit is of healthier soil, and do we understand the practices that can get us there? Those are the questions we tried to answer.”

150 Experiments on Six Continents

Basche looked at 150 field experiments across six continents and found that nearly two-thirds showed that soil held water better if any of a number of soil-building practices were used, including cover cropping, “no-till” and rotational planting, among others. Of those practices, she found that maintaining “continuous living cover”—by growing cover crops or perennial crops—proved the best strategy for improving soil’s ability to absorb water.

“This improvement is likely related to the creation of continuous root systems in the soil, which contribute to topsoil retention, increased levels of soil carbon, enhanced biological activity, and reduced water loss from runoff,” Basche wrote. “This is a novel scientific finding that can help prioritize the practices that help reduce climate risks.”

In Iowa, 60 Percent Less Runoff

In Iowa, which struggled through extreme storms and drought in recent years, Basche found that cover and perennial crops could make more water available for absorption by crops — up to 11 percent more — and would reduce runoff by 9 to 15 percent. In drought years, when rain absorption is even more critical, the benefits were greater. Basche’s analysis found that in 2012, a year of extreme drought in Iowa, rooted soils had 60 percent less runoff than soils without cover or perennial crops.

While the percentage of Midwestern acres planted with cover or perennial crops may be going up, according to a recent survey, Basche and other proponents of soil-boosting practices say there are still too many obstacles and too few incentives for many farmers to make the change.

“It takes time for farmers to figure out how to plant cover crops,” Basche said. “There’s a cost to seed and labor. It complicates management. There’s no way of getting around that.”

Too Much Emphasis on Short-Term Insurance

U.S. Department of Agriculture policies have, for decades, promoted the expansion of soybeans and corn, at the expense of a more diverse mix of crops. Critics say the department places too much emphasis on short-term crop insurance to help farmers in drought or flood conditions, rather than on soil-building practices that could make farms more resilient in the long term.

“We need more perennials in our cropping systems, as the report suggests,” said Ferd Hoefner, policy director for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, which has long advocated cover cropping. “Conservation, research and commodity and crop insurance policy reform is critical to making that happen.”

A drought in the Plains states this year, growing fertilizer-caused water pollution and recent reports that the “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico—caused by nitrogen runoff—has reached its biggest size ever, only underscore the need for policies that promote soil-building practices, proponents say.

“We need to have roots in the soil,” Basche said.","Wed, 09 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://mk0insideclimats3pe4.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/soybeans-field-water_scott-olson-getty.jpg,"['cover', 'change', 'practices', 'help', 'farmers', 'crops', 'drought', 'agriculture', 'water', 'soil', 'spongy', 'combat', 'basche', 'climate']", ,flood_and_drought
19,19,Drought_Indonesia,SE Asia Report: AUD adds to importer strain | Vietnam increases buffalo imports | Ethiopia feedlot project - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/live-export/se-asia-report/se-asia-report-aud-adds-to-importer-strain-vietnam-increases-buffalo-imports-ethiopia-feedlot-project/,"To view the Bahasa Indonesian language version of this article click here

Indonesia: Slaughter Steers AUD $3.85/kg live weight (Rp 10,400 = $1AUD)

Slaughter cattle prices remain the same this month at about Rp 40,000 per kg live weight with the change in the AUD price above due entirely to the steep rise in the AUD exchange rate.

With steady prices for feeder cattle in Australia during July this has meant additional pain for importers who need to exchange a lot more Rupiah to get their foreign currency to purchase more cattle.

Feedlot inventories are generally running at below 50% after a reasonable number of sales over the Ramadan/Lebaran period cleared their backlog of fat cattle. Weak, post Lebaran demand has meant that only one new shipment of feeder cattle arrived in Indonesia during July while about 5 shipments are booked for August with all of these being purchased at the new expensive exchange rates.

For the first time in my memory of this trade (and I have been involved since the beginning) the Australian producer is the only part of the supply chain enjoying a profit margin.

The Indonesian importers, shipping companies and Australian exporters are all experiencing trading conditions which essentially mean that if they continue with their business, they must make a loss.

This is the reverse of the situation for the last 27 years where in almost every case, when trading margins were squeezed, producers were the ones who were forced to cut their sale prices in order to allow the trade to continue.

Logic would suggest that a trade cannot be sustained if the majority of the stakeholders along the supply chain are making losses.

The two key areas for price movements are the sale price of live feeder cattle in Australia and slaughter cattle in Indonesia. The price of feeders in Australia is being held firm by the very low numbers of stock following the drought. The price of slaughter cattle in Indonesia is being held down by the presence of Indian beef and the government ban on price rises. I expect that Indian beef is here to stay and that the government will have no reason to relax the ban on price rises so that only leaves an Australian cattle price reduction to save the day for importers, exporters and shipping companies. Or the trade slowly comes to a grinding halt. Something has to change, as the current situation is not sustainable.

The disruption in Indian buffalo exports has not impacted supplies in Indonesia as official figures state that there were 27,000 tons remaining in cold stores on the 5th of July with a further 1,148 tons imported later in July.

During July, Indian courts announced that the government’s ban on buffalo sales was illegal so selling of buffalo through traditional markets has recommenced allowing export abattoirs to get back to normal slaughter rates.

My agents in Jakarta continue to report that many small wet market traders are unable to obtain supplies of buffalo from wholesalers.

Further inquiry suggests that the reason for this is that wholesalers need to move large volumes of product because the margins per kg of buffalo beef are very small which makes it unattractive to supply very small-scale retail customers.

The broader trade in Indian beef seems to be continuing strongly with key customers in the bakso ball manufacturing industry, Betawi Soup and Padang restaurant shops consuming very large quantities.

Slaughter numbers of live cattle remain at about 50% of their pre-Indian buffalo rates which suggests that the demand for Indian product has reached a steady state with each product sharing about 50% of the original fresh meat market.

Another winner from the Indian beef importations is the Cold Chain industry.

The industry association reports that installed capacity is 245,000 tons which is usually replaced 5 times per year allowing the total volume of product handled to be around 1.2 million tons annually. If the Indian beef imports continue, this capacity will need to expand.

The DGLS announced that the Special Acceleration Program on Mandatory Cattle Pregnancy (SIWAB) had not been successfully implemented for a number of reasons. I suspect that one of those reasons is that small farmers are more likely to be considering selling their cattle rather than breeding more as demand for slaughter animals has halved and the government has fixed slaughter cattle prices at unattractively low levels.

In another interesting news article this month the dramatic reduction in the number of dairy cattle was announced with the national herd shrinking from 576,000 cows in 2011 to an estimated 300,000 in 2017. And this reduction in numbers has taken place while the per capita consumption of milk products has been steadily rising.

Vietnam: Slaughter Steers AUD $3.82/kg (VND17,800 to $1AUD)

Slaughter cattle markets across Vietnam remain weak with demand in the south softer than the north. Butchers in the south are only interested in bidding on steers and bulls under 500kg with rates equivalent to last month’s Dong 68,000 per kg offered only for the very best yielding cattle.

The market in the north is much stronger with heavy bulls selling for as high as Dong 75,000 per kg live weight. Medium slaughter cows are attracting bids of around Dong 64 – 66,000.

The general theme of the market remains the same however with high import prices being strongly resisted by retail customers.

This is causing importers to reduce numbers purchased and do everything they can to cut the cost of their product. The main strategy to date has been to import low priced slaughter cows and buffalo from Australia. Buffalo have done well in Vietnamese feedlots so we may well see an increase in demand for this class of stock if the prices of Aussie live export cattle remain high.

Despite these problems, Vietnamese supply chains continue to innovate their down stream distribution networks. Dong Ha Trading Co is a good example, developing their new fresh beef distribution systems at Can Tho in the Mekong Delta province. See their upgraded meat shop in the photo below designed to sell hygienic beef product from Australian imported cattle.

Thailand: Slaughter Steers AUD $3.80/kg (Baht 26.3 to $1AUD)

No significant changes in the Thai market as the main export markets to China and Vietnam remain effectively closed leaving only the steady domestic trade to keep the wheels turning.

Malaysia: Slaughter Steers AUD $3.52 per/kg (RM3.35 to $1 AUD)

Nothing to report in Malaysia either with even the frozen buffalo prices remaining steady for a change at 22 Ringgit per kg.

Philippines: Slaughter Cattle AUD $2.78/kg (Peso 39.5 to AUD$1)

My agent reports the continuation of good business conditions across the Philippines despite the extension of Martial Law until the end of December 2017. Good seasons and solid markets keep the products flowing and the prices of most agricultural commodities strong and stable. The Philippines has rarely had such an extended period of favourable seasons and economic prosperity. Meat and livestock prices remained stable during July.

China: Slaughter Cattle AUD $4.38/kg (RMB 5.3 = AUD$1)

This month has seen a small but significant increase in the price of live cattle in the Beijing region from Y21.5 per kg live weight in June to Y23.2 per kg in July.

The Inner Mongolian drought continues although some limited areas have experienced useful rains. The figures provided to me suggest that about 35% of pastures remain affected by drought conditions.

Brunei

I spent a week in Brunei in July. Imported food is very expensive.

Despite the rising trend of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in Indonesia, an economist believes that online-based businesses have increased risk of bad debt if the lenders ignore the importance of supervision.

The credit application mechanism in P2P lending is risky. There is no integrated costumer blacklist data-base like in the banking industry, said Samuel Aset Manajemen economist Lana Soelistianingsih said in Jakarta on Friday.

She said applicants for loans just presented their legal documents such as identity cards and vehicle ownership certificates to get loans.

""If you apply for a loan at banks or in pawnshops, they will hold your physical documents, but in P2P lending, we do not know whether or not the same scanned documents are being used for other loan applications,"" Lana said at the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) building in Jakarta on Friday.

Moreover, she said P2P lending offered annual interest rates of up to 18.5 percent to investors, adding that such aggressive offers could increase the risk of business failure.

She also said the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) did not guarantee deposits in P2P lending and in addition to the risk, the data for P2P lending is not covered by the Financial Service Authority (OJK).

""This is a risky business and unfortunately our people love risky things. The OJK must regulate this soon,"" she said.

22,22,Drought_Indonesia,Successful prediction of multi-year US droughts and wildfire risk: Longer-term forecasts will benefit agriculture and natural resource management - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170801094509.htm,"The next mega-droughts and subsequent active wildfire seasons for the western U.S. might be predictable a full year in advance, extending well beyond the current seasonal forecast and helping segments of the economy related to agriculture, water management and forestry.

The new model, developed by an international team of scientists from the U.S., South Korea and U.K., and led by Utah State University climate scientist Yoshimitsu Chikamoto, was reported in the July 26 edition of Scientific Reports.

The source of this improved predictability is based on a combination of factors, including tropical climate variability, global climate change and the natural filtering effects of soils. To mitigate drought-induced socioeconomic risks, water resource managers require detailed drought forecasts as far in advance as possible. Climate prediction centers generate and routinely disseminate seasonal drought outlooks. However, predicting multi-year droughts that reach well beyond seasonal timescales is challenging for climate scientists.

Over the past 15 years, parts of the western U.S. have experienced severe drought conditions and an increasing number of wildfires that take a toll on people and ecosystems. The team's research shows that in addition to contributions from natural forcings and global warming, temperature differences between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans play a role in causing drought and increasing wildfire risks. The new findings show that a warm Atlantic and a relatively cold Pacific enhance the risk for drought and wildfire in the southwestern U.S.

""According to our study, the Atlantic/Pacific temperature difference shows pronounced variations on timescales of more than 5 years,"" explained Chikamoto, USU associate professor in the department of Plants, Soils and Climate. ""Like swings of a very slow pendulum, this implies that there is predictability in the large-scale atmosphere/ocean system, which we expect will have a substantial societal benefit.""

The new findings of successful multi-year drought/fire predictions are based on a series of computer modeling experiments, using the state-of-the-art earth system model, the most detailed data on current ocean temperature and salinity conditions, and the climate responses to natural and human-linked radiative forcing. The results of the experiments are presented in the online Scientific Reports.

""We found that, even 10-months after the starting prediction, the model was tracking the observation-based soil water conditions very well,"" Chikamoto said. ""This implies that drought and fire conditions in the next water year can be predicted from the previous winter.""

""This is a surprising result,"" said co-author Lowell Stott from the University of South California. ""The atmospheric river is an important source for California water resources, but its predictability is limited to the atmospheric short memory of 2 weeks. Of course, we cannot predict an exact location, duration and timing of each drought event beyond several weeks. However, our result of multi-year drought predictability suggests that the annual frequency of atmospheric river water supply is controlled by large-scale climate variability and change. This frequency change in drought condition is much more predictable beyond several seasons.""

""There are three predictable processes,"" explained co-author Axel Timmermann, director of the Institute for Basic Science Center for Climate Physics, Pusan National University in South Korea. ""At first, tropical ocean temperature contrast between Pacific and Atlantic causes slow climate variability due to its large thermodynamical inertia, and then affects the atmospheric high-pressure ridge off the California coast via global teleconnections. Secondly, the slow variation in this high-pressure ridge is enhanced by filtering out the atmospheric noise through land soil processes. Thirdly, global climate change contributes to the long-term drying trend in the West. A combination of these three processes explains the recent southwestern U.S. drought event for 2011-2014.""

The application of this findings is anticipated to be in great demand. ""Our study clearly demonstrates a new possibility of international, ongoing, decadal forecasting activities, said co-author Magdalena Balmaseda from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. ""We anticipate that multi-year drought predictions will be available soon by collaborating with operational forecast centers.""","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['successful', 'change', 'predictability', 'prediction', 'forecasts', 'multiyear', 'global', 'longerterm', 'atmospheric', 'wildfire', 'resource', 'climate', 'natural', 'conditions', 'water', 'risk', 'management', 'temperature', 'drought']", ,drought
23,23,Drought_Indonesia,"The key to drought-tolerant crops may be in the leaves: Leaf wax acts as the equivalent of 'lip balm' for plants, protecting them from the harmful effects of drought - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170815145836.htm,"A solution to help farmers to grow crops in dry areas or during stretches of drought may depend on breeding and cultivating plants that protect themselves with a thicker layer of leaf wax, a new study shows.

Sarah Feakins, a scientist at USC who has studied leaf wax in the context of climate change, teamed up recently with researchers at Texas A&M University to research and develop drought-resistant crops. During tests with growing winter wheat, a type harvested for yeast-based breads and other such products, the team found that the cultivars in a high and dry area of Texas generated more protective wax on their leaves as a measure to protect themselves against more extreme conditions.

The results mimicked what scientists have found in leaves in natural ecosystems: Those that survive in dry climates have higher concentrations of wax.

""Water conservation depends on innovation, and in this case, we are hoping to find one solution by identifying the traits in this important food crop that would enable the wheat plants to tolerate drought and still produce plenty for harvest,"" said Feakins, a co-lead author of the study and an associate professor of earth sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

The study was published in the journal Organic Geochemistry on Aug. 14.

Dry vs. regular moist conditions

All plants produce wax that helps their leaves repel water and shield the plant from insects and the elements, said Feakins, who has studied climate history of the Earth through the geochemistry of leaf wax in sediments.

Feakins said this latest study marks the first time she has applied her expertise to agricultural production. The United States is currently the top exporter of wheat in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Winter wheat is largely grown for bread products and ingredients, such as all-purpose flour.

For the study, the researchers grew test plots of winter wheat in two different areas of Texas: the high plains of Amarillo and a farming area known as Winter Garden, Uvalde.

At each location, scientists grew 10 cultivars, or plant varieties, of winter wheat that received regular irrigation and another 10 cultivars that received 13 percent to 25 percent less irrigation. The team compared the leaf wax of all the plots to gauge their drought tolerance.

The plot set to receive 25 percent less irrigation in Winter Garden ended up receiving 13 percent less because of greater-than-expected rainfall. But a similar plot grown with 25 percent less water in the most arid area, Amarillo, generated 50 percent more paraffin on its leaves than the other cultivars in all the other plots, which enabled the plants to tolerate their dry conditions.

""We see a strong effect in the higher and drier location,"" Feakins said. ""We see the plants adapt to their environment and to better protect their leaves, allowing them to respond well to reduced irrigation.""

The lower available water was tracked through carbon isotopes in the plant leaves and in the waxes themselves, tools that are used to reconstruct climates of the past from ancient waxes in sediments.

""This is part of an effort to breed crops that are more drought-resistant. In the world that we are in today, with warming reducing available water, there will be more demand for crops that are drought-resistant,"" Feakins said.

Feakins said the team will next consider which of their cultivated wheat crop offers the best resilience and are able to generate high yields with low irrigation or precipitation.

24,24,Drought_Indonesia,UN sanctions could send North Korean economy plunging as much as 5% - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/UN-sanctions-could-send-North-Korean-economy-plunging-as-much-as-5,"TOKYO -- North Korea is in for a plunge in economic activity, following new economic sanctions by the United Nations, on top of tumbling trade with China and the worst drought since 2001.

Despite its rapid progress in ballistic missile capabilities, much of the North Korean economy remains undeveloped and mired in poverty, with few sources of economic growth other than mining and agriculture.

The new economic sanctions, introduced Saturday by the U.N. Security Council, have eliminated the sources of what growth is left in the economy -- coal, iron ore and other minerals exports.

North Korea's economy is likely to shrink around 5% in 2017, according to Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.

Such a contraction would be by far the worst in recent years. North Korea's economy recorded negative growth in five of the last 11 years, but the scale of contraction was usually around 1%, according to data from the Bank of Korea.

The North Korean economy shrank 4.4% in 1995, when the country was hit by one of the worst famines in its history, which left more than 2 million people dead.

The new sanctions came as the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned July 20 of the worst drought since 2001 and of a severe food shortage over the next few months in North Korea.

According to the FAO, early season crop production is down 30% compared to last year.

A brewing economic crisis follows a rare expansion of 3.9% in 2016, the fastest in 17 years, on the back of surging coal exports to China.

North Korea depends on China for some 90% of its trade, following a sharp reduction in trade with neighboring South Korea.

Since mid-February, however, China has sharply curtailed its coal imports from North Korea, in line with U.N. sanctions introduced in November limiting the country's exports of coal -- its main export item -- to 7.5 million tons a year.

This has resulted in a drop of more than 50% in Chinese imports from North Korea in March-May from the preceding three-month period and sharply increased North Korea's trade deficit with China, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs.

The U.N. Security Council further tightened the sanctions Saturday, introducing a complete ban on North Korean exports of coal and iron ore as well as seafood exports.

According to Bank of Korea data, mining accounted for 13% of the economy, and agriculture and fishing about 22%. The two sectors accounted for much of the 3.9% growth in 2016, with other sectors showing little growth.

""With both mining and agriculture expected to contract in 2017, around 34% of the total economy of North Korea will be experiencing output declines,"" Biswas said.

""If the drought continues to impact the main crop, then the negative impact on agriculture could widen further,"" he added.

IHS Markit estimates North Korea's gross domestic product per capital at $1,355 for 2016, one of the lowest in Asia.

North Korea's poverty is striking, given its prowess in missile technology and the fact that it is surrounded by successful economies such as China, South Korea and Taiwan.

North Korea's leadership shows little sign of learning from its neighbors. ""They are not interested in anyone,"" Biswas said.

""Basically all the benefits have flown to a small group of people and to sustaining their military and weapons program.""

In a region where 3-6% growth is the norm, North Korea's growth has rarely exceeded 1%. The country is still unable to feed its own people and depends on China for help.

The question will be how long China is willing to allow North Korea to keep running trade deficits, with more money owed to China, without ever paying its bills.

The implementation of sanctions on Saturday has closed other avenues for foreign exchange for North Korea, by banning countries from increasing the number of North Korean guest workers. This will result in North Korea quickly depleting its foreign exchange reserves.

The deficit North Korea is running with China may not be large in the huge scale of China's wealth, but ""China doesn't want to be indefinitely paying for all these things"" -- and may put more pressure on Pyongyang to end its military provocations, he said.","Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F2%252F8%252F2%252F632822-8-eng-GB%252F20170807_northkorea1.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['economy', 'send', 'korean', 'korea', 'growth', 'economic', 'koreas', 'china', 'coal', 'plunging', 'north', 'trade', 'sanctions']", ,drought
25,25,Drought_Indonesia,Taiwanese soldiers' contribution to Indonesian independence recognized - Taiwan News,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3231674,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Indonesia will commemorate its 72nd anniversary of freedom from Dutch rule and Taiwanese soldiers are being recognized for their contribution to the victory.

One of them, Li Po-ching (李柏青), was born in 1922 in Tainan and voluntarily joined the Japanese Army under the Japanese name as Eiji Miyahara. He was then posted to Indonesia during the Second World War over 70 years ago.

After the Japan surrendered, around 1,000 soldiers from the Japanese Army deserted and stayed behind to join Indonesians in their fight for independence from their Dutch colonial rulers. Among these soldiers included men from Taiwan.

After the war, Li and approximately 300 of his comrades decided to stay in Indonesia for different reasons.

In an earlier interview with Li, he was concerned that he might be imprisoned when he made a trip to Taiwan in 1974, when the island was under the rule of martial law, as he also fought in the Japanese army against China's ""National Revolutionary Army"" in Myanmar. Li left Taiwan in a hurry after a brief meeting with his parents.

While living in Indonesia, he has contributed to promoting friendship between Indonesia and Japan by establishing the Yayasan Warga Persahabatan foundation and received many visitors from Japan as well as Taiwan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also came to visit him three times and paid his respects at Li’s foundation.

He is also a man who never forgot his roots, according to Poppy, a worker at the foundation. He said that even though Li usually communicated in Indonesian, he taught his children to be fluent in Chinese.

His dedication and service during and after the war was recognized by Indonesian government. In 2005, Li was invited to attend a ceremony marking Indonesia’s 60th Independence Day and was awarded a hero's medal by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, making him the first foreigner to receive such an honor.



Another Taiwanese contributor, Chen Chih-hsiung (陳智雄), who was given honorary citizenship by the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, also served in the Japanese Army in Indonesia during WWII.

Chen stayed in Indonesia after the war and sided with Sukarno in the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution and was imprisoned by the Dutch for a year.

Chen went back to Taiwan but was imprisoned in 1962 by the Taiwan Garrison Command and executed in 1963 for his involvement in promoting Taiwan independence.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/5991395aede58.jpg,"['war', 'recognized', 'contribution', 'li', 'japan', 'taiwan', 'indonesian', 'independence', 'soldiers', 'indonesia', 'japanese', 'taiwanese', 'army']", ,non
26,26,Drought_Indonesia,Climate Change Is Making This Bolivian Village a Ghost Town - InsideClimate News,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25082017/climate-change-shocks-bolivia-rural-poor-migration-agriculture-quinoa/,"SANTIAGO K, Bolivia — Someone’s nearly always lived in Santiago K.

Cupped in the Bolivian highlands that border Chile, the small village is littered by centuries of conquest and expansion: from the pre-Incas, who ringed the surrounding hills with protective fortresses, to the gold-hungry Spanish conquistadors drawn to the region’s mineral wealth.

But after centuries of settlement, Santiago K has become a ghost town. Drought, debt and climate change have squeezed roughly 80 percent of Santiago’s residents from their homes in search of work and a better life.

Justino Calcina, 58, is one of the few who stayed behind. As mayor of Santiago, he stayed because he had to. Only community leaders and the very old remain.

“Life in the community isn’t guaranteed,” Calcina says. Yellowed newspaper pages block the windows of abandoned houses. Herds of roaming llamas tramp through the streets. Most of Santiago’s younger families, Calcina says, have fled to Chile. There, men scavenge for jobs in construction, mining and seasonal farmwork. Women find work as domestic employees, cooking, cleaning and washing the clothes of better-off Chileans.

About 125 families lived in Santiago before the 2015-2016 drought. An estimated 25 remain.

The Promise of Quinoa

It is an ancient town. Settlement near Santiago dates to the 12th century. The Incas built a shrine at the peak of Caral Inka, a mountain to the west still used for traditional sun and rain ceremonies. The Spanish built Santiago’s church, which sits in the village center, from mud-brick and gravel. The small village has witnessed the rise, tottering and fall of empires, and outlasted them all.

Today, Santiago’s farmers draw much of their income from the production and sale of quinoa. A nutty grain indigenous to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru, quinoa traditionally was harvested by hand on smaller plots. In the dry Andes, scarce rainfall kept plants watered. Farmers sold most of their yields at a regional market or through cooperatives; the rest they set aside for personal use. South America’s upper-class spurned the grain as “Indian food.”

But then the world caught on. In 2012, a staggering uptick in demand for quinoa—from the United States especially—pushed Santiago’s farmers to expand production. Flush with bank credit, farmers purchased tractors and encroached on land normally left to wild shrubs. The idea was to harvest more, faster. And for a while, business was good. From 2000 to 2014, the price of quinoa tripled.

Then the rain stopped. For two seasons, from 2015 to 2016, as the El Niño weather cycle combined with rising global temperatures, crops shriveled. Production dropped to nothing. The river that jags through Santiago slowed to a trickle, then dried to sand.

At around the same time, Peru’s quinoa exports jumped. Supply pumped skyward. And in Bolivia, prices crashed, by as much as 75 percent from their peak in 2014.

All at once, with scanty crops and banks breathing down their necks, many of Santiago’s quinoa farmers faced a hard choice: move or perish.

Remarkably Vulnerable to Climate Change

Climate shocks tend to hit the poor the hardest and those in rural areas who often have fewer resources to recover quickly or to weather an extended drought. Studies in communities around the world have shown how climate shocks affect human health as food, water and crop income become more scarce and pressure migration.

As in much of South America, a spate of flooding, drought and mudslides have plagued Bolivia in the last decade because of El Niño events and changes in the climate. Bolivia is among the nations least responsible for climate change—in 2010, it released about 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption, as compared to 5,610 million metric tons emitted in the same year by the United States—yet the country is remarkably vulnerable to its effects.

Of all the countries impacted by climate change, Bolivia is among the most visibly affected. Whole glaciers have melted. In 2016, the country’s second-largest lake, Lake Poopó, dried up and vanished. In the same year, the worst drought in 25 years led Bolivia’s government to declare a state of emergency in 142 of Bolivia’s 339 municipalities. Residents of El Alto, the booming indigenous city splattered across the plateau above La Paz, took water authorities hostage.

It is among the most impoverished nations in South America. Land-locked and mapped by extremes of geography—from high desert to tropical jungle—Bolivia lacks the infrastructure of neighboring Chile and Argentina. What growth there is—in mining and agriculture mostly—hangs on scarce water sources. Nearly 40 percent of the country’s electricity is drawn from hydroelectric dams powered by glacial runoff and rainfall. In 2014, three-quarters of all employment outside of agriculture was informal. About 45 percent of the population lives in poverty.

Fleeing Failing Farms for Urban Insecurity

The increasing frequency of climate shocks, matched by the vulnerability of Bolivia’s population, makes Bolivia uniquely prone to natural disasters. Where climate change does not force migration directly, it sharpens existing points of insecurity.

“I would migrate, possibly, I would,” muses Hector Saturnine Lupa, 50, a quinoa farmer in Santiago. “This year, the quinoa is cheap, cheap. It doesn’t cover the costs of production.” Lupa says he plans to stay—his children live nearby—but it wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to migrate.

Santiago’s older residents have long leaned on migration when work is scarce. When a crippling drought struck the altiplano in the early 1980s, many, including Calcina and Lupa, sought employment elsewhere. Like today’s migrants, Lupa bounced between jobs in Chile, finding work in mines. But both Calcina and Luoa say last year’s drought, and the migration that tailed it, were particularly severe.

Depopulation can spell the end for a small town in the high desert. The effects, says Cristo Bernal Ramos, representative of the quinoa cooperative CEDEINKU, often are far-reaching. “Schools and health centers receive little assistance,” Ramos says. “With fewer inhabitants, there’s less power … and economically, it’s already been said. There’s no money.”

Rural migration within Bolivia tends to flow toward urban areas like El Alto, the booming city sprawled above La Paz. According to Raoul Kaezing, a researcher at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland, many households in Bolivia’s altiplano maintain a “double residency,” caring for a farm while studying or working in the nearest city.

The causes for migration in Bolivian highlands, however, are indistinct. A stream of interlocking vulnerabilities coax resettlement.

Many of these stem from the production boom of the last decade. Soaring prices encouraged farmers to borrow heavily, thinking that prices would hover near the same level. When prices tumbled, farmers were forced to find other means to pay off debts. With work meager in Santiago, migration seemed to many to be the logical choice.

Water Woes and Erosion Increase Vulnerability

The same spike of demand nurtured unsustainable and self-defeating practices of land use. Incentivized to harvest, Bolivian farmers pushed onto marginal lands ill-suited for production. According to a study by Lasse Sander and Sven-Erik Jacobsen, “the almost complete removal of natural … vegetation over large and continuous areas [resulted] in increased wind erosion and partial crop failure.” The effect was an “escalating, land-intensive production … characterized by high erosion rates and a dissipative resource use.” Another of Jacobsen’s studies links the introduction of the tractor and heavy machinery to a direct degradation of soil fertility. Rapid production allowed by machinery then tipped land quality into disequilibrium.

A paucity of rainfall did have an obvious hand in killing off crops. But Bolivia’s water troubles stem from more than drought alone, points out Dirk Hoffmann, former head of the Bolivian Mountain Institute. Faulty infrastructure and development restricted, and restricts, access to water. Existing water infrastructure strains to accommodate the exploding populations of urban areas; in the last 25 years, the size of El Alto has roughly tripled to more than 900,000 inhabitants. From 2006 to 2011 alone, one-third of Bolivia’s population migrated into cities. In addition, Bolivia’s mining industry filters off and contaminates large amounts of the limited fresh water in the altiplano.

What resulted was a crop and economy vulnerable most of all to climate change. Climate change, Hoffmann notes, acts in addition to “conditions already difficult in the high Andes, often making conditions still worse.” More than a cause for migration, climate change exacerbates existing pressures that push or pull someone from their home.

Finding a Future as Climate Extremes Sharpen

Nearly to the man, Santiago’s farmers remarked on the unusual shifting of weather patterns closely observed. Calcina says he’s noticed Bolivia’s climate sharpen to extremes over the past half century: bitter cold and terrible heat, beating rain and punishing drought. “Before it was much stabler. Rain arrived in the rainy season. There was a time for wind, when the wind came. But now it’s not like that,” he says.

With its super-grain now scarce, Santiago is exploring its options. “Our only sustenance in this town, and in this region, is—or was—quinoa,” Calcina says.

The solution Calcina prefers is community-based tourism. Thousands of tourists flock each year to nearby Uyuni, to see its expanse of salt flats, some of the largest in the world. Calcina is keen to tap some of this market. But financial resources are few, and Uyuni is three hours from Santiago by bus, the only road a rutted track pressed to the desert floor.

Mining offers another viable option, says Cristo Bernal Ramos. Uyuni is home to one of the world’s largest deposits of platinum; the same mineral wealth might be found in Santiago. “We need to consider every possibility,” Ramos says. “One must think about how we’ll live.”

Santiago K has received little outside support, but it has survived worse. Calcina believes life here will go on, as it always has—so long as someone stays; so long as someone makes sure it does. “I am not ready to leave my town,” he says, pausing to trace the sloping landscape by sight. “I am made for my land.”

27,27,Drought_Indonesia,India's Farmers Revive Traditional Grains in Face of Severe Drought - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/indias-farmers-revive-traditional-grains-face-severe-drought,"THIRUTHURAIPOONDI, INDIA - For Nel Jayaraman, the realization that hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides were making farmers more vulnerable to extreme weather came slowly.

In fields near the town of Thiruthuraipoondi in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Jayaraman saw yields falling and farmers' debt rising as their reliance on modern seeds and pesticides grew, even as the rains became increasingly fickle.

Thiruthuraipoondi, India

Fifteen years ago, Jayaraman gave up both, returning to traditional varieties and organic farming methods that had become nearly extinct in the Cauvery river delta region where his family had lived for generations.

Since then, he has revived about 150 indigenous varieties of rice, and become an evangelist for traditional seeds and organic farming, which he sees as key to combating the impact of climate change and protecting harvests and farmers' incomes.

""Hybrid varieties need more water, fertilizers and pesticides. They are just not sustainable in this region,"" he argued in his small office as a steady stream of farmers walked in and out to talk to him or buy seeds. ""We should go back to traditional varieties that are suited to this soil, that can withstand these conditions. It is the only way farmers can make a decent living.""

That is particularly crucial as Tamil Nadu faces its worst drought in more than a century, after the monsoon rains failed last year, he said.

Green Revolution

As India's population expanded quickly after its independence from colonial rule in 1947, the government backed a program to increase food production to meet rising demand.

The Green Revolution, launched in the 1960s, increased harvests with improved technology, including high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice developed by scientists, and greater use of chemical fertilizers.

While productivity rose, there has been criticism that the benefits were overstated, that the cultivation methods damaged the land and drained groundwater, and that the gene pool for staple crops narrowed, leaving farmers fewer options when faced with disease and drought.

Several organizations in southern India have since launched efforts to revive traditional cultivation and rice varieties.

FILE - Kashmiri farmers harvest paddy crops on the FILE - Kashmiri farmers harvest paddy crops on the outskirts of Srinagar, Sept. 14, 2015. FILE - Kashmiri farmers harvest paddy crops on the outskirts of Srinagar, Sept. 14, 2015.

The Center for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS), for example, has revived dozens of traditional rice varieties that are resistant to pests and disease, capable of dealing with floods and drought, and that have valuable medicinal properties.

""Particularly for coastal regions such as this, you need varieties that can handle the higher salinity of the soil and groundwater, and are resistant to drought,"" said Subhashini Sridhar at CIKS in neighboring Nagapattinam district.

""You need a large and diverse genetic pool to preserve these qualities,"" she said, citing the example of the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which hit Nagapattinam hard.

Afterward, only some traditional varieties could be successfully grown because salinity in the soil and groundwater was higher than normal.

Less damage

About 60 percent of India's population depends on land to make a living.

But while agriculture made up more than two-thirds of a farm family's income in the 1980s, its share is less than a third today as commodity prices have fallen but the costs of seed, fertilizer and pesticides have risen.

Rising debt — in part from harvests slashed by drought and uneven rainfall — has triggered tens of thousands of farmer suicides, including in Tamil Nadu.

Jayaraman and Sridhar see traditional seeds as a solution.

Farmers do not need to buy seed every year as they have to with hybrids — instead they simply save part of their harvest to replant — and the older varieties often need less water and do not need chemical fertilizers and pesticides, Jayaraman said.

A move to more healthful eating in India's cities has also sparked demand for traditional grains and organic fruits and vegetables, for which consumers are willing to pay more, he said.

About 37,000 farmers in the delta region are now cultivating traditional rice varieties, said Jayaraman.

Irregular rainfall and extreme weather, including drought in the Cauvery delta over the past decade, have convinced more farmers of their merits, he said.

""But it can be hard to switch, as the government subsidizes fertilizers and pesticides and gives cheap loans to farmers, leading them deeper into debt when crops fail or prices fall,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""Instead, they should subsidize organic farming and promote it better,"" he said.

100,000 varieties

India was once home to about 100,000 varieties of indigenous rice, but the Green Revolution wiped out most of them, and consumers began to prefer eating the fine-grained, polished white hybrid varieties that were promoted by the government.

Government support for reviving traditional grains and for organic farming has been uneven.

The northeastern state of Sikkim became the first organic state in January 2016. Nine other states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, have an organic farming policy.

Separately, organic farming is also drawing an unlikely enthusiast: city-dwelling professionals.

They include Senthil Kumar, a former software engineer who quit his job a year ago to focus on his seven-acre (three-hectare) organic farm, a two-hour drive from the southern city of Chennai where he lives.

""When I realized the impact of chemicals and pesticides on my health and the environment, I started looking at the organic alternative,"" said Kumar, who then set up a nonprofit to train farmers and urban enthusiasts with some help from Jayaraman.

29,29,Drought_Indonesia,Mitsubishi Heavy unit to boost all-purpose engine production - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Mitsubishi-Heavy-unit-to-boost-all-purpose-engine-production,"TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engine System will accelerate production of general-purpose engines, responding to growing demand in China and the Middle East.

Production of these engines will increase roughly 20% from the previous year to 520,000 units in fiscal 2017. High-performance models are produced mainly in Japan, while standard versions of these engines are made in China.

Labor shortages are growing severe in China's agricultural sector as the country's farmers age, spurring demand for related machinery as more farms look to automate and conserve their workforce. Much of China's farmland also lacks electricity, creating demand for power generators.

The drought-prone Middle East, meanwhile, is experiencing greater demand for pumps to bring water up from the ground.

All-purpose engines are used in farm machines, power generators, pumps and more. The Mitsubishi Heavy Industries group unit produces small gasoline engines under the Meiki Engine brand.

Other makers of all-purpose engines include Yamaha Motor and Honda Motor. Subaru, formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries, has decided to exit the field and sell a portion of its technological assets to Yamaha Motor.

By Isaiah Esipisu

KANGORIO, Kenya, Aug 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At this time of year, Cherop Longiro and her husband are normally busy looking for grazing for their livestock. But their three cows died in the drought in March and they sold their 20 sheep, fearing they would meet the same fate.

""We had two options: either take them to the market and sell them at a throwaway price, or keep them, which was risky because they were most likely going to die,"" said Richard Longiro from his farm in Kangorio village, West Pokot County.

Over the past year herders in Kenya's Rift Valley have lost thousands of animals to worsening drought and erratic rainfall. This is causing a growing number of them to switch to farming as a way to supplement their income.

Cherop and her husband now plant chillies - a crop resistant to drought - on a quarter-of-an-acre portion of their land, in addition to pawpaw, mangoes and bananas.

""Livestock had become so vulnerable to dry weather that we decided to start a new activity,"" the mother of three told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

RESISTANT TO DROUGHT

Chillies are a safe bet for farmers in times of drought as they do not require fertilisers or water once the roots are established in the soil, said Giuseppe De Bac, project manager in West Pokot County for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

FAO helped negotiate a three-year agreement for 200 farmers - many of whom have lost livestock - to sell chillies to La Fattoria, an Italian company with a processing plant in the southeast of the country, at a fixed price of 200 Kenyan shillings ($1.9) per kilo. The chillies are then exported to Italy.

A quarter-of-an-acre plot of land can hold 2,500 chilli plants, with each plant yielding up to 1.5 kg of chillies in three years if well tended, said De Bac.

""That could get farmers as much as 250,000 shillings ($2,409) per year, compared to only 7,500 shillings ($72) when they grew maize,"" he said.

Glenda Andiema, a marketing executive at La Fattoria, said the contract may be renewed at the end of the three-year period, ""to involve more farmers if we see it is working well"".

Herders in the region are increasingly farming crops like maize or onions in addition to keeping livestock, said De Bac.

""But most of it was only for domestic consumption - we want to help them scale up their production and derive a reliable income from it,"" he said.

CHANGING BEHAVIOURS

Although the village's farmers are starting to embrace their new crop, De Bac said the initiative has been far from straightforward.

""Farmers in this region are used to keeping livestock and if they have to grow any crops, they mainly grow maize and vegetables for domestic consumption,"" he said.

""Introducing them to high-value horticulture was not an easy task, even after praising the benefits of having access to a ready market.""

""(Chilli) needs water in the early stages of growth, so we encourage farmers to plant on drip-irrigated plots,"" he said.

FAO supplies the farmers with water storage tanks and drip irrigation kits, through funding from the Italian Agency for Development and Cooperation.

To date, however, some farmers prefer using sprinklers which are easier to use than the more water-efficient drip irrigation, he said.

Andiema explained that extension officers visit the village to ensure the farmers follow the correct practices, which will yield a high quality product.

La Fattoria may refuse to buy the chillies if they are of insufficient quality or quantity, she added.

SPREADING THE RISK

Putting farmers in touch with buyers is a good way to ensure they benefit from a ready market, while being contractually obliged to deliver produce of high quality, said Ann Mbaabu, director for market access at the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, which supports smallholder farmers.

""However, the buyers must de-risk the farmers from poor yields by deploying monitoring officers on the ground to help them meet quality standards, or even linking them to insurers to provide a cushion against extreme weather,"" she said.

According to Haron Kibet, the county administrator in West Pokot, the fact that a community that has always relied on livestock is now pursuing an alternative source of income is a positive step.

""It will put them in a much stronger position to deal with tough climate conditions,"" he said.

Some of the farmers have delivered their first crop of chillies to drying centres and will receive their first payment in September once the produce has been collected.

""This is an exciting moment for us, because for the first time we are growing a crop which we know we will sell, to whom and for how much,"" said chilli farmer Pamela Chepkorir.

Agustinus Woro, who is infamous for climbing advertising hoardings and electricity towers, has been on top of an electricity tower on Jl. Yos Sudarso in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, since Monday.

Agustinus appeared to be haranguing crowds of onlookers below with a loud-hailer but it was unclear what he was actually saying.

The man took similar action in May when he climbed a 15-meter advertising hoarding in Setiabudi, South Jakarta. He hung a banner from the hoarding calling for the dissolution of political parties.

He climbed another hoarding in Slipi, West Jakarta in February, carrying four banners stating “Orphans are victims of crazy gambler army”, “Adonara man shot dead”, “People, Densus 88, terrorist” and “Dissolve, close prisons”.

The motive behind the current action remains a mystery.

“Get down! Are you looking for attention? That’s dangerous,” one resident shouted at him.

According to an official at the scene, Agustinus carried food in a bag and slept in a makeshift hammock slung between two poles.

34,34,Drought_Indonesia,"As Rural Sri Lanka Dries Out, Young Farmers Look for Job Options - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/rural-sri-lanka-dries-out-young-farmers-look-job-options,"ADIGAMA, SRI LANKA - Scorched by a 10-month drought that has killed crops and reduced residents to buying trucked-in water, Adigama's young people are voting with their feet.

At least 150 youth have left this agricultural village 170 kilometers northwest of Sri Lanka's capital since the drought began, looking for jobs in the country's cities, or overseas, village officials say.

Few are expected to come back, even when the rains end.

""If they get the lowest-paying job overseas, or in a garment factory, they will not return,"" Sisira Kumara, the main government administrative officer in the village of 416 families, said as he walked through a dried and long-abandoned maize plot. ""They will work at construction sites or as office helpers — anything they can get their hands on.""

W.M. Suranga, 23, who left his family's withering rice paddy six months ago for Colombo, said working for low wages in the city is preferable to struggling with no rain at home.

""At least I am sure of a paycheck at the end of the month. This uncertainly of depending on the rains is too much of a risk,"" he said.

As Sri Lanka struggles with its worst drought in 40 years, farmers in the hardest-hit areas are migrating for work — with some wondering whether farming remains a viable career as climate change brings more frequent extreme weather.

""There is no income here. All the crops have failed in the last four seasons,"" Kumara said.

Little to harvest for a year

Paddy rice and vegetables are usually the main source of income in Adigama. But since the last big rains in July 2016, there has been little to no harvest.

Older villagers like Rajakaruna Amaradasa, 55, say that at their age they don't have the option of looking outside the village for a new life.

After four decades of harvesting rice and herding cattle, he abandoned his paddy fields earlier this year when his harvest failed, and now spends his days moving his cattle around, looking for scarce water.

""It will take us another two to three harvests to recover our losses and pay off any debt. Even then it all depends on the rain,"" Amaradasa said.

With average rains, Amaradasa said he used to make between 30,000 and 40,000 rupees a month ($200-$260). Now his income has fallen to a third of that, he said.

Sri Lanka's drought, which by mid-August had affected 19 of the island's 25 districts, has particularly devastated arid regions that lie outside the country's wet western plains and mountains.

A joint report by the World Food Program and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, released in mid-June, classified the drought as worst in 40 years.

It predicted rice production this year in Sri Lanka would be almost 40 percent less than last year, and 35 percent lower than the five-year average. That amounts to the lowest harvest since 2004, it said.

Climate change

It also warned that Sri Lanka ""is highly susceptible to climate change, and therefore the frequency of the weather hazards will likely increase as the earth warms.""

The impact on Sri Lanka's economy is also likely to be substantial, with more than a quarter of the country's labor force working in agriculture, a sector that contributes 8 percent of gross domestic product, the report said.

The situation is worst in villages like Adigama that rely almost entirely on rain to grow crops.

Suranga, the Adigama youth now working in Colombo, said he has no plans to return home. Instead he dreams of traveling to the Middle East as a construction worker.

""What is the guarantee there will be no more droughts or floods?"" he asked. ""When my father was my age, maybe the rains were much more predictable. Now only a fool will bet on the rains.""","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/E8835380-4C9A-432C-9A73-B5B37FF507AF.jpg,"['rice', 'working', 'farmers', 'options', 'drought', 'worst', 'young', 'sri', 'job', 'rains', 'village', 'adigama', 'dries', 'rural', 'look', 'lanka', 'rain']", ,flood_and_drought
35,35,Drought_Indonesia,Deepening Drought Hits Ethiopia Herders as Millions Go Hungry - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/deepening-drought-hits-ethiopia-herders-millions-go-hungry,"Livestock are dying in parts of Ethiopia that are overwhelmingly reliant on their milk as deepening drought pushes up the number of districts in need of life-saving aid by 19 percent, according to a report released on Thursday.

At least 8.5 million people in 228 districts of Ethiopia need urgent food aid in the second half of the year, up from 5.6 million in January, according to the study published on ReliefWeb, a website run by the United Nations.

Ethiopia's eastern Somali region is one of the country's worst affected zones and is home to a quarter of the country's cases of severe acute malnutrition, U.N. agencies said.

Severe acute malnutrition is a condition that kills up to half of sufferers under five years old.

FILE - Basherow Hassen, a mother of four, waits for food aid with her twin children in the Warder district in the Somali region of Ethiopia, Jan. 28 2017.

""The number of districts requiring immediate, life-saving intervention increased to levels not seen since the height of the El Nino drought impacts in 2016,"" said the joint report, which was compiled by the U.N. and the Ethiopian government.

Eastern and southern Africa were hit hard last year by drought exacerbated by El Nino — a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean — that wilted crops, slowed economic growth and drove food prices higher.

A strong aid response almost halved the number of Ethiopians needing food aid to 5.6 million since mid-2016. But the devastating drought was followed by poor spring rains this year in the southern and eastern parts of the country.

Since the end of last year, about 2 million animals have died in Somali region, which is home to many herding communities, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

""For livestock-dependent families, the animals can literally mean the difference between life and death, especially for children, pregnant and nursing women for whom milk is a crucial source of nutrition,"" FAO said in a statement last week.

The U.N. agency is helping the worst-hit communities to protect their remaining livestock with vaccinations, supplementary feed and water, and improved fodder production.

""It is crucial to provide this support between now and October — when rains are due — to begin the recovery process and prevent further losses of animals,"" said Abdoul Karim Bah, FAO's deputy representative in Ethiopia.

""If we don't act now, hunger and malnutrition will only get worse among [herding] communities,"" he said.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:18:23 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/3EC46C97-9AA2-46C7-81ED-C087396D3840.jpg,"['number', 'hungry', 'aid', 'mother', 'herders', 'food', 'millions', 'ethiopia', 'million', 'hits', 'somali', 'deepening', 'drought', 'waits', 'region']", ,drought
36,36,Drought_Indonesia,Incomplete drought recovery may be the new normal - The Statesman,https://www.thestatesman.com/technology/science/incomplete-drought-recovery-may-new-normal-1502438472.html,"A chronic state of incomplete drought recovery may be the new normal for the remainder of the 21st century, due to increasingly common extreme temperatures, according to a study.

The amount of time it takes for an ecosystem to recover from a drought is an important measure of a drought’s severity, said researchers from Carnegie Institution for Science in the US.

During the 20th century, the total area of land affected by drought increased, and longer recovery times became more common, they said.

Scientists predict that more-severe droughts will occur with greater frequency in the 21st century, so understanding how ecosystems return to normal again will be crucial to preparing for the future.

However, the factors that influence drought recovery have been largely unknown until now.

A chronic state of incomplete drought recovery may be the new normal for the remainder of the 21st century and the risk of reaching “tipping points” that result in widespread tree deaths may be greater going forward, researchers said.

The team used measures of photosynthetic activity to assess drought recovery. Quantifying how long it took for plant productivity to return to normal gave the researchers a better understanding of the longevity of a drought’s effects.

“If another drought arrives before trees and other plants have recovered from the last one, the ecosystem can reach a ‘tipping point’ where the plants’ ability to function normally is permanently affected,” said Yuanyuan Fang from Carnegie Institution for Science.

Researchers found that the conditions most-strongly contributing to drought recovery time were precipitation and temperature. Better conditions shortened recovery.

Temperature extremes, both hot and cold, lengthened it.

Recovery took the longest in the tropics, particularly the Amazon and Indonesia, and in the far north, especially Alaska and the far east of Russia, researchers said.

Other factors influencing drought recovery included pre- drought photosynthetic activity, carbon dioxide concentrations, and biodiversity.

The team found that drought impacts increased over the 20th century.

Given anticipated 21st century changes in temperature and projected increases in drought frequency and severity due to climate change, the findings suggest that recovery times will be slower in the future.

The research was published in the journal Nature.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1490706412-drought--getty.jpg,"['21st', 'understanding', 'century', 'took', 'droughts', 'recovery', 'drought', 'tipping', 'incomplete', 'normal', 'researchers']", ,drought

39,39,Drought_Indonesia,Indonesia | Sixth province declares emergency as fires spread - Macau Daily Times,https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/indonesia-sixth-province-declares-emergency-fires-spread.html,"The number of dry season fires burning across Indonesia has jumped to more than 500 and a sixth province has declared a state of emergency, the disaster mitigation agency said yesterday.

Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said satellite images show 538 fires across 23 provinces, up from about 160 early in the month.

Plantation companies and villagers often set the fires deliberately to clear land for planting. They spread easily because a widespread practice in Indonesia of draining swampy peatlands for palm oil and pulp wood plantations has made swathes of land highly combustible.

Nugroho said Central Kalimantan was the latest province to declare a state of emergency. Last month five provinces — Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan — declared emergencies in anticipation of a worsening of the fires and to enable measures to mitigate the choking smoke that peatlands generate when burned.

He said the agency has deployed 21 helicopters to help extinguish fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan as well as a Casa 212 aircraft to induce rain in Sumatra.

More than one-third of the fires are in West Kalimantan on the Indonesian part of Borneo and one quarter are in the easternmost Indonesian region of Papua. Typically the fires have affected Sumatra and Kalimantan the most, but plantation companies have found new frontiers in Papua’s wilderness, exposing it to greater fire risk.

In 2015, record fires burned 2.6 million hectares, more than four times the area of Bali, and blanketed Sumatra, Borneo, Singapore, Malaysia and southern Thailand in health-damaging haze that a Harvard and Columbia study estimated hastened 100,000 deaths in the region.

The World Bank said the fires, which were worsened by El Nino drought conditions, caused USD16 billion in losses.

40,40,Drought_Indonesia,Weathering the violence caused by climate change - The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/08/16/commentary/world-commentary/weathering-violence-caused-climate-change/,"With India experiencing its worst drought in 140 years, Indian farmers have taken to the streets. At a protest in Madhya Pradesh this summer, police opened fire on farmers demanding debt relief and better crop prices, killing five. In Tamil Nadu, angry growers have held similar protests and lit candles in remembrance of those killed. And at one rally in New Delhi, farmers carried human skulls, which they say belonged to farmers who have committed suicide following devastating crop losses over the past six months.

According to a recent study by Tamma A. Carleton of the University of California, Berkeley, suicides among Indian farmers have increased with the temperature, such that an increase of 1 C above the average temperature on a given day is associated with approximately 70 additional suicides, on average.

Beyond exposing failed farming policies, this year’s drought-fueled turmoil also underscores the threat that climate change poses not just to India, but to all countries. As global temperatures rise and droughts become more common, political agitation, social unrest and even violence will likely follow.

In 2008, when severe weather cut into the world’s grain supply and drove up food prices, countries ranging from Morocco to Indonesia experienced social and political upheavals. More recently, food insecurity has been used as a weapon in the wars taking place in Yemen and Syria.

According to the Center for Climate and Security, failure to address such “climate-driven risks” could lead to increased fighting over water, food, energy and land, particularly in already unstable regions. CCS identifies 12 “epicenters” where climate change might ignite or exacerbate conflicts that could engulf large populations and spill across national borders.

It is no coincidence that conflicts proliferate alongside rising temperatures. A 2013 study estimates that interpersonal violence rises by 4 percent and intergroup conflicts by 14 percent, “for each one standard deviation change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall.” Moreover, psychological studies have shown that when people are subjected to uncomfortably hot temperatures, they show increased levels of aggression. And new research is finding that what is true for the individual also holds true for populations.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, researchers have found a strong correlation between three decades of rising temperatures and outbreaks of civil war. If warming trends continue, civil wars and other conflicts will become more common in Africa, the South China Sea, the Arctic, Central America and elsewhere. Avoiding such outcomes will require renewed support for multilateral treaties such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which has been weakened by the withdrawal of the United States. But it will also require increased engagement by countries, cities and industries on three key areas: resource management, disaster mitigation and migration.

In largely agricultural societies, farm productivity affects the entire economy. As we’ve seen in the Horn of Africa and India this year, changes in temperature and rainfall can reduce crop yields, and thus rural incomes. Under such conditions, and in the absence of other economic opportunities, communities may resort to violence as they compete for food and scarce resources.

International aid organizations, working with state and federal governments, should go beyond addressing the immediate causes of poverty to also develop long-term strategies for helping agricultural communities survive bad harvests. Such strategies should focus on arable land management and water conservation, among other areas.

Additionally, new strategies are needed to coordinate disaster relief efforts. As the climate changes, weather-related calamities such as floods, hurricanes, landslides and typhoons will increase in frequency, intensity and duration, undermining individual livelihoods and the broader economy. Governments must work together to mitigate these risks, and to respond forcefully to disasters when they happen. Otherwise, the fallout will disproportionately hurt poor and vulnerable communities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and violence.

Finally, we need better policies for managing human migration, much of it related to severe weather and droughts. In 2015, the number of international migrants reached a record high of 244 million. As the climate shifts, entire regions could become uninhabitable and many more people will be uprooted. Parts of the Middle East, for example, could become too hot for humans by the end of this century; and heavily populated cities such as New Delhi could experience temperatures over 35 C up to 200 days out of the year. The International Organization for Migration fears that as more people flee the heat, the concentration of humanity into smaller spaces will have an unprecedented impact on local “coping capacity.”

Scientists agree that climate change poses a grave danger to the planet. But for some reason, politicians and government officials have not connected the dots between a changing climate and human conflicts. Among the many threats associated with climate change, deteriorating global security may be the most frightening of all. It is bad enough to see farmers carrying skulls through the streets of India. But if we do not get serious about climate-driven security risks, we could see far worse.

Forests play a central role in climate change mitigation, as recognized by the Paris Agreement. Over the last decade, hundreds of subnational initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) have flourished worldwide, and numerous countries mention either forests or REDD+ as part of their mitigation strategies. Yet, very little is known about the carbon effectiveness of these initiatives.

“There is a lot of attention on how to implement REDD+ at the national and international level, especially with respect to designing financial frameworks and measuring the global tree cover change,” explains Astrid Bos. “What is not so clear is how to measure the impact of specific initiatives on the ground.”

This prompted Bos — who is the lead author of a new study, alongside senior scientist Amy Duchelle and other researchers and partners of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) — to explore the comparative potential of two methods for assessing the effectiveness of subnational REDD+ initiatives.

The ‘BA approach’ analyzes tree cover in a given area before and after a REDD+ intervention. The ‘BACI approach’ is a more complex, costly method that includes control areas — very similar to initiative areas, but not subjected to interventions. ­ Both were tested at the village and at the site level — encompassing districts, regions and even biomes.

The assessment methods were put to the test on 23 subnational initiatives from CIFOR’s Global Comparative Study (GCS) on REDD+ in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia and Vietnam. The results were revealing.

SCALE MATTERS

The before-after method seems straightforward enough: increases in tree cover loss mean failure of the REDD+ intervention. Or do they? What the BA approach fails to take into account is the background noise affecting tree cover.

This may range from periods of extreme drought and spontaneous fires, to newly constructed roads and global commodity prices — factors beyond the scope of REDD+ initiatives.

“With the before-after approach, these background dynamics can be very misleading,” notes Bos, who is a PhD candidate at the Wageningen University Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing. “This is why we argue you have to put the observed changes in tree cover into context, so that you are comparing apples with apples.” This is precisely the strength of BACI.

Because, in theory, both the control and the intervention areas are subject to the same time-varying factors — including socioeconomic ones — any difference in tree cover between them should be able to be attributed to REDD+ interventions.

You have to put the observed changes in tree cover into context, so that you are comparing apples with apples Astrid Bos, researcher

However, BACI comes with its own set of challenges, the main one being the fact that results are only as good as the choice of control areas. “The bigger the surface, the more difficult it is to find a control area that has the same characteristics as the intervention one,” says Bos. And the area in question may be as big as a Brazilian state.

The first conclusion of the study is that the BACI approach is more relevant the more local the scale of the assessment is. “Using BACI at village rather than at initiative level, besides being much easier, is more accurate,” sums up the researcher. “Comparing areas at higher levels turned out to be more difficult than we expected.”

At the onset of the GCS REDD+, control areas were selected based on reported forest cover loss from cost- and labor-intensive field studies. Now, new global forest datasets based on satellite data allow for improved control area selection. “This is a very good moment to start implementing the BACI approach at the local scale,” concludes Bos.

DIRECTION OF CHANGE

A second conclusion is that the before-after approach, which focuses on the direction of change, is also useful under certain conditions. In some cases, the BA scores flag poor and BACI scores good performance of a particular REDD+ initiative. So, which one is right?

When increases in deforestation are higher in control areas than in intervention ones, the BA score makes clear that deforestation is still increasing, just less rapidly than would have occurred without REDD+.

“Conversely, in situations of generalized positive changes, BA scores alone risk painting a rosier picture than could be reasonably attributed to the REDD+ intervention,” adds the paper.

Independent of approach, the study found a slightly better performance at the village level that at the initiative one. According to Bos, one of the reasons could be related to the so-called ‘treatment density’, meaning that “REDD+ initiatives, especially if the proponent is an NGO, may not be targeting all the villages inside the initiative boundary.”

Although the study focused on analyzing monitoring approaches, it notes the “overall minimal impact of REDD+ in reducing deforestation so far,” regardless of the method used to assess the effectiveness of the initiatives.

“This could be the subject of another study,” says Bos, but she offers some possible explanations: slow implementation of interventions, and proponents that target smallholders instead of the main drivers of deforestation at their sites are two of them.

Other reasons may have to do with the design of the research project itself. The study focuses on deforestation, without analyzing degradation or reforestation, and it does not examine specific REDD+ intervention strategies used at different sites.

THE WAY FORWARD

A next research step is to link performance assessment results to intervention mixes, and to monitor effectiveness of REDD+ initiatives over a longer timeframe, which Duchelle notes is now in progress as part of the third phase of GCS REDD+. Interventions may include varying combinations of incentives, such as livelihood improvements; disincentives, such as fees; and enabling measures, such as tenure clarification.

Overall REDD+ impact depends on land-use decisions on the ground Astrid Bos, researcher

“It is crucial to link tree cover change to particular REDD+ strategies; what works in one area might not be the solution in another one,” stresses Bos. Better understanding what works in which contexts may also provide valuable pointers for upscaling options to national REDD+ policies.

Countries, the study argues, should find ways to incorporate results from local level monitoring into their national reporting systems. “After all, overall REDD+ impact depends on land-use decisions on the ground.”","Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://forestsnews.cifor.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/35517865023_39e5eb0860_k-520x272.jpg,"['study', 'measuring', 'intervention', 'cover', 'initiatives', 'approach', 'redd', 'control', 'subnational', 'effectiveness', 'areas', 'tree', 'bos']", ,none

Singapore’s Soh Rui Yong defended the gold in 2:29:27s while silver went to Indonesia’s Agus Prayogo who clocked 2:31:20s. Muhaizar finished the race in 2:31:52s.

The Malaysian runner who hails from Gurun, Kedah dedicated his win to his family, friends and all Malaysians who prayed for him.

""I only managed to train for a month and it was my target to contribute a medal to the country. Alhamdulilah, I’ve achieved that thanks to the support of my wife, children and parents,"" he told reporters later.

This is the first medal obtained by Malaysia in athletics at the 29th edition of the Games from Aug 19 to 30.

Malaysia last won a medal in a marathon at the 1973 Singapore SEA Games through M. Solaimuthu who clocked 2:42:03s to win the bronze.

Muhaizar, who beat his personal time of 2:35:55s today, expressed hope that fellow Malaysians in the contingent would continue to make the country proud in the biennial Games.

In the women’s category, Mary Joy Tabal of the Philippines clinched the gold in 2:48:26s ahead of Vietnam’s Hoang Thi Thanh in 2:55:43s and Thailand’s Natthaya Thanaronnawat who clocked 2:58:17s.

(CNS/Antaea Foto, Reuters)

Jakarta, Indonesia — The Vatican has appointed an apostolic visitor to investigate claims by Indonesian priests that their bishop had a mistress and misappropriated church funds. Bishop Antonius Subianto Bunyamin of Bandung, Indonesia, told ucanews.com Aug. 8 that the Vatican had asked him to look into the accusations against Bishop Hubertus Leteng of Ruteng, Indonesia. Bunyamin, also general secretary of the Indonesian bishops' conference, was scheduled to visit the diocese on Catholic-majority Flores Island during the week of Aug. 14, ucanews.com reported.

The appointment followed social media postings that Catholics in the Ruteng Diocese living in Jakarta would gather at the apostolic nunciature for a vigil calling for a speedy resolution to the situation. Bunyamin said the gathering would ""worsen the situation."" He said the dispute was ""tarnishing the church's image."" The conflict erupted June 12 when 69 diocesan priests submitted letters of resignation, leaving their positions as episcopal vicars and parish priests and demanding that Leteng change how the diocese is run. The move followed allegations last year that the bishop secretly borrowed $94,000 from the Indonesian bishops' conference and $30,000 from the diocese without providing accounting for how the money was spent. Reports indicated that the disagreement among the priests and the bishop emerged during a meeting in which he explained that the money was used to finance the education of a youth from a poor family who was studying to be a pilot in the United States. When asked for details, he told them that it was none of their business.

45,45,Drought_Indonesia,Weathering the violence of climate change - The New Times,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/218095,"SANTA MONICA – With India experiencing its worst drought in 140 years, Indian farmers have taken to the streets. At a protest in Madhya Pradesh this summer, police opened fire on farmers demanding debt relief and better crop prices, killing five.

SANTA MONICA – With India experiencing its worst drought in 140 years, Indian farmers have taken to the streets. At a protest in Madhya Pradesh this summer, police opened fire on farmers demanding debt relief and better crop prices, killing five. In Tamil Nadu, angry growers have held similar protests, and lit candles in remembrance of those killed. And at one rally in New Delhi, farmers carried human skulls, which they say belonged to farmers who have committed suicide following devastating crop losses over the past six months.

According to a recent study by Tamma A. Carleton of the University of California, Berkeley, suicides among Indian farmers have increased with the temperature, such that an increase of 1º Celsius above the average temperature on a given day is associated with approximately 70 additional suicides, on average.

Beyond exposing failed farming policies, this year’s drought-fueled turmoil also underscores the threat that climate change poses not just to India, but to all countries. As global temperatures rise and droughts become more common, political agitation, social unrest, and even violence will likely follow.

In 2008, when severe weather cut into the world’s grain supply and drove up food prices, countries ranging from Morocco to Indonesia experienced social and political upheavals. More recently, food insecurity has been used as a weapon in the wars in Yemen and Syria.

According to the Center for Climate and Security, failure to address such “climate-driven risks” could lead to increased fighting over water, food, energy, and land, particularly in already unstable regions. CCS identifies 12 “epicenters” where climate change might ignite or exacerbate conflicts that could engulf large populations, and spill across national borders.

It is no coincidence that conflicts proliferate alongside rising temperatures. A 2013 study estimates that interpersonal violence rises by 4%, and intergroup conflicts by 14%, “for each one standard deviation change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall.” Moreover, psychological studies have shown that when people are subjected to uncomfortably hot temperatures, they show increased levels of aggression. And new research is finding that what is true for the individual also holds true for populations.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, researchers have found a strong correlation between three decades of rising temperatures and outbreaks of civil war. If warming trends continue, civil wars and other conflicts will become more common in Africa, the South China Sea, the Arctic, Central America, and elsewhere. Avoiding such outcomes will require renewed support for multilateral treaties such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which has been weakened by the withdrawal of the United States. But it will also require increased engagement by countries, cities, and industries on three key areas: resource management, disaster mitigation, and migration.

In largely agricultural societies, farm productivity affects the entire economy. As we’ve seen in the Horn of Africa and India this year, changes in temperature and rainfall can reduce crop yields, and thus rural incomes. Under such conditions, and in the absence of other economic opportunities, communities may resort to violence as they compete for food and scarce resources.

International aid organizations, working with state and federal governments, should go beyond addressing the immediate causes of poverty to also develop long-term strategies for helping agricultural communities survive bad harvests. Such strategies should focus on arable-land management and water conservation, among other areas.

Additionally, new strategies are needed to coordinate disaster-relief efforts. As the climate changes, weather-related calamities such as floods, hurricanes, landslides, and typhoons will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, undermining individual livelihoods and the broader economy. Governments must work together to mitigate these risks, and to respond forcefully to disasters when they happen. Otherwise, the fallout will disproportionately hurt poor and vulnerable communities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and violence.

Finally, we need better policies for managing human migration, much of it related to severe weather and droughts. In 2015, the number of international migrants reached a record high of 244 million. As the climate shifts, entire regions could become uninhabitable, and many more people will be uprooted. Parts of the Middle East, for example, could become too hot for humans by the end of this century; and heavily populated cities such as New Delhi could experience temperatures over 95º Fahrenheit (35º C) up to 200 days out of the year. The International Organization for Migration fears that as more people flee the heat, the concentration of humanity into smaller spaces will have an unprecedented impact on local “coping capacity.”

Scientists agree that climate change poses a grave danger to the planet. But for some reason, politicians and government officials have not connected the dots between a changing climate and human conflicts. Among the many threats associated with climate change, deteriorating global security may be the most frightening of all. It is bad enough to see farmers carrying skulls through the streets of India.

46,46,Drought_Indonesia,UN: Drought-Warning Tool to Help Central American Farmers - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/americas/un-drought-warning-tool-help-central-american-farmers,"BOGOTA, COLOMBIA - A new weather monitoring system to better forecast drought in Central America could help the region's governments and farmers avoid major crop losses and boost resilience to recurring water shortages, the United Nations says.

The tool is based on existing warning systems, and uses satellite and geospatial data to map areas where crops could be affected by drought, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Central America is one of the regions most vulnerable to extreme weather exacerbated by climate change, and farmers are already struggling, the FAO says.

The tool will target mainly subsistence and small-scale maize and bean farmers in Central America's ""Dry Corridor"" running through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua where about 10.5 million people live.

""The aim of the system is to monitor the situation of crops in the field every ten days,"" said Oscar Rojas, a natural resources officer with the FAO.

""For governments, this is important in order to activate their national drought mitigation plans and to foresee districts that may present food insecurity problems,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Two consecutive years of drought from 2015 to mid-2016, linked to a powerful El Nino weather phenomenon, decimated crop harvests in parts of Central America and left 3.5 million people in need of food aid.

Experts say more accurate, timely and high-quality data on climate and weather patterns are needed to help government authorities forecast drought more effectively, and activate an early response to prevent crop losses and hunger.

The new tool includes land-use maps, crop-sowing dates and cycles, among other information, to more accurately pinpoint periods and agricultural areas of low rainfall, the FAO said.

Weather monitoring systems can help farmers decide when to plant crops and guide government funding for water harvesting and irrigation projects, the FAO said.

Climate change is expected to bring more frequent and severe droughts and floods around the world, making a deeper understanding of the way global warming affects local weather patterns crucial, experts say.

The FAO said the Central America tool could also be used by insurance companies to devise index-based policies for weather-related crop losses.","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/8C4B81A2-70C7-4619-AB24-4C1E7F812A55.jpg,"['help', 'farmers', 'central', 'crop', 'droughtwarning', 'losses', 'fao', 'weather', 'drought', 'american', 'tool', 'america']", ,flood_and_drought

I first visited for a television show in 2008 and have since stayed with my family at a friend’s home in Canggu, a beach area north of Seminyak in the south of the island.

Bali has a bit of everything: sandy beaches, coral reefs, forested volcanic mountains and dense jungle. To the south, the city of Kuta has lively bars, while Seminyak, Sanur and Nusa Dua are popular resort towns. Prime surfing spots such as Padang Padang, Uluwatu and Canggu attract enthusiasts from around the world.

Anything special I should pack?

A surfboard. Bali is a surfer’s paradise. The peak surfing season is between April and October and it’s the ideal place to learn how to ride the waves, regardless of your skill level.

What do you miss most when away?

I’ve had lots of motorcycle injuries and recently smashed up my legs very badly, so I miss the warm, tropical climate which helps ease the discomfort. May is the hottest month, averaging 82F (28C).

First thing you do when you arrive?

I head for Echo Beach in Canggu, one of the island’s best surfing spots. There are three main breaks, making it ideal for everyone from beginner to advanced level. There’s also a restaurant strip along the beach – the ideal point for watching the sun drop into the ocean.

Nowhere does sunset surf shots like Bali Credit: Getty

Where’s the best place to stay?

There are many spectacular properties on the island – from beachside villas to secluded treehouses – so Airbnb is probably the best approach. Accommodation rates can vary, depending on room availability and the season, so it’s worth double-checking the final price before confirming your booking.

Where do you meet friends for a drink?

The Deus Café (0062 811 388 150; deuscustoms.com/cafes/canggu) in Canggu, next door to Deus Ex Machina’s Temple of Enthusiasm, a shop selling vintage motorbikes and surfboards. It has a great bar and there’s always a live band on Sundays. The food is good, too – a fusion of Indonesian and western cuisine.

Where is the best place for lunch?

Tucked away opposite the former Royal Palace in Ubud, Ibu Oka’s shanty café (0062 0361 976345) is a Bali institution and arguably the most famous place to order babi guling, a delicious Balinese-style whole-roasted suckling pig, stuffed with spices. The restaurant opens around 10.30am and tables fill up quickly.

A post shared by G R A C E (@gracechan10) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:41pm PST

And for dinner?

Lacalita Cantina Mexicana (0062 822 4731 2218; lacalacabali.com), just off Seminyak’s famous Eat Street, is a fabulous Mexican restaurant run by Adelaide-born chef Will Lovejoy. Their short-rib burger, flavoured with Mexican spices, is a sophisticated take on the American classic, but I particularly like their tacos filled with slow-braised meats and fresh island fruits.

Where do you take a first-time visitor?

Most people visit Bali for its beaches. There’s something for everyone, from remote stretches of soft white sand and secret coves under towering limestone cliffs to black-sand beaches that point to the island’s volcanic past.

What should I avoid?

The rainy season, which typically falls between October and March. The worst months are usually January and February, although it’s not nearly as bad as other regions in South East Asia.

What should I bring home?

The rag trade is a huge industry in Bali, so it’s a great place to buy clothes. You’ll find everything from hand-painted batiks and colourful beachwear to designer gear.

Bali is renowned for its friendliness Credit: Credit: Cavan Social / Alamy Stock Photo/Cavan Social / Alamy Stock Photo

Public transport or taxi?

Bali is bigger than you might think and the poor standard of roads, not to mention the heavy traffic in the south, make the going even more time-consuming. While it’s possible to get around via local transport system (bemos), many visitors prefer to travel by hire car or taxi. However, the best way to explore is by scooter. There are around 30 million scooters in Indonesia, apparently. Just ask your hotel to have one delivered for you.

Manbag or money belt?

Manbag is fine. One of the lovely things about Indonesia is that the people are extremely kind and gentle.

48,48,Drought_Indonesia,Gourmet grub: Thai fine-diners explore insect cuisine - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/08/29/gourmet-grub-thai-fine-diners-explore-insect-cuisine.html,"At a hip Bangkok diner, foodies with an adventurous palate tuck into a bug-based menu that includes watermelon salad sprinkled in bamboo worms, nachos with silkworm cherry tomato salsa and pasta made from ground crickets.

Abundant and stacked with protein, insects have long been a favorite snack among Thai farmers. But they have often carried a negative image, perceived as ""food for the poor"" in a country with profound class divides.

Now bugs are creeping onto the menu of some of Bangkok's high-end restaurants as the capital's gourmands leap on the latest global food trend with a sustainable agenda.

Ratta Bussakornnun, a 27-year-old who works in the cosmetics industry, admitted she was initially sceptical as she sat for a meal recently at Insects in the Backyard, which says it offers Bangkok's first insect-themed fine-dining menu.

Many wealthier Thais, she said, think of insects as ""unappetising and dirty"".

But by the end of her meal she was won over.

""I just ate scallops topped with bamboo worms and a fish fillet with an ant egg sauce. It was delicious,"" she beamed, a gentle jazz track playing overhead in the dimly lit restaurant.

""The food is well presented,"" she added. ""This gives an impression of sophistication.""

The restaurant is located in Chang Chui -- an arty district in western Bangkok filled with vinyl record stores and local fashion designers.

Feed the world

Co-founder Regan Suzuki Pairojmahakij says insects are more than just a gastronomic trend -- they are a potential panacea for an increasingly crowded and meat-hungry world.

The Canadian national used to work in the NGO sector with remote rural communities, many of whom incorporated insects into their cuisine.

""I've been working in the climate change, natural resource management fields for a number of years, and a big part of it has been the search for the sustainable forms of protein, food and supply chain,"" she told AFP.

With the world's population expected to hit 9.8 billion in 2050, many experts remain acutely concerned about how the world will feed itself as well as the environmental damage caused by so much meat being consumed.

Insects, she said, require a fraction of the costs and energy needed to farm compared to staples like chicken, pork, and beef.

That is nothing new to many of Thailand's rural classes.

Insect consumption is particularly popular in the rural northern regions, mainly due to its drought-prone climate, which has created a more varied and less fussy local palate.

For people in the central part of the country that is fertile all year long, insects are eaten more as a snack, often deep fried and served with seasoning or spicy sauce.

But persuading the wealthy middle classes of Bangkok, a city of huge disproportionate wealth compared to the rest of the country, is still a challenge.

""No Bangkokian eats insects because it has a social status connotation,"" said Massimo Reverberi, an Italian entrepreneur of a small start-up called Bugsolutely.

Based in Bangkok and Shanghai, his firm says the not-so-welcoming look of insects remains a major turn-off for many.

Instead he looks for ways to use insects in everyday food items like chips and energy bars.

Their current product is a pasta made from cricket flour, which is now sold by a small number of outlets in Japan and New Zealand, but not yet Thailand.

Bug eggs

Back in the kitchen of Insects in the Backyard, chef Thitiwat Tantragarn says the most important thing is to get the flavours right.

""Giant water bug meat has a similar texture to crab, so that's why I use it in the ravioli,"" he enthused.

Ant eggs are another favourite of his, which he tends to serve with fish.

""They have a sour flavour, which helps reduce the fishy taste. We try to make sure the menu has balance and harmony.""

""My intention is to change diners' attitude. Insects are edible and delicious,"" he added. ""It's not disgusting.""

His culinary approach appears to be working.

Ania Bialek, a British teacher living in Thailand, said she had tried fried insects sold by street vendors but wanted to know what a higher end menu would taste like.

""I will happily eat them again,"" she said at the end of the meal.

""But I would need someone else to prepare it for me. I will not be keen on cooking it myself.""","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2017/08/29/2017_08_29_31724_1503989263._large.jpg,"['trend', 'menu', 'food', 'thai', 'bangkok', 'explore', 'cuisine', 'end', 'grub', 'finediners', 'country', 'worms', 'insect', 'gourmet', 'rural', 'insects', 'backyard']", ,drought

Heavy downpour since early in the morning caused flash floods in many areas of Jayapura on Thursday.

Residents of the Papua's provincial capital were shocked when they woke up in the morning only to find their homes inundated.

“I was lucky I woke up early today, otherwise my belongings would have been completely soaked,” said Agustine, a resident of Kotaraja in Abepura.

At least three schools had been closed due to the natural disaster, said Jayapura Education Agency head I Wayan Mudiyasa.

Even many students of schools that remained open opted to stay at home.

“I couldn’t go to school; my home is flooded,” said Gorion, a fourth-grader.

The overflowing Kali Acay River inundated residential areas and the Youtefa Market.

Vendors were scrambling to secure their items at the market.

Jayapura Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Tober Sirait said he had deployed personnel and rubber boats to help evacuate residents.

“We are helping to get residents to houses of relatives or friends that are unaffected,” he said.

50,50,Drought_Indonesia,Short Story: The view from a moving bus - The Jakarta Post - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/08/28/short-story-the-view-from-a-moving-bus.html,"It was the day that would forever change her life, but the Village Girl could not see anything would go wrong. Instead, she was bursting with excitement.

“Ma… Why are the trees running? Where will they go?”

The Village Girl could not stop staring at the outside, flattening her forehead, nose and lips against the window. It was her first experience riding in a car. Having lived her whole life corralled by green hills and sandy beaches in a very remote area of Sukabumi had limited her chances of witnessing modern developments. Even though her village is located some five-hours away from Jakarta, one of the world’s most popular megacities. This was where she was heading. She was so happy when Ma took her to the city while her other siblings were left at home with Granny.

Before the Village Girl and Ma left the house this early morning, Granny wrapped her arms around her small body and hugged her so tightly she could not breathe. Granny’s eyes grew misty and the Village Girl thought it was funny the way her grandmother was staring at her as if for the last time.

“Granny, why are you so sad? You used to love it when I was not around to bother you,” said the Village Girl mockingly. Granny had always yelled her for being too noisy around the house, especially when the Village Girl was playing with her siblings.

“You little brat,” Granny nagged at her, but her eyes had become wet and her voice was hoarse.

“It’s already five, we have to go!” Ma said. She folded her arms, while tapping her right foot against the floor. She watched with disdain as her daughter, the Village Girl, was trying to part with the grandmother.

“I know what time it is… don’t you dare pressure me!” the sound of Granny’s voice startled the Village Girl. Both her mother and Granny were giving each other ‘the look’ — the kind you’d throw at people you didn’t like. The younger woman quickly grabbed the Village Girl’s hand and dragged her away from the older woman’s presence.

Ma never mentioned why they went to Jakarta; neither what would they do once they got there. But she guessed that Ma was missing Pa terribly and that they would meet him there. The Village Girl had repeatedly asked Ma to meet Pa — a man of whom she knew nothing, even his name. Granny told her that Pa left the family to earn more money when he found out that Ma was pregnant again; the Village Girl was barely one-year old at the time. Pa complained that their small village had nothing to offer except vast paddy fields which were always dry due to the long drought and terrible irrigation. That was Granny’s version — the version about her father’s leaving that the Village Girl had come to believe. Ma refused to mention anything about Pa.

Nina, her favorite playmate, told her, “Your father is a jerk. That’s what Mom told me.”

The Village Girl did not really understand what Nina meant, but she was sure it was pretty bad. She remembered how Nina had called her own father a jerk after a particular incidence — one in which he refused to buy her new shoes for the Eid celebration.

The Village Girl swore to herself she would never call her father names no matter what he had done. Feeling his presence would have been enough. Sure, it was hard not to have her father around, but The Village Girl noticed it must have been harder for Ma. Since Pa left the family, or as far as she remembered, the Village Girl never saw Ma smile at anyone. Now that they were on the bus to Jakarta, the Village Girl wished she would see the smile on Ma’s face again. But Ma’s mind seemed to have wandered far away. Ma was gazing straight at the worn gray seat in front of her.

“Ma, why are the trees outside running? I wonder where they want to go. Are they following us?” the Village Girl wiggled her mom’s thigh, demanding an explanation.

“Yes, the trees are running to their new place. Don’t you know that everything is changing in this world? Just like your little brother: he was helpless when he was just born. Now he can crawl and sit by himself. And you, you will grow and you can be anything you want to be if you behave.”

“Really? I want to be Sailor Moon! How can I be Sailor Moon, Ma? My hair is long like Sailor Moon, but it is dark, not yellow,” she touched the tip of her fishtail braided hair, inhaling the scent. Ma washed her hair this morning with strawberry shampoo. She never ate a strawberry, but she knew the picture from her older sister’s school book cover where she saw a very pretty young lady with pink hair covered by a strawberry hat.

“Ma, can I be Sailor Moon by wearing a strawberry hat?” The Village Girl shook Ma’s skinny hands, which were holding her shabby brown canvas tote bag tightly.

“What did I just tell you, eh? You can be anything as long as you behave well.” In a normal situation, every time she said, “You have to behave well,” Ma’s tone was sharp, cold and mean. But not this time. There was none of that.

The Village Girl tried to enjoy her first bus trip, but the bumpy road made dizzy. There was no AC on the bus. Throughout the journey, the Village Girl wiped the sweat across her forehead using her shirt sleeve. Even worse was the mixture of rotten smell hanging in the air which came from fish, people’s feet, sweat, and the pungent odor of cheap perfumes. But she did not let them ruin her day. The running trees were no longer visible to her. Had they discovered the places they wanted to go to?

After the trees, the Village Girl saw so many houses moving and running as well. She pondered whether the houses were running with their occupants too. Otherwise, where would they sleep once they discovered their houses had left them? She then thought of their old house which was always there every time she went home after helping Ma selling fried sweet potatoes. It was normal for the Village Girl and her mother to walk around the village for six straight hours (or more if there were sweet potatoes were not selling as fast as they should). Ma insisted that if the Village Girl helped her sell the cake, more people would want to buy the fried sweet potatoes. If they managed to sell all the fried potatoes on any given day — which was very rare — Ma would let the Village Girl play at Nina’s house. Nina lived in the largest house in the village, and if the Village Girl was lucky, when she arrived at the house Sailor Moon would be playing on TV.

Besides the running houses, she saw many other running cars racing each other as if they were pulled hard by invisible ropes. The deafening sound of those cars, boisterously and clamorously, was such a great contrast from her daily life. Usually, the loudest sound she would hear came from petrol chainsaws chopping down the coconut trees that grew abundantly in her village. But what surprised her most was to see the way some cars would leave thick black clouds behind them, hovering low above the ground.

“Maaa… Can I touch the black clouds over there?”

“What black clouds?” Ma’s attention was now drawn to her.

“Look at them! They are scattered around the cars!”

The Village Girl had always dreamed of touching the white clouds across the blue sky. Now that the dream was coming true, the Village Girl tried not to blink her eyes very often, thinking she could not witness this miracle again anytime soon. And also, the realization of how clouds were formed stirred her eagerness to go back home right away to tell her playmates that she knew how clouds were made.

The new knowledge triggered her another question: why did the color change from black to white once the cloud was up in the sky? This question was quickly forgotten as soon as the running houses were gone. What was in front of her now were very tall buildings pressing against each other like tiny bristles on her blue toothbrush. The lean buildings looked so fragile as if they would collapse easily once the wind came and blew them off. Ma could sense her anxiety. Ma squeezed her hand.

“We will get off the bus soon. Collect your belonging now,” Ma’s voice was hoarse like there was a roll of hay clogged in her throat. The Village Girl reluctantly grabbed her worn-out cuddly baby doll and a bottle of water. Her braided hair was no longer neat, her ironed cloth was crumpled and wet with sweat. Ma helped her tighten the braid before they got off.

When the bus left them at a stop, the Village Girl could not blink at all seeing the big city in front of her. No more bus window separated her view from the real tall buildings that still looked intimidating to her. Now she could see clearly the endless range of buses, cars, and motorbikes. She squinted her eyes for the blazing sun was not only burning her skin, but also blinding her sight. She trusted Ma to lead her by her hand with her eyes half closed.

Ma took her inside a food stall where a long line of dishes made her mouth water and her stomach growl like a mad bear’s. She waggled her two hands to seize all the food aromas toward her: dried beef curry, grilled chicken, tilapia soup, pan fried shrimp and many others that the Village girl had never seen before. But Ma disrupted her pleasure and asked her to sit and wait on the wooden chair. When Ma came and brought her a plate of warm rice and a fried egg, she unwillingly took the plate. She chewed the rice slowly while closing her eyes, imagining that what she had for lunch was a slice of dried beef curry.

“Why, you don’t like it?” Ma glared at her. The Village Girl knew she better say nothing or Ma would repeat her mantra: “Behave well!”

While eating at the table by the large window, the Village Girl observed the world outside. Besides the long heavy traffic, she noticed there were many street children by the traffic light. When the red light was on, they took over the entire street by singing, wiping car windows, selling newspapers, selling snacks or just begging for alms. There were also children close to her age whose clothes were torn and who seemed to be in need of a good shower.

“Ma, what are they doing?” the Village Girl pointed toward something.

Without directing her gaze to what the Village Girl was pointing at, Ma answered shortly while eating. “They are earning money so they can eat,” she said.

“Where are their parents? I also earn money with you.”

Ma stopped chewing. The wrinkles on her forehead were getting thicker as she stared at the Village Girl. “They would not do that if their parents had already enough money. Now, stop looking at them and finish your lunch!”

The Village Girl’s plate was still full while Ma’s plate was already empty. She tried to hasten but her little mouth could only take in half a spoon every time she scooped the rice.

After a few moments, Ma cleared her throat and spoke to the Village Girl. “Listen, I want you to know that no matter what people say, you have to keep in mind that I have been trying to do the best for us. You understand that, eh?” For the first time today, Ma initiated a conversation. Not only that, Ma seemed to really mean it.

“I know, Ma.”

“Listen, I have to go somewhere where children aren’t allowed to come.”

“Why Ma? Don’t leave me alone!”

“Remember I told you to behave, okay? No, it will not take a long time. You don’t have to worry, though, my friend will come and pick you up so you will not be alone waiting for me. Hush.. Hush… No more crying!” Ma took some tissues from a box on the dining table and wiped away her tears.

“Promise me that you will behave, okay? My friend will arrive soon and he will take you to a water park while waiting for me. You told me once that Nina went there last month. Now it is your time to have fun in the park,” Ma smiled lightly.

“Water Park?” The thought of playing all day long at the water park soothed the Village Girl’s cry by itself. “But, but, we will meet there soon, right?” She felt herself torn between excitement and sadness.

“Oh, sure... You are such a well-behaved daughter. See you there soon, okay? Bye!” Ma kissed her left cheek and hugged her for a moment. The Village Girl followed Ma’s steps with her eyes until her shadow disappeared. Not long after Ma had left, a tall thin man appeared. She could not see his face since it was covered with a bushy mustache and round sunglasses. A strong smell of tobacco came from his black leather jacket.

The man cleared his throat intentionally to catch her attention when the Village Girl looked down on her plate with a perplexed gaze.

“So, are you ready to go to the water park?”

The Village Girl said nothing, tears began to well up in her eyes. Don’t cry, she told herself. After a while, the man took her hand and led her outside. Again, the fiery blazing sun blinded her so she kept on tripping behind the man. But even though her teary eyes were half closed, the Village Girl was sure she saw Ma on a running bus, watching her for a moment, before eventually turning away from her.

51,51,Drought_Indonesia,'An Inconvenient Sequel' presents Truth To Power - Environment - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/08/25/an-inconvenient-sequel-presents-truth-to-power.html,"When An Inconvenient Truth was released in 2006, the documentary, which centers on former United States vice president Al Gore’s campaign to educate the public on global warming, sent shockwaves around the world with its warnings of imminent environmental catastrophe brought by climate change.

Gore followed his gut and his heart, putting everything he had into an issue that had long lit a fire within him ­— confronting the increasingly alarming prospect of a global climate crisis that could literally signal the end of human civilization.

At that time, the climate crisis itself was at a crossroads, with scientific consensus coalescing around the costs to mankind, the global economy and the planet if zero efforts were made to cut down on man-made greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. Then, the scope of the threat was just breaking through to the public and the fossil fuel industry was putting up strong resistance.

The inspiring film, directed by Davis Guggenheim, won two Oscars and contributed to taking the issue of climate change into popular culture, propelling Gore to being named a co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize alongside the United Nation’s panel of climate scientists in 2007.

Its sequel, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, which hits theaters here on Aug. 25, shows how far the battle to reverse the effects of climate change has come in 10 years. It serves as the next chapter of the story as people see not just accelerating change, but also the emergence of new battles. Simply put, if the first movie was the wakeup call, millions of people are now wide awake.

An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (Paramount Pictures/File)

Directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, the sequel sets off in a new direction. It follows Gore as he continues his tireless fight, traveling around the world training an army of climate leaders while influencing international climate policy.

The award-winning directors (The Island President; Audrie & Daisy) offer a fresh perspective and sense of warmth to the sequel, bringing in their skilled eyes for cinematography to make the story, which may not be easy to tell, entertaining.

Cameras follow Gore behind the scenes in a direct cinema style, connecting the audience to the subject while revealing the complexity of human relations in a manner as electrifying and dramatic as fiction.

The sequel reveals both private and public moments as well as funny, poignant and unscripted, off-the-cuff moments, as Gore explains that, while the stakes have never been higher, the perils of climate change can be overcome with human ingenuity and passion.

Cameras also shadow Gore on his journey across Greenland, India, Europe, Asia and the US, navigating through corridors of power as well as “in the trenches” with survivors, scientists, unlikely leaders and ordinary people moved to take extraordinary actions.

Unexpected scenes intimately show Gore’s day-to-day efforts — he peels off his soggy socks after wading through ocean-flooded Miami; he escapes traffic by taking a crowded Paris subway; he engages in power-brokering roles with top officials such as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres; and he listens to heart-wrenching stories from typhoon survivors in Tacloban, Philippines.

The film also allows viewers to “be there” with Gore as he visits the Swiss Camp research station in Greenland that monitors the movement of ice sheets. There, he learns the station itself has collapsed several times over the last decade because the ice on which it is anchored is melting so precipitously.

One moving scene at Russell Glacier in Greenland shows Gore standing, his face in awe, while taking in what he sees — ice cracks off into a river that leads to the ocean, then says he can see that the glacier is in worse condition compared to last time he visited.

The film shows images of the climate change impacts splashed in the media — in the US alone, Louisianans in their cars are saved from drowning in a flood; ocean fish swim in Florida streets; and sci-fi-like “rain bombs” deluge Arizona. In India, a woman falls into a melting road. These scenes show that the urgency to solve the climate crisis is as great as ever.

Throughout the film, there is a sense of urgency and optimism, as well as a sense of connection with Gore’s passion, courage, resilience, heart and, most of all, his unique ability to inspire others.

While the first film may have caused deep concern, the sequel, while still pointing to extreme droughts, record-breaking downpours, melting Arctic ice and worrying scientific facts as evidence of climate change, has a more hopeful message in the world’s ability to solve the crisis.

Heart-warming scenes show, in the past 10 years, a low-carbon economy is emerging at an unprecedented pace, driven by innovative technologies and growing economic upsides. In fact, the year 2016 marked an all-time high in investments in renewable energy across the globe.

The sequel points out some huge climate success stories, including cities around the world achieving the goal of using 100 percent renewable electricity and how global investments in renewable electricity generation now exceed fossil fuels with markets increasingly turning away from them.

The film’s message is clear. There is hope that, together, we can solve the climate crisis. While economics alone do not paint the entire picture, the trends put the writing on the wall: the future belongs to renewables.

Just like the first film, the sequel delivers a powerful message for the world to hear. As Gore says: “The next generation, if they live in a world of floods and storms and rising seas and droughts and refugees by the millions escaping unlivable conditions, destabilizing countries around the world, they would be well justified in looking back and asking, ‘What were you thinking?’”

Italy, the Balkans and parts of France and Spain are among the most affected countries, with the extreme weather resulting in wildfires and damaging crops throughout the region. Wine growers in Italy started gathering the grape harvest weeks earlier than usual due to the extreme heat.

Bosnian officials said the heat wave and drought had nearly halved the country's agricultural output, which accounts for 10 percent of the country's economic production. Neighboring Serbia reported a similar situation, and experts said drought could slash corn and soybean production by a third.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Too close for comfort Smoke and flames rise from a fire in the Croatian village of Podstrana, near the Adriatic coastal town of Split, on July 18, 2017. In Croatia, the blazes have spread over several locations along the coast and onto the islands, engulfing pine forests and low shrubbery in extremely dry and windy weather.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Hope for the best While there were no reports of casualties and the fires only reached a few homes, some people could only stand by and watch as the flames razed everything in their path, especially nature. Fires between the Croatian town of Omis and Split have reportedly destroyed 4,500 hectares of forest.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Desperate times Forest fires are common in southern Europe each summer, and can sometimes be caused by reckless tourists. However, there have also been cases where speculators have deliberately set fire to properties seeking new land to build on. Croatian news media are already speculating about arson, as fires started in more than 20 sites in Croatia alone.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe All hands on deck Firefighters used aircraft to try to tackle the flames, which continued overnight in both Croatia and neighboring Montenegro. With fires raging on the mainland as well as on islands such as Pag and Vir, the military was also called in to help in both countries. Montenegro also requested NATO's assistance.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Situation mostly under control Fires that have raged for days in neighboring Montenegro have been brought under control, with soldiers helping to put out blazes on the Lustica peninsula near the town of Tivat. Some remote areas of Montenegro continue to be affected.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Full picture of damage yet to emerge More than 100 tourists had to be brought to safety in Montenegro alone, as wildfires came threatening close to human habitats. The full extent of the damage remains unknown, as there is still some work to do to stop the fires and prevent future blayes in coming days, as temperatures are expected to soar.

Wildfires rage through Southeast Europe Large parts of southern Europe affected Europe has been experiencing an unusual heatwave this summer, with temperatures approaching record levels in many places. Southern Italy had to deal with its own wildfires less than a week earlier. The blames consumed swathes of land in the provinces of Cosenza (pictured here) and Salerno as well as parts of Sicily. Portugal was also affected by wildfires a month ago.



Official restrictions

Authorities in some areas issued traffic restrictions and banned work in the open during the hottest part of the day, as temperatures surpassed 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

Spain's national weather service was among those issuing an emergency high temperature warning for 31 of the country's 50 provinces. Italian authorities issued weather risk warnings for 26 cities, including the tourist hubs of Venice and Rome, where many fountains have been turned off due to drought.

Authorities in other countries urged people to stay indoors and drink water.

53,53,Drought_Indonesia,"Flexibility, Planning Cut Somali Famine Threat, Report Says - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/africa/flexibility-planning-cut-somali-famine-threat-report-says,"LONDON - People suffering in Somalia's latest drought have fared better when donors deftly shift funding to emergency projects that help residents save money and stockpile food, a charity said Tuesday.

Severe drought in the Horn of Africa nation is expected to deepen until the October rainy season, and humanitarians are racing to avoid a repeat of the 2011 famine when more than 250,000 people died of starvation.

Funding from major donors, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, has been used effectively in Somalia for community warehousing of food and for savings and loan programs, the rights group Refugees International said in a report.

Flexible use of that funding allowed agencies in Somalia to switch to emergency preparedness projects once it became clear in June 2016 that the drought would be prolonged, it said.

It was easier for donors to send funds to agencies in Somalia because they already had contracts in place, it said.

""By acting early to heed pre-famine warnings, the humanitarian community in Somalia and donors were able to stabilize what could have been a catastrophic situation,"" it said.

""Many of the target communities were better able to maintain food security, preserve their assets and avoid having to flee to other areas during the drought.""

More than 6 million Somalis — about half the country's population — need emergency aid, the United Nations says.

Another sign of progress since the 2011 famine is that the government's national development plan and the U.N.'s humanitarian appeal included long-term resilience projects, Refugees International said.

Along with a shift to longer-term planning, Somalia needs a stronger government and peace to end its recurrent hunger crises, Mark Yarnell, a senior advocate with Refugees International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/65F6844D-1B93-40AC-969C-0C0EB4401EC6.jpg,"['somalia', 'refugees', 'threat', 'projects', 'drought', 'flexibility', 'united', 'famine', 'donors', 'shift', 'planning', 'somali', 'report', 'food', 'international', 'emergency', 'cut']", ,drought

55,55,Drought_Indonesia,OVERVIEW GLOBAL MANGO MARKET - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2180445/overview-global-mango-market/,"Exporters want to increase their market share in the US, Japan, South Korea and some European countries. New technology must be used to back this ambition. New technologies can, among other things, ensure quality during transport, thus bringing new markets into reach. In the week ending on 12 August, more than 2.9 million boxes were exported, which is about 100,000 boxes more than in the same week last year. Before the season, production was estimated at 67.8 million boxes for export. A year earlier, a total of 66.2 million boxes were exported.

Europe and the US are the main markets, but there are major differences. Europe receives about 70% of the total volume that Brazilians export by sea every week. In the US there isn't as much room in the market. In October, when Ecuador begins exporting to the US, Brazilians are no longer able to continue shipping, so Brazilian exporters actually have a two-month period for their exports.

Given that Mexican exporters focus mainly on the US market, the Brazilians have more or less free play on the European market. Mexican exports to Europe are limited. Last year there were some problems in August and September. Whether there will be a repeat of these problems again this year is still uncertain. For now, trade has been good.

Growers are concerned about the lack of rainfall predicted for the months of November and December. For the past five years, producers have already been struggling with the effects of drought, which has significantly affected the crop. Moreover, the country's water reserves have been widely exploited in these years. So far, there has been insufficient rain to supplement these reserves. How this situation will develop before the harvest is still uncertain. For the time being, the start of the season has been good and growers are satisfied with the quality.

The season has been marked by stability compared to previous years. Production amounts to around 7.8 million boxes. By far, the most common mango variety is the Tommy Atkins, accounting for about 85% of the production. The rest of the production consists of Ataulfo ​​(8%) and Palmer (7%).

Dominican Republic sees increase in export potential

During the season, the Caribbean island exports 6.9 million dollars' worth of mangoes. The Dominican Republic has about 5,500 hectares devoted to the cultivation of mangoes suitable for export. Most of the crops are located in the regions of Bani, Azua, Neiba and San Juan de la Maguana. The list of varieties cultivated is long and includes the Mingolo, Golden Grain, Pascual, Banilejo, Yamagui, Madame Frances, Keitt, Kent, Marcelo, Tommy Atkins, Moradito, Fabricated, Puntica, Golden Drop, Cream of Gold, Parvin, Palmer, Springfield, Manzano, Rosita, Luis, Osteeny and Haden. Moreover, new varieties are grown on demand from the market, like the Keshar, Alphonso and Maha Chanok. In recent years, exports have grown sharply and the Dominican Republic has achieved a good position in the European, US and Caribbean markets. Europe accounts for 52% of the exports, followed by the United Kingdom (41%), the US (4%) and Canada (2%).





Peruvian sector waiting until season starts

There is currently no mango trade in Peru. The latest season finished in March and the new harvest will not hit the market until December. The country had a good position in the US market in January and February and is now considered the leading supplier of mangoes. This year, Peru exported between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes to the US in those months. In total, 150,000 tonnes were harvested in the first three months of this year, which is 20% more than in the previous year.





When looking at the long term, it is clear that the sector has been developing. Over the last ten years, the value of the production has doubled from $ 262 million in 2005 to $ 523 million in 2016.





Before the start of the coming season, the impact of the Coastal El Niño could have major consequences. Mango trees are currently in bloom and the damage that the weather phenomenon has caused to irrigation infrastructure could take a toll on the crop. Irrigation is important from July to November. It is still too early in the season to determine whether the crop will suffer from these irrigation problems.

Guatemala closes season with smaller sizes

The season is already over. The country has a good position on the US market, but as soon as the campaign comes to a close, Mexico takes its place. According to a US importer, the sizes this season have been slightly smaller than usual, but they recovered after the rains recorded in Guatemala during the season.





Philippines harvests fewer mangoes

In the first half of this year, the harvest volume was 10% lower than last year. 654,100 tonnes were harvested, compared to 724,870 tonnes a year earlier. The main reason for this fall has been the impact of rain in combination with insects pests during the flowering period.





Chinese market can increase production volume

The main mango cultivation areas are in Sanya (Hainan Province), Baisan (Guangxi Province), Yunnan Province and Panzhihou (Sichuan Province). The season kicked off in April in Hainan. In addition to domestic production, mangoes are also imported from south east Asia and Ecuador and Peru. The large volume coming from Asian countries competes with the domestic production. Production costs in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are significantly lower than in China. The Peruvian import season lasts from December to June and is followed by the Australian export season; however, Peruvian mangoes must undergo a heat treatment and the transport time is considerably longer. Also, there are initiatives to export premium Chinese mangoes of varieties like the Guifei or Red Dragon to Europe.





Israeli mango season at full steam The mango season is now going full steam ahead. In a week or two, the season of the early varieties will come to an end. The later varieties, like the Kent and Keitt, are already on the market. The season lasts until the end of September. ""We have had a good harvest,"" reported a trader. ""July and August are traditionally months with little trade."" This is mainly due to the holiday period in Europe.

US traders satisfied with season's balance During this time of the year, most of the mangoes on the US market come from the northern Mexican region of Sinaloa, where the mango season is now almost about to end; the south is closing the season this week, while the north will follow suit at the end of September. At the moment, 2 million boxes of mangoes are shipped to the United States every week. That is a normal volume for the time of year.

By the end of the month, the first Brazilian mangoes will arrive, for which the peak period will be in mid-October. Furthermore, the Keitt mango from California will hit the market next month.

A trader said he was satisfied with the season's balance. The volume is about 2% higher this year than last year. This year, the peaks and falls in the season have been flatter, although there has also been a lack of larger sizes. Due to drought in Peru and southern Mexico, the mangoes have been smaller. Most of the demand is traditionally recorded in June or July. In the autumn, the demand practically disappears.

Spanish growers are investing in Osteen and in advancing the season start Although the season already started ten days ago, the volumes are still small. The campaign kicked off in Malaga with the first Tommy's, which will be followed by the Osteen, which accounts for 80% of the production. By the middle of October, the Kent and Keitt will also be on the market. The share of Tommy Atkins continues to decline, as more and more growers are replacing this variety with the Osteen. The Osteen is more productive and appreciated in the export markets.

According to a trader, the season started 15 days earlier than usual. The yield is lower this year, because it is an off-season. New plantations, however, are in production, which greatly compensates for the decrease in volume. ""We expect between 10 and 15% more production in general in the sector,"" said a trader.

Spanish mangoes are more expensive than those imported by sea, although in terms of quality, they actually compete against the mangoes imported by air. In that segment, Spanish mangoes are cheaper. Growers are looking for new varieties in order to extend the season. Currently, the campaign lasts for 2 to 2.5 months. Also, the focus is on advancing the start of the season, because the temperature in November is actually too low. According to estimates, production in 3 to 4 years will reach 60,000 tonnes.





The French prefer the Kent The Kent is the most popular variety in the French market. An importer explains that this is the reason why they only purchase this variety. Although it is imported all year round, there is a smaller volume available in August. An importer explains that they haven't been able to get any mangoes this week. In July, a lot of mangoes were imported from Mexico before the supply was reduced, which has to do with the smaller volume of Kent available; the competition with summer fruit is actually not an important factor.

From September, imports will increase again. Shipments will arrive from countries like Israel, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali, Peru and Colombia, among others. Of these, Peru is the largest supplier. The French have had an average season; last year, there was a greater volume available in the market. The volume of mangoes available is increasing every year. Prices are also rising on a yearly basis. In July, prices oscillated between 4 and 4.50 Euro per kilo, which is about the same as last year.

Normal market situation in the Netherlands There is a positive mood on the mango market, even though prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks. There has been a price difference of 3 Euro between Senegal and Brazil. Senegalese mangoes have been cheaper, while Brazilian and Israeli mangoes have been far more expensive. Prices are again stable. Brazil supplies Palmer, while Israel supplies Kent, and the Spanish Osteen will also be on the market again soon. The Brazilian and Israeli product yields between 7 and 7.50 Euro. ""For the market, it is always best if the price fluctuates around that rate."" The situation will not change in the coming weeks. A trader explains that ""currently, the mango supply is sufficient; not too big. The demand is on the rise and I believe it will remain fairly stable in the next few weeks.""





Early start in Darwin, Australia This year, the harvest in Darwin has started earlier than usual; a result of the high temperatures recorded in July. This has resulted in smaller volumes of Kensington Pride. The green varieties have already been on the market. In the coming months, the volume will further increase, with a peak in October. Western Australia also expects a bigger harvest. The mood there is positive. In September, other producing regions will also be on the market.

The sector sees opportunities for exports to the US and South Korea, although those markets are currently small. For the longer term, China and the Middle East have also been identified as ""promising markets.""

Linkedin News Desk (AFP) Los Angeles ● Thu, August 17, 2017 10:00 1385 4065a5a8898c7cc661d4adf97ace06f5 2 World #entertainment,#EmmaStone,#highest-paid Free

Oscar-winning Emma Stone capped a perfect 12 months on Wednesday as she knocked Jennifer Lawrence off the top spot on Forbes' 2017 list of the world's highest-paid actresses.

Stone, 28, who won best actress for her role as a struggling performer in ""La La Land,"" made $26 million in pre-tax earnings in the year up to June, according to the magazine's annual chart.

""Friends"" star Jennifer Aniston, 48, also leapfrogged Lawrence, grabbing the runner-up spot with earnings of $25.5 million, boosted by numerous endorsement deals across the world.

Lawrence's $24 million was enough for third spot but a shadow of the 27-year-old's earnings in the last Forbes list.

The star, who took the best actress Oscar for 2012 comedy-drama ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" topped the 2016 chart for a second successive year with $46 million.

Melissa McCarthy and Mila Kunis -- on $18 million and $15.5 million respectively -- rounded off the world's five highest-paid actresses.

The top 10 -- also including Emma Watson, Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Julia Roberts and Amy Adams -- made a combined $172.5 million, down 16 percent from last year's $205 million total, said Forbes.

The actors' list due to be published later in the week is expected to show once again men banking far more than their female counterparts.

The issue of pay disparity grabbed headlines in 2014 after a leak of stolen emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment showed that Lawrence was paid less than her male co-stars in the hit movie ""American Hustle.""

Last year, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson topped Forbes' list of highest-paid actors at $64.5 million, more than double Stone's total this year.

It has been an incredible few months for Stone, who completed a clean sweep of Hollywood's major prizes in February with an Oscar for her performance as an aspiring actress in ""La La Land.""

She had already picked up trophies at the Golden Globes, British BAFTAs and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Born Emily Jean Stone in Scottsdale, Arizona to a homemaker mother and businessman father, Stone began acting in youth theater in Phoenix.

At the age of just 14, she made a PowerPoint presentation entitled ""Project Hollywood"" to persuade her parents to allow her to drop out of school and pursue a movie career.

She has appeared in more than 20 movies since her 2007 debut in ""Superbad"" but really came to the fore as a major talent in ""The Help,"" Tate Taylor's 2011 drama about the racism faced by black maids in 1960s Mississippi.

A string of hit films followed, including two ""Spider-Man"" movies and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman,"" which earned Stone a best supporting actress nomination.","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2017/08/17/2017_08_17_31146_1502938314._large.jpg,"['tops', 'best', 'list', 'highestpaid', 'stone', 'emma', 'actresses', 'la', 'spot', 'actress', 'million', 'lawrence', 'forbes', 'earnings', 'paid']", ,none
58,58,Drought_Indonesia,7 Reasons We're Facing a Global Water Crisis - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/7-reasons-were-facing-global-water-crisis,"Droughts in Somalia. Water rationing in Rome. Flooding in Jakarta. It doesn't take a hydrologist to realize that there is a growing global water crisis. Each August, water experts, industry innovators, and researchers gather in Stockholm for World Water Week to tackle the planet's most pressing water issues.

What are they up against this year? Here's a quick rundown on the growing global water crisis.

1) We're Changing the Climate, Making Dry Areas Drier and Precipitation More Variable and Extreme.

Climate change is warming the planet, making the world's hottest geographies even more scorching. At the same time, clouds are moving away from the equator toward the poles, due to a climate-change driven phenomenon called Hadley Cell expansion. This deprives equatorial regions like sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central America of life-giving rainwater.

Paradoxically, climate change is also increasing precipitation in other areas, and people who live near rivers and streams have the most to lose. Currently, at least 21 million people worldwide are at risk of river flooding each year. That number could increase to 54 million by 2030. All countries with the greatest exposure to river floods are least developed or developing countries – which makes them even more vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. This summer, extreme flooding submerged over a third of Bangladesh, claiming over 115 lives and affecting 5.7 million citizens.

2) More People + More Money = More Water Demand.

It's a simple equation: As populations increase and incomes grow, so does water demand. The world's population, now at 7.5 billion, is projected to add 2.3 billion more people by 2050. How can the planet satisfy their thirst? Growing incomes also exacerbate the water problem, because of the water-intensive products—like meat and energy from fossil fuels—that richer populations demand.

3) Groundwater Is Being Depleted.

About 30 percent of Earth's fresh water lies deep underground in aquifers. And it's extracted daily for farming, drinking and industrial processes – often at dangerously unsustainable rates. Nowhere is this more evident than India, which guzzles more groundwater than any other country. 54 percent of India's groundwater wells are decreasing, meaning that water is used faster than it's replenished. Unless patterns shift, in 20 years, 60 percent of India's aquifers will be in critical condition.

Unlike an incoming hurricane or a drained lake, the naked eye cannot see when groundwater reserves in aquifers are declining. Global water supplies are susceptible to this hidden and growing threat.

4) Water Infrastructure Is in a Dismal State of Disrepair.

Having enough water to go around is only the beginning. That water also needs to be transported, treated, and discharged. Around the world, water infrastructure―treatment plants, pipes, and sewer systems―is in a state of disrepair. In the United States, 6 billion gallons of treated water are lost per day from leaky pipes alone. Built infrastructure is notoriously expensive to install and repair, meaning that many localities ignore growing infrastructure issues until disaster strikes, as it did in California earlier this year.

5) And Natural Infrastructure Is Being Ignored.

Healthy ecosystems are "" natural infrastructure"" and vital to clean, plentiful water. They filter pollutants, buffer against floods and storms, and regulate water supply. Plants and trees are essential for replenishing groundwater; without them, rainfall will slide across dry land, instead of seeping into the soil. Loss of vegetation from deforestation, overgrazing and urbanization is limiting our natural infrastructure and the benefits that it provides. Forested watersheds around the world are under threat: watersheds have lost up to 22 percent of their forests in the past 14 years.

6) Water Is Wasted.

Although it's true that water is a renewable resource, it's often wasted. Inefficient practices like flood irrigation and water-intensive wet cooling at thermal power plants use more water than necessary. What's more, as we pollute our available water at an alarming rate, we also fail to treat it. About 80 percent of the world's wastewater is discharged back into nature without further treatment or reuse. In many countries, it's cheaper to receive clean drinking water than to treat and dispose of wastewater, which encourages water waste. This brings us to the next issue:

7) The Price Is Wrong.

Globally, water is seriously undervalued. Its price does not reflect the true, total cost of service, from its transport via infrastructure to its treatment and disposal. This has led to misallocation of water, and a lack of investments in infrastructure and new water technologies that use water more efficiently. After all, why would a company or government invest in expensive water-saving technologies, when water is cheaper than the technology in question? When the price of receiving clean water is closer to its actual service cost, efficient water use will be incentivized. And on the flip side, the poor often end up paying disproportionately high prices for water, stunting development.

It's Not Too Late

Amidst these seven deadly water sins, there is good news: governments, businesses, universities and citizens around the world are waking up to water challenges, and beginning to take action. Each year brings more solutions – like using wastewater for energy, using restoration to bring water back to dry topographies, and monitoring groundwater levels more closely. However, even the best solutions will not implement themselves. Along with fresh water, political will and public pressure are critical resources in ensuring a sustainable future for all.","Mon, 28 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['natural', 'global', 'reasons', 'water', 'facing', 'crisis', 'plants', 'price', 'infrastructure', 'world', 'groundwater', 'growing', 'wastewater', 'worlds']", ,flood

While United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un indulged in a battle of incendiary rhetoric recently, ASEAN was at a crossroads. The regional grouping faced the choice between either buckling under the US pressure to further isolate North Korea and oust the country from the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) or rebuffing Washington’s request by standing firmly in the promotion of dialogue and diplomacy to de-escalate these simmering tensions.

Sensibly and correctly, ASEAN chose the latter.

Discussions on settling the Korean Peninsula conflict during the ASEAN Ministers Meeting (AMM), the East Asia Summit and the ARF were much anticipated. ASEAN issued a stand-alone statement conveying its grave concern over North Korea’s continued launch of ballistic missiles …

60,60,Drought_Indonesia,Japan's Nidec to sell factory automation robots - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Japan-s-Nidec-to-sell-factory-automation-robots,"OSAKA -- Japanese electronic parts maker Nidec will offer factory-automating robots and systems as soon as this year, targeting domestic manufacturers seeking labor-saving measures amid a worker drought.

The Kyoto-based company, which aims to do away with overtime for its workers by fiscal 2020, will test the productivity-boosting equipment at its own facilities. It hopes for annual sales of around 200 billion yen ($1.81 billion) for the business by that same fiscal year.

The use of the so-called internet of things in factories makes it possible to produce goods without human labor. It also allows for automatically adjusting output volumes to meet demand, and offers domestic manufacturers the possibility of competing on the cost front with cheap labor in the Asia region, even while producing at home in Japan.

Nidec aims to directly sell systems based around factory robots and including linked components such as reducers, sensors and cameras, offering its artificial intelligence technology together with its robotics technology.

Vice Chairman Mikio Katayama, former president of Japan-based Sharp, is central to the development of the new ""smart factory"" business. Technology made in cooperation with external companies will play a part as well.

Nidec has already begun jointly developing automated carrier machines with a startup based in Ibaraki Prefecture. The two have produced carrier robots that navigate spaces using wireless communication, as well as ones equipped with automatic following functions.

A group company's factory to be built in Vietnam for 55 billion yen presents an opportunity to test the technology. Nidec will gather data in such areas as cost savings and productivity boosts on its own turf before offering its systems to major manufacturing plants.

Precision motors for computer hard-disk drives have been among Nidec's bread-and-butter products, but through acquisitions, it has been shifting toward mid- and large-size motors for industrial and consumer-electronics applications. The company is accelerating a module-based strategy in which it sells motors together with related components, shooting for consolidated sales of 2 trillion yen by fiscal 2020.

Factory automation robots have drawn demand not only from Japanese manufacturers -- who face a labor crunch triggered by a shrinking population and other factors -- but also from overseas companies looking to raise productivity. The global market for next-generation factory automation devices and systems may nearly triple by 2022 to around 6.96 trillion yen from about 2.45 trillion yen in 2017, according to marketing research firm Fuji Keizai.

A stockman rides his horse as he leads another down a road toward the cattle yards in the outback town of Windorah, Queensland, located south of Stonehenge, in Australia, Aug. 11, 2017.

Stonehenge in England averages 10 days a month of rainfall and a maximum temperature of 22 degrees Celsius (72 Fahrenheit).

The town in Australia averages 325 sunny days a year and summer temperature of about 45C (113F), and forget regular rain.

How the town got its name is a mystery.

Praying for rain

Stonehenge's remaining 23 residents say they are struggling to survive one of the longest droughts in memory.

""Certainly, this is the worst drought I've seen in the last 28 years because of its longevity. It's just gone on for so long,"" said cattle and sheep farmer Tony Jackson.

Jackson's Hill View Park Station property of more than 150,000 acres (60,000 hectares) is excellent wool country because of the stones. Less dirt means better quality wool.

He manages 800 cattle and about 6,000 sheep on the drought-hit property, but he fears he will have no feed or water if there is no rain by Christmas.

Jackson and his neighbors have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on feed.

Debt levels for broadacre farms, which include cattle, sheep and crops, is estimated to have increased by 7 percent during 2015-16 to average A$560,500 per farm, the Australian government's agricultural bureau said.

Other parts of Australia have seen the drought break, and farmers there are looking at a bright future. Cash incomes on cattle farms are estimated to be the highest in more than 20 years, at A$204,000 per farm, because of rising beef prices.

But the drought has a stranglehold on Stonehenge.

For the first time in more than 34 years, the main water supply, the meandering Thomson River, has stopped flowing.

Farmer Dick Smith says it has been seven years since the last decent rain filled the river.

""This is drought country. No one forced me to live here. We have to expect a drought, but this one's gone on too long,"" he said on the veranda of his home on the Depot Glen property.

Smith usually manages about 1,500 cattle but has destocked to survive and now has just 47 cows and calves.

He said that because of droughts over the past decades, he had ""completely destocked three times,"" and the potential for a fourth was high.

When the rains do come, the farmers of Stonehenge will struggle to pay for new stock at a time when cattle prices are at record levels because of demand for beef.

Hard on families

The drought has taken its toll on families, with the emotional and financial stress contributing to poor mental health, according to a study by the Australian National University.

The study examined 8,000 people living in drought and found that the more severe the drought, the more severe the impact on the mental health of a farmer and his family.

""You really have to love your husband to live out here,"" said Sue, a champion equestrian when she was young.

""We're not isolated up here. We have bitumen roads, telephones, internet, but I do miss white sheets,"" she said, referring to the groundwater that stains her sheets.

Stonehenge has suffered a huge loss of people because of the drought. The town many years ago boasted three hotels, and until just a decade ago, a population of 106.

Frank Irwin, who used to work on a farm, now runs the Stonehenge Hotel, a tin building with a bar crowned with empty beer bottles and rodeo memorabilia.

Stonehenge, like its English namesake, will survive, he said.

65,65,Drought_Indonesia,Thais change gears with 2 more golds - Bangkok Post,https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1309339/thais-change-gears-with-2-more-golds,"Thailand celebrate winning the sepak takraw team regu gold medal at the 29th SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

Kuala Lumpur: Thailand reigned supreme in the men's sepak takraw team regu and women's water polo at the SEA Games yesterday.

In sepak takraw, Thailand lived up to their top billing as they defeated Malaysia 3-0 in the final round-robin match of the men's team regu competition at the Titiwangsa Stadium, denying the hosts' mission to end their 26-year drought in the event.

For Thailand, the win is proof of their domination of the event as this is their 12th consecutive gold medal since the 1993 Manila SEA Games.

Indonesia took the silver after defeating Brunei 3-0 with Malaysia and Brunei sharing the bronze.

The early indicators of victory became evident in the win over Malaysia's first regu of Farhad Adam, Hanafiah Dollah and Syahir Rosdi.

Trio of Pattarapong Yupadee, Pornchai Kaokaew and Jantarit Khukaeo defeated the home players 21-15, 21-17 to put Thailand ahead.

The Thais' second regu of Assadin Wongyota, Anuwat Chaicana and Sittipong Khamchan followed suit with a 21-10, 21-6 victory over Safarudin Abu Bakar, Said Izwan Said and Muhamad Norhaffizi Abd Razak.

The third regu of Somporn Jaisinghol, Thawisak Thongsai and Kritsanapong Nontakonte completed the rout with an easy 21-9, 21-8 victory over Syazreenqamar Salehan, Meor Muhamad Zulfikar Mat Amin and Azlan Alias.

Thailand coach Thawat Kumutpongpanich said: ""Actually, the defining moment was the win by our first regu. It made our work easier. Had we lost, I'm sure the scenario would have been different.""

In the women's water polo, Thailand stamped their authority on the event with a 5-1 win over Singapore in their last round-robin match at the National Aquatic Centre to retain the title.

The Thais were in their element throughout the match, adopting defensive and counter-attacking strategies to deny and frustrate the Singaporeans.

""Our defence was awesome today. The Singaporeans tried hard to dominate the play and managed to keep our counter-attacks at bay,"" Thailand coach Daniele Ferri said.

""They continuously frustrated us in our attacks but we managed to keep our composure and strike hard when opportunities came.""

In another encounter, Indonesia recorded a thumping 7-1 victory over Malaysia to take home the bronze.

In the marathon, Singapore and the Philippines opened their SEA Games athletics campaigns on golden notes with Guillame Soh Rui Yong and Mary Joy Tabal winning the men's and women's titles respectively.

Soh, the 25 year-old defending champion, completed the men's race in 2:24.25hr, edging Indonesia's Agus Prayogo who came in second in 2:27.16.

""This win is for all Singaporeans,"" said Soh.

Thailand's Boonthueng Srisang failed to finish due to cramp.

In the women's marathon, Tabal earned the Philippines' first gold of the Games with a convincing performance, crossing the finishing line in 2:43.31, edging Vietnam's Hoang Thi Thanh and Thailand's Natthaya Thanaronnawat. agencies/bangkok post

67,67,Drought_Indonesia,Are we running out of fresh water? - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/are-we-running-out-of-fresh-water/a-40241057,"Two-thirds of the world is covered in water, containing over a billion trillion liters of water. So how could we have water shortages?

The vast majority of water on earth is saltwater and therefore not fit for human consumption. Only 2.5 percent of all water is freshwater. But more than two-thirds of that is locked away in ice caps and glaciers.

That leaves us with a very tiny fraction of water to drink, cook with, irrigate crops and feed livestock.

But water is a renewable resource that moves in a cycle. The amount of H2O on our planet will always remain the same, and won't run out as such.

The question is whether we will have enough clean water available for all citizens at all times.

Local water scarcity

According to a 2016 study by the University of Twente in the Netherlands, 4 billion people could face severe water shortages for at least a month every year.

In some regions, people are already severely affected by droughts and water scarcity. Millions of people in the Horn of Africa face hunger and illness after years of recurring drought. And Pakistan could run dry by 2025, a UN report suggests.

""Locally, the problem is very acute,"" Johannes Schmiester, a water expert at WWF Germany, told DW. ""And all available numbers and observations suggest that the situation will become more severe.""

Climate change is expected to intensify the situation. It alters weather patterns and water cycles around the world, causing shortages and droughts in some areas, and floods in others.

Extreme temperatures are also to blame for physical water scarcity. But in many cases experts as well point out ""economic"" water scarcity, due to how we manage our water supplies.

Water scarcity in India: People fill up their plastic canisters from water tanks

Groundwater is over-extracted; rivers and lakes are drying up or becoming too polluted to use.

To combat economic water scarcity, governments have to invest more in infrastructure for water supply and water storage, says Vincent Casey, a water expert at WaterAid.

""A big challenge is that water isn't always where you need it and when you need it most. So investment has to go into water storage and distribution, to ensure people always have access to safe water,"" he told DW.

Agriculture's thirst

One of the biggest water consumers is agriculture. Around 70 percent of all freshwater on the planet goes into irrigation of fields and feeding of livestock.

Farmers in some regions are already seeking to water their fields more efficiently. But researchers say this is not enough.

In Spain's tomato-growing region, farmers using the latest technology have managed to decrease their water consumption over the years. But in the industry as a whole - which produces a quarter of Europe's tomatoes - still needs more water than local water resources can supply.

As a result, the region faces water scarcity.

Researchers say the solution is to consider the entire geographical area and think in units of river basins. Can the local ecosystem sustain agricultural production?

""It's important to change perspective and consider whether local fresh water supplies can support certain industries,"" says Schmiester from WWF.

Growing demand

An additional strain on water management is our ever-growing consumption.

According to the World Health Organization, human beings need at least 20 liters (5.3 gallons) of freshwater per day to prepare meals and for basic personal hygiene. Laundry and bathing are not included.

Water consumption is much higher in industrialized countries, though - for example, the average person in Germany uses 140 liters per day. Flushing the toilet alone uses 30 liters.

To conserve water, irrigation can be made more efficient

Our indirect water footprint is even higher: 840 liters of water are required to produce one pot of coffee. And more than 8,000 liters go into a single pair of jeans.

Growing consumption calls for better reuse of water and more efficient production. The theme of this year's World Water Week addresses ""water and waste,"" and how to reduce use and recycle water.

More than 3,000 experts will exchange ideas and develop solutions for waste water treatment and poor water management.

But Casey warns that technical solutions won't be a silver bullet for the global water crisis.

""It ultimately comes down to political decisions over allocations and effective governance of the resource. Solutions have to be devised in the countries where the problems are - and only then can water scarcity be solved,"" he concluded.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19200293_6.jpg,"['liters', 'need', 'running', 'local', 'wont', 'freshwater', 'water', 'solutions', 'consumption', 'fresh', 'world', 'scarcity']", ,none
68,68,Drought_Indonesia,Trees in the Amazon make their own rain - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/trees-amazon-make-their-own-rain,"Trees in the Amazon make their own rain

The Amazon rainforest is home to strange weather. One peculiarity is that rains begin 2 to 3 months before seasonal winds start to bring in moist air from the ocean. Now, researchers say they have finally figured out where this early moisture comes from: the trees themselves.

The study provides concrete data for something scientists had theorized for a long time, says Michael Keller, a forest ecologist and research scientist for the U.S. Forest Service based in Pasadena, California, who was not involved with the work. The evidence the team provides, he says, is “the smoking gun.”

Previous research showed early accumulation of moisture in the atmosphere over the Amazon, but scientists weren’t sure why. “All you can see is the water vapor, but you don’t know where it comes from,” says Rong Fu, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Satellite data showed that the increase coincided with a “greening” of the rainforest, or an increase in fresh leaves, leading researchers to suspect the moisture might be water vapor released during photosynthesis. In a process called transpiration, plants release water vapor from small pores on the underside of their leaves.

Fu thought it was possible that plants were releasing enough moisture to build low-level clouds over the Amazon. But she needed to explicitly connect the moisture to the tropical forest.

So Fu and her colleagues observed water vapor over the Amazon with NASA’s Aura satellite, a spacecraft dedicated to studying the chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere. Moisture that evaporates from the ocean tends to be lighter than water vapor released into the atmosphere by plants. That’s because during evaporation, water molecules containing deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen made of one proton and one neutron, get left behind in the ocean. By contrast, in transpiration, plants simply suck water out of the soil and push it into the air without changing its isotopic composition.

Aura found that the early moisture accumulating over the rainforest was high in deuterium—“too high to be explained by water vapor from the ocean,” Fu says. What’s more, the deuterium content was highest at the end of the Amazon’s dry season, during the “greening” period when photosynthesis was strongest.

The tree-induced rain clouds could have other domino effects on the weather. As those clouds release rain, they warm the atmosphere, causing air to rise and triggering circulation. Fu and colleagues believe that this circulation is large enough that it triggers the shift in wind patterns that will bring in more moisture from the ocean, they report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Scientists have studied the connection between trees and rain in the Amazon before. A 2012 study found that plants help “seed” the atmosphere for rain by releasing tiny salt particles. But the new study strongly supports the idea that plants play an important role in triggering the rainy season, says Scott Saleska, an ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was not involved with the work. The deuterium provides a clear “fingerprint” for what plants contribute to the process, he says.

The findings also address a long-standing debate about the role plants play in weather, says Saleska, suggesting that they are more than just “passive recipients,” and that they instead can play an active role in regulating rainfall. If that’s true in the Amazon, Saleska says, climate scientists will need to take into account practices like deforestation when predicting regional changes in weather patterns. And curbing deforestation will be an important step for people to take in preventing drought.

Next, Fu will be studying rainforests in the Congo, to see whether the same process is happening.","Fri, 04 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/cc_G4X446-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=olvJwxCR,"['vapor', 'fu', 'amazon', 'scientists', 'water', 'plants', 'atmosphere', 'moisture', 'ocean', 'weather', 'trees', 'rain']", ,drought

70,70,Drought_Indonesia,Tropics most prone to soil erosion - SciDev.Net,https://www.scidev.net/global/news/annual-mean-rainfall-erosivity-above-global-average/,"[NEW DELHI] Regions in the tropical climate zones suffer the greatest rainfall-related soil erosion, reports an international study.



The study, published last month (July) in Scientific Reports, has developed the first-ever Global Rainfall Erosivity Database and a Global Erosivity Map. It notes that while rainfall provides moisture critical for plant growth, it is also one of the prime causes of soil degradation, referred to as rainfall erosivity, which threatens food and water sustainability.



For experts, model predictions of global erosivity are very important because they help assess risks as well as plan and implement effective soil mitigation and restoration strategies.



According to the study, erosion by rainfall remains poorly quantified despite its significance. This is because it is a complex event influenced by various factors including rainfall intensity, duration, amount and frequency — factors which are not captured in current erosivity estimates.

“In a given year, there are rainstorms of different intensity and duration. Other factors like the protective vegetation also vary throughout the year” Anton Vrieling

To model annual rainfall erosivity for different regions, the international team relied on rainfall data gathered from 3,625 stations scattered across 63 countries. Their analysis shows that annual mean rainfall erosivities for countries in the tropics are more than double the global average of about 2,190 megajoule millimetres per hectare per hour per year.



South America (particularly Brazil, Columbia and Peru), South-Eastern Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Bangladesh), the Caribbean, and Western and Central Africa have annual mean rainfall erosivities that are greater than 5,000 megajoule millimetres per hectare per hour per year.



Cold and dry regions like Canada, the Russian Federation, Northern Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East have the lowest annual mean rainfall erosivity.



“The tropical forests and the monsoon zones (covering Amazonia part of Brazil, Central Africa and Southeast Asia) have intense rainfall but also excess monthly precipitation (greater than 1,000 millimetres for two consecutive months),” says Panos Panagos, study leader and scientific officer at the Joint Research Centre, European Commission. “The Mediterranean zone (a typical temperate climate zone) has seasonal rainfalls which are less intense than the ones in the tropical zones.”

Global erosivity map



Adapted from original in Scientific Reports.

“This is a great effort,” says Anton Vrieling, assistant professor of geo-information science and earth observation at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. However, he observes that calculating rainfall erosivity at different times in a year would be more useful than having an annual average value.



“In a given year, there are rainstorms of different intensity and duration. Other factors like the protective vegetation also vary throughout the year,” notes Vrieling.

With extreme rainfall events becoming more common as a result of climate change, soil erosion is expected to increase — leading to further impacts on agricultural production , and a greater contribution to disaster-related risks such as flooding and landslides.Panagos says the emerging risks can be managed through good agricultural practices like reduced tillage, cover crops, grass margins and contour farming

EU's Water Footprint ©iStock/danymages The EU uses 668 km3​ of water for all of the goods it produces, consumes and exports annually. Roughly 38% is water from outside the EU with 98% of foreign water use coming for agricultural commodities mainly from: Brazil (20%); Argentina (11%); Indonesia (8%); Ivory Coast (8%); Ghana (4%); the US (4%); Ukraine (3%); Malaysia (3%) and India (3%).

Source: Water Footprint Network Report ​

The study titled ‘Dependencies of Europe’s economy on other parts of the world in terms of water resources’​​ was carried out as part of EU-funded project IMPREX​​ (Improving Predictions and Management of Hydrological Extremes).

It measured water availability in countries for which the EU is reliant upon for agricultural commodities and compared with EU consumption of each commodity.

The report expects sugarcane, almonds and pistachios will be vulnerable in the near future due to current water scarcity.

Water scarcity is not affecting cocoa and coffee at present, but longer-term climate change may alter rainfall and weather patterns in origin countries ultimately harming these crops, it says.

‘They don’t see how vulnerable they are’​

Dr. Ertug Ercin, project manager of the Water Footprint Network and co-author of the report told ConfectioneryNews water scarcity was “underestimated”​ by Europe’s confectionery industry.

“Multinationals are aware that there can be problems related to water scarcity, but they don't see how vulnerable they are in the case of a drought, or climate change....and the destruction it means for their production.""​

""This is a big issue...The current and future drought situations may affect businesses, including through an increase in commodity prices.""​

He added some agricultural commodities grow only in certain countries or climates, making it harder to source elsewhere.

""If the rainfall is not there, you have two choices: Either you have to irrigate or you have to find somewhere else.​

""For example for cocoa, if you look at the chocolate industry, there's only certain places where it's grown. You don't have many choices - you can’t go to the Netherlands or Germany,"" ​he said.

Irrigation systems are not widely used in cocoa. Around 95% of cocoa​​ is grown by smallholder farmers on small land plots of one to three hectares, typically by West African farmers often living in poverty.

Dr. Ercin said confectioners might only be able to offset higher input costs via price increases so much before upsetting retailers and consumers.

""[Companies] realize there is a risk with climate change, but they are looking at climate from the perspective of global warming. They underestimate the water issues,”​ said Dr. Ercin.

""When there's a lack of water, competition for water increases, scarcity increases,”​ he said, adding this will ultimately lead to commodity price hikes.

Almonds ‘highly vulnerable’​

Almonds are predicted to be the worst affected agri-commodity with 91% of EU almonds classified as “highly vulnerable,”​ according to the report

Almost all crops imported to the EU from India and Pakistan are in areas with high water scarcity, it adds.

Around 56% of EU sugarcane imports are vulnerable, the report says.

According to Dr. Ercin, most EU businesses will opt for locally sourced beet sugar. However, he said once the sugarcane supply from outside the EU declines – for example in India - there will be increased demand for EU beet sugar causing a spike in prices.

Drought is already harming hazelnut production in Turkey this year, he added.

""Next year, the chocolate industry will suffer and it will affect their prices if they are producing hazelnut chocolate,”​ said the report author.

Cocoa vulnerable if rainfall patterns change​

Current water scarcity is creating immediate risks for these crops. However, any future disruption in rainfall patterns driven by climate change could impact other crops, such as cocoa, says the Water Footprint Network’s paper.

""At the moment they are not vulnerable,” said Dr. Ercin. ​

“But rainfall patterns will change and areas [such as West Africa] can be negatively affected…that's the worry there. These are ‘rain fat’ commodities - they mostly grow by rainfall,” ​he said.

South America – particularly Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia – are the most vulnerable cocoa origins, according to the report’s maps.

""West Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia are the least impacted,"" ​said Dr. Ercin.

What can companies do?​

Dr. Ercin suggested companies map where water scarcity and drought may affect their business most and look at adaptation measures, such as increasing water productivity.

Climate change and cocoa forecasts Source: CIAT A​nalysis​​ published last year by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) predicts a 57% reduction in high climatic suitability areas in top cocoa producing nation Côte D’Iviore from present day to 2050.

The report author urged companies to take a holistic approach, looking beyond solely where they source their agri-commodities.

""Most of the time they look at [their direct supply], which is not enough, they have to look at the situation of the whole water resources in the area because ultimately if anything goes wrong it will affect them,” ​said Dr. Ercin.

He advised companies to support vulnerable regions by promoting good agricultural practices, infrastructure and irrigation systems.

""The most important thing is to build the capacity of the growers at every level,” ​he said.

The report was the first phase of the Water Footprint Network’s project.

It will further explore how climate change and weather extremes may alter the vulnerability levels of different economic sectors in the EU and will assess the economic consequences.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/4/7/4/8/7198474-1-eng-GB/Water-scarcity-and-climate-change-Impact-on-sugar-cocoa-and-nuts.jpg,"['eu', 'confectionery', 'change', 'vulnerable', 'cocoa', 'rainfall', 'water', 'footprint', 'hit', 'report', 'market', 'underestimated', 'climate', 'scarcity']", ,drought
72,72,Drought_Indonesia,"Rohaya-Selamet Marriage Isn't Funny, but Disturbing and Unlawful - The News Lens 關鍵評論網",https://international.thenewslens.com/article/75275,"Earlier this month, news about a wedding that took place in Karangendah Village, Ogan Komering Ulu (OKU), South Sumatra, between a 16-year-old boy named Selamet Riyadi and a 71-year-old woman named Rohaya went viral. Social media and online news outlets were flooded with pictures and a video of Selamet taking oath before a local clergy to officiate his relationship with Rohaya as husband and wife.



The wedding was unregistered, locally known as nikah siri, which, although not formally acknowledged by the state, is considered valid under Islamic law. Later on, the couple was invited to the talk show ""Hitam Putih,"" known for its bluntly speaking host Dedy Corbusier, where they were asked to spill some beans on their rather unusual courtship. Before the camera, again and again, Rohaya and Selamet defended their professed love for each other, greeted by laughter and giggles from the audience.



As the overly exposed marriage between Rohaya and Selamet continued to fill people’s news feeds and trending topics in the past weeks, facts about the couple’s new married life started to emerge.



It is unclear whether Selamet is currently still in school, but the interview on ""Hitam Putih"" reveals that now Selamet has taken up the role as the financial provider of the household by doing menial jobs for people in the village. When he goes off to work, Rohaya stays at home and takes care of the house. Out of jealousy, Selamet would often lock Rohaya up in the house when he is away because he is worried Rohaya would wander around with another man.



Selamet also does not seem to understand the concept of procreation, as he eagerly boasts to the audience that he wants to have children with Rohaya. Something that triggered another collective giggle by the audience.

Child marriage, gender irrelevant

From the way the media and the public reacted to the news, one thing is clear: they all seemed to think it’s funny for a boy like Selamet to be in love with an elderly woman such as Rohaya. Nobody seemed to mind, let alone find the matter odd and disturbing. It is as if we intentionally disregard the fact that the boy is only 16 years old, three years shy from the legally allowed age for men to be married, according to Indonesian Marriage Law No. 1/1974. This makes him an under-age minor by the law and therefore the marriage hereof should be automatically regarded as a child marriage. There were no voices of resentment from the authority, including the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (Komisi Perlindungan Anak Indonesia/KPAI), when in fact child marriage has been long regarded as a serious threat to the fulfillment of child rights.



People’s reaction is exactly the opposite when a similar child marriage case emerged back in 2008. At the time, Syekh Puji, a wealthy businessman from Semarang, was brought in for questioning by the authority and sentenced to four years in jail and a Rp 60 million (US$942,000) fine for marrying a 12-year-old girl. His act was proven felony against the Law on Child Protection.



What is it that gets us all fired up when an adult man marries a little girl, but keeps us chill as a cucumber in a cold winter when an adult woman marries a little boy? Why do we think it’s creepy for a grown-up man to be lurking at a little girl, but find an adult woman lusting over a boy as merely a joke? Both are fine examples of child marriage and statutory rape; both of which in countries such as the U.S. and U.K. are considered crime and punishable by law.



The double standard may be linked with the patriarchal values that are rooted in many societies, including Indonesia. Women are seen as weak, helpless and emotional beings that make them vulnerable to harm and pain, while men are typically strong and assertive. This dichotomy of femininity and masculinity has led to a general assumption that men are independent and therefore can take care of themselves, even when they are in a difficult situation or trapped in an abusive relationship.



While it is true that the majority of child marriages involve girls, boys can be victims, too. Recent data from UNICEF shows that 18 percent of those married before the age of 18 are boys, and 82 percent are girls. Because he is a boy, the public may see Selamet as an independent being who can choose not to marry Rohaya and leave her whenever he wants to. However, the fact that he is still a child makes it hard for him to make informed decisions, and therefore he is vulnerable to manipulative actions asserted by adults.



Selamet, in this case, is as vulnerable as the 12-year-old girl that was married off to Syekh Puji nine years ago. Still, we chose to shrug our shoulders and laugh it off.

Child marriage violates children rights

Selamet now has to earn every penny he can get to provide for his wife. A boy his age in Indonesia is normally an 11th grader struggling his way to finish middle school. They should be worrying about final exams and prep schools instead of paychecks and overdue bills. Many victims of child marriage are denied their rights to education and skills development which, ultimately, puts an end to the possibility for them to be able to live a healthy and fulfilling life and to contribute fully to their families and communities.



We may not immediately realize this but we adults who sit at the front row of the audience bench and laugh the loudest when reading up on Selamet and Rohaya’s wedding are also responsible for normalizing child marriage while, at the same time, robbing Selamet of his childhood and his every chance to live a fulfilling life.

Still think it’s haha funny?

Prone to domestic violence

As a child, by default Selamet is a victim. But he may not be the only one. Locking Rohaya up in the house because she is not allowed to hang out with other men in the village is a sign of abusive relationship. Domestic violence is dangerous and could seriously bring fatal harm to the victims.



Studies have shown that child marriages are prone to domestic violence, be it physical, emotional or psychological. Chances are Selamet and many other teenagers are never given proper education and understanding of what a healthy and equitable relationship is. Indonesia has always been in limbo in deciding whether or not teenagers should be given access to proper sex education.



The strong patriarchal values, moreover, may put Selamet in a situation where he thinks he holds full power over his wife, because, you know, he is a man. He may think that controlling Rohaya is an expression of love, when, in fact, it is a form of violence. Putting a child who does not know squad in a situation where he is expected to be accountable for his actions in itself is a fallacy.



It is time we put an end to romanticizing child marriage. Child marriage is no joke. It is illegal, unlawful and should be treated as such, no matter who the victim is — a girl or a boy. No exception. The government and society as a whole have the responsibility to ensure every child is protected for their best interests and is not forced into a situation where they are denied their rights.



It is also a perfect time for us to revisit our constant (ab)use of nikah siri. Let us, for a moment, think back how we have been misguided in exercising the leniency in Islam to practice this type of marriage. If we continue misusing it for the sake of justifying child marriage or abusive polygamous relationship, then the joke is really on us.

73,73,Drought_Indonesia,Climate change begs for policy initiatives in South Asia - East Asia Forum,https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2017/08/26/climate-change-begs-for-policy-initiatives-in-south-asia/,"Author: Simrit Kaur and Harpreet Kaur, University of Delhi

Staring at the tipping point of an environmental crisis, South Asia is mute and in self-denial. Collective wisdom needs to prevail in order for climate change policies to be implemented across the region that prepare for — and prevent — the dangers that lie ahead.

Floods, storms, landslides, droughts, wildfires, hail and tornados are the new norms of South Asia’s ecology. Increases in global temperatures have not only caused rising sea levels, but have also impacted the availability of agricultural land for cultivation. Equally alarming is the influence of rising temperatures on growing conditions for crops, with increases in crop failures and production declines threatening regional food security.

Based on the Global Climate Risk Index, Bangladesh and Pakistan have been assigned a global rank as high as 6 and 7 respectively in terms of risks associated with climate change, with related annual GDP losses of close to 0.7 per cent. But other countries in South Asia have not fared well either. Coping with fragile mountainous ecosystems is a challenge for Bhutan and Nepal, and addressing risks associated with low-lying coastal areas remains crucial for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India and Pakistan also face the challenge of sustaining agricultural production in drought prone arid and semi-arid regions.

Ongoing research indicates that countries in the region experienced the highest decadal average temperatures recorded from 2001–2010. The decadal average temperatures increased the most in Afghanistan, rising by 1.57 degrees Celsius in the last hundred years. Bhutan was hotter by 1.28 degrees Celsius and Pakistan by 1.2 degrees Celsius for the same period. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and the Maldives also exhibited higher temperature volatilities during the same period.

Given the already precarious food security situation in the region, rising temperatures and erratic monsoons will exacerbate the dismal conditions facing the undernourished in South Asia. Small landholders, the landless and women are expected to be the most vulnerable.

Several studies have estimated yields to decline the most in South Asia as compared to other regions, irrespective of the crop considered. Wheat yields are expected to decline by 45 per cent compared to 35 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa. Rice yields too are expected to decline by 0.75 tonnes per hectare in India with a 2–4 degrees Celsius temperature increase. Although the share of rice in caloric intake has fallen, poor households continue to spend a disproportionate amount of their income on rice as a staple food.

Adapting to climate change remains crucial for South Asian countries. It is important to design and implement proactive and reactive policies at all levels of governance.

At the national level, many countries have developed their own national adaptation programs. Constructing ‘bunds’ — embankments used to stop the flow of surface water and run off — in India, improving livestock rearing productivity in Pakistan and Nepal, and using bamboo for drip irrigation in Bhutan are a few examples. Households in South Asia have also adapted by planting different crops, using a better variety of seeds and altering the timing of crop plantation.

But adaptation efforts remain fragmented. Equally disappointing is the decline of public investments in agriculture for South Asian countries. In Bhutan for instance, investment declined from over 30 per cent in 1980 to under 10 per cent in 2015. Given the government’s inability to finance agricultural infrastructure, public–private partnerships need to be promoted.

Water security is also a contentious issue. The Asian Water Development Outlook reports South Asia as a global ‘hot spot’, with many countries in the region classified as having ‘hazardous’ water security. Other consequences of climate are bound to further impact water availability. Agricultural irrigation demand in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia is estimated to increase by at least 10 per cent for an increase in temperature of 1 degree Celsius.

While expanding irrigation remains important, improving irrigation management systems cannot be neglected. Regrettably, not much is being done. India’s adoption of sprinkler and drip irrigation ensuring ‘more crop per drop’ is one positive example that needs replication.

Finally, regional cooperation is required to avoid the wasteful duplication of limited resources. Asian regional research organisations — such as the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation — could develop initiatives towards regional cooperation for food security. To counter volatility in food prices, building regional food stocks and operationalising the South Asia Food Bank may also be explored.

Individual countries should take the lead. While Bangladesh could initiate the dissemination of knowledge in setting up micro-credit systems, India could be a forerunner in publicising the private sector’s participation in agricultural markets. Such interactions would undoubtedly go a long way in strengthening the capacity of South Asia to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture and food security.

74,74,Drought_Indonesia,Canary in the Arctic coal mine: warming harms migrating red knot - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2017/08/canary-in-the-arctic-coal-mine-warming-harms-migrating-red-knot/,"The Arctic is warming faster than any other part of the world, and its ecosystems are changing quickly, with shifts in the timing of insect hatches, plant growth and more.

Those changes are impacting migratory species that move between the Arctic, the tropics and temperate zones. One such species is the red knot, a shorebird whose Arctic food supply and stored energy have been reduced due to climate change.

A recent study found that young red knots (Calidris canutus) have shrunk by about 15 percent since 1985. This shrinkage includes a smaller beak which jeopardizes the juvenile birds’ survival as they dig for bivalves.

Researchers have detected a variety of global warming risks to species as they move from tropical wintering and Arctic summering grounds, and along migratory routes, including shrinking tundra; rising seas; increasingly extreme weather; ocean acidification; and changes to specialized environments, such as temperate stopover havens.

What happens in the Arctic, doesn’t stay in the Arctic: change flows south of the Arctic Circle as an altered jet stream brings extreme weather to middle latitudes, some scientists say. It also rises, as thawing permafrost leaks CO 2 and methane into the atmosphere, heightening global temperatures. And, more and more, it flies out of the North, into temperate and tropical ecosystems, as migratory birds are impacted adversely by a hotter Arctic climate.

In recent years, climate change-affected migratory species have become a major focus of the Arctic Council’s Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna subgroup, and the United Nations Convention on Migratory Species. Both are trying to determine not only how climate change is altering Arctic ecosystems, but how those shifts are impacting ecosystems to the south, with migratory animals — especially birds — acting as a kind-of vector of transmission.

One major problem they’re looking at: the rapidly warming Arctic has resulted in dramatic changes in plants and the makeup and timing of insect hatches, meaning that birds reliant on a particular Arctic food supply are often now departing the North on long migratory journeys with less stored energy than in years prior.

“The Arctic is very important for shorebirds and waterbirds, like geese and ducks, and some species of sea birds, like terns,” says Borja Heredia, head of the avian unit at the UN Convention on Migratory Species. “All of these creatures use the Arctic. But the ice is melting, the conditions are changing, and the timing of migration is being affected by climate change.” Migratory birds that spend their summers in the Arctic, have winter destinations as far away as the forests of Central America and the Amazon basin, or the shores of West Africa — which makes the conservation of stopover habitat all the more important

The Red Knot (Calidris canutus) is a scientifically documented example of a climate change impacted migratory species. Flocks of these shorebirds, a medium-sized sandpiper, fly 9,300 miles north, from wintering grounds on the Mauritania coast in West Africa, to the high Russian Arctic. There, as the snow melts, the birds mate. Once the chicks emerge from their eggs, they spend two months gorging on insects, fattening up for the long voyage back to Africa. Or at least, that’s how it used to work.

“Due to Arctic warming, the juvenile red knots are still making it to West Africa, but by the time they arrive they’re so small they have a problem getting food out of the sediment,” says Jan van Gils, a marine ecologist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. In a 2016 study in Science, van Gils found that the young birds have shrunk by about 15 percent since 1985. Part of this shrinkage includes a smaller beak which jeopardizes their survival. Red knots eat bivalves buried about three to four centimeters in the sand, but now their beaks are often too short to reach such depths, and the birds are forced to subsist on less nutritious seagrass instead.

As a result of this problem, along with other stressors especially habitat loss, redknots are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

Scientists hypothesize that the red knots’ shrinking size is likely due to a trophic mismatch in the Arctic breeding grounds. “Because they are migratory, they have difficulties keeping up with the rates of change in the high Arctic, especially in their own food supply,” says van Gils. With the snow melting earlier and earlier, insects are emerging ahead of schedule, while the birds’ arrival and hatching dates have stayed the same. As a result, the red knots’ reproduction schedule is now mismatched with peak food availability, and the chicks grow without an adequate protein source.

This North-originating problem “might even lead to a vicious cycle where, once they’re smaller, they cannot feed on bivalves in West Africa and have to switch to seagrass, which is harder to fuel up on, [making it] harder to leave earlier for Russia to get the insects.”

Of greater concern, this phenomenon isn’t likely limited to red knots. A number of species around the world are shrinking in body size due to global warming, impacting their ecosystems in various ways. For migratory species, these impacts are doubled.

Heredia emphasizes that regional climate change effects on migratory species can be a two-way street. “These impacts happen in one direction and the other direction [too]… Many of these [Arctic] species will go into the tropics, and there you have deforestation,” along with escalating drought and other climate change precipitated stressors. There are problems for long distance migrators at mid latitudes too.

A 2014 study, for example, found that climate change exacerbates the risk of extinction for nearly 90 percent of North American shorebirds, all of which are migratory. Researchers detected global warming risks in tropical wintering and Arctic summering grounds, and along migratory routes — including shrinking tundra; rising sea levels; increasingly stormy, extreme weather; ocean acidification; and alterations to specialized environments, such as the temperate stopover havens where migrants rest.

For North American red knots, this makes for multiple climate change-induced pressures all along their routes. Beside shrinking nesting grounds and a food shortage in the Arctic, the birds must also face warming and acidic oceans that inhibit the growth of shellfish (another important high energy food source); rising sea levels that can degrade and flood flyway marshes, plus altered nesting and stopover habitat that can expose them to more predators.

“Migration is a risky adventure,” says Heredia. “If birds are not well prepared, they’ll have a lot of problems.”

One solution: scientists and policymakers are now rallying nations along migratory flyways to conserve stopover habitat that provide avian species with a place to shelter, feed, and rest.

Later this year, in the Philippines, the Convention on Migratory Species will convene the parties in hopes of passing an agreement to protect the East Asian-Australasian flyway, a route that stretches from the Taimyr Peninsula in Russia to Alaska, and southward to Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and finally Antarctica. An estimated 55 migratory species travel along this route, with about five million birds using it per year.

Other migratory routes, summering and wintering grounds, urgently need to be assessed and protected. “From a conservation perspective, it’s very important to look at the whole itinerary of [a migratory bird species], not just one country or ecosystem,” says Heredia. “If we destroy these stopover sites, then forget it. It’s the end of the story.”

Balancing on a homemade ladder, the farmer retrieves cobs from a full granary, the bounty of this year's good rains, which broke three years of drought in Malawi.

Kanyangale, 44, from Kalumbu village, part of the capital city Lilongwe, says his 5-ton harvest of maize is double the previous year's crop, and he has some soya beans too. But he is still worried about his income.

“I am not sure I will get good prices for my crop. I planted more maize for home consumption and more soya beans for sale because the rains were good after the drought of last year, but if I do not get good prices, I will not have enough income to help my family,” he said.

Many of Malawi's smallholder farmers who grow maize as a cash crop have diversified into legumes like soya and groundnuts, hoping for better market prices should one crop fail due to drought.

But faced with climate change, uncertain markets and government policies they see as unhelpful, many farmers feel ill-equipped to decide how much of which crop to plant and when.

Last year's extreme weather, bringing both floods and drought, left many in a food fix.

Acting on specialist advice to diversify away from maize, some farmers grew more tobacco and soya in 2016, based on expectations of favourable prices in 2017.

But a glut has frustrated them, depriving them of a ready market for their surplus soya beans.

Yet those who ignored the advice and stuck with maize are also in trouble because of a government ban on the export of maize grown for domestic consumption.

“I am not happy about the ban,” said Kanyangale, a member of the 1,500-member Nyanja Farmers' Association. “If this is not lifted soon, I could [be forced to] sell my maize at giveaway prices to middlemen.”

“Growing maize is a must for me and low prices affect me greatly,” he added.

Help to adapt

Changing farming ways does not happen overnight, explained Peter Kaupa, a field officer with the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) who works with the Nyanja group.

“This year farmers will grow more tobacco because the price is right, and might grow less maize and soya because of what they have seen this season,” Kaupa said.

Farmers used to mono-cropping are reluctant to change their practices, he added, and struggle to make prompt decisions in the face of climate extremes and the implications of government policy for crop marketing and exports.

Kaupa's organization offers training on farm business practices, including cost-benefit analysis of which crops to grow and climate-smart agriculture to adapt to erratic weather.

NASFAM's initiative is part of a project promoted by the Technical Center for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), an international institution based in the Netherlands, which aims to reach over 200,000 farmers in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

More than 50,000 smallholder farmers across five districts in Malawi will be shown how to access real-time climate information, obtain weather-based insurance, and use drought-tolerant crop varieties.

Olu Ajayi, project leader at the CTA, said it hopes to help smallholder farmers increase their yields during droughts.

“Our partner in Malawi, NASFAM, also addresses the marketing aspect of the value chain by facilitating opportunities for farmers to get the best price for their produce,” said Ajayi.

Maize maze

Alice Kachere, who also farms in Lilongwe, grew more maize than soya this year, fearing lower prices for the legume.

Kachere hopes to sell her bumper harvest of 13 tons of maize and buy seed and equipment for next season.

Last year she planted tobacco but made a big loss and had to borrow money to prepare for this season. She too is anxious for the export ban to end so she can take advantage of trade with Kenya.

“I hear there is drought (in Kenya) and the prices we get will be high,” Kachere said. “I will be in trouble if the ban is not lifted.”

In May, Joseph Mwanamvekha, Malawi's trade minister, said the government was ready to issue export licences to traders who can prove they bought the maize for export and to farmers who have grown maize specifically to sell outside the country.

The government has not yet indicated when it will lift the ban on maize grown for home consumption, but the wait is affecting farmers who are anticipating better income from crop sales.

Malawi is projecting a bumper harvest of 3.2 million tons of maize this year, an increase of one-third over production in the 2015/16 season.

With an El Niño weather system forecast for this year, farmers would do well to brace for another drought by diversifying their crops, said Lluis Navarro, head of cooperation for the European Union in Malawi, which has invested in developing the southern African nation's agriculture.

“Maize is a crop that is very sensitive to climate change,” said Navarro.

Malawi's maize prices are the most volatile in the region, he said, making farmers reluctant to invest and produce a surplus they cannot be sure of selling.","Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/CD339FE3-0EB0-4C74-9AAE-E493EA2F86B3.jpg,"['policy', 'farmers', 'near', 'prices', 'crop', 'capital', 'choices', 'lilongwe', 'maize', 'drought', 'soya', 'confuse', 'climate', 'extremes', 'malawi']", ,drought
78,78,Drought_Indonesia,Did tiny algae fell mighty dinosaurs? - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/did-tiny-algae-fell-mighty-dinosaurs,"Did tiny algae fell mighty dinosaurs?

Seventy million years ago, they all came to drink in the rapidly drying river: long-necked sauropods, fierce theropods, crocodiles, lizards, and raven-sized birds. They never left. The giant and the tiny were entombed together in the riverbed, forming what is now a spectacular series of mass graves in northwestern Madagascar. Last week, researchers proposed a culprit behind this ancient mystery: harmful algal blooms (HABs), in the very water that had lured the animals.

The remains of such algal blooms “should be more common in the fossil record,” says vertebrate paleontologist Nicholas Pyenson of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who was not part of the study. But he cautions that they are tough to prove.

Bone beds always come with a mystery: Why did so many animals die at once? Floods and volcanoes are sometimes invoked, and for years researchers suspected that drought killed the animals whose fossils accumulated in the Maevarano Formation of Madagascar. Torrential rains punctuating periods of drought might have created turbulent rivers choked with sediment that buried skeletons intact.

One chunk of this formation “is the most fossiliferous package of rock I’ve ever seen,” says Raymond Rogers, a geologist at Macalester College in St. Paul, who has been studying the site for 2 decades. He and his colleagues have so far cataloged nearly 1200 specimens from a single bed a third the size of a tennis court.

Over time, the team grew skeptical of drought as the only explanation. Large and small animals nestle against each other, suggesting that the bodies were buried where they died and that the killer struck all kinds of animals without discrimination. In addition, whatever killed these animals “was fast-acting,” Rogers says, “dropping birds in their tracks.” And it happened again and again, creating multiple layers of bone beds.

Last week, at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology here, Rogers noted the arched-back posture of the dead, which suggests neck convulsions; an unusual carbonate crust, similar to those left by algae in other sediments; and the sheer number of dead birds. Taken together, he says, these clues suggest that the killer was “almost certainly harmful algal blooms,” which can develop repeatedly in the same place in late summer.

HABs have been implicated in mass deaths before. In 1878, a Nature paper noted a peculiar hyperextended neck posture—similar to the postures of the Maevarano creatures—in dead livestock near a lake; testing confirmed that the animals had ingested toxic cyanobacteria. And in a 2014 paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Pyenson and others suggested that toxic algae periodically killed hundreds of whales and other marine animals off the coast of what is now Chile, starting 11 million years ago.

Algae even might be implicated at Germany’s famous Messel Pit, says paleontologist Wighart von Koenigswald of the University of Bonn in Germany, who was not involved in the new study. That series of Eocene mass graves is full of birds and bats, he notes, making one explanation—sudden carbon dioxide degassing from an ancient lake—unlikely. Moreover, the beds include turtles caught in the act of copulation as well as pregnant mares, suggesting that the deaths happened during mating season across different years. years. Toxic algae are “the most plausible explanation,” Von Koenigswald says.

In Madagascar and elsewhere the smoking gun—direct evidence of algae—is still missing, Rogers acknowledges. He plans to hunt for chemical traces or biomarkers of algae in the rocks and fossils. If such evidence is found in Madagascar, says Smithsonian vertebrate paleontologist Kay Behrensmeyer, this “very provocative” idea might help explain other fossil troves. “It opens up a possibility that we probably have not been considering seriously enough.”","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/bone%20beds.jpg?itok=bUIXzBy6,"['toxic', 'mighty', 'tiny', 'paleontologist', 'rogers', 'killed', 'birds', 'dinosaurs', 'mass', 'algae', 'fell', 'madagascar', 'vertebrate', 'animals']", ,flood_and_drought

80,80,Drought_Indonesia,10 Artists on What Climate Change Actually Looks Like - Outside,https://www.outsideonline.com/2229726/these-artists-are-trying-make-climate-change-feel-visceral,"Climate change data has its problems: It is often lofty and complicated, hard to digest, and even harder to conjure into feelings of urgency. But artists are stepping in to marry data with their crafts, bridging the gap between scientific information and human connection. Recognizing that people often act by heart rather than logic, these ten artists aim to help viewers understand the data while developing an emotional attachment that convinces them to do something about it—now.

Zaria Forman

Amid the dire reality of melting ice sheets and subsequent rising sea levels, Zaria Forman opts to spotlight the beauty: “A bombardment of terrifying news is paralyzing, but focusing on the positive is empowering.” Forman’s staggeringly realistic paintings capture the majesty and fragility of the icebergs. Look closer and you’ll see the finely painted ice fjords crackling, crumbling, and melting. Still, Forman’s message always leans toward hope and action. “I try to celebrate what is still here; to give viewers the sense that it is still possible to do something to protect this Earth that sustains us.”

Sean “Hula” Yoro

Growing up in Hawaii, Sean “Hula” Yoro was raised to respect nature. The surfer and self-taught artist creates murals usually involving portraits on hard-to-reach locales like ship docks and dams to illustrate the changing landscape. In some cases, he paints on natural surfaces like icebergs or forest trees, letting the figures rapidly melt or get washed away by natural forces to create a sense of urgency. “The idea of my art not lasting adds another depth to the message and feels more real,” says Yoro.

At 24, painter and environmental science student Jill Pelto is already establishing a new kind of art informed by scientific data and inspired by early 20th-century explorers like Edward Adrian Wilson. Pelto knows that her generation and those that follow are the ones inheriting the issues and that the research isn’t always simple to digest. “I also find that many people just don’t pay attention,” she says. Her illustrations depict the same kind of graphs you might find in a textbook (decline in glacier mass balance; ocean acidification; deforestation) overlaid with watercolor paintings of the affected natural wonders, bringing the research to life.

Murals can transform cities and inspire change. Photographer Tre’ Packard, who founded PangeaSeed with his wife to promote environmental activism through art and education, applies the same concept to ocean conservation. The organization’s Sea Walls festivals, hosted in cities around the world, unite artists with scientists to create abstract street art that encourages dialogue. “I’m not delusional,” says Packard. “I know we are not going to change the world, but small efforts add up. We want to lead by example.”

Courtney Mattison

One of the challenges in communicating the scope of environmental change is that we mostly can’t see it. With coral reefs, though, the impact is clear: The water gets warmer, the corals bleach, and unless the temperature is stabilized, they deteriorate. “It’s like a city going bankrupt and letting the buildings fall apart,” says former marine biology student and sculptor Courtney Mattison. Her thousand-pound ceramic reef renderings show this process starkly, with white corals mixed into the vibrantly painted and meticulously detailed pieces. She lets her fingerprints show on the stoneware and porcelain corals, speaking to our potential role in recovering the fragile ecosystems by emphasizing the human element of the work. “If people see evidence of my hands in the work, they may relate more closely,” says Mattison. “I don’t want it to be too literal, because the point is to spark curiosity.”

Tamiko Thiel

Tamiko Thiel uses technology to illustrate the impact we have on the planet. Her Gardens of the Anthropocene virtual reality installation first appeared in Seattle Art Museum’s Olympic Sculpture Park and depicts a world overtaken by mutated versions of regional drought-resistant plants that feed on everything in sight—phones included. As an engineer, Thiel felt compelled to include factual data, but as an artist she wanted to complete the picture and pick up where the science (which she notes is couched in conditionals) stops. The series, now on view at Stanford University, is meant to entertain while stealthily urging viewers to do their part. “Humans only change when they see no other alternative in order to survive,” says Thiel.

Justin Guariglia

Justin Brice Guariglia became one of the first artists in a decade to work with NASA when he joined the group on survey flights for Operation IceBridge as an independent artist in 2015. The aerial images obtained are impressive, but Guariglia takes it a step further by transforming the photos into topographical prints that pop off the canvas through a printing process he developed. His work will be presented in West Palm Beach, Florida’s Norton Museum of Art in September. This year, Guariglia also launched After Ice, a selfie app with a filter that shows how high sea levels will rise by 2080 in New York. (Spoiler alert: If you’re near the city, you’ll be swimming with the fishies.)

Eve Mosher

In 2007, artist Eve Mosher took to the streets of Brooklyn with a baseball field chalker to trace a 70-mile line around the city marking the projected reach of a flood that could hit the coast within three to 20 years. Mosher’s HighWaterLine project simplified complex data down to a clear-cut line that hit way too close to the literal home of thousands of New Yorkers. It got attention. Then Hurricane Sandy came along and proved the predictions true. Now, HWL has grown to include workshops, community outreach, and other public art installations in cities from South Florida to England. “Art can create the space needed to go from grief and shock of what is coming to action.”

Hannah Rothstein

“I have been worried about climate change for a long time, and when I saw the systems designed to fight it being dismantled, I felt my time to pull out the art guns had come,” says illustrator Hannah Rothstein. She drew from some of the most iconic images in U.S. history—vintage National Park posters—and reimagined seven of them to resemble their fated decline for 2050, only 33 years away. Although she stays away from politics, Rothstein has been pleasantly surprised to see people sending postcards of the prints to senators. “Instead of deepening our divisions,” she says. “I hope this project will inspire our country’s policymakers to put politics aside and focus on the greater good.”

Lisa Murray

Photojournalist Lisa Murray has seen firsthand how new weather patterns affect rural communities. She’s seen women in Kenya walk hours to get water for their families following periods of intense drought; healthy villages in South Sudan going hungry after flash floods wipe away the harvest; fishing communities in Indonesia disappearing due to erosion and rising sea levels. “In the West, climate change doesn’t impact on our lives the same way it does in the global South,” she says. “It’s easy for people to ignore it.” Murray launched Faces of Change to document how environmental issues impact the lives of real people without sensationalizing or harping on the negative. “Showing the impact climate change has on everyday people and everyday life enables us to understand the consequences of a warming planet on a human level,” says Murray.","Thu, 03 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/full-page/public/2017/07/26/climate-change-art-lead_h.jpg?itok=dxzbq0Yd,"['data', 'change', 'looks', 'pelto', 'work', 'sea', 'jill', 'artists', 'actually', 'environmental', 'courtesy', 'impact', 'art', 'climate']", ,flood_and_drought
81,81,Drought_Indonesia,Global warming could cause yield of sorghum crops to drop 'substantially' - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/global-warming-could-cause-yield-of-sorghum-crops-to-drop-substantially/,"Sorghum is the fifth most economically important cereal in the world and is grown in some of the most arid parts of Africa and South Asia, where it is a staple food for half a billion people.

The new research finds that for every degree of warming above a 1985 to 2014 average, sorghum crop yields could drop by around 10 per cent. This suggests the hardy cereal may be more vulnerable to heat stress caused by climate change than previously thought, the authors tell Carbon Brief.

However, the indirect impacts of temperature might actually be a larger driver of future sorghum yield declines, another scientist tells Carbon Brief. It is likely that environmental factors, such as humidity, will have significant role in crop productivity, he says.

“ While I do not doubt the ultimate importance of tolerance to direct effects of high temperature, this is a consequence of “shock effects” of high temperature at specific development stages. Graeme Hammer, director of plant science, University of Queensland

Why is sorghum so hardy?

Sorghum is a tall cereal grain that is grown for food in arid parts of Africa and South Asia, and for animal fodder (and sometimes biofuel) in many developed and developing countries.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the US is the world’s largest producer of sorghum, followed by Mexico, Nigeria, Sudan and India.

Farmers started growing sorghum in north-eastern Africa around 8,000 years ago. Through thousands of years of selective breeding, the crop has evolved to be more resilient to harsh environmental conditions than other cereals, such as maize and wheat.

Sorghum is particularly hardy in dry conditions because it has large fibrous roots which can reach far down into the earth to extract water. It has also adjusted its reproductive system to withstand high temperatures.

As a result, sorghum has even been suggested as an alternative crop for wheat and maize farmers facing falling yields due to climate change.

However, the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that sorghum yields will be severely dented by rises in temperature.

The researchers find that sorghum yields will decline “substantially” at temperatures higher than 33C. Lead authors Jesse Tack and Krishna Jagadish from Kansas State University explain to Carbon Brief in a joint interview:

“We studied 30 years of sorghum production in Kansas and found that the crop is vulnerable to additional heat stress should average temperatures rise. Our results indicate that climatic change will likely produce an average yield loss of 10 per cent for each degree Celsius of warming.”

The graph below shows how exposure to temperatures causes negative changes to sorghum yield. The red line shows the results for managed field trials at 11 locations across Kansas, while the orange line shows results for data taken from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).

Growing problems

Using data from 9,000 observations collected over the course of the 11 trials and 30 years, the researchers developed a model to simulate how rises in temperature could affect sorghum yields.

The chart below shows the projected drop in yield for each degree of temperature rise above a 1985-2014 average. So, for example, 2C of warming (roughly equivalent to 2.6C above pre-industrial) could cause sorghum crop yields to drop by 17 per cent. Losses increase to 57 per cent for the highest scenario of 5C.

Warming affects the productivity of sorghum by causing heat stress at key points in its reproductive cycle, say Tack and Jagadish:

“We show that pre-flowering [when reproductive parts are developed] and post flowering stages [when seeds are produced] to be equally impacted by stress. We can do this because we observe planting and flowering dates for every single observation, another valuable aspect of our data.”

However, falling crop yields may also be impacted by temperature-dependent factors other than heat stress, says Prof Graeme Hammer, director of plant science at the University of Queensland, who was not involved in the research.

In his research, he has shown that rising temperature can have a number of indirect effects on the growth and development of cereal plants.

For example, unusually warm temperatures can affect the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) – this is the difference between the water vapour contained in the leaf’s interior and in the air surrounding it.

Hot weather causes increases in VPD (pdf), upping the rate of transpiration – the process by which plant moisture is released into the atmosphere.

In order to readjust this balance and prevent moisture escaping, a plant will close its pores. This restricts how much CO2 the plant can absorb and use to grow through photosynthesis.

Hammer believes that this indirect effect of temperature on plant growth has a larger impact on crop yield than heat stress:

“While I do not doubt the ultimate importance of tolerance to direct effects of high temperature, this is a consequence of “shock effects” of high temperature at specific development stages. The gradual effects of “heat stress” reside in consequences they bring on the dynamic of crop growth and development over the season.”

Finding a solution

Whether the impacts of temperature rise on sorghum yields are predominantly direct or indirect, the need to help farmers adapt is still there.

One solution for US farmers might be to grow sorghum in cooler environments, such as the US corn belt, researchers say.

However, similar options are not necessarily available in hotter, drier countries, such as Chad, where sorghum is a staple food for thousands of subsistence farmers.

Instead, scientists will need to hunt for new genes that promote resistance to heat extremes and incorporate them into sorghum breeding programmes, say Tack and Jagadish:

“Our particular focus was on the potential to adapt using currently available seed varieties. We find limited scope in this regard. However, breeding programmes can likely introduce new genetic material from sorghum plants existing in nature in order to boost heat resilience.”

In addition to developing new heat-resistant breeds, researchers will also have to develop new crop management strategies that address how warming affects the VPD, says Hammer:

“Some attention to adaptation of phenology (time to flowering) of cultivars [plant breeds] and adjustment of crop management (to deal with changes in water balance) would likely moderate much of the effect observed.”

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said the funds, over $136 million for Ethiopia and almost $33 million for Kenya, would be used for emergency food aid, nutrition supplies and health services.

USAID said nearly 8 million Ethiopians are in need of urgent humanitarian aid. Without it, the agency said ""food insecurity could reach catastrophic levels for some families in the worst-affected areas"" and result in ""the displacement of affected populations.""

In Kenya, USAID said some 2.6 million people are ""acutely food-insecure"" as drought conditions continue.

The latest round of humanitarian aid increases to $458 million the amount of assistance the U.S. has provided to Ethiopia and Kenya this fiscal year.

Last month, the U.S. pledged nearly $640 million in urgent food assistance to Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.

In addition to drought-caused food shortages, the countries have had to grapple with armed conflicts and economic turmoil that caused reductions in medical care, shelter and safety and sanitation services.

83,83,Drought_Indonesia,Big-headed gecko shows human actions are messing with evolution - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/big-headed-gecko-shows-human-actions-are-messing-with-evolution-81770,"Evolution doesn’t have to take millions of years. New research shows that a type of lizard living on man-made islands in Brazil has developed a larger head than its mainland cousins in a period of only 15 years.

The group of insect-eating geckos from the species Gymnodactylus amarali was isolated from the rest of the population when areas of the countryside were flooded to provide hydro-electric power. This caused the extinction of some larger species of lizards on the new islands, leaving the geckos to eat insects that would normally have been mopped up by the bigger species. As a result, the geckos have evolved bigger mouths, and so bigger heads, that enable them to eat their larger prey more easily.

We’ve actually seen rapid evolution like this before, but usually in response to a natural disaster such as drought or climate change. What’s different about the geckos is that they’ve evolved in direct response to an environmental change enacted by humans, demonstrating just how much impact we can have on the natural world.

The gecko study, published in PNAS, gives us an interesting demonstration of how evolution works, not just because the change has happened within our lifetimes. Those geckos among the original colony that had larger heads (and mouths) could eat a wider range of prey and so had more energy to put into survival and reproduction. As a result, they had more children and their genes for larger heads spread to a greater proportion of the next generation. This continued until larger heads had become a common feature of the group.

But why just those with bigger heads? Why didn’t geckos whose whole bodies were bigger receive the same evolutionary advantage? Well larger bodies take more energy to maintain, so those individuals would lose the advantage that they gain by eating more food.

Carlos Eduardo Ribeiro Cândido, Universidade de Brasília

One of the most interesting things about this research is that the geckos on all five of the islands studied have evolved larger heads, even though they were isolated from each other. This suggests that increasing head size without increasing body size is the most efficient way to take advantage of the opportunity to eat a more varied diet than is normal for this species.

This kind of rapid evolution has been seen before, including among the finches of the Galapagos Islands that helped Charles Darwin formulate his theory of natural selection in the first place. One of these finches species reduced the average size of its bill in a period of just 22 years when a competitor with a larger bill colonised the island.

The larger species ate all the larger seeds with tough shells, a large bill that still couldn’t compete became a disadvantage for the finches and so those birds with a smaller beak began to thrive. This is one of the fundamental principles of biology: if you don’t need a particular structure you don’t bother to grow it and save the energy instead.

A similar instance occurred in Florida when a lizard called the Cuban brown anole, which is much larger than the native green anole, colonised areas of Florida. The green anole promptly retreated up into the treetops and within 20 generations had evolved bigger, stickier foot pads, a helpful characteristic for the high life.

Human impact

Another example of rapid evolutionary change was found in Soay sheep on the island of Hirta in St Kilda off the coast of Scotland. After the residents of the island were evacuated in 1930, the sheep were allowed to run wild and, within 25 years, began to get smaller. The explanation put forward for this is that milder winters caused by climate change are allowing smaller lambs to survive, bringing down the average size of the whole population.

This suggests that we should expect to see many more examples of rapid evolution as the climate continues to change in response to greenhouse gas emissions. But the new study on geckos shows that localised human action can also interfere with the processes of evolution. Although the change in head and mouth size in the gecko seems benign, we should remember it came about because of the extinction of four other species of lizard in the area linked to the flooding. It’s a timely reminder that climate change is not the only issue facing biodiversity and evolutionary processes.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/180381/original/file-20170731-728-1k82dcf.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C143%2C1920%2C931&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['gecko', 'change', 'species', 'geckos', 'bigger', 'size', 'bigheaded', 'actions', 'human', 'larger', 'messing', 'rapid', 'shows', 'islands', 'heads', 'evolution']", ,flood_and_drought

The research takes into account the effects of falling system prices, tendering and auctions, which could result in a 109- gigawatt market of renewable solar energy by 2021

The rise of pay-as- you-go solar

As one of the longest-running forms of renewable energy on the planet, solar power is beginning to make real headway in emerging economies thanks to a new class of infrastructure investment: microgrids and pay-as- you-go solar. In a recent article published by Energy Transition, the many benefits of micro- grids for emerging economies, including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, are discussed at length. Naturally, as the development of off grid, renewable energy solutions across emerging economies continues to strengthen, there comes a greater need for off grid energy education. Solar-powered energy in particular is steadily making its way into more and more homes across Africa, Latin America and Asia. As its presence increases, we have a responsibility to ensure that families are shown how to efficiently manage the off grid energy resources now at their disposal.

The rise of emerging economies

Aside from the surge in pay-as- you-go and microgrid solar solutions across some emerging economies, there are four developing nations taking notable forward strides in other kinds of off grid energy solutions that are worth mentioning. Keep a keen eye over the coming 12 months on the off grid movements happening in China, Chile, Brazil and Kenya.

Asia

China recently made the global headlines by confirming that it plans to create an entirely new mega city from scratch, to be called Xiongan, and that it will power it exclusively by using off grid, renewable energy sources. The city is expected to span across a surface area of 2,000 square kilometres and hopes to house at least 2.5 million people, as well as many businesses, who will move to the city and ease severe congestion problems in neighboring Beijing. Cited as the world leader in renewable energy for the past few years, China plans to invest another 2.5 trillion yuan into off grid energy solutions by 2020, so watch this space!

Latin America

Chile is home to El Romero, Latin America’s largest solar-energy plant located in the Atacama Desert. It is hoped that by April 2018, this plant will generate enough energy (196 megawatts to be exact) to provide lighting in a quarter of a million homes across the country. With no more than two or three cloudy days in a year, Chile is learning how to harness the natural and constant power of the sun in the Atacama Desert to its advantage. Latin America comes up trumps a second time thanks to the off grid energy work related to wind turbines in Brazil. Since 2009, more than 360 wind projects have been seen through to fruition, according to data published by Abeeolica, the country’s wind association.

Africa

Even though Kenya’s natural resources make it a prime candidate for geo- thermal energy, much of the off grid energy on offer is still highly underexplored at present. Having said that, its largest geo-thermal project, named Olkaria after its location (a region known for its powerful hot springs, fumaroles, searing rocks and sulfur-oozing fissures), has the potential to provide off grid energy to almost the entire country. Japan is one of the project’s major investors. This is definitely one the emerging economies to keep an eye on as we move into 2018.","Mon, 28 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://cleanleap.com/sites/default/files/short-cut_1.png,"['emerging', 'solar', 'economies', 'renewable', 'way', 'grid', 'solutions', 'yougo', 'energy', 'latin', 'leading', 'wind']", ,none
89,89,Drought_Indonesia,Kale Power: Water for Crops Gives Women in Kenya's Drylands a Voice - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/kale-power-water-crops-gives-women-kenyas-drylands-voice,"ALIMAO, KENYA - On a blistering hot afternoon, Zainab Omar Ali methodically sorts through freshly picked bunches of kale on her farm in Alimao village in northeast Kenya.

""I managed to sell most of my batch at the market this morning,"" she said with satisfaction. ""I'll try to sell the remaining fresh ones tomorrow, and cook the rest at home.""

Near her farm in Wajir County, women buzz around four greenhouses made of dark shade nets, watering vegetable plots and removing weeds.

Omar Ali and other women in this village bordering Somalia used to grow vegetables by fetching water from a hand-dug shallow well and keeping off pests with old mosquito nets.

But increasingly dry weather and rising temperatures damaged their already limited harvests and weakened their cattle, the women said.

Change is afoot, however. Since 2016, a project led by an international charity is helping women from Alimao grow vegetables like kale and onions under shade nets that protect the crops from predators and the sun's intensity.

A drip irrigation system is installed under the nets to use water more efficiently.

The ""Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development"" (Kenya RAPID) program, implemented by World Vision Kenya, aims to improve 45,000 people's access to water and sanitation in dry northern counties.

Rebuilding after drought

After losing all their livestock to drought in the 1990s, Omar Ali and her family left their village in northern Kenya and migrated to Wajir County.

""Life was hard without any meat or milk to rely on,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""My [six] children and I would sometimes go for two days without a proper meal and had to rely on wild fruits.""

Experts say women bear the brunt of climate change in many developing countries, and are often more vulnerable than men when disasters like floods or droughts strike.

Richard Munang, climate change program coordinator for Africa at U.N. Environment, said men in pastoralist communities control the main source of income - livestock -- meaning women cannot take the decision to sell or slaughter an animal.

""That makes them more likely than men to have to go without food in times of need, while they must walk long distances to fetch water,"" he said.

With no stable income to rely on, Omar Ali and six other village women decided to pool their limited savings in 2013.

""We used to have weekly meetings where each member would give 200 Kenyan shillings ($1.93) to buy milk from livestock herders and resell it to town dwellers,"" she recalled, bending to water her vegetables. ""But the milk would often spoil due to the heat.""

Halima Qureysh, another group member, said the women then tried farming a small piece of land allocated by village elders, but the hand-dug shallow wells they used often ran dry.

Since last year, however, the women have used the shade nets provided by the Kenya RAPID project, which is funded by the U.S. and Swiss governments, to help protect their crops from extreme heat.

Last year they harvested 35 tons of kale, compared to just a few bunches each previously, which was barely enough for domestic consumption.

Omar Ali said the group's ""healthy-looking"" kale now fetches 50 shillings per kilo, instead of only 20 previously.

She now makes about 4,500 shillings per month -- three times what she used to earn.

""I can take my children to school, cook balanced meals for my family and I have gained recognition in my community,"" she said.

""In our society, women are not normally allowed to speak in public forums,"" she added. ""But given our group's success, men are now letting the members speak to the rest of the village and make decisions at a family level.""

Solar-powered pump

With support from the project, the group has also set up a borehole with a solar-powered pump to ease water shortages.

The women purify water from the borehole, store it in tanks and sell it to the rest of the community.

""We used to share dirty water with livestock in water pans â€“ if there was water at all,"" said Omar Ali. ""But the water we get now is clean.""

Dickens Thunde, former country director at World Vision Kenya, said working with the community's existing ways of coping with climate extremes - rather than introducing a new system - had been key to the success of the project.

""This community was already managing its own natural resources - it just needed a sustainable water source to withstand shocks,"" he said.

However, challenges remain in reaching other vulnerable community members who aren't part of the women's group.

Hadabah Mahamoud, a project officer for sanitation and nutrition with World Vision, said a lack of funding has so far limited the project's expansion to other villages.

""Once established, these projects are easy to manage, but the initial cost of setting them up and sourcing the equipment like irrigation pumps is quite high,"" she said.

""Most people in this arid region still lack proper access to water, without which they cannot expect a healthy harvest or livestock,"" she added.

For now, said Omar Ali, the women plan to use the group's savings to offer training in sustainable farming to other women in the region, using their village as ""a center of excellence.""

""Climate change is not an abstract concept, it is impacting huge numbers of vulnerable people,"" said MIT professor Elfatih Eltahir. ""Business as usual runs the risk of having extremely lethal heat waves.""

'Wet-bulb temperatures'

Unlike previous climate change and temperature projections, the MIT study also looked at humidity and the body's ability to cool down, as well as heat levels. The three factors make up what's called a ""wet-bulb temperature,"" which is measured by recording the temperature of the air when a wet cloth is wrapped around the thermometer. Climate scientists use this measurement to estimate how easily water can evaporate.

According to climate scientists, humans can survive a wet-bulb temperature of about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), while anything beyond could cause the body to have difficulty sweating to cool down. Such a phenomenon could lead to heat stroke or even death within just a few hours.

Putting the research findings into perspective, wet bulb temperatures have so far rarely exceeded the already hazardous level 31 degrees Celsius.

World's hottest region

The study also predicts that the Gulf could become the world's hottest region by 2100, due to climate change. However, citizens in the region are significantly better off financially than those in the Ganges and Indus river basins, meaning they will be able to better respond to the risks posed by relentlessly blistering temperatures.

The affected South Asia reasons also rely on crops and livestock, while the oil-rich Gulf region imports almost all of its food.

Less developed medical infrastructure in the rural regions of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would also see diseases and infections flourish in the in the scorching temperatures, compounding the just how dangerous merely venturing outside could become in the coming decades.

Cause for hope

In the study, scientists also estimated wet-bulb temperatures under the scenario in which concerted action was taken was to limit global warming. Although temperatures would still reach dangerous levels of around 31 degrees Celsius - a level considered dangerous but significantly less fatal - the percentage of South Asia exposed to potentially fatal temperatures would increase from zero to just 2 percent.

91,91,Drought_Indonesia,Turkey Bones May Help Trace Fate of Ancient Cliff Dwellers - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/science-health/turkey-bones-may-help-trace-fate-ancient-cliff-dwellers,"DENVER - Researchers say they have found a new clue into the mysterious exodus of ancient cliff-dwelling people from the Mesa Verde area of Colorado more than 700 years ago: DNA from the bones of domesticated turkeys.

The DNA shows the Mesa Verde people raised turkeys that had telltale similarities to turkeys kept by ancient people in the Rio Grande Valley of northern New Mexico — and that those birds became more common in New Mexico about the same time the Mesa Verde people were leaving their cliff dwellings, according to a paper published last month in the journal PLoS One.

That supports the hypothesis that when the cliff dwellers left the Mesa Verde region in the late 1200s, many migrated to northern New Mexico's Rio Grande Valley, about 170 miles (270 kilometers) to the southeast, and that the Pueblo Indians who live there today are their descendants, the archaeologists wrote.

The cliff dwellers would have taken some turkeys with them, accounting for the increase in numbers in New Mexico, the authors said.

The debate continues

Researchers have long debated what became of the people sometimes called Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in the elaborate Mesa Verde cliff dwellings and other communities across the Four Corners region, where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.

Archaeologists believe the Ancestral Puebloans were a flourishing population of about 30,000 in 1200, but by 1280 they were gone, driven off by a devastating drought, social turbulence and warfare.

Because they left no written record, their paths are not known with certainty. Many archaeologists and present-day Pueblo Indians believe the Ancestral Puebloans moved to villages across New Mexico and Arizona, and that their descendants live there today.

Scott Ortman, a University of Colorado archaeologist and a co-author of the PLoS One paper, said the turkey DNA supports the explanation that many migrated to an area along the Rio Grande north of present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico.

“The patterns that we found are consistent with several other studies and several other lines of evidence,” he said in an interview.

Evidence of migration

Jim Allison, an archaeologist at Brigham Young University who was not involved in the paper, agreed the findings mesh with other evidence of a southeastward migration.

But a weakness of the study is the number of DNA samples used, he said. Researchers examined DNA from nearly 270 sets of turkey remains — some from before 1280 and some from after that date. But only 11 sets of remains came from the Rio Grande before 1280.

“It would have been really nice to have 10 times as many,” Allison said, but they were not available.



Ortman acknowledged that the turkey DNA alone is not conclusive evidence of migration to the Rio Grande Valley.

The New Mexico turkeys could have come from someplace other than the Mesa Verde region, or turkey-herding communities could already have sprung up in New Mexico before the Ancestral Puebloans left their Mesa Verde communities, he said.

Evidence is thin

Some archaeologists argue the evidence for a migration to the Rio Grande Valley is thin. Even supporters, such as Allison, acknowledge that some evidence does not fit, including differences in pottery and architectural styles.

Tim Hovezak, an archaeologist at Mesa Verde National Park, said he is not convinced the Ancestral Puebloans moved to the Rio Grande, but he tries to keep an open mind.

“I think it's still a mystery, and it's a very compelling one,” he said.

Ortman said other evidence besides the turkey DNA points to the migration.

The Tewa language spoken by some northern New Mexico Pueblo Indians today includes vocabulary “that seems to harken back to the material culture of the Mesa Verde area,” he said.

The Tewa term for the roof of a church translates roughly to “a basket made out of timbers,” Ortman said. That better describes the roofs used on kivas — ceremonial rooms — in ancient Mesa Verde communities than it does the churches in New Mexico, he said.

Another line of evidence is similarities in the facial structures of the remains of ancient people from the Mesa Verde region and New Mexico, Ortman said.

Respect for Ancestral Puebloan remains

Examining human DNA from Ancestral Puebloan remains would provide a more definitive answer, Ortman said. But some contemporary Pueblo Indians object to doing that, and Ortman and others said they respect their wishes.

Theresa Pasqual, a member of the Acoma Pueblo in northwestern New Mexico and the pueblo's former preservation director, said she knows of no pueblos that would consent to DNA testing on ancestral remains because of spiritual and cultural concerns.

Pasqual, who is studying archaeology at the University of New Mexico, said she was heartened by the turkey DNA study because it supports the oral traditions of Acoma and other present-day pueblos that point to ancestral ties to the Mesa Verde region.

Some Acoma families still raise domestic turkeys and hunt wild ones, but it would be difficult to trace that tradition to the Ancestral Puebloans, Pasqual said.

The Ancestral Puebloan sites are a key factor in what she called Acoma's “migration narrative.”

“These places have been a part of our narrative and a part of our history and a part of our present-day life for as long as we can remember,” Pasqual said.","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/76B99B47-5628-4A24-9FF4-950B025B9780.jpg,"['help', 'grande', 'ancestral', 'dna', 'evidence', 'ancient', 'verde', 'rio', 'puebloans', 'dwellers', 'mexico', 'mesa', 'trace', 'fate', 'turkey', 'bones', 'cliff']", ,none
92,92,Drought_Indonesia,IOM: Smugglers 'deliberately drowned' migrants near Yemen - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/iom-smugglers-deliberately-drowned-migrants-near-yemen/a-40030666,"Smugglers forced more than 120 migrants from Ethiopia and Somalia - most of them teenagers - off a boat near the coast of Yemen on Wednesday, the International Organization for Migration announced in a statement. According to the IOM, survivors buried 29 bodies and at least 22 people remain missing.

""The survivors told our colleagues on the beach that the smuggler pushed them into the sea when he saw some 'authority types' near the coast,"" said Laurent de Boeck, the UN's body's chief of mission in Yemen. ""They also told us that the smuggler has already returned to Somalia to continue his business and pick up more migrants to bring to Yemen on the same route.""

IOM staff provided aid for 27 survivors who remained on the beach. Others left to attempt to continue on their journeys.

'False hope'

Ongoing conflicts and a deadly drought have displaced many Somalis. In Ethiopia, tens of thousands have abandoned their homes in search of relief from a 10-month state of emergency imposed to suppress ongoing anti-government protests.

According to the IOM, since January about 55,000 people - most of whom are teenagers from Somalia and Ethiopia - have left the Horn of Africa in an effort to transit Yemen in search of more sustainable conditions in oil-rich Middle Eastern nations.

More than 111,500 people landed on the country's shores last year, up from about 100,000 in 2015, according to the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat, a grouping of international agencies that monitors such movements in the area.

With Yemen in an ongoing state of civil war that has killed more than 8,000 people and without a central authority to police people's movements, the country has become a popular route. However, the journey leaves people vulnerable to abuse by armed trafficking rings - many of which have connections to belligerents in Yemen's war.

""Too many young people pay smugglers with the false hope of a better future,"" de Boeck said on Wednesday.

In March, an attack pinned on the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 42 people on a migrant boat off the coast.

95,95,Drought_Indonesia,NUS Study: Cambodia Deforestation Increases Child Health Issues - AEC News Today,https://aecnewstoday.com/2017/nus-study-cambodia-deforestation-increases-child-health-issues/,"A team of researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) has found that the loss of dense forest in Cambodia is associated with higher risk of diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, and fever in children.

The team, led by assistant Professor Roman Carrasco from NUSs Department of Biological Sciences, found that just a 10 per cent decrease in dense forest is associated with a 14 per cent increase in the incidence of diarrhea in children younger than five, while an increase in protected area cover was associated with a lower risk of diarrhea and acute respiratory infection.



Published in the August 2017 edition of The Lancet Planetary Health, the study is believed to be the largest empirical analysis of links between deforestation, conservation, and several public health outcomes ever conducted. Research conducted by the NUS team into previous studies in any language globally prior to April 24, 2017 found that most studies of links between health, deforestation, and conservation focused on single diseases.

Researchers surveyed 35,547 households in 1,766 communities between 2005 to 2014, with dense and mixed forest coverage derived from Open Development Cambodia (ODC). Forest loss was calculated from 2000 to 2004, 2004 to 2009, and 2009 to 2014, with the main purpose of the survey being to investigate the relationship between child health and protected areas across different forest types in Cambodia.

Citing data from 2014 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the NUS researchers found ‘one in every 29 Cambodian children does not survive to their fifth birthday, while 6 per cent, 28 per cent, and 13 per cent of children had symptoms of acute respiratory infection, fever, or diarrhea, respectively, in the two weeks before these data were gathered.’

According to assistant Professor Carrasco PhD, “In this study, we showed that deforestation in Cambodia is associated with increased risk of leading causes of childhood mortality and morbidity. This highlights the link between environmental degradation and health, and suggests that conserving forests could help in mitigating health burden.”

Although the authors of the report admit that the causal mechanisms are unclear, Professor Carrasco said “our findings suggest that protected areas could help to alleviate the global health burden, presenting new possibilities for simultaneous achievement of public health and conservation goals.”

Deforestation in Cambodia

Cambodia is frequently criticised over the rate of deforestation occurring to its old-growth forests. Less than two weeks ago The Phnom Penh Post reported that despite an export ban on logs and cut timber to Vietnam, cross-border trade in both items in the first half of this year had almost surpassed all of that exported in 2016.

According to Vietnam Customs’ data, obtained and released by US-based NGO Forest Trends, 313,000 cubic meters of Cambodian timber valued at $142 million was recorded entering Vietnam between January and June this year, compared to 318,232 cubic meters for all of 2016.

The following day Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment (MoE) issued a statement denying that large-scale forest crime is still occurring in Cambodia, saying that its data indicated that ‘the annual average loss of forest coverage had decreased from 2.7 per cent in 2010-2014 to 0.8 per cent in 2014-2016’.

The NUS researchers point out in their paper that Cambodia is not alone in facing health and conservation issues due to agricultural expansion, large-scale development projects, and illegal timber harvesting compounded by poor institutional capacity, unclear land tenure, and restricted law enforcement. The lessons learnt in Cambodia could apply to many other tropical countries they claim.

More than 60 per cent of Cambodia’s dense forest was lost between 1973 and 2014 which has led to 17 per cent of Cambodia’s terrestrial area being designated as protected areas – a designation that anti-logging activists and conservationists say is not being enforced.

Fresh from their success of snagging an unlikely spot in the 2018 AFC U23 Championship as Group H leaders, having edged qualifier hosts and regional powerhouse Thailand, as well as Mongolia and bitter rivals Indonesia, Malaysia U22 are now expected to capture the football gold medal from defending SEA Games football champions Thailand, an uphill battle despite playing at home.

In the qualifiers last month, Datuk Ong Kim Swee's boys recorded victories over Indonesia and Mongolia in the group stage, but were hammered 3-0 by the hosts; showing the massive gulf between the two sides' qualities. The Young Tigers' campaign received a massive help by lady luck, as Thailand had to play their matches against Indonesia and the unfancied Mongolia on a waterlogged pitch, with both matches ending in draws. As a result, the War Elephants only qualified for the finals as the best second-placed teams in the qualifiers.

Goal spoke to former Kedah head coach Azraai Khor Abdullah, who won the double-treble in the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons with the Green and Yellows before moving on to hold a post with the Harimau Muda programme in 2010, to get his take on the missing aspect of youth development in the country, as compared to the their regional neighbours.

In a telephone conversation, Azraai told us that the most prominent aspect missing from youth players' development in the country is the jump to senior-level football. He remarked on his time with Kedah, when he gave several youth players their start at the senior level.

""First of all, what is missing is the path of these young players. For instance, when I coached Kedah I promoted Khyril Muhymeen [Zambri] to the senior team at the age of 17. He then received call-ups to the senior and junior national teams. The same happened to Baddrol Bakhtiar, Bunyamin Omar and a few other boys.

""And at the time Kedah were also competing in the AFC Cup. In 2008, our first year in the competition, we faced fixture congestion and I've had to utilise squad rotation, using youth players that I have promoted.

""We then unearthed the talent of Shakir Ali. We promoted him to the senior team, he played in the AFC Cup, he started scoring and received a call-up from Rajagobal [former Harimau Muda and Malaysia head coach Datuk Rajagobal Krishnasamy]. Afterwards he joined the Harimau Muda programme for two, three years.

""What I hope and have been hoping from those days is for the U23 players to find playing time with the senior teams. These days, it's just the Kedah boys, and a number who play for Pulau Pinang. This (lack of senior team playing time) causes low exposure, when we expect those representing the country in the SEA Games to also be playing at a higher level. The coaches need to be brave. With the hectic July schedule, they should have used it as a chance to expose their younger boys,"" he pointed out, touching on the recent month of July and the first week of August, when M-League teams who also compete in the Malaysia Cup had to go through 11 matches in a 36-day stretch.

He later added more names to the list of youth players he promoted as Kedah boss in a text message; Sabre Abu, Faizal Abu Bakar, Helmi Eliza Elias

Another aspect that he finds wanting in youth development in Malaysia is the gap between the senior team organisation and their youth system.

""Without naming names, several teams have very good youth teams that have been winning at the junior levels, but their boys are not promoted (to the senior side). Instead, the teams sign non-local senior players.

""Kedah until now still promote their young boys. Apart from the leftback position which is occupied by Fitri Omar, the rest are all Kedahans. And lately Hanif (Dzahir) has been challenging Fitri for the position. Even during my double-treble stint we have been developing and promoting local boys.

""The question is, do the senior team coaching staff, the senior team head coach attend these junior competitions; the President's Cup and the Youth Cup, to observe their own junior sides? I don't think so. How would they then be certain of the type of players that they need?

""During my time, I would attend Kedah youth team home matches at the Jitra Mini Stadium together with the late Ahmad Basri (former Kedah FA administrator Dato' Paduka Ahmad Basri Akil), as well as away youth matches held in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia, as far as Ipoh. We would go to Pulau Pinang and Perlis to see their performance. We would scout their abilities and performances one by one, but in addition to this, our presence would be a source of motivational boost for the team,"" explained Azraai.

He made comparisons with Vietnam's scouting system, where the net cast is wider and is able to spot a greater number of promising youth players.

""Vietnam's scouting begins at the district level where thousands (of young players) are scouted. I read one article whereby they gather tens of thousands of them.

""You can see that in terms of youth development, Vietnam are following close behind Thailand in this region. Their young players are coming up, and Myanmar's too. Their junior team have qualified for the World Cup.

""Whereas for us in Malaysia, we're still neither here nor there,"" said the 65-year old trainer.

On the Malaysian FA (FAM's) decision to shut down the Harimau Muda programme in 2015, in order to let the state FA's and clubs shoulder the task of developing young players, Azraai expressed his agreement.

""You tell me, where are the products of the programme? How many former Harimau Muda players are prominent names in the Malaysia Super League now?

""Most of them are not household names now. We can consider the programme unsuccesful, especially when they were considered as the backup national team players. How many of them are in the national team now? It's sad. The players are not anywhere now, so for me FAM did the right thing by shutting the programme down.

""Maybe FAM should come up with something new,"" lamented Azraai.

But when asked about the chances of the Young Tigers against the War Elephants in the coming SEA Games, Azraai was optimistic, telling us that things may go the hosts' way, or against the favourites'.

""I'm sure head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee is already aware of the Thais' strengths and weaknesses, and we are capable of defeating them.

""This is football, we can still overcome them if we face them in the semis of the final match. (In the AFC qualifiers) they defeated us, but against Indonesia they only managed a draw. We can't simply judge by what's on paper. Sometimes coaches get the tactics wrong and what they plan don't go their way,"" he pointed out.

Malaysia have been drawn in Group A of the SEA Games, and their campaign begins on August 14 against Brunei at the Shah Alam Stadium.","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['teams', 'youth', 'khor', 'malaysia', 'fa', 'kedah', 'programme', 'muda', 'players', 'team', 'thing', 'young', 'shutting', 'right', 'harimau', 'senior', 'malaysian']", ,none

99,99,Drought_Indonesia,Dying gods: Mt Kenya's disappearing glaciers spread violence below | Climate Home - Climate Home,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/08/02/dying-gods-mt-kenyas-disappearing-glaciers-spread-violence/,"Those who rely on Mount Kenya’s glaciers for water have turned against one another as the rivers fed by the mountain dry up

By Daniel Wesangula in Karatina

Mwangi Gitaru remembers his childhood well. He remembers the childhood games. He remembers the songs he and his friends used to sing while tending family goats. He remembers the stream that ran across his father’s parcel of land, cutting it in half.

But most importantly, Gitaru remembers how each day his grandfather would wake up and face Mount Kenya and pray.

“He believed the mountain was the source of life,” Gitaru says. “At that time, its whole peak was white as cotton wool. We were told as young boys, that was where the gods were. And we believed it.”

From the snow-capped mountain came folklore; came tales of bravery and bounty handed down from generation to generation. But more importantly, from the glaciers near the summit, which rises to more than 5,000m above sea level, came streams that fed into bigger streams that fed into rivers that gave life to everything that lay around the mountain; including Gitaru, his neighbours in Karatina region, friends and some enemies too.

Gitaru belongs to the Kikuyu tribe, Kenya’s most populous according to the most recent census. The Kikuyu refer to the mountain as Kirinyaga (Mountain of Whiteness) and traditionally revere it as home to their omnipotent deity Ngai. But lately, the deity appears to have forsaken them.

“The ice is melting away. The rivers flowing from the glaciers are not as full as they used to be. Some have dried up. And this is causing conflict downhill,” Kenyan environmentalist and chairman of Kenya’s Water Towers Management Authority Isaac Kalua says.

The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that only 10 of the 18 glaciers that covered the mountain’s summit a century ago remain, leaving less than one third of the previous ice cover. The Lewis Glacier, the largest on Mt Kenya, has decreased by 90% in volume since 1934, with the highest rates of ice volume loss occurring around the turn of the century.

“When the melting starts, rivers first experience high flows because of the melting ice,” says Kalua. “But this subsequently reduces because the glaciers never really recover like they did before climate change became a reality. Because of this, there is less and less water in the rivers in the years that follow.”

Kenya, like many African countries is highly vulnerable to climate change because of its exposure to increasing temperatures and rainfall variability and its dependence on agriculture.

“Any change in anything that could affect this subsistence agriculture almost always ends in conflict,” Kalua says.

Forty-five year-old Albert Lesiyan knows this too well. In April of 2017, he and group of four cousins drove close to a thousand cows from their ancestral home in Laresoro, a village in the Samburu region, and moved them north towards Nanyuki town, much closer to Mt Kenya.

“Our cows had nothing to eat. Even if it were you, would you let your cow die yet there is grass somewhere near?” he asks, briefly chewing on a grass stalk.

But there was a problem. Nanyuki town is some 70 kilometres from his village. And the grass they had been told about, grew on private land.

“We cut the fence and drove our cattle in,” he says. Their timing couldn’t have been worse.

Early March, herders had shot and killed Sosian Ranch co-owner Tristan Voorspuy while he was inspecting a burnt lodge in the expansive 24,000-acre ranch. The region had been battling mass invasions, violence and vandalism by herders that drove away tourists, investors and caused job losses.

A week prior to Lesiyan moving into the ranch, a different group of herders shot renowned author and conservationist Kuki Gallmann at her 100,000-acre Laikipia Nature Conservancy ranch. (She survived).

As soon as Lesiyan and his group drove their cattle in, the ranch owner called the police who launched an operation to drive them out of the vast farm.

“They didn’t listen to us. They started shooting. More than 100 of our cows were confiscated. Three of us were shot and wounded. We were not bothering anyone. We just wanted our cows to have something to eat,” he said.

Lesiyan’s home is dry. The ground looks thirsty. Every step you take kicks up a cloud of dust. Nearby, children play with sand in a dry river bed.

The drainage pattern from the Mt Kenya’s glaciers is radial. Despite this though, all streams eventually end up as tributaries to one of two rivers; The Tana River, that runs tirelessly south and eventually into the Indian Ocean and the more sporadic Ewaso Ng’iro in the country’s eastern lowlands.

“My father tells me when he was young, even elephants could not cross this river. Now our children play in its stomach,” Lesiyan says, looking on at the children playing in the river bed of the Ewaso Ng’iro.

This time next year, Lesiyan might be staring at the same options that sent him north in the first place.

“The pastoralists will continue to have it rough. During the drought, the land remained bare because of overgrazing. When the rains came, all the top soil was washed away in the flash floods, it will take months for grass to grow again and these conflicts will continue,” Francis Karin, a climate change and food security expert said. “And the water from up the mountain no longer trickles down to them.”

He said even the reduced water coming down the mountain is heavily dammed by the nearby farming communities.

“The future of those further downhill looks bleak,” Karin said.

Kalua says the continued melting of the Mt Kenya glacier can only make things worse for the communities living around it.

“We cannot do anything about it,” he says. “It is not our problem. We are not responsible for the massive emissions responsible for global glacial melts. But we are suffering the consequences.”

For Felix Kathune, the consequences are a continual lack of sleep. The redness of his eyes tells the story.

“I have not slept for two days,” he says. “If I do, they will bring their cows and let them loose in our farms,” he says.

He lives in Kathekakai, a village 110km north of Gitaru’s own and right beneath the mountain.

“They are lurking… waiting for us to sleep then bring their cows and goats to eat our cabbages and maize,” he says.

He, like many of his neighbours in nearby Nkothima village, stay awake to prevent members from the neighbouring pastoralist Borana community from feeding their crops to the animals.

“They say their river is dried up and they need to come through our farms to access our river. But when they do this, they set their cows into our farms and we are left with nothing,” he says.

He does not believe that the river the Borana’s used to go to is all dried up.

“They are just pretending. They just want our crops,” he says.

But the River Liki, which stretches from the northern side of the mountain and was traditionally depended on by the Boranas, no longer flows all year round.

“It has now become seasonal. Running for only 8 months of the year,” water manager Kalua said. “It is during these months that conflict between the Meru and Borana communities flares up.”

Before a mountain hiker gets to the fast disappearing glaciers of Mt Kenya, they will go through a succession of distinctive, elevation-based vegetation zones. The grasslands first, then at about 6,000 feet he will meet a ring of dense forest covering the slopes up to about 10,000 feet.

Then the slightly ticklish scent of cedar and yellowwood. From 8,000 feet, with the air getting thinner and thinner, one would walk into a row of bamboo forest that noticeably become shorter as you go higher. At 12,000 feet, a moor. The ground becomes slippery due to the moss and lichen covering the ground. Then at 15,000 feet the glaciers announce their majesty in between bare rock, slate and ice, sitting on top of the mountain like icing on a massive cake.

In 1893, the famous British geologist John W Gregory led the first scientific expedition up Mt Kenya but could not make it past the ice glaciers to reach the summit.

Now, the climb and descent to the highest mountain peak and one of two remaining glacier capped mountains in East and Central Africa takes a total of five days.

“If I were to kneel and pray facing Mt Kenya, my children will think I am growing mad,” Gitaru, the farmer from the little village in Nyeri says. “Very many things have changed in very little time,” says the 73- year- old, the sun setting behind the god of his forefathers, whose disappearance has turned neighbours against one another.","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2017/08/1280px-Lewis_Glacier_4600m_Mt_Kenya.jpg,"['rivers', 'mountain', 'spread', 'river', 'mt', 'kenyas', 'ice', 'water', 'cows', 'dying', 'violence', 'glaciers', 'kenya', 'village', 'disappearing', 'gods']", ,flood
