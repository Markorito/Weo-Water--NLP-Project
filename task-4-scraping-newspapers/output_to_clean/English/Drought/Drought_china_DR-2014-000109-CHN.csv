Participants in China, without access to Facebook or Twitter, have taken to Weibo -- their version of Twitter -- to post their videos. While some donate to the ALS Association, others are giving money to local groups like China Dolls -- a Beijing-based non-profit fighting rare diseases, the Taiwan Motor Neuron Disease Association, and the Hong Kong Neuro-Muscular Disease Association.

Since the challenge kicked off, China Dolls has received $8.5 million RMB ($1.38 million USD) in donations, compared to the $2 million RMB ($325,000 USD) they received in total last year.

Participants include FoxConn?s Terry Guo, retired NBA player Yao Ming, actress Zhang Ziyi, and Taiwanese film director, Doze Niu, whose father suffered from ALS. Even China's self-proclaimed ""Most Charismatic Philanthropist"" -- multi-millionaire Chen Guangbiao, who recently made headlines for hosting a lunch for homeless people in New York -- jumped into the fray, immersing himself in a tub of ice water for the cause.

But Chinese netizens have criticized the challenge for wasting water during severe droughts in parts of the country, and questioned the validity of a donation promise in videos some say missed the point by not even mentioning ALS.

In response, actor Takeshi Kaneshiro used water from his dehumidifier to complete the challenge in complete silence, donated money then declined to nominate more challengers. CCTV anchor Lu Yu donated, but refused to waste water, posting instead about the drought in Henan, China.

Whether that?s primarily of the disease for which it is raising funds ? amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AKA motor neurone disease ? or the speed at which images of swimsuit-clad celebrities will go viral is a long-term question. More pertinent right now is whether or not the craze has reached, er, tipping point.

As it lived by social media, so the ice bucket challenge could die by it. If there?s one counter-trend to pour room-temperature water on the craze, it?s #droughtshaming. The state of California is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts on record. Taps have dried up, lakes and reservoirs are emptying, water wastage is being fined. So gestures such as companies dousing their staff en masse in hundreds of gallons of icy water, come across more as wasteful PR exercises than charitable gestures ? and are being called out as such on Twitter.

There has been a similar reaction in China. Last week, protesters in drought-stricken Henan province raised empty red buckets over their heads, accompanied by the slogan ?Henan, please say no to the ice bucket challenge?. More practical is India?s Rice Bucket Challenge, started by a Hyderabad journalist, whereby participants simply give a bucket of rice to someone who needs it.

China?s ministry for civil affairs, while broadly supportive, has warned citizens against the practice?s ?entertainment and commercial tendencies? ? so don?t hold out for Xi Jinping in his swimming trunks. Likewise, the US state department has forbidden diplomats from participating for fear of favouring particular charities.

There are also ethical objections: Pamela Anderson and Grimes are among those who refused to take the challenge due to the ALS Association?s animal testing. Catholic leaders in the US have also banned schools from donating to the association since it carries out embryonic stem cell research.

But the real dampener could be the risk of bodily harm. Yesterday, the craze claimed its first fatality ? albeit tenuously. A teenager drowned at a quarry in Fife shortly after taking the challenge. This comes after Corey Griffin ? who popularised the Ice Bucket Challenge ? drowned on Friday in a tragic diving accident. Last week, four firefighters in Kentucky were seriously injured in an elaborate variation on the challenge, in which a firetruck ladder got too close to overhead power lines.

And doctors around the world have warned of risks to elderly people, expectant mothers and people with heart conditions. One Chinese health broadcast even warned of potential damage to vertebrae by ice cubes.

To learn more about global water wars, watch Parched

Aquifers provide us freshwater that makes up for surface water lost from drought-depleted lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. We are drawing down these hidden, mostly nonrenewable groundwater supplies at unsustainable rates in the western United States and in several dry regions globally, threatening our future.

We are at our best when we can see a threat or challenge ahead. If flood waters are rising, an enemy is rushing at us, or a highway exit appears just ahead of a traffic jam, we see the looming crisis and respond.

We are not as adept when threats?or threatened resources?are invisible. Some of us have trouble realizing why invisible carbon emissions are changing the chemistry of the atmosphere and warming the planet. Because the surface of the sea is all we see, it's difficult to understand that we already have taken most of the large fish from the ocean, diminishing a major source of food. Neither of these crises are visible?they are largely out of sight, out of mind?so it's difficult to get excited and respond. Disappearing groundwater is another out-of-sight crisis.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Groundwater comes from aquifers?spongelike gravel and sand-filled underground reservoirs?and we see this water only when it flows from springs and wells. In the United States we rely on this hidden?and shrinking?water supply to meet half our needs, and as drought shrinks surface water in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, we rely on groundwater from aquifers even more. Some shallow aquifers recharge from surface water, but deeper aquifers contain ancient water locked in the earth by changes in geology thousands or millions of years ago. These aquifers typically cannot recharge, and once this ""fossil"" water is gone, it is gone forever?potentially changing how and where we can live and grow food, among other things.

A severe drought in California?now approaching four years long?has depleted snowpacks, rivers, and lakes, and groundwater use has soared to make up the shortfall. A new report from Stanford University says that nearly 60 percent of the state's water needs are now met by groundwater, up from 40 percent in years when normal amounts of rain and snow fall.

Relying on groundwater to make up for shrinking surface water supplies comes at a rising price, and this hidden water found in California's Central Valley aquifers is the focus of what amounts to a new gold rush. Well-drillers are working overtime, and as Brian Clark Howard reported here last week, farmers and homeowners short of water now must wait in line more than a year for their new wells.

In most years, aquifers recharge as rainfall and streamflow seep into unpaved ground. But during drought the water table?the depth at which water is found below the surface?drops as water is pumped from the ground faster than it can recharge. As Howard reported, Central Valley wells that used to strike water at 500 feet deep must now be drilled down 1,000 feet or more, at a cost of more than $300,000 for a single well. And as aquifers are depleted, the land also begins to subside, or sink.

Unlike those in other western states, Californians know little about their groundwater supply because well-drilling records are kept secret from public view, and there is no statewide policy limiting groundwater use. State legislators are contemplating a measure that would regulate and limit groundwater use, but even if it passes, compliance plans wouldn't be required until 2020, and full restrictions wouldn't kick in until 2040. California property owners now can pump as much water as they want from under the ground they own.

California's Central Valley isn't the only place in the U.S. where groundwater supplies are declining. Aquifers in the Colorado River Basin and the southern Great Plains also suffer severe depletion. Studies show that about half the groundwater depletion nationwide is from irrigation. Agriculture is the leading use of water in the U.S. and around the world, and globally irrigated farming takes more than 60 percent of the available freshwater.

The Colorado River Basin, which supplies water to 40 million people in seven states, is losing water at dramatic rates, and most of the losses are groundwater. A new satellite study from the University of California, Irvine and NASA indicates that the Colorado River Basin lost 65 cubic kilometers (15.6 cubic miles) of water from 2004 to 2013. That is twice the amount stored in Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the U.S., which can hold two years' worth of Colorado River runoff. As Jay Famiglietti, a NASA scientist and study co-author wrote here, groundwater made up 75 percent of the water lost in the basin.

Farther east, the Ogallala Aquifer under the High Plains is also shrinking because of too much demand. When the Dust Bowl overtook the Great Plains in the 1930s, the Ogallala had been discovered only recently, and for the most part it wasn't tapped then to help ease the drought. But large-scale center-pivot irrigation transformed crop production on the plains after World War II, allowing water-thirsty crops like corn and alfalfa for feeding livestock.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But severe drought threatens the southern plains again, and water is being unsustainably drawn from the southern Ogallala Aquifer. The northern Ogallala, found near the surface in Nebraska, is replenished by surface runoff from rivers originating in the Rockies. But farther south in Texas and New Mexico, water lies hundreds of feet below the surface, and does not recharge. Sandra Postel wrote here last month that the Ogallala Aquifer water level in the Texas Panhandle has dropped by up to 15 feet in the past decade, with more than three-quarters of that loss having come during the drought of the past five years. A recent Kansas State University study said that if farmers in Kansas keep irrigating at present rates, 69 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer will be gone in 50 years.

This coincides with a nationwide trend of groundwater declines. A 2013 study of 40 aquifers across the United States by the U.S. Geological Survey reports that the rate of groundwater depletion has increased dramatically since 2000, with almost 25 cubic kilometers (six cubic miles) of water per year being pumped from the ground. This compares to about 9.2 cubic kilometers (1.48 cubic miles) average withdrawal per year from 1900 to 2008.

Scarce groundwater supplies also are being used for energy. A recent study from CERES, an organization that advocates sustainable business practices, indicated that competition for water by hydraulic fracturing?a water-intensive drilling process for oil and gas known as ""fracking""?already occurs in dry regions of the United States. The February report said that more than half of all fracking wells in the U.S. are being drilled in regions experiencing drought, and that more than one-third of the wells are in regions suffering groundwater depletion.

Satellites have allowed us to more accurately understand groundwater supplies and depletion rates. Until these satellites, called GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), were launched by NASA, we couldn't see or measure this developing invisible crisis. GRACE has given us an improved picture of groundwater worldwide, revealing how supplies are shrinking in several regions vulnerable to drought: northern India, the North China Plain, and the Middle East among them.

As drought worsens groundwater depletion, water supplies for people and farming shrink, and this scarcity can set the table for social unrest. Saudi Arabia, which a few decades ago began pumping deep underground aquifers to grow wheat in the desert, has since abandoned the plan, in order to conserve what groundwater supplies remain, relying instead on imported wheat to feed the people of this arid land.

Managing and conserving groundwater supplies becomes an urgent challenge as drought depletes our surface supplies. Because groundwater is a common resource?available to anyone with well?drilling equipment-cooperation and collaboration will be crucial as we try to protect this shrinking line of defense against a future of water scarcity.

Heavy rains have caused severe flooding along Cambodia?s Mekong and Basak rivers in nearly the entire eastern part of the country, destroying rice fields and wrecking homes and other structures, according to government sources.



Meanwhile, drought in the northern and southern parts of the impoverished country also threatens harvests as farmers struggle to find water to irrigate their crops, the sources said.



The flooding, which began in July and has continued through August, has affected 12 provinces and led to 45 deaths, one government official told RFA?s Khmer Service this week.



?It has now been confirmed that 45 people have been killed,? said Vice Chairman for Cambodia?s National Committee for Disaster Management Nhim Vanda.



The southern province of Prey Veng has seen the largest number of deaths, with neighboring Kampong Cham coming in second, Vanda said, adding that two of the 45 who died were killed by snakebite.



Other affected provinces include Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom, Ratanakiri, Strung Treng, Kratie, Tbong Khmum, Kandal, Svay Rieng, Kampot, and Mondulkiri, Vanda said.



Widespread damage



Reports show that the flooding over the last two months has affected about 100,000 families and 60,000 houses and flooded about 80,000 rice fields, with an estimated 9,000 hectares (22,240 acres) of rice and 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of plantations destroyed, Vanda said.



Additionally, 396 schools, 154 pagodas, and 32 hospitals have been flooded, he said.



Vanda declined to give a figure for estimated financial losses from the flooding, but voiced concern over possible damage resulting from further storms and rain.



?It is very hard now to take care of our children, and even of our livestock,? a villager in southern Cambodia?s Prey Veng province said, describing the hardships caused by the floods.



?The flooding has lasted for almost three months now, and I am scared my children may drown,? the villager, Phan Vai, told RFA.



Cambodian Red Cross senior official Uy Samath said that the Red Cross has so far helped about 13,000 families affected by the floods, providing emergency aid including rice, instant noodles, canned fish, and temporary shelters.



?I think we have more people to help?especially those living along the Mekong river and in Preah Vihear and Kampong Thom and along the Tonle Sap,? he said.

Meanwhile, drought in other parts of Cambodia?including the provinces of Oddar Meanchey in the north and Takeo in the south?has also threatened crops, with rice-growing areas left without adequate water, sources said.



Oddar Meanchey agriculture official Kam Vuthythun said that about 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of rice are now at risk in the northern province, adding, ?If there is rain, we might be able to save the rice. Without rain, it will be destroyed.?



Water sources have also been hard to find in recent days in the province of Kompong Speu and in parts of Takeo and the province of Kampot, Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen was quoted saying by The Cambodia Daily last week.



?Our citizens face twin problems?one is from floods and one is from droughts,? Hun Sen said.

A joint Chinese and American research team analyzed five decades of data from Chinese government records and found that the country's coastal marine ecosystem has steadily degraded to an almost irreversible point since 1978?the year the Chinese government introduced sweeping reform to industrialize the country's economy.

While China's population has held steady through that time, the economic growth has driven people from the country's interior farmland to the coast, and the combination of industrialization and a swelling coastal population is taking its toll on the marine environment, according to the researchers.

Qiang He, a marine ecologist from Beijing Normal University, led the research while a visiting scholar in Mark Bertness' lab at Brown University. He has studied coastal change in China for the best part of a decade and is first author on a study describing the research, published today in the journal Scientific Reports.

""Our paper shows that economic growth, not population growth, is major cause of China's coastal ecosystem changes,"" he concluded.

More people on the coast, less fish in the sea

And these ecosystem changes may only get worse, threatening the 28,000 different marine species that live along the coast as well as China's 1.3 billion people?half of whom live on the industrialized coast.

Before 1978, the diversity and size of China's fish species were steady, but since the economic reforms took place, both have been steadily decreasing. Coral cover in the South China Sea has crashed to 15 percent of pre-1978 levels, according to the study, and red tides?algal blooms that turn coastal waters a deep, biblical red and can be debilitating and fatal to marine life?have increased from around 10 each year before 1980 to between 70 and 120 each year since.

China's coastal gross domestic product growth and population movements mirror this coastal degradation. Between 1950 and the 1978 reforms, China's coastal GDP grew annually by around $2.2 billion. Between 1978 and 2010, China's coastal GDP increased by over two orders of magnitude with the country's coastal GDP contribution rising from 50 percent of the total to 60 percent. China's coastal population also increased from 260 million in 1954 to 400 million in 1978, and to 590 million in 2010.

During that time, China has been fueling its industrial and economic growth partly through massive development of its coastline. Mariculture and fishing activities have expanded to support local populations, pollution levels have increased, and miles of coastlines have been developed and filled in with mud to build larger and busier ports.

""The coastal degradation has been just phenomenal,"" said Mark Bertness, a marine ecologist at Brown who supervised the study. ""The message here is without some kind of regulation on this, some kind of conservation, they're going to burn out the resource base.""

""All of that stuff is going to be gone, and it's going to be gone in very short order,"" he added.

A 'red flag' for developing countries

China has been gaining attention internationally recently for its aggressive efforts to decarbonize its economy. Record-breaking levels of smog in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai over the winter spurred the government to declare a ""war on pollution,"" investing heavily in renewable energy and technology to clean up its fossil fuel power plants. The country is also close to launching a nationwide carbon market (Greenwire, March 5).

Yet while air quality issues in China have been highly publicized, the study says it has been at the expense of water quality and the degradation of marine ecosystems. Coastal cities like Shenzhen and Fujian are not as populated and are more removed from the public eye, he added.

""The air pollution is very intense, it's very serious in the major cities like Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said. ""But in coastal cities, populations are ... not as high as in those cities.""

There has been a fair amount of research in China on coastal pollution, but Bertness said this is the first study to show that Chinese economic development is accelerating the country's coastal degradation.

China is also one of several nations pulling themselves out of the Third World this century through rapid industrialization. India, Brazil and other developing nations are following a similar trajectory, and Bertness said those countries should also keep an eye on how their industrial and economic development is effecting their coastal marine ecosystems.

""This should be a red flag for all of the developing countries, especially the Asian developing countries,"" Bertness said. ""The nice thing about China was that there was this line in the sand?1978?when everything absolutely changed. But in reality, in a lot of Third World countries, the change has been almost as dramatic.""

A 'mega-star' is born

Bertness was also proud of the work Qiang He did on the study. The young Chinese scientist?who gained the nickname ""Q,"" after the James Bond scientist, while working at Bertness' lab?conceptualized the study almost by himself. But it took some work, Bertness said.

""His first few months in my lab were really kind of trying, because I was trying to get him to think creatively and get him to think of new different things to do,"" Bertness said. ""One of things I stressed with him is if you really want to do something big in China, you want to do something no one in China has done yet.""

After a few months of fruitlessly pitching research ideas to Bertness, Qiang came into his office one day and said he wanted to look into the effect of the 1978 economic reforms on marine environments in China.

12,12,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Inbee Park Ends Asian Golf Drought ? The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/inbee-park-ends-asia-golf-drought/,"Advertisement

After struggling for nearly a year to rediscover her dominant form, South Korea?s Inbee Park finally ended her ? and Asian golfers? ? major drought by winning last week?s Wegmans LPGA Championship in a playoff.

After Park won last year?s LPGA Championship, the four subsequent majors were won by Norway?s Suzann Pettersen and three Americans ? Lexi Thompson, Michelle Wie and Mo Martin. The four-major stretch without a win was the longest drought for Asian golfers since they began dominating women?s golf in 2008.

For the former World No. 1, the victory in Pittsford, N.Y., ended a long stretch of near misses. After winning last year?s U.S. Women?s Open in June, Park went almost a year without a victory until winning the Manulife Financial LPGA Classic this June. Her performance in the majors also took a dive, as she finished outside of the top 35 in three consecutive tournaments.

Park was able to prevail last week thanks in part to the late collapse by Brittany Lincicome, who only needed a par on the final hole to claim her second major victory. But she botched an easy two-putt and then fell in the first playoff hole when she was unable to get up-and-down to save par.

By repeating as the LPGA champion, the 26-year-old Park now has five major victories, tying her for 13th on the all-time list. She won?t have to wait long to attempt to increase that total as the fifth LGPA major of the year, The Evian Championship, will be held September 11-14.

While Park has regained her championship form, another former World No. 1 is still trying to rediscover hers.

Taiwan?s Yani Tseng, who became the youngest golfer (male or female) to claim five major titles when she collected her fifth at the age of 22, finished tied for 30th at the LPGA. While that hardly measured up to her previous lofty standards, at least she?s making some progress.

After winning the Women?s British Open in 2011 to cement her status as the top player in the world, Tseng finished third in her next major at the 2012 Kraft Nabisco Championship, and then began a long descent into golf purgatory. She failed to finish in the top 25 in 11 of her next 12 majors, with five missed cuts and a T-19 at last year?s LPGA her best finish.

An attempt at a swing change worked to her detriment and as a result, a complete loss of confidence in her game plagued Tseng. Once one of the longest and most accurate drivers of the ball, Tseng contracted the same disease that befell another famous former world No. 1, Tiger Woods.

But Tseng?s sudden fall from golf superstardom was more stunning than Tiger?s in that she was not beset by injuries or personal issues. And despite a six-year drought in the majors, Woods did manage to lead the PGA Tour with five victories as recently as last year. Tseng last won an LPGA event in March 2012.

Tseng?s struggles are thus more reminiscent of yet another former world No. 1, David Duval. After winning his lone major championship at the 2001 British Open and finishing a stretch of top 16 or better in eight straight majors, his game completely fell apart. He?s never won another PGA Tour event and, save for a surprise T-2 at the 2009 U.S. Open, never had another top 10 in the majors.

During this year?s Women?s British Open at Royal Birkdale, Tseng was seen walking down the fairway with tears streaming down both of her cheeks during a ghastly round of 82 on Friday as she missed the cut. She now speaks wistfully about her better days as if it?s an out-of-body experience.

?Yani is still in there somewhere,? she said last Wednesday before the LPGA Championship. ?My skill is still inside me. I just have to trust myself and let it out.?

She said she?s been getting advice from all sorts of people, ?thousands,? ranging from LPGA hall of famers to random fans everywhere. And it?s not necessarily helping.

?That?s why I?m so confused,? Tseng said. ?My left brain is fighting my right brain. Juli Inkster used to tell me that when you start to doubt yourself, that?s when you have a problem.

?When I started to doubt myself, I started to wonder if all those people were right. And then I?d start second-guessing myself all over again. ? I have to stick to what I believe and trust it. But it?s so hard. It?s so much easier to say.?

It?s uncertain whether Tseng will ever regain her form that kept her on top of the world for 109 consecutive weeks. At this point, it?s probably a longshot that she?ll ever be a factor again in LPGA majors, even though at 25 she?s only entering the prime for most golfers.

Tseng is already eligible for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame after the criteria was changed in March. She?s done enough by the age of 22 to warrant enshrinement, but that can?t happen until she either turns 40 or been retired for five years.

Dr. Simone Riehl of Tübingen University's Institute for Archaeological Science and the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment has headed an investigation into archaeological finds of grain in order to find out what influence climate had on agriculture in early farming societies. Her findings are published in this week's PNAS -- Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

She and her team analyzed grains of barley up to 12,000 years old from 33 locations across the Fertile Crescent to ascertain if they had had enough water while growing and ripening. Riehl found that periods of drought had had noticeable and widely differing effects on agriculture and societies in the Ancient Near East, with settlements finding a variety of ways to deal with the problem.

The 1,037 ancient samples were between 12,000 and 2,500 years old. They were compared with modern samples from 13 locations in the former Fertile Crescent. Dr. Riehl and her team measured the grains' content of two stable carbon isotopes. When barley grass gets insufficient water while growing, the proportion of heavier carbon isotopes deposited in its cells will be higher than normal. The two isotopes 12C und 13C remain stable for thousands of years and can be measured precisely -- giving Simone Riehl and her colleagues reliable information on the availability of water while the plants were growing.

They found that many settlements were affected by drought linked to major climate fluctuations. ""Geographic factors and technologies introduced by humans played a big role and influenced societies' options for development as well as their particular ways of dealing with drought,"" says Riehl. Her findings indicate that harvests in coastal regions of the northern Levant were little affected by drought; but further inland, drought lead to the need for irrigation or, in extreme cases, abandonment of the settlement.

The findings give archaeologists clues as to how early agricultural societies dealt with climate fluctuations and differing local environments. ""They can also help evaluate current conditions in regions with a high risk of crop failures,"" Riehl adds. The study is part of a German Research Foundation-backed project looking into the conditions under which Ancient Near Eastern societies rose and fell.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['change', 'isotopes', 'near', 'agriculture', 'water', 'ancient', 'drought', 'societies', 'times', 'climate', 'findings', 'riehl']", ,drought

Shutterstock.com Photo © trekandshoot The chambers of the California Senate, which passed historic changes to the state?s groundwater laws. Click image to enlarge.

After clearing the first of two legislative chambers, groundwater reform is one step closer in California.

By a vote of 26 to 11, the state Senate passed AB 1739, a bill that will require areas that use the most groundwater and have the largest populations to submit plans for managing the resource and to set goals for balancing groundwater supply and demand.

The Assembly is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, as well as on a companion bill sponsored in the Senate.

?We praise the California Senate for their leadership and dedication to advancing AB 1739,? said Lester Snow, executive director of the California Water Foundation, which held meetings and led negotiations that facilitated the bill?s journey through the Legislature. ?Today?s bipartisan vote brought northern, southern and coastal elected representatives together to move us significantly closer to protecting our vital groundwater supplies for current and future generations.?

A severe drought, now in its third year, has revealed deep geological and social calamities resulting from unchecked use of groundwater. As more and more water is pumped from the ground, the land surface in the Central Valley, the state?s agricultural hub, is deforming, impairing the ability of canal systems to deliver water to cities and farms. In Tulare County, also in the Central Valley, hundreds of families are without running water after their shallow wells dried up.

The Senate vote largely followed party lines, with a few regional defections. Urban officials and urban water utilities lined up in favor of the bill in droves this week. The only two Republicans voting with the Democratic majority both represent districts around San Diego, whose water wholesaler endorsed the measure.

The bill faced opposition from agricultural interests in the Central Valley .

Along with passage of a water bond, stricter oversight of the state?s groundwater reserves, which account for more than 60 percent of state water use this year, was a top legislative goal this year for Governor Jerry Brown. The Legislature passed a $US 7.5 billion water bond on August 13.

Approval from the Legislature and the governor is but a first step in the path to reform. The bill requires the Department of Water Resources to develop by June 1, 2016 rules for evaluating the groundwater management plans that local agencies must produce.

Only one-quarter of the state?s 515 groundwater basins are covered under the rules. These are the basins where groundwater use is highest and the population is largest. These basins have until June 30, 2017 to form a management agency and until January 31, 2020 to submit a management plan to the state.

The plans will have a broad effect. Counties must consult them before making changes to land development plans. The groundwater management agencies will have the power to collect fees from water users that will pay for projects that put water back into depleted basins.","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_CASenate.jpg?fit=1000%2C667&ssl=1,"['passes', 'california', 'bill', 'reform', 'water', 'states', 'management', 'legislation', 'senate', 'groundwater', 'vote', 'plans', 'basins', 'valley']", ,drought

It was a bloody week in China?s far west, with nearly 100 people killed in unrest that the authorities have characterized as terrorism but that Uighur advocacy groups have said is a consequence of a sweeping crackdown aimed at silencing opposition to the government?s hard-line policies in the region.

The outbreak of violence in Xinjiang amid an overwhelming show of security appears to be the worst since 2009, when at least 200 people died during several days of ethnic rioting in the regional capital, Urumqi.

The state-run news media on Sunday provided new details of the most serious episode, a clash last Monday in Yarkand County. A report said that 35 ethnic Han Chinese had been killed and that 59 people described as terrorists had been shot dead by the police.

The report, published by Tianshan, a news portal run by the Xinjiang regional government, said two Uighurs had also been killed during what it described as a rampage by masked, knife-wielding assailants who attacked cars and passers-by in Yarkand.

FOCUS AREA: PREPAREDNESS

Results & Achievements

After an initial grant of US$70,000, a program involving the World Bank, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), and the Government of Djibouti has leveraged over $40 million in funds for disaster risk management projects.

GFDRR efforts also leveraged the creation of a $5 million national safety net to ease financial stresses caused by disasters.

The GFDRR-funded program installed 5 new hydrometeorological stations in different climatic areas around the country.

The program also catalyzed a $3 million water project to better manage resources in rural areas, along with a $5.2 million power access and energy diversification project.

GFDRR-funded projects have inspired the Djibouti government to pursue preparedness and resilience in cybersecurity, pandemics, and other sectors.

Situated on the Horn of Africa, Djibouti is highly vulnerable to prolonged droughts and flooding. The last major drought claimed nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually between 2008 and 2011 and impacted more than half of its 860,000 residents.

With funding and guidance from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), a vulnerability/risk assessment and communication platform was established comprised of hydrological early warning systems, flood and drought early warning systems, and seismic and floods risk/vulnerability assessment?the first of its kind in Africa.

With nearly 75 percent of its population concentrated in its capital city, Djibouti is at particular risk for water shortages and severe flooding, both of which profoundly impact its growing but fragile economic sector. The 2008-2011 drought caused upwards of $51 million in damages, and more than $157 million in losses. Additionally, given current growth rates, the country?s population is set to double in less than 15 years, increasing strain on Djibouti?s already stressed fresh water resources and its vulnerability to natural hazards (Djibouti?s fresh water availability per capita is only one fifth of neighboring Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia), with changes in climate only exacerbating these issues.

Approach

GFDRR and The World Bank have been partnering with the Government of Djibouti since 2007 in an effort to improve resilience and absorb natural shocks to the region?s burgeoning population and economic activity. GFDRR was able to leverage more than $40 million to fund various projects in disaster risk management and recovery, including the establishment of the Middle East and North Africa?s region first comprehensive risk assessment platform to address:

outdated preparedness and emergency plans;

improvements to weather monitoring systems;

needed seismic and flood vulnerability assessments;

inadequate flood and drought early warning systems.

Lessons Learned

Successful disaster risk management requires a multisectoral approach. The Government of Djibouti recognizes that disaster risk management is not a stand-alone activity, but is rather a cross-cutting practice that needs to be mainstreamed through all sectors to ensure sustainable results in development efforts. With trade logistics comprising nearly 85 percentof GDP, the Government has made it a priority to disaster-proof its economy, taking cues from the successful Comprehensive Approach to Risk Assessment in Djibouti (CARAD) project completed in partnership with GFDRR and the World Bank.

A multiplicity of voices can further risk reduction. Because input from both the regional and national level inform disaster management policies and implementation, GFDRR is helping solidify an institutional framework that will streamline communication between governance levels, ensuring that local knowledge is effectively incorporated into national policy.

Next Steps

A proposed third phase of technical assistance spanning 2014-2015 will consist of (1) operationalization of the risk assessment and communication platform that will inform infrastructure investments, (2) detailed spaceborne cartographic mapping of the entire country, and (3) integration of the recently finalized risk/vulnerability assessments for Djibouti-Ville in World Bank urban developments and efforts. Inspired by previous programs. The Government of Djibouti has also reached out to GFDRR to assist in implementing risk management techniques in novel sectors, including cyber-security and public health.","Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Results/drm/dj-gfdrr-impact-djibouti2.jpg,"['disaster', 'assessment', 'water', 'sustaining', 'growth', 'djibouti', 'risk', 'million', 'management', 'world', 'drought', 'managing', 'gfdrr']", ,flood_and_drought

Well, he?s getting his wish. Changes in wind and ocean currents caused by global warming shift heat around unevenly, causing some areas to heat up dramatically even as other regions cool. Russia, it turns out, is in the unusually hot category. Between 1976 and 2012, average Russian temperatures rose 0.43°C (0.8°F) a decade?more than twice the global average of 0.17°C?according to a new report out by Russia?s climate and environment agency (pdf, link in Russian).

Russian Hydrometeorological Service Trends in Russia?s average temperatures.

This is a big problem for a variety of reasons, say Russia?s climate scientists. Hotter temperatures appear to be driving a spike in episodes of dangerous extreme weather:

The frequency of forest fires (Russian) in the Siberian taiga, Evenki, and Khabarovsk regions and in the far northeast have surged between 30% and 50% in the past two to three decades.

Those extreme-weather episodes are taking their toll on Russians? health. The report notes that the forest fires that often accompany summer heat waves give off noxious fumes. In 2010, this smog caused Moscow mortality rates to double.

Balmier climes are also making Russia more hospitable for certain diseases. The report notes that by 2010, the breeding ground for harmful insects was twice what it was in 1973. This trend, says the report, is linked with a flare-up of West Nile virus in the last 15 years, as well as an expanded range of Crimean hemorrhagic fever and tick-borne encephalitis.

One of the arguments that Putin and others have advanced in favor of global warming is that it will make more of Russia?s land arable. The report notes that is happening, as agriculture shifts to central and northern parts of the country. However, it?s something of a wash given that drought is also hurting output in Russia?s breadbasket region. Others note that the melting of permafrost could galvanize Russia?s mining and oil industries by making nickel, copper, diamonds, oil and natural gas more accessible.","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/russia-global-warming-climate-change-smog-forest-fires-vladimir-putin.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['planetand', 'seeing', 'rest', 'russia', 'result', 'global', 'faster', 'russias', 'fires', 'temperatures', 'warming', 'report', 'drought', 'average', 'notes', 'forest', 'twice', 'heat']", ,drought

By Brett Walton

Circle of Blue

For the land and water managers working in the aftermath of one of the largest fires in California?s history, the lack of rain and snow ? and more significantly the absence of land-ripping thunderstorms ? has been a spot of relief in an otherwise bleak and trying year.

Blackened trees and charred homes are misery enough after a destructive blaze. But a severe forest fire also prepares the land for a destructive second act: a flood of muck and debris into streams and reservoirs after a heavy rain. In recent decades large forest fires in the American West, from California to Colorado, have cost water utilities millions of dollars in clean up costs.

The Rim fire burned more than one quarter of a million acres last August in Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park and cost $US 127 million to snuff out. A federal grand jury indicted a hunter last week for accidentally starting the inferno.

Yet the curtain has not lifted on a big second-act flush in the watershed. For that, California?s record drought ? which has prompted unprecedented reductions in water availability ? is a silver lining.

?The drought has been somewhat beneficial to the watershed,? Mary Moore, a U.S. Forest Service hydrologist working on the Rim fire recovery project, told Circle of Blue. ?The rain has been light, wetting rain. That has allowed the seed bank to reestablish.?

The seed bank is the stock of grasses and young trees that begin to push through the denuded soil.

?We?re starting to see green up in the burned area,? Moore said. ?There haven?t been any significant effects in degrading the watershed ? no gullies or rills.?

Utilities operating in the watershed downstream of the fire are relieved too. No overwhelming cascade of dead trees, brush, and sediment has washed into Don Pedro reservoir, a large manmade lake on the Tuolumne River, said Calvin Curtain, spokesman for Turlock Irrigation District, which operates the dam and reservoir.

?Our biggest concern in relation to the Rim Fire is debris runoff into the reservoir,? Curtain told Circle of Blue. ?Fortunately, in this case, we haven?t seen much runoff.?

The district has spent about $US 100,000 to guard mechanical structures in the reservoir from debris, Curtain said.

A Fear of Water

Floods are a problem after a fire for several reasons. First, dead trees and ash can turn streams into a thick cauldron of goo. Fort Collins, Colorado, for instance, sealed its water intake from the Cache la Poudre River in July 2012 after a rainstorm over the recently extinguished High Park fire caused a spike in particulates and a rapid degradation of the watershed.

The second problem occurs if the fire burns with such intensity that it creates a hydrophobic layer of soil that repels water like Teflon.

Image courtesy of U.S. Forest Service A map of the Rim fire with areas classified by how severely the soil burned. High severity burns (shown in red) covered 7 percent of the 103,772 hectares (256,428 acres) that burned. Click image to enlarge.

In the Rim fire, some 7 percent of the burn zone was classified as ?high severity.? But roughly 40 percent of the burned acres show hydrophobic soil properties, Moore said.

A week ago Moore was in the field assessing the soil. She found the water-repelling layer at a depth of 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). All of the soil above the hydrophobic coat could potentially wash off.

?One inch is not as scary as three or four,? Moore explained.

Evidence of the flood risk came in late July when one of the few large storms to hit the area parked over Granite Creek. Almost 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain fell in an hour. Moore said the storm tide overwhelmed a culvert large enough for a grown man to walk through.

Hitting the Utility?s Wallet

Turlock Irrigation District has spent only $US 100,000 responding to the Rim fire. Not every utility gets off so cheaply.

Fires in 1996 and 2002 clogged Strontia Springs reservoir and led Denver Water, the owner, to spend $US 26 million to dredge the facility and reseed the surrounding forest.

In Southern California, a series of storms in 2010 that followed a destructive fire in Angeles National Forest prompted a similar response from Los Angeles County, which spent $US 30 million to clear debris from basins it uses for flood control.

After these experiences, several utilities are taking preemptive action. Denver and Santa Fe are among a growing number of cities that are adding the costs of forest restoration and fire prevention to their water rates. They seek to reduce the risk of a catastrophic fire in the watersheds from which they drink.

The U.S. Forest Service, because it often oversees the land upstream of the reservoirs, usually facilitates the programs and has agreements with Colorado Springs in addition to Denver and Santa Fe.

The Bureau of Reclamation, a large federal water agency, joined the party last June as part of the Western Watershed Enhancement Partnerships, one of President Obama?s many climate change initiatives. River basins in six states ? Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Washington ? were selected for the program.

These efforts will take time ? both to thin forests before a fire and guard against ill effects afterward.

Moore, the U.S. Forest Service hydrologist, said that a watershed takes as many as 10 years to recover from a serious fire. Significant damage to rivers and streams can occur even five or six years after the smoke has cleared.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RimFireSoil.jpg?fit=1000%2C747&ssl=1,"['service', 'california', 'burned', 'water', 'rain', 'soil', 'watershed', 'rim', 'recovery', 'drought', 'large', 'forest', 'helps', 'moore']", ,flood
25,25,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Illegal coal mine encroaching on nature reserve in north-west China - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/07/illegal-coal-mine-nature-reserve-china,"A Chinese coal company has been operating illegal open-pit mines in alpine meadows on the far-western Qinghai plateau, potentially endangering one of the country?s largest rivers, a new investigation has found.

Four opencast mines on the Muli coalfield, operated by the private corporation Kingho Group, could seriously endanger a fragile ecosystem high on China?s far north-western Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, according to an investigation by Greenpeace East Asia released on Thursday. The coalfield is 14 times larger than the City of London, Greenpeace said. Two of its mines overlap with a protected nature zone, making them illegal, and another two are preparing to expand into the zone.

?China?s natural reserve law says you shouldn?t be doing any large-scale operations within national parks,? said Li Shuo, the organisation?s climate and energy campaigner. ?This is a clear violation.?

Photographs taken by Greenpeace show alpine-green meadows suddenly falling off into massive black and ash-grey craters. Glacial melt from the Qilian mountains ? an 80 sq km protected zone abutting the coalfield ? runs directly into a tributary of the Yellow river, China?s second-longest waterway.



?The Muli coalfield is a growing cancer on an otherwise intact alpine ecological system,? said the Greenpeace report. ?The opencast coal mining over years has destroyed the alpine meadows connecting the glaciers on the mountains and the plateau, cutting off the channel for rainfall and melt water to feed into rivers. As a result, the water-holding capacity of the landscape is significantly compromised.?



The problem is rooted in China?s reliance on coal, which accounts for approximately 70% of the country?s energy. As China?s energy demand rises ? and levels of air, water, and soil pollution in the country?s overcrowded east become unbearable ? the central government is slowly shifting heavy mining and industrial operations to the country?s sparsely-populated west. Yet environmental groups say that authorities have not developed an adequate regulatory framework to keep the environmental impact of the new projects in check, creating a risk of mass water shortages and desertification.

Coal extraction is a highly water-intensive process. Yet ?if you look at water management [policies] in China, there aren?t any strong points on coal and energy development ? the regulations are quite weak,? said Zhong Lijin, senior associate and China Water Lead at the World Resources Institute. The central government has approved 16 ?coal power bases? (pdf) for construction between 2011 and 2015, most of them in the country?s interior. Their combined output ? 3.5bn tonnes of coal per year will eventually compromise 80% of China?s coal consumption.

?On the bright side, you can see the central government is paying more attention to this issue,? Zhong said. She said that national energy authorities have recently adopted new rhetoric, urging provinces and cities to use caution when approving water-intensive energy projects. On Monday, Beijing?s Environmental Protection Bureau said that the municipality will completely abandon coal by 2020, and instead prioritise natural gas.

The Kingho Group began developing the Muli coalfield in 2003, lured by government programmes to attract business and investment. According to Greenpeace, the company has built a ?complete coal industry chain? in the area, including a coal chemical plant 90 miles away from the mines.



Environmental experts completed an environmental impact assessment report for the coalfield in 2010, according to the report, and found that two parts of the coalfield overlapped with a buffer area of the nature reserve. In 2011, the ministry of environmental protection told local authorities that they should ban mining in the area and contain the coalfield?s scale. Despite the words of caution, the mines are moving ahead with plans to expand.



Greenpeace found that the company and government have not systematically assessed the projects? impact on the surrounding ecosystem. ?The projects therefore went ahead before the long-term impacts of mining were fully studied,? the report said.","Wed, 06 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407340720400/ad9f2391-d969-478b-a7d0-11c68eb8e046-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5761851c4ad740e503baef828629902e,"['nature', 'encroaching', 'projects', 'water', 'illegal', 'greenpeace', 'coalfield', 'coal', 'china', 'energy', 'northwest', 'environmental', 'reserve', 'chinas', 'report', 'countrys']", ,none

More than 2 million Ice Bucket Challenge videos featuring tech giants such as Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have helped raised more than $20 million for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research and awareness since July 29.

But for some Californians stuck in an exceptional drought, watching people douse themselves with ice water flies in the face of the conservation rhetoric being stressed by state and local officials.

?#ALSIceBucketChallenge WE ARE IN a DROUGHT. imagine if everyone put this much effort for that?!? #IceBucketChallenge #ALS #droughtshaming,? wrote one Twitter user.

In an email, DWP spokeswoman Michelle Vargas said: ?There are plenty of ways that L.A. residents can take the Ice Bucket Challenge and not waste water.? She then referred to an article that offers what the utility, on Twitter, called ?common-sense advice? such as skipping a shower or recycling the water used for the challenge.

On Monday, Los Angeles officials announced that they are beefing up their water-wasting patrols following the adoption of new state rules that allow fines for water wasters.

The DWP had been assigning one inspector to drive around handling complaints of water wasting in a city of 4 million people. Now the DWP has four water-use inspectors who roam the streets in specially marked cars.

Los Angeles is in Phase 2 of a mandatory water conservation ordinance. Among other restrictions, that means watering no more than three times a week and never on Saturdays and not being able to wash a car unless one uses a self-closing, water shut-off nozzle. A dry fall and winter in California would bring Phase 3, which would result in much harsher restrictions such as prohibitions. Failure to abide by the rules after getting a warning could result in fines of several hundred dollars.

On Friday, The Daily Currant posted a story headlined ?California Fining ?Ice Bucket Challenge? Participants for Wasting Water,""which made its way through social media and was picked up by various outlets before some realized the story was satirical.

By Monday, people were using the #droughtshaming hashtag on Twitter to criticize the Ice Bucket Challenge as wasteful. A Long Beach Post story performed some quick calculations and concluded that ?nearly 19,000 homes? daily water usage has been wasted.?

?Let?s do another Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money & awareness for the California Drought. #IceBucketChallenge #droughtshaming #irony,? one twitter user said Monday.

The YouTube 'Ice Bucket Challenge' gets challenged around the globe

Who could be against the YouTube challenge spreading across social networks that has celebrities and others dousing themselves with buckets of ice water to raise money to fight ALS? Plenty of people, it turns out.

First, doctors fear the practice could be risky for expectant mothers and those with heart conditions. Then, there are Californians who are living through a drought and using the hashtag #droughtshaming to tweet their amazement that anyone would celebrate wasting fresh water.

In China, protesters in drought-stricken Henan province snapped a shot of themselves raising empty red buckets above their heads, with a message to just say ""no"" to the ice bucket challenge.

The Guardian reports that a journalist in Hyderabad, India, is proposing an alternative ? the Rice Bucket Challenge ? which has a more direct charitable link. To do it, you give a bucket of rice to someone who needs it.

Here's a story of an American journalist captured by terrorists ? with a happy ending

When James Foley was beheaded by ISIS terrorists in a video released on social media last week, it sent shivers down the spines of many around the world who have loved ones still being held by terrorists in Syria and elsewhere. But for the family of American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, the nightmare ended over the weekend.

Curtis was taken by the extremist al-Nusra Front nearly two years ago and he was released after negotiations led by Qatar.

The circumstances around his release remain unclear, but his family is ecstatic beyond words. PRI's The World talked to a journalist and high school sweetheart of Curtis ? who described him as a a ?high school mischief-maker? turned ?fine intellect.? So far, Curtis has not made a public appearance or commented about his time in captivity.

Faster than a speeding bullet and more valuable than a soaring bitcoin ... It?s Superman!

Action Comics #1 just sold for more than $3.2 million on Ebay. And for those not in the know, that's the comic book that introduced Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Superman to the world, starting the superhero comic book genre. It is now officially the most expensive comic in the world.

So what makes it so valuable? For one thing, CNET reports there are only about 50 unrestored copies of it left. For another, this copy was near-pristine, because it was kept in a cedar chest at high altitude in the mountains of West Virginia by a guy who bought it from a newstand. So it remained soft, with white pages and brightly colored images. The collectibles dealer who discovered it and auctioned it on Ebay calls it the ""Mona Lisa of comics"" and says he was proud to have owned it.

Could a change in farming reverse climate change?

Plants depend on carbon to grow ? they convert it to energy without releasing it into the atmosphere. But a bedrock practice of modern farming ? tilling, or breaking up and turning over the ground ? releases carbon fixed in the soil and limits the carbon dioxide that plants can remove from air.

Journalist and writer Kristin Ohlson says there's strong evidence that farmers should stop tilling, for their own sake and for the sake of the environment.

PRI's Science Friday talked to Ohlson about how keeping the soil as undisturbed as possible leaves intact the organisms and systems that feed on carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere. Ohlson says farmers who practice ""no till"" farming are producing as much yield as farmers who till, and at much lower cost. She estimates that changing farming practice, by itself, could counteract much, if not all, of today's human-induced rise in greenhouse gases.

So he set up tables at some of the most popular supermarkets in southern China, hung American flags and began dishing out steamy samples of rice from Arkansas and California.

?At first they?d say, ?There?s rice in the U.S.?? said Yielding, head of emerging markets for the U.S. Rice Producers Assn., a Houston-based trade group. ?And we?d have to show them a map to explain that it?s grown in California and the South. Then they?d try it, and they would really like it.?

------------

FOR THE RECORD:

Rice exports: An article in the Aug. 24 Section A about U.S. rice farmers hoping to enter the China market described the USA Rice Federation as a trade association that largely represents millers. The group said it also represents merchants and 90% of the nation?s rice growers. ?

------------

Chinese importers, distributors and grocery chains lined up. Selling U.S. rice to China seemed like a slam-dunk. But eight years after Yielding?s first venture on behalf of the U.S. industry, not a single shipment of American rice has officially made it into Chinese hands.

That won?t happen until the two countries agree on a so-called phytosanitary protocol, which determines the necessary steps U.S. rice exporters must take to mitigate pests such as insects. The disagreement highlights the growing pressure on U.S. agricultural producers to either accommodate China or risk being shut out of the world?s largest emerging consumer market.

That might not have mattered a decade ago when U.S. farmers could rely on domestic buyers or traditional foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada. Today, China?s swelling appetite for food is touching agribusiness everywhere and forcing companies to choose whether to adapt.

Those that comply are seeing dividends. American agricultural exports to China rose to a record $25.8 billion last year from $5 billion a decade earlier.

Until a few years ago, no one would have considered exporting much rice to China, the world?s largest producer and consumer of the grain.

Tim Johnson, president and chief executive of the California Rice Commission, called it ?the ultimate example of selling ice to the Eskimos.?

But starting in 2012, China went on a spree, scooping up millions of tons of the grain from countries such as Vietnam, Pakistan and India. China is now on pace to import a record 3.4 million tons of rice this year ? six times more than it did in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chinese regulators want the U.S. rice industry to expand the use of insect traps down the supply chain and keep records of their findings. The USA Rice Federation, a trade association in Washington, D.C., that largely represents millers, called the Chinese demands ?unrealistic and onerous.?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture?s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service declined to provide details about the negotiations. A spokeswoman said the agency was currently reviewing the latest Chinese response, received Aug. 1.

Other food exporters have overcome challenges gaining access to the China market. Before Chinese buyers purchased Smithfield Foods last year, the Virginia pork giant began ramping up production of meat free of ractopamine, a feed additive used to promote lean muscle that?s banned in China.

Dairy farmers in Nevada also built a first-of-its-kind milk powder plant to meet China?s preference for whole milk powder rather than the skim milk powder standard in the U.S.

Other industries remain shut out. The U.S. beef industry is still trying to overturn a 2003 ban on American cattle over mad cow disease. Starting late last year, nearly a million tons of U.S. corn have been rejected at Chinese ports because of inclusion of an unapproved genetically modified strain. And some American pork imports were halted this month over fears they contained traces of ractopamine.

?Demand is growing so quickly in China for so many food products ? and with so many places to get them from ? China can pick and choose,? said Jim Harkness, a senior advisor on China for the Institute of Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis. ?From a U.S. perspective, it looks like the Chinese are being picky and erecting non-tariff barriers for political reasons. But I think from the Chinese perspective, the U.S. is an outlier in some cases. Ractopamine is banned in over 100 countries.?

In addition to China, the European Union and Russia also ban the additive. It?s deemed a risk to people with cardiovascular problems.

While other products struggle to win access, the U.S. rice growers are hopeful that officials in Washington and Beijing can come to terms as early as next year. If they do, analysts estimate, U.S. rice exports to China could reach several hundred million dollars a year. That would make China a top buyer of the American grain, on par with Mexico and Japan.

Though it produces only 2% of the world?s rice, the U.S. accounts for nearly 10% of the rice traded globally ? enough to make it the fifth-biggest exporter. About half the rice grown in the U.S. ends up abroad. Still, rice consumption in China is so high the country could eat through America?s annual production in 17 days.

California?s Sacramento Valley produces about one-fifth of America?s rice, generally a stickier medium grain that?s popular in north Asia and often is used in sushi. The rest is mostly long grain grown in the southern U.S. in states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The growing Chinese appetite for imported rice may partly reflect surging food demand, analysts said. But it?s mostly driven by arbitrage, as government policies have kept domestic rice prices high to protect Chinese farmers. Rice mills in China decided it was cheaper to buy foreign supplies.

American rice producers can?t meet that sort of mass demand ? nor do they want to. Their interest is in selling packaged rice to China to fill a high-end niche. The rice producers association?s survey of Chinese consumers buttressed that idea. Despite the concerns of Chinese regulators, shoppers in China overwhelmingly perceived U.S. rice as a safe alternative in a country hit by myriad food safety scandals.

Josh Sheppard, a fourth-generation rice grower in Biggs, Calif., about 60 miles north of Sacramento, said he?d welcome Chinese buyers because they probably would pay more for his grains than U.S. customers ? much the way Japanese buyers currently do. That?s especially important now when drought has cut rice acreage in the state by 25%.

?We don?t want to compete down in the gutter. We consider ourselves a premium product, like a fine wine,? said Sheppard, who heads a rice farming cooperative in Butte County that?s already made plans to export to China.

Advertisement

The cooperative is managed by Stuart Hoetger, co-founder of Stogan Group, an agricultural consulting firm in Chico, Calif.

Hoetger has arranged a partnership between the rice growers and Chinese food and agriculture conglomerate Wufeng.

Medium grain rice known as Calrose grown by the cooperative is being shipped in limited quantities to Chinese ports, where Wufeng is redirecting it to customers in small markets such as the Solomon Islands, the idea being Hoetger and his growers will be ready to ship to China shortly after a trade agreement is finalized.

?If China asks for something, you do it,? Hoetger said. ?You ask any farmer that?s sold to China in the last few years and they?ll tell you they?ve made a lot of money.?

29,29,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Hong Kong's Inconvenient Truth ? Foreign Policy - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/08/21/hong-kongs-inconvenient-truth/,"Hong Kong?s Inconvenient Truth

HONG KONG ? Around Hong Kong, the former British colony now subject to Chinese sovereignty, the central government in Beijing is widely, though none-too-fondly, called ""Grandpa."" Implicit in this moniker is what Siu-keung Cheung, a sociologist at Shue Yan University in Hong Kong, characterized in an interview with Foreign Policy as the ""control of bodies and lives"" ? through which Beijing presents itself as the generous benefactor to compatriots in Hong Kong.

Even as the grassroots campaign in Hong Kong to wrest greater autonomy and other freedoms under Beijing?s one-country, two-systems constitutional framework has intensified, the city?s long-standing dependence on the mainland for basic necessities like water, food, and energy rarely gets a mention. But if Hong Kong has anything to learn from its colonial ruler?s experience in negotiating with Beijing, it?s that the cold, hard realities of resource dependency can translate into political concessions.

Although not quite a piece of ""barren rock"" as derided by Lord Palmerston, Britain?s foreign secretary during the First Opium War, from 1839 to 1842, the fact remains that Hong Kong isn?t endowed with the necessary natural resources to support its population of 7 million. The Hong Kong special administrative region of China gets over 70 percent of its water from Dongjiang, a river in neighboring Guangdong province. Meanwhile, over 90 percent of fresh meat and vegetables consumed in Hong Kong is sourced from the mainland. And mainland energy sources generate more than half of the electricity consumed locally.

Many Hong Kongers in the staunchly capitalistic city tend to regard the supplies as mere business transactions with an equally capitalistic state, not least because the city pays market prices. Most people have also taken it for granted that water will keep flowing and live pigs will keep being trucked in from across the border. But decades before the reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the political ramifications of Hong Kong?s resource dependency loomed large in the minds of British colonial officials. And as the tug of war between Hong Kong and the mainland over universal suffrage intensifies, these issues may come to hold greater sway in the public consciousness.

When British colonial officials exercised control over Hong Kong, they were deeply preoccupied with Hong Kong?s use of mainland water. After China?s civil war ended with the Communist victory in 1949, hundreds of thousands of refugees poured into the tiny territory and strained its scarce water resources. Rationing became a fact of life. In 1960, Guangdong provincial officials and the colonial government struck a deal allowing Hong Kong to pipe in water from a reservoir recently completed in Shenzhen, now a megacity of over 10 million but then a sleepy part of a rural county. Beijing offered the water for free, but Hong Kong?s colonial government rejected the overture because it saw Beijing?s offer as a political ploy, and it insisted instead on a strictly commercial transaction. The Chinese agreed and in return earned badly needed foreign currency and, later, funding for treatment infrastructure. This laid the groundwork ? both hydrological and geopolitical ? to draw the colony closer to the mainland.

A few years into the 1960 supply agreement, a severe drought limited water rationing to four hours every four days. Since then, continued population growth and climate change have made Chinese water even harder to reject. According to Hong Kong government figures, in 2012, Hong Kong depended on the mainland for 76 percent of its water supply, up from 22 percent in 1965.

During the Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong?s sovereignty, which began in 1982, water supply ranked high on the list of concerns. (Dependence on water from the mainland was 34 percent in 1980.) Percy Cradock, then the British ambassador to China and who was involved in the negotiations, warned Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the British had little bargaining power because Hong Kong so heavily relied on the mainland for fresh water. The British eventually made significant concessions and gave up all of their rights to Hong Kong.

The fact that water might have sealed the city?s fate on the negotiating table seems like ancient history in post-handover Hong Kong. But it has not been forgotten; in August 2010, Nelson K. Lee, a lecturer in government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, published the results of archival research and argued that the British had given up pursuing water independence for Hong Kong as a part of the handover negotiations, while China had intentionally increased the quantity of water supplied to Hong Kong in order to tighten the mainland?s leash on the territory. ""This certainly captured the attention of the pro-[Hong Kong] independence movement,"" Lee told FP. Lee said that was true ""even for ordinary Hong Kongers,"" making the general public ""more attuned to the politics behind what used to be formulaic economic calculations.""

This shift is evident in the recent backlash against the Hong Kong government?s proposal in early 2014 to tap more electricity from the China Southern Power Grid in Guangzhou. The proposal, if implemented, will result in Hong Kong relying on the mainland for more than 90 percent of its energy needs. A chorus of opposing voices, ranging from environmental groups to the local electric utilities duopoly, roared when public consultation completed in mid-June.

As it is, Hong Kong already relies on the mainland for about half of its electricity. Natural gas piped in from a gas field on the Chinese island of Hainan provides about a quarter of the electricity supply for Hong Kong, about another quarter comes from Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in Shenzhen, and the rest comes from coal imported from elsewhere, including from the mainland. When the Daya Bay plant was being planned in the mid-1980s, Hong Kongers took to the streets to protest, with many citing the meltdown of a nuclear reactor in the then-Soviet city of Chernobyl in April 1986 as a dangerous precedent. But in the end, the energy-hungry city became one of the plant?s largest customers. There?s one source of dependency that is already nearly absolute: fresh meat and produce. According to Hong Kong government figures, Hong Kong gets all of its fresh beef, 94 percent of its fresh pork, and 92 percent of its fresh vegetables from the mainland.

To be sure, Beijing has not threatened to pull the plug on water, food, and electricity for Hong Kong ? that would not be politically astute. ""At the end of the day, the party is all about paternalistic politics, but it can?t use water and food as bargaining chips. The cost of using them as such is simply too high,"" said Cheung. ""Because once the trigger is pulled, it?ll backfire.""","Thu, 21 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/hk_small5.jpg?w=960,"['kongs', 'mainland', 'electricity', 'water', 'hong', 'kong', 'colonial', 'fresh', 'truth', 'british', 'chinese', 'inconvenient']", ,drought

So, many of them are calling dowsers.

These 'water witches', draped in dubious pseudoscience or self-assembled mythologies?or both?typically use divining rods and some sort of practiced intuition to ""find"" water. The professional variety do so for a fee (sometimes a 'suggested donation'). And business is booming.

The phenomenon is nothing new, of course, as humans have a long, weird history of trying to conjure water out of the ether through mystic or technic means. But for a modernized society that would scoff at the notion of rain dances?and occasionally delights at mocking their caricature?we're still rather susceptible to hokum of precisely the same order.

""Pretty much all the farmers I know won't drill a well if they don't have a dowser,"" the successful winemaker Marc Mondavi recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. He, too, is a dowser. He spends his weekends swinging a rod around his property to locate hidden water stores.

It's actually been a fairly widespread practice in America since the late 19th century (though it dates to the 1500s as a practice to find rare metals). It's popular enough nationwide that there's a body called the American Society of Dowsers that convenes annually.

Here is how the ASD website describes its work:

But it's easy to pick on dowsing, with its New Age trappings and crystals and wands. The truth is, when we're desperate for water, we'll believe just about anything.

At the turn of the 20th century, rainmaking, or pluviculture, was a cottage industry overrun with con men and swindlers who used fraudulent methodologies and devices they claimed could create rain. They traveled across the West, where settlers had just began tending land they'd bought from the government and knew almost nothing about. Many landed in arid places unfit to grow the crops they were used to growing, and many grew desperate?so they turned to pluvicluturists.

There's a chapter in Jeff Goodell's book on geoengineering, How to Cool the Planet, dedicated to this cast of characters, the most famous of which was Charles Hatfield. In some ways, Hatfield really was a proto-geoengineer; he claimed his secret mixture of chemicals, when mixed into galvanizing tanks and released into the atmosphere, could beckon forth a downpour. But he had no training as a scientist, and his rainmaking successes were dubious at best.

Hatfield is perhaps most famous for accepting a $10,000 job in 1915 from the city of San Diego, which had grown too fast to keep up with water demand. He set up a tower with his galvanizing tanks, and, coincidentally, a storm opened up and flooded the city, causing so much damage it refused to pay him.

The idea has never been recognized by science, primarily because it's absolutely insane.

Anecdotes like those help rainmakers earn their mythological stripes; Hatfield failed plenty, and some astute observers suggested that he was merely smart enough to only take jobs when he recognized a storm system approaching.

Of course, all kinds of pseudoscientific devices have been assembled in the name of rainmaking?the most famous might be Wilhelm Reich's cloudbuster. Reich, one of history's most illustrious scientists-cum-pseudoscientists, believed that drought was caused by too much ""orgone""?which he believed, according to Atlas Obscura, was ""an omnipresent libidinal life force responsible for gravity, weather patterns, emotions, and health""?accumulating in the atmosphere.

So, he built a cloudbuster?basically, a bunch of hollow tubes connected to hoses?that would ostensibly suck the orgone out of the sky to create rain. In 1953, in the midst of another major drought, New England blueberry farmers asked the eccentric inventor to aim the contraption over their crops. By some accounts, it rained. Of course, the idea has never been recognized by science, primarily because it's absolutely insane.

Today, cloudbusting is probably best known for the hit Kate Bush song the pseudoscience inspired.

With climate change sweeping the globe, and more and more populous regions succumbing to more frequent drought, there's only going to be further desperation for rain. This is partly why geoeningeering has become such a heated topic of late.

The modern era of rainmaking is, occasionally, more scientifically informed. Weather modification has been a hot topic for decades, with the infamous Operation Popeye deployed to rain out the enemy in the Vietnam war, and scientific institutions dedicated to tinkering with drawing more water from clouds.

The Desert Research Institute has found that seeding clouds with silver iodide, potassium iodide, or dry ice can squeeze more moisture out of clouds in the winter.

That's perhaps why China has a vast infrastructure dedicated to its national rainmaking project, and why it fires off artillery rounds full of chemicals into skies across the nation. Famously, it did so right before its Summer Olympic Games debut to attempt to ensure a dry opening ceremony. Scientists remain divided over the efficacy of such efforts?some suggest that the net precipitation isn't changed much, just the location where it falls?but at least there's a scientific basis for the endeavor.

Which brings us back to dowsing. It's interesting that of the two primary feats of rainmaking?one based in mythology and a quasi-religious framework, one pseudoscience turned bona fide science?it's dowsing that farmers are still tapping in the midst of epic drought. Sure, a few have asked about cloud seeding. But the hucksters stick to the wands and the rods.

It's a bit of an anachronistic paradox?I'm sure some of the same farmers that hire dowsers use crop management software and harness energy from photovoltaic arrays?and a reminder that as far as we like to imagine we've advanced, a little desperation can make room for a lot of pseudoscience. That's not likely ever to change.","Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.vice.com/motherboard/content-images/contentimage/14831/1409181243404962.jpg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC41NzQxNjI2Nzk0MjU4MzczeGg7Y2VudGVyLGNlbnRlciZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoqJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOio,"['dowsing', 'farmers', 'recognized', 'pseudoscience', 'water', 'brings', 'rainmaking', 'hatfield', 'drought', 'downpour', 'rain', 'theres']", ,flood_and_drought

33,33,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,"For groundwater, local management proves effective - California Farm Bureau",https://www.agalert.com/story/?id=7007,"For groundwater, local management proves effective

As the state Legislature considers statewide groundwater legislation in the midst of a severe drought, water agencies and water users say local groundwater management has yielded sustainable and positive results.

""Recent discussions may have left people with the impression that California has no groundwater management, but dozens of local and regional plans are in place and work well,"" said Danny Merkley, California Farm Bureau Federation director of water resources.

Current law enables local entities or agencies to implement their own groundwater basin management solutions and strategies. Local management falls into three main categories: special act districts, created through an act of legislation; county groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies; and court adjudications, where groundwater rights are determined by a court.

For example, the Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District?a special act district?has collected groundwater data since it was formed more than 60 years ago. Special act districts operate under different rules and processes, based on local needs. The Yolo County district was formed at the request of county supervisors and created by the Legislature with the purpose of finding new water sources and managing them efficiently.

Tim O'Halloran, general manager for the district, said its data collection efforts give well owners ""a snapshot twice a year of how their groundwater is doing, a trend over time,"" which allows development of sophisticated, conjunctive water programs that assure sustainable groundwater use.

Effective groundwater management comes from working through the issues collaboratively and locally, he said.

""If an outsider comes in and takes the data, by the time it is processed, it may or may not make sense and they won't have the context to evaluate the data,"" O'Halloran said.

Another special act district, the Sierra Valley Groundwater Management District, was established in 1980 after irrigators became concerned about increased drilling of new wells.

Jim Roberti, a director of the Sierraville-based district, said the district was established to prevent export of water.

""The major goal of the forming of the district has been achieved and the water has been allowed to stay in the valley for the people that live here,"" he said.

Roberti said landowners are required to purchase a meter for any wells with a flow rate of more than 100 gallons per minute. The district owns and maintains the meters, with data collected monthly.

Management of aquifers is also achieved through the use of local groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies.

The Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation was formed in 1999.

""Butte County started this county water and natural resource department because there were transfers taking place and the residents felt there should be a little more oversight, so the county passed an initiative that restricts transferring surface water and pumping groundwater,"" said Les Heringer, farm manager at M&T Ranch in Chico. ""Since the county started this, it has functioned very well.""

Paul Gosselin, the director of the county department, said Butte County has more than one ordinance that guides groundwater, such as a groundwater management plan and a well-spacing ordinance to ensure that agricultural wells do not interfere with each other.

""It is pretty complex with groundwater flows, surface water flows and the interaction with surface and groundwater, and then how much land use affects either surface-water use or groundwater use,"" Gosselin said.

Butte County has a network of wells that are monitored quarterly, plus additional wells dedicated for groundwater monitoring, with data reported publicly. Landowner volunteers are asked to assist with groundwater monitoring.

""We've had extraordinary involvement and public participation and willingness by landowners to do monitoring and help study the basin,"" Gosselin said. ""The people at the local level did this from the grassroots up because of their understanding and appreciation of the importance of groundwater and what that means for the community, agriculture and the environment.""

A third form of groundwater management is through court adjudication, in which groundwater rights are determined by a court, including how much groundwater well owners can extract and who serves as watermaster to ensure the basin is managed.

John Martin, general manager of the Tehachapi-Cummings County Water District in Tehachapi, said the district has three adjudicated basins.

""Because of the fact that the groundwater is limited and the safe yield is very small, we have an informal arrangement with the farmers that they don't take more than half of their total water needs from the ground and that they get at least half from our (surface) water supply,"" Martin said. ""They have been complying with that for quite a number of years and by doing that, the basin is staying well below the court-determined safe yield.""

The Tehachapi-Cummings district, which acts as the court-appointed watermaster, meters agricultural wells that take monthly readings and groundwater elevations, and people are notified when the supply is getting out of balance.

Merkley said Farm Bureau and other agricultural organizations have been urging the Legislature to move deliberately in considering statewide groundwater legislation. He noted that some groundwater basins face supply-demand challenges, but that examples of successful local programs could ""provide a path for others to follow"" in coming years.

""The complexities of groundwater, groundwater management and interactions with surface water are simply too great to rush to complete an isolated solution,"" he said. ""We recommend a carefully thought-through process to develop appropriate protections of our groundwater resources for future generations.""

Butte County farmer Heringer put it this way: ""One size does not fit all in this state regarding groundwater. Every groundwater basin is different in the state, so local oversight is much better than having somebody from the state come in and tell us how to manage it.""

34,34,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Olive oil prices set to rise sharply after Andalusia drought - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/25/olive-oil-prices-rise-andalusia-spain-drought-poor-harvest,"Hold the bruschetta: olive oil prices are expected to rise sharply after a prolonged drought in the world's biggest producing region in southern Spain, at the same time as a blight has hit the crop in Puglia, Italy's main olive-growing area.

While there is still time for rain to save the day in Andalusia, as harvesting takes place from October to January depending on the olive variety and location, without better weather soon this year's crop is predicted to be 40% down on the bumper 1.77 million-tonne harvest of 2013-14.

""Not even the most optimistic are predicting a million tonnes,"" said David Erice of Spain's Small Farmers Union. ""We're expecting something closer to 2012, when production was around 700,000 tonnes.""

Spain produces 50% of the world's olive oil, with 73% of that coming from the province of Andalusia in the south and 16% from Catalonia in the north-east. In 2013 olive oil exports from Andalusia were worth ?1.5bn (£1.1bn).

The drought isn't the only problem. Bumper harvests leave the trees exhausted, said Erice, and they produce far fewer olives the following year.

Anticipation of a poor harvest means that in the wholesale market, where it is priced per kg, virgin olive oil has already risen from ?2.40 to ?2.70 per kg over the past few weeks, according to Infaoliva, the Spanish olive oil federation. The drought in 2012 led to a 13% price rise.

Prices are predicted to rise by as much as ?0.50c a litre ? although extra virgin olive oil retails in supermarkets at around ?3.00 a litre in Spain and is a popular loss leader in supermarket wars, to the detriment of producers who in recent years have complained that supermarkets have pushed the price down to below the cost of production. Some analysts predict that supermarkets will absorb any price hike in order to maintain their competitive edge.

Virgin olive oil futures for September are at their highest level since June 2013, and some suppliers say that speculators are contributing to the rise in futures prices by capitalising on the uncertainty caused by the drought. The bets they are making are driving prices higher.

There are also claims that some producers are withholding stock in anticipation of selling at a higher price later in the year. However, for all but the biggest producers the olive oil business has become a no-win proposition. If the harvest is good, the price slumps; a poor harvest means selling much less for only slightly more.

The oil is exported principally to France, Portugal and Italy. Italy often repackages Spanish oil as ""estate bottled"", giving consumers the impression that it is an Italian product. Italy is the second largest producer after Spain, accounting for 15% of world production, with Greece producing 13%.

This year Spain has overtaken Italy as the market leader in olive oil in the US and Japan. Worldwide demand for ""liquid gold"" has risen by 60% over the past 20 years, driven by increased demand in China, the US, Canada and Australia.

Olive oil has been left off the list of agricultural products embargoed by Russia in its ongoing spat with the European Union. ""If Russia had included it in the list of banned products it would have been a great setback,"" says Rafael Picó of Asoliva, the oil exporters' association.

While it is drought that threatens the Spanish harvest, in the southern Italian olive-growing region of Puglia the trees have been afflicted by the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa.

""There is no cure. The only solution is to burn the infected trees to stop the bacteria spreading quickly,"" Raffaele Piano, a local grower, said. ""Prices will rise by 30% to 40% but quality will not be affected,"" he said.

While harvests in other major producing countries such as Greece and Turkey are expected to be at average levels this year, they will not be able to make up for the shortfall in Spanish production, and price rises seem inevitable.","Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/25/1408980300785/Olive-oil-prices-set-to-r-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e2c22f4503f304b5ed70a5ad8e39d253,"['sharply', 'prices', 'spain', 'oil', 'production', 'set', 'rise', 'harvest', 'price', 'andalusia', 'spanish', 'drought', 'olive']", ,drought

Instead of raising and selling crops irrigated by the Zayandeh Roud, they are now paid to keep its parched riverbed clean and litter-free.

The Zayandeh Roud, or ?life-giving river?, has flowed through the ancient city for more than 1,000 years en route from its source in the Zagros Mountains in the west of the country to the vast wetlands of Gavkhooni in the south of the Isfahan region. But the riverbed now resembles a vast, gravelly beach, a dead stretch of sun-baked land that winds through the heart of Isfahan, a five-hour drive south of Tehran.

?No water in this river means I had to leave my farmlands in the town of Varzaneh and work for the Isfahan municipality for 15,000 tomans [$5.6] per day,? says Afshin as he cuts weeds on the riverbed.

The drying out of the river means about 2m people ? 40 per cent of the population ? in the Zayandeh Roud basin who depend on agriculture have lost their income, says Mostafa Hajjeh-Foroush, head of the agriculture committee of the Isfahan Chamber of Commerce. ?If this situation continues they should think of changing jobs,? he adds.

The water that disappeared ? a result largely of mismanagement and overuse rather than drought ? is stored at the Zayandeh Roud dam and diverted for domestic and industrial consumption, leaving the city?s 11 river bridges standing as symbols of what is missing.

Residents say the loss is overwhelming. ?When I see the Zayandeh Roud dried, I feel I am drying, too,? says Fereydoun, a 27-year-old taxi driver.

The choking of the river has had a profound effect on a city that was built around the Zayandeh Roud in the same way that London grew up around the Thames and Paris around the Seine.

But Isfahan?s plight is just one example of a water crisis in a country gripped by 14 successive years of drought. Iran is hardly alone in facing a water shortage but its problems are acute. A growing population and shrinking economy make the situation difficult, but its position at the centre of a politically unstable region where competition for water is intense makes it dangerously volatile.

Thousands of villages rely on water tankers for supplies, according to local media, while businessmen complain shortages are a daily hazard in factories around Tehran. At least a dozen of the country?s 31 provinces will have to be evacuated over the next 20 years unless the problem is addressed, according to a water official who declined to be named.

The situation may be even worse than that, says Issa Kalantari, a reform-minded agriculture minister in the 1990s. ?Iran, with 7,000 years of history, will not be liveable in 20 years? time if the rapid and exponential destruction of groundwater resources continues,? he warns, adding that the shortages pose a bigger threat to Iran than its nuclear crisis, Israel or the US.

The authorities have warned of the need for water rationing, but so far they are asking only that heavy users cut back.

The crisis raises concerns about the risk of conflict in a country surrounded by unstable neighbours ? most notably Afghanistan and Iraq ? with water shortages of their own.

?Water has been a recurring source of friction with each of Iran?s neighbours,? says David Michel of the Stimson Center, an international security think-tank in Washington. ?In the absence of more effective management I would expect that water issues will continue to be a flashpoint with Iran?s neighbours.?

Hassan Rouhani, the centrist president, has spoken frequently of the need to tackle the crisis since winning power last year, and has promised to reverse the populist policies of Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, his predecessor, who is accused by reformist politicians and environmentalists of making the problem worse.

But the reforms require money, and Iran?s economy is struggling under the weight of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear programme.

?Last year was a really bad year because of sanctions and a lack of sufficient funds,? says Alireza Parastar, director-general at the agriculture ministry, hinting at one of the reasons water reforms were set back.

Western officials are also reluctant to offer help on water conservation measures, say international experts.

?Supporting those in Iran who wish to reverse environmental management problems and reduce future threats from climate change is in the planet?s interest as well as Iran?s,? says Gary Lewis, resident representative of the UN development programme in Tehran. ?Environmental challenges, especially water, ought to be the real future human security priority for Iran.?

?

Iran?s water problems are largely of its own making. Although it only gets about 200mm of rain a year, about a third of the global average, and 75 per cent of it falls on only 25 per cent of its area, it has a notable history of water engineering. It has built impressive dams and invented the ancient system of qanats, vertical shafts connected by gently sloping tunnels that channel water from higher regions with no need for pumps.

However, a population that has doubled to 76m in the past 40 years has put that system under pressure, as has a changing climate that has seen rainfall decline by 16 per cent over the same period. The growth of industry in dry regions has added to the strain.

But the biggest problem is a system of generous subsidies that has encouraged wasteful use of a resource long taken for granted. The problem is most visible in the agricultural sector, which uses about 90 per cent of Iran?s water and accounts for about 15 per cent of gross domestic product.

With little incentive to use systems that conserve supplies, Iran?s farmers have flooded their crops with supplies pumped from underground sources that are often difficult to replace.

Groundwater extraction nearly quadrupled between the 1970s and the year 2000, according to the UN?s Food and Agriculture Organisation, while the number of wells rose fivefold.

Analysts say more than $100bn in investment is needed over the next decade to improve irrigation systems and replace water-intensive crops such as wheat. At the same time, work is needed to curb the desertification and deforestation that have grown at an alarming pace, mainly because of overgrazing of livestock.

?The country?s 84.9m hectares of pasture can feed only 37m cattle rather than the current 83m and over 120 days each year rather than 200 days,? says Ali Mohammad Tahmasebi, an authority on deserts at the ministry of agriculture. ?Shepherds do not face any limits.?

Though the roots of Iran?s water crisis go back decades, the problem grew much worse under Mr Ahmadi-Nejad, president between 2005 and 2013, according to reform-minded academics and former officials.

To curry favour with rural voters, he allowed management of Iran?s water to shift from the central government to the provinces. Isfahan was a victim of the move.

In 2006, Mr Ahmadi-Nejad visited Chaharmahal Bakhtiari, the mountainous province west of Isfahan and the source of the Zayandeh Roud, and announced that local farmers would have priority access to water.

FT series A world without water An investigation into how businesses are having to adapt to rising water costs around the world

The move encouraged farmers in the province to plant water-intensive crops. But as the neighbouring provinces of Yazd and Kashan grew, the Zayandeh Roud was used to supply them with water. Isfahan farmers began to run short.

They reacted by mounting protests ? some of which turned violent ? to highlight the diversion of water that they regarded as theirs. The farmers have vowed to block projects that could channel water toward Isfahan city, Yazd and Kashan.

About 1,000 farmers in the east of the province last year drove their tractors 100km to the city of Isfahan and destroyed valves on pipelines carrying water to the city of Yazd. The protest led to clashes with riot police. There was further unrest in the spring of 2014 when farmers threatened further protests if the river stayed dry. The central government in Tehran promised them compensation and said the river would flow in autumn so they could plant crops.

But Ali, a 24-year-old farmer, says his tractor is always ready to head to Isfahan. ?We want our historical right which was given to us for thousands of years,? he says. ?I can earn 300m rials ($11,755) every year if there is water, but now the government is going to give me a compensation of 30m rials ($1,175). It is ridiculous.?

Mr Hajjeh-Foroush says that those ?who benefited from the previous government?s policies? are reluctant to give up those gains.

The damage in Isfahan province has been substantial. Analysts say tens of thousands of hectares of farmland have turned to desert. More than 500m trees have died over the past four years and land has subsided ? a byproduct of draining groundwater supplies ? in some areas by as much as one metre, threatening the city?s historical sites.

?Mismanagement has been far more damaging than drought,? says Aliahmad Keikha, deputy head of the state-run department of environment for natural environment and biodiversity. ?We could cope with drought if there was a more efficient management.?

Analysts and politicians expect conflict to widen and intensify. ?Iran faces a hydro-political crisis which means national crises in the future will be rooted in a water shortage,? says Morad Kaviani Rad, a professor at Kharazmi University.

?

Isfahan is by no means the only visible sign of Iran?s water crisis.

Urmia Lake in the northwest is on the brink of an ecological catastrophe. About 95 per cent of it has dried up over the past two decades, mainly due to wasteful irrigation practices and drought.

In 1996, the lake stretched over 5,200 cubic kilometres and held 31bn cubic metres of water. Now it holds 1.5bn.

More than 80,000 groundwater pumps and 37 dams for irrigating farmland in the lake?s basin mean more water has left the lake than flows into it. Agricultural yields from the Urmia region, meanwhile, have generated only about $1.2bn a year.

?Reviving the lake is essential,? says Mr Kalantari, the former agriculture minister who is advising the government on measures to save Urmia. ?We cannot sit idly and witness evacuation of the region.?

At $4bn, the cost of returning the lake to health would be prohibitive. It could also take about 12 years, he says. But President Rouhani has ordered the replenishment of the lake no matter the cost, a sign of the new government?s determination to tackle the water crisis.

Ministers have been ordered to draw up plans for a new water management system, and stop the expansion of farms in arid regions and consider measures to discourage the use of groundwater pumps in stressed areas such as Urmia Lake.

Analysts say the problems Mr Rouhani faces ? from international sanctions to stagflation ? mean that environmental projects could take a back seat even as domestic and border tensions over water rights simmer.

The shortages in Iraq have left the Hoor al-Azim wetlands in southwest Iran, which is served by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, depleted.

Supplies from the Harirud, a border river in the northeast, have been diverted upstream in Afghanistan to irrigate its farmland, jeopardising the supply to the religious centre of Mashhad, Iran?s second-biggest city, which is facing the biggest drinking water crisis in the country.

?Mashhad will soon be a hostage to Afghanistan,? warns Mr Kaviani Rad.

The Hamouns in the southeast ? three wetlands covering 5,660 sq km mostly in Iran but also in Afghanistan ? which should be fed by the Helmand river have been mostly dry over the past decade. There are unconfirmed reports that villagers around Helmand have started migrating to northern provinces.

?What would remain of Iran if Urmia Lake, Zayandeh Roud and the Hamouns are erased from its map?? asks Mr Keikha. ?The drying up of the Hamouns is [equivalent to] drying up of the roots of a great civilisation in the world?s east. We have not been good soldiers to safeguard this ancient land.?

Extraction technology: History washed away a qanat at a time

Qanats, the gently sloping shafts and tunnels that form Iran?s irrigation system, have been running in the country for more than 2,000 years, conveying subterranean water from mountains to plains.

But their future is at stake as the increasing use of groundwater pumps sucks aquifers dry, leading to destruction of the ancient system first developed in Persia and then extended to Asia, Africa and Europe.

Qanats are built by skilled workers who identify the mountain water source and locate the sites for vertical shafts, which are dug by hand, and then connected by gently sloping tunnels that open on to the plains below.

The entrance to an a underground aqueduct, part of a qanat, in Yazd, Iran.

In recent decades, however, technology and greater demand have turned into the biggest threat to the system. Government authorities have been accused of failing to maintain and extend the qanats system, which could no longer meet rising demand, and did little to prevent excessive extraction through quicker and easier methods. The 36,000 qanats left in Iran ? about half the number of 50 years ago ? provide 14 per cent of the water needed for agriculture.

In the Shahre-Ray area of southern Tehran, where farmlands meet part of the city?s vegetable needs, there are 40 qanats, half the number that existed in the 1960s. In their place are some 1,400 pumps set up to irrigate farmlands and provide drinking water for a booming population.

?Most qanats suffer from a shortage of water or have dried up mainly because of pumps operating around them and, to a lesser extent, due to successive years of drought,? says Abdolhamid Rasekhi, an expert on Tehran?s qanats.

Another challenge is the cost of maintenance. The annual cost of dredging the 7km Karimabad Tehranchi qanat in southern Tehran, for instance, is 500m rials ($19,277).

Meanwhile, the qanat builders are not being replaced when they leave the trade, raising fears that the systems will eventually die out.

?We developed qanats and introduced them to the world, then we lost them. It?s so sad that one of the most sustainable ways of water harvesting is almost gone,? says Dr Kaveh Madani, an authority on Iran?s water at Imperial College, London.

The company had been comparatively slow to raise prices, possibly because the margins on K-cups are so high that they could absorb coffee price increases for a time.

The gross margin on K-Cups can approach 50% in some cases, huge for any industry, let alone food retail.

The increase will go into effect November 3rd. Behind the jump is a massive increase in the price of green coffee, which is up more than 50% over the past year, after a drought and disastrous harvest in Brazil. The prices have soared, stayed high:

The price increase comes ahead of the company?s rollout of its new Keurig 2.0 machine, which will come with the ability to detect knockoff unlicensed pods, and to brew carafes of coffee instead of just a cup.

In its most recent earnings call, the company said it had locked in its coffee supply through 2015. But the pressure to make up those coffee costs, as well as increases in the prices of packaging materials, energy, and transportation?and to follow the lead of competitors?was apparently too much.","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rtx18pbd.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['prices', 'skyhigh', 'coffee', 'increases', 'costs', 'raise', 'green', 'company', 'price', 'kcups', 'raising', 'keurig', 'increase']", ,drought

In early August 2014, we have seen several significant rainfall events occur across the United States. During the week of August 10, for example, a slow moving area of low pressure across the Great Lakes and New England produced widespread showers and storms. Yesterday (August 19), parts of Phoenix (yes, the desert) recorded over four inches of rain in a short time period, thanks to an upper level low pushing into the western United States. Are extreme rainfall events related to climate change, and/or has urban sprawl contributed to flash flooding events due to more concrete and poor sewer systems? The answers to both questions are probably yes. Follow the links inside to learn more.

What about the rest of the world?

Is global warming responsible for the increase in urban flooding in the past few years?

Sampling of U.S. extreme rainfall events so far in August 2014

On August 18, heavy rain fell in parts of Arizona and the desert U.S. Southwest. Some spots recorded over four inches of rain in a small amount of time.

According to CNN International Meteorologist Brandon Miller,

The 5.59 inches in 12 hours near Black Canyon City represents a greater than 1 in 1,000 years precipitation event. The Agua Fria River near Rock Springs rose over 23 feet in only 7 hours. At one point rising more than 10 feet in only 2 hours between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. This would be the 4th highest crest, highest since Jan 2010 and second highest since 1993.

During the week of August 10, a slow moving area of low pressure across the Great Lakes spun its way towards New England. Behind the system, a very dry air mass was in place and would eventually push into the U.S. Southeast and provide lower humidity in places that typically see muggy conditions. The first area that was hit was Detroit, Michigan on August 12, 2014. Heavy rain produced flash flooding that brought water levels as high as 14 feet. Cars were submerged under water, and areas were impassible. Over four inches of rain fell and the heavy rain event made it the second wettest day in Detroit history. The next day, the heavy rains struck Baltimore and parts of the U.S. Northeast. According to the Capital Weather Gang, 10 inches of rain fell south of Baltimore in northern Anne Arundel County. In Washington D.C., two inches of rain fell. On August 11, Islip, New York recorded 13.57 inches of rain in 24 hours, breaking the New York state 24 hour rainfall total of 11.6 inches recorded back in 2011 when Tropical Storm Irene affected the region.

On August 16, 2014, another area of low pressure centered across Canada produced heavy rain for parts of western North Dakota. Manning, North Dakota recorded over six inches of rain in 24 hours. Several other spots in Burleigh, Dunn, Stark, and Morton counties recorded over four inches of rain.

Meanwhile, heavy rain in Kearney, Nebraska last week produced serious flooding in a hospital. Check out the footage of the water pouring into the building.

An extreme rainfall event from earlier this year. Extreme rainfall in the U.S. hasn?t been limited to August 2014. How can we forget the extreme rains that occurred across the Gulf Coast in late April, 2014? Some spots recorded over 24 inches of rain within 48 to 72 hours.

Pensacola, for example, recorded a two day total of 20.47 which lies between a 1 in 100- to 1 in 200-year-event.",,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
It is not unusual to see heavy rainfall totals of four to eight inches from a tropical cyclone making landfall. However, these events are not from tropical moisture. They are mostly caused by blocks in weather patterns where areas of low pressure are able to pull plenty of moisture and are unable to push out quickly. They are also due to amplification of the jet stream. The jet stream has been very active in the eastern United States in 2014, which helps explains the cooler and wetter conditions.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
At the same time, in the western United States, a ridge of high pressure has caused one of the worst droughts ever seen in the state of California.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
What about the rest of the world? Extreme precipitation events aren?t only occurring in the United States. They are occurring across the globe. Lets take a brief look at some July and August 2014 precipitation highlights around the world.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
There?s major drought occurring in India and Nepal. A major drought is also occurring in parts of China.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
On August 20, heavy rainfall in Hiroshima, Japan resulted in a deadly landslide, killing over a dozen people.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, was a very wet July for parts of Europe. According to the NCDC, France had its wettest July since national records began in 1959, receiving double the 1981?2010 average and surpassing the previous record set in 2000.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Is global warming responsible for the increase in urban flooding in the past few years? As we?ve all heard by now, computer models suggest that, as Earth?s climate warms, we are more than likely to see bigger swings in both rainfall events and droughts. Meanwhile, it?s super important to note that you cannot point to a single event and link it, clearly, to climate change or global warming.,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
However, after seeing repetitive episodes of extreme flooding ? such as the floods in Nashville (2010) or Atlanta (2009) and such as the floods of August, 2014 ? you might wonder when we will finally conclude that global warming is responsible. Some climate experts are now beginning to make this connection. According to Dr. Marshall Shepherd, Director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at University of Georgia and host of WxGeeks on the Weather Channel, both humans and climate change do play a role in urban flooding. Shepherd says there is a unique formula that comes to mind regarding extreme rainfall events. That is:,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Urban Flooding = Increase in intensity of top 1% rain events  expanding urban impervious land cover  storm water management engineered for rainstorms of ?last century?,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
He explains how most of the flooding events that have occurred over the past 10 years are a result of ?extreme meteorological conditions, urbanization, and people.?,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
One factor, he says, is the sheer size of cities, which are growing and becoming more spread out. As cities continue to expand in size, it?s as if a target has gotten larger and easier to hit. According to Shepherd:,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
If the bullseye is tripled in size, I probably have a better chance of hitting the bullseye more often. Warming climate is likely increasing the urban flood bullseye, making the probability of such flooding more likely.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Theresa Anderson, whose Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Georgia came from research into hydrometeorology, says heavy rainfall and other extreme weather can severely impact big cities.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
These heavy rain events are devastating for cities. Urban areas, which are expanding and aggregating, are not equipped to handle large volumes of water due to outdated storm water management, impervious surfaces, lack of vegetation, etc. Unfortunately, that leads to major flooding over a short period. Hopefully these events are anomalies, but when considering the predictions of an accelerating water cycle, record rainfall events may be more likely.,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Bottom line: Under conditions of a warming climate, a growing population and subsequent urban sprawl mean that extreme precipitation events are affecting cities more now than they did before 1970. Not one extreme weather event can be linked to global warming; however, computer models suggest that accelerating the water cycle via climate change will continue to bring about unusual precipitation events, including drought or flash flooding. Urban planners are beginning to speak of the need to adapt and improve cities? infrastructures ? for example, their drainage systems ? to help reduce urban floods.","Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://earthsky.org/upl/2014/08/Kevin-Burns-Portland-Maine-e1408507767325.jpg,"['precipitation', 'heavy', 'unusual', 'rainfall', 'extreme', 'water', 'recorded', 'flooding', 'patterns', 'events', 'inches', 'rain', 'urban']", ,flood_and_drought,
39,39,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,What Can Iraq?s Fight Over the Mosul Dam Tell Us About Water Security? - New Security Beat,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2014/08/iraqs-fight-mosul-dam-water-security/,"The fight for control over ?the most dangerous dam in the world? is raging.

Since its capture by Islamic State (IS) militants on August 7 and subsequent attempts by Iraqi government and Kurdish forces to take it back, Iraq?s Mosul Dam has been one of the central components of the government?s surprising and rapid collapse in the country?s northern and western provinces. In fact, one might see the capture of the Mosul Dam as the moment IS ascended from a dangerous insurgent group to an existential threat to Iraq as a state.

Water factors into conflict in ways that defy easy classification

Is the fight for Mosul Dam a ?water war?? Has the scarcity-induced chaos that many have predicted finally arrived? Not exactly.

The dynamics of the conflict and water?s role in it are multifaceted. It cannot be characterized as a simple fight over dwindling water resources. However, the military struggle between IS, the Iraqi government, and Iraqi Kurdish fighters does vividly demonstrate the numerous ways water intersects with violent conflict. From the plainly illustrated strategic value of dams, to its use as a weapon of war, a spoil, driver, and potential peacebuilding tool, water factors into conflict in ways that defy easy classification.

Critical, But Vulnerable, Infrastructure

The Mosul Dam is located on the Tigris River in a valley about 30 miles north of the city of Mosul, Iraq?s second largest and home to 1.8 million people. In operation since 1986, the dam generates upwards of 310 MW of electricity a day; holds back over 11 billion cubic meters of water; and is used for flood control, municipal water supplies, and irrigation, a crucial lifeline for thousands of farmers in Iraq?s northern Ninevah province.

A 15-foot high wave would carry on to Baghdad, over 270 miles away

Despite its significance to national infrastructure and the wellbeing of millions, concerns over poor security have been voiced for years. The dam was constructed on highly soluble soil, meaning it requires constant repairs. During the 2003 invasion, U.S. forces identified the protection of the dam as a primary objective, and, in 2006, it was described by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as ?the most dangerous dam in the world.?

Between 2006 and 2010, $30 million was poured into upgrades, but the dam remains critically vulnerable thanks to its perpetual structural problems and the tenuous security environment surrounding it.

In early August, as the fall of the dam became increasingly evident, many news stories and analyses emphasized the incredible destructive potential then controlled by the Islamic State. Some of these reports relied on data from a 2009 article by two Iraqi academics that simulated the effects of a Mosul Dam break. Their findings make for terrifying reading: In the case of a severe dam failure, Mosul would be buried beneath an 80-foot wave crashing down at a velocity of over 3.5 meters a second, and the resulting flood would be so strong that a 15-foot high wave would carry on to Baghdad, over 270 miles away.

The Tipping Point

Judging by reports of extreme brutality, as well as their genocidal rhetoric, there is ample reason to fear the Islamic State?s control of Iraq?s largest dam. The U.S. government and its allies evidently agree. It was a confluence of factors, including the violent persecution of the Yazidi religious minority, the continued advance on the Kurdish capital of Irbil, and the fall of the dam, which likely tipped the balance and prompted the start of U.S. airstrikes on August 8.

Initial targets seem to have been militant positions around Mount Sinjar to help establish a safe corridor for many of the trapped Yazidi. But soon the U.S. turned its attention to dislodging IS fighters from around the dam, which was explicitly cited by the White House on August 17 in its justification for more air strikes:

The failure of the Mosul dam could threaten the lives of large numbers of civilians, endanger U.S. personnel and facilities, including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and prevent the Iraqi government from providing critical services to the Iraqi populace.

According to the latest reports, it appears these strikes have made a difference as Iraqi Kurdish forces have regained control of the dam, hopefully easing fears of IS using it as a catastrophic weapon against the Iraqi populace.

Water as a Weapon

The battle over control of the Mosul Dam provides a dramatic centerpiece that has captured the public imagination, but it is not the first time water has played an important role in this war.

In April, reports emerged of attempts by IS to manufacture a drought by closing the floodgates of the small Nuaimiyah Dam on the Euphrates River near Islamic State-controlled Fallujah. The resulting water crisis affected millions of people in the predominantly Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf and was partly responsible for two-thirds of the polling stations in Anbar province being closed during recent parliamentary elections.

The Middle East is in the midst of its worst drought in at least 60 years

There are conflicting reports about what happened next ? IS claims the Iraqi government decided to open the floodgates further upstream, thereby flooding Fallujah and surrounding regions, while the Iraqi government says IS caused the flooding themselves by mismanaging the Nuaimiyah Dam. Regardless, water levels in the area rose significantly and overflowed the Euphrates banks into irrigation canals. Some 60,000 people lost their homes, schools were destroyed, and almost 50,000 acres of agricultural land were flooded.

Water has sparked regional tensions as well. In May, there were accusations that Turkey (or Syria, or IS, depending on the source) reduced the flow of the Euphrates into certain parts of Syria and Iraq, with millions of people being left without adequate drinking water as a result.

And hanging above it all is the fact that the Middle East is in the midst of its worst drought in at least 60 years.

Beyond Water Wars

The crisis in Iraq demonstrates how water can play a number of pivotal roles in conflict and peace, without being the primary causal factor ? and why that distinction is important.

Traditionally understood, a ?water war? reflects a zero-sum game arising from scarcity. This approach emphasizes Malthusian concerns of growing populations, which lead to high resource consumption, water degradation and scarcity, furthering competition between states and finally leading to the outbreak of violence and war. This calculus reflects a rather simplistic reduction of the variety of reasons why conflict breaks out, as well as the different ways water factors into conflict other than as a lootable resource.

The Islamic State appears to be primarily interested in using water as a strategic leverage point or component in its project to establish a long-lasting Caliphate rather than as a tactical weapon. According to one report, once they took control of the Mosul Dam, IS officials told workers their salaries would be paid, provided the dam remained in operation and electricity was generated for the region under its control. This would seem to adhere to other reports that detail how IS uses its control of oil fields, oil revenues, and petroleum products primarily as income generating projects.

The distinction is important because it can frame how we anticipate and respond to water problems. Labeling a conflict a ?water war? reduces the complexity of water to a single conflict variable. But water intersects with society in all its forms and is also important for peacebuilding and establishing government legitimacy.

Water provision is a crucial component of the state. The failure to provide adequate water supplies reflects a failure to provide basic security and justice, core functions of the state. In this regard, improvements to water infrastructure and management should be seen as key peacebuilding interventions in places like Iraq.

Conflict Is Never Simple

This is a dangerous trend which leaves violent conflict as a product of geography rather than human decisions

It is clear water has ascended as a key security variable for the Islamic State, for Iraq, and for the wider international community. And it?s understandable that in the rush to portray the existential threat posed by the Islamic State controlling vast water resources, officials and journalists have focused on the struggle over scarce resources and the potential for catastrophic damage. A careful reading of the situation, however, reveals multiple layers of complexity and interaction between water and security that suggest more calculated motives.

In Iraq, water is being used as a weapon, for covert diplomacy, blackmail, economic development, and as a discourse justifying armed intervention ? but none of these things make the conflict a water war.

Labeling it as such overlooks more complex dynamics and reduces causality to a single variable. This is a dangerous trend which leaves violent conflict as a product of geography rather than human decisions and obscures important interventions that can build lasting peace.","Thu, 27 Aug 2015 03:33:01 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mosul_Dam-300x222.jpg,"['islamic', 'water', 'control', 'state', 'dam', 'mosul', 'conflict', 'iraqs', 'security', 'iraqi', 'fight', 'reports', 'tell', 'war']", ,flood_and_drought

A severe shortage of river sand has forced the mining and quarrying branch of the Mines and Geology Division to clamp down on sand-mining operations across the island, warning that the situation will worsen as the drought continues.

""There is currently a shortage of traditional river sand in Jamaica and it can only get worse in light of the chronic drought that we have faced certainly over the last five years,"" Ronald Edwards, deputy commissioner of the mining and quarrying branch, told The Gleaner yesterday.

""We have this chronic shortage of sand. We have recognised that in some areas, there is no sand, and as such we will have to rest some of these areas (because) we wouldn't't want it to come to the point where we have to import sand,"" he added.

Edwards further explained that the lack of rain has interrupted the sediment flow into the main river sources for sand - Morant and Yallahs in St Thomas, Wag Water in St Mary, and Rio Minho in Clarendon.

The division has for the past four months suspended sand mining in Yallahs to allow the river to 'rest' and plans to do the same for the Rio Minho before moving on press home the same message to the Wag Water and Dry River operators in St Mary.

""There is going to be a continuing shortage of traditional sand until we have significant improvement in rainfall,"" Edwards said.

Chescot Brownie, director of western Jamaica real-estate developers Seal Construction Ltd, warned that the sand shortage could trigger an escalation in building costs.

""We have been having a sand shortage for some time. The Chinese have been prepaying for most of the sand,"" Brownie told The Gleaner last night, referring to the large-scale road infrastructure developments by the China Harbour Engineering Company.

""Locals can't get much sand. This will make it worse now.""

Brownie fears that truckers will take advantage of the sand crisis by hiking the prices of hauling aggregate, which he said costs $1,300-$1,400 per tonne.

He added that western Jamaica real-estate developments, like an impending multi-home construction in Lucea, Hanover, could seriously be affected.

The Mines and Geology Division will tomorrow host a workshop for all major stakeholders in regard to sand mining and quarrying, where it will impress upon quarry operators, regulatory agencies and the police, among others, the gravity of the situation which could have serious implications for the construction industry.

Meanwhile, Leonard Green, president of the All-Island Truckers' Association, said although his members were aware of the shortage of sand, his association has not been engaged by the authorities.

""I didn't know something was in the pipeline. We understand risks of erosion and so the whole thing has to be managed,"" Green said.

He argued that the decision by the authorities in setting up a permanent truck weigh station in Harbour View, St Andrew, to monitor the operations of aggregate truckers from Yallahs and its environs forced some truckers to take their business elsewhere. He said this led to increased demand for aggregate from the Rio Minho and Wag Water River.

After two years of woeful weather, French grapegrowers have a sunnier outlook this year.

The French wine industry is expecting a better harvest this year, despite drought and hail damage to some vineyards.

That?s good news for growers after two disastrous years, but consumers won't be getting any benefit, as the increased volumes won?t be enough to bring down the price of wine.

""After two years of excessively low harvests, we return to something more normal. We have an auspicious start of the harvest,? said Jérôme Despey, president of the wine branch of the agricultural organisation France Agrimer, last week.

The Department of Agriculture has revised upwards its forecast for the 2014 harvest, estimating the potential of wine production to nearly 47 million hectoliters, with the summer rains promoting growth.

The harvest represents an increase of 11 percent over the ""very poor harvests of 2012 and 2013"", and 3 percent on the five-year average, according to projections released Monday by Agreste, the statistical office of the ministry.

""The historically low level of harvests in 2012 and 2013 was the result of adverse weather conditions, particularly at flowering time,"" reported Agreste.

This year was a ""near-normal cycle."" Grape ripening happened ""relatively early"", thanks to a mild winter and spring, although it was then ""slowed by bouts of cool snaps, unusually frequent during the summer.""

Hailstorms caused ""significant damage"" especially in the Aude and Hérault, and also struck Burgundy and Beaujolais, but yield prospects remained high in the latter two regions, where rains have favored the growers.

In Bordeaux, the vines flowering went well, and the department has revised its harvest forecasts upwards to 6m hectoliters for the region. Champagne could see its production increase by almost 20 percent over the five-year average of 3.2m hectoliters, due to favorable weather.

This year, the Languedoc-Roussillon suffered a ""very hot, dry spring followed by episodes of some severe hailstorms in the Aude, west of the Hérault and Gard,"" lamented Despey, who is himself a winemaker in the region.

Production was expected to fall by as much as 10 percent over the five-year average. ""Some growers are returning 15-20 percent fewer grapes because of the drought,"" he said.

The harvest is just beginning in Languedoc-Roussillon (where Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscat are being picked), Corsica and in some parts of Provence.

For now anyway it is all systems go, which is ""important for the industry because stocks were very low, with worries about supply in all regions,"" said Despey. In 2013, production had reached only 42.3m hectoliters, while the average from 2009 to 2013 has been 45.6m.

""This will help to reposition ourselves in terms of market competitiveness,"" said Despey. Lately, given low inventories, ""we could not fulfill all the orders. Some buyers turned their back on the French market."" French exports have declined in recent years on the world wine market, especially among its traditional customers (Germany, U.K., U.S.), where its position is challenged by Italy and Spain, although it remains the major exporter to China.

The good harvest won?t prevent prices from rising next year, because stocks are still lower than a decade ago when production was close to 60m hectoliters, Despey said.","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/44/09/Languedoc-Vendanges--Berlou-10004409.jpg,"['better', 'forward', 'bigger', 'despey', 'wont', 'low', 'harvest', 'france', 'average', 'wine', 'looking', 'hectoliters', 'market', 'production', 'french']", ,drought

Foremost among these is Jaguar Land Rover, which used the Beijing Auto Show in April as a platform to announce the establishment of a 50m Yuan (£4.86m) China Children and Youth Dream Foundation. This fund has been established to ?support the dreams of under-privileged and disadvantaged children?.

There is also a profit agenda. The foundation, which received equal billing with the opening of a new Chengdu regional office, illustrates JLR?s long-term commitment to developing a partnership with China and the Chinese, which it expects will be reciprocated. It?s a commitment to support the needs of a China that cannot afford its products, in order to encourage the China that can to embrace the brand.

It?s a strategy echoed by other large corporates such as HSBC that claims on its website that CSR ?... is critical to HSBC?s long-term success in China. CSR is not only about charitable donations, the environment or society, but also about making decisions that maintain the right balance between the environment, society and the Bank?s business.? Translated from corporate-speak, that means: we can afford to be philanthropic, because it also helps our bottom line.

According to former IBM marketeer and now China consultant, John Pickup, it?s a very sound strategy, even for non-listed companies, ?CSR is a sign of the maturing corporate landscape, and an ?on-message? way to provide a strong point of difference in an increasingly competitive environment, as it signals that the company is making a long-term commitment to a locality.? But he warns ?it needs to be handled very sensitively to avoid giving the impression that is just a cynical marketing ploy.? This requires real commitment on the part of foreign companies as it must convey respect for the community.

In the 2005 National People?s Congress, the government?s Harmonious Society policy changed China?s focus from economic growth to one of societal balance and harmony. Pressure for an intensified focus on CSR was an outcome of this initiative. Article 5 of the 2006 Chinese company law, which requires companies to ?undertake social responsibility? in the course of conducting business, is a legislative example of this policy.

The government?s growing appreciation of the role that corporate CSR can play to complement its central operations, and also to help address corruption, was underlined by Premier Wen Jiabao in 2009: ?Entrepreneurs should not only focus on business and management, they should have the blood of ethics flowing in their bodies?. It has now been embedded in the twelfth five year plan (2011-2015), which seeks ?inclusive growth? rather than growth at any cost.

The massive Sichuan earthquake of 2008 marked a key change in Chinese CSR, generating an unprecedented number of donations and an outpouring of volunteerism. One of the consequences of this earthquake was the establishment of the Chinese Relief and Development Foundation (CRDF) which funds projects including disaster relief initiatives, ?left behind children?, water projects and social enterprise schemes.

According to the Foundation Center there are now almost 4,000 foundations in China. This figure is set to grow as the government continues to encourage active CSR among Chinese and western businesses. Established foundations can provide a CSR service to businesses, allowing them to avoid the paperwork and the various hoops that need to be jumped through. The central government is keen to manage and control the number and work of NGOs in China, and have therefore made it very complicated to set up an NGO. International banks such as UBS, via their Optimus Foundation, also offer an ?out of the box? CSR solution.

China is a complex country and businesses need to have the ability to select NGOs that match their aims and help them to deliver CSR projects which meet a need and help generate goodwill for the business. To quote the IoD?s Responding to Global Risks pamphlet, ?Opportunities, as well as resilience, will emerge from building the right corporate culture?

47,47,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Nevada bark beetle numbers down, but drought could renew infestation - CTV News",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/nevada-bark-beetle-numbers-down-but-drought-could-renew-infestation-1.1953826,"RENO, Nev. -- Scientists say there's been a significant reduction in the amount of Nevada forest under assault from bark beetles and similar bugs, but they fear lingering drought will further weaken trees and make them more susceptible to future attacks.

Nevada Division of Forestry forest health specialist Gene Phillips says aerial surveys show populations of the tree-killing insects plummeted across the state last year compared to 2012 -- from 500,000 acres to only about 50,000.

""These are some pretty dramatic decreases,"" Phillips told the Reno Gazette-Journal.

The trend was seen with the Pinyon Engraver beetle, also called the Ips, which infested some 12,000 acres of forest across Nevada in 2012. Last year, surveys concluded only about 2,500 acres were infested, a drop of more than 80 per cent.

Infestation by mountain pine beetles -- which have decimated forests in Colorado, Idaho, Montana and British Columbia -- also dropped significantly in Nevada, down from 3,650 acres to 1,100, Phillips said.

The most dramatic reduction, nearly 90 per cent, came in the amount of land under assault by the Pinyon needle scale, a pinhead-sized critter shaped like a bean. That infestation fell from an estimated 487,000 acres to only 49,000.

Phillips said it's most likely part of a normal cycle that produces booms and busts in insect populations.

Significant overpopulation of an insect species is often followed by a crash in numbers, he said. Big beetle populations can result in spikes in the number of natural predators like wasps, which then whittle down beetle numbers.

""Insect outbreaks are very cyclical,"" Phillips said. ""They increase dramatically and they decrease dramatically. They increase and then they crash.""

The biggest concern is that a 3-year-old drought may continue, stressing already-stressed trees to make them more susceptible to insect attack.

""It doesn't mean we might not see a dramatic increase this year,"" Phillips said. ""If this drought continues, all tree species in Nevada are going to continue to be stressed and bark beetles sense that. That's when they get going.""

Healthy trees can easily fend off attacks by a limited number of bark beetles by secreting resin and essentially booting the bugs out of their bark. But when trees are stressed by drought, their defence mechanisms are weakened. Beetles can then attack successfully and while doing so, secrete perfume-like pheromones that attract hordes of more aggressive beetles than can overwhelm trees relatively quickly.

Drought has resulted in huge spikes in beetle populations and widespread tree die-offs before, said Gary Blomquist, a biochemist at University of Nevada, Reno who has studied beetle pheromones.

The extensive drought the Reno-Tahoe area experienced from 1987 to 1994 resulted in nearly a third of the trees in the Lake Tahoe Basin being killed by beetles, Blomquist said.

That beetle infestation didn't peak until the drought had lasted four to five years, he said.

""We've actually been very fortunate in this area. We haven't seen that much in the Sierra yet,"" Blomquist said. ""We're going to see more of them.""","Sun, 10 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1953829.1407706889!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['reno', 'renew', 'numbers', 'infestation', 'beetles', 'phillips', 'bark', 'drought', 'nevada', 'trees', 'populations', 'beetle', 'acres']", ,drought

Kurdish rebels have abducted foreigners in the past to draw attention to their cause, but none have come to any harm.

It comes amid talks between Turkish officials and the PKK?s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, which aim to end a three-decade long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In 2013, Kurdish rebels declared a cease-fire and began withdrawing fighters from Turkey into bases in northern Iraq, but the withdrawal came to a halt in September after the PKK accused Turkey of not increasing Kurdish rights as promised.

Currently, there is no ground- or satellite-based global network monitoring soil moisture at a local level.

Farmers, scientists and resource managers can place sensors in the ground, but these only provide spot measurements and are rare across some critical agricultural areas in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Nasa's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission, scheduled to launch in November, will collect the kind of local data agricultural and water managers worldwide need.

SMAP uses two microwave instruments to monitor the top 5 centimetres of soil on Earth's surface.

Together, the instruments create soil moisture estimates with a resolution of about 9 kilometres mapping the entire globe every two or three days.

Although this resolution cannot show how soil moisture might vary within a single field, it will give the most detailed maps yet made.

""Agricultural drought occurs when the demand for water for crop production exceeds available water supplies from precipitation, surface water and sustainable withdrawals from groundwater,"" said Forrest Melton, a research scientist in the Ecological Forecasting Lab at Nasa Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California.

""Based on snowpack and precipitation data in California, by March we had a pretty good idea that by summer we'd be in a severe agricultural drought,"" Melton added.

""But irrigation in parts of India, the Middle East and other regions relies heavily on the pumping of groundwater during some or all of the year,"" Melton said.

Underground water resources are hard to estimate, so farmers who rely on groundwater have fewer indicators of approaching shortfalls than those whose irrigation comes partially from rain or snowmelt.

For these parts of the world where farmers have little data available to help them understand current conditions, SMAP's measurements could fill a significant void.

Some farmers handle drought by changing irrigation patterns. Others delay planting or harvesting to give plants their best shot at success.

Currently, schedule modifications are based mostly on growers' observations and experience. SMAP's data will provide an objective assessment of soil moisture to help with their management strategy.

""If farmers of rain-fed crops know soil moisture, they can schedule their planting to maximise crop yield,"" said Narendra Das, a water and carbon cycle scientist on SMAP's science team at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

""SMAP can assist in predicting how dramatic drought will be, and then its data can help farmers plan their recovery from drought,"" said Das.","Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/images/gadgets/nasa_space_station_ap.jpg,"['data', 'help', 'smap', 'farmers', 'smaps', 'water', 'soil', 'moisture', 'nasas', 'melton', 'combat', 'drought', 'satellite', 'irrigation']", ,drought

After the six people fled the midnight attack in north-western China's Xinjiang region, the wolves killed several farm animals.

The victims were taken to hospital in the nearby city of Urumqi where most required stitches on their hands and face.

It was previously unheard of for humans to be attacked by packs wolves, as they usually steer clear of contact with people.

However, the animals were driven mad by hunger caused by the worst drought in decades in the region, with average rainfall down by a third, affecting nearly a million hectares of crops.

Many of the animals that the wolves might have otherwise fed on have died from lack of food, leading them to turn on the men and women in the village.

The victims were taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Urumqi for urgent treatment

A drought in north-western China killed off most of the wolves' prey, causing the attack

Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have also been left without water and the economic damage is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of pounds.

The drought has brought near-disaster to the Ili River valley that has seen no rainfall in what is the worst drought in 60 years.

The wolf population of China is rapidly decreasing, but there are still approximately 10,000 grey wolves in Xinjiang province, where the attack happened.

Flooding in Santa Ana, California, in 1969. Photo courtesy Flooding in Santa Ana, California, in 1969. Photo courtesy Orange County Archives

As Californians suffer through one of their worst droughts since the state joined the Union, it seems cruel to ponder the devastation that might afflict them if this winter?s rainy season happens to go overboard.

But government planners and emergency managers are paid to prepare themselves - and to prepare us - for the worst. So let?s consider the ARkStorm.

The ARkStorm is a fictional, or more accurately a hypothetical, event that was conjured a few years ago as part of an exercise the U.S. Geological Survey conducted. It asked what would happen if two of the worst rainstorms in the state?s modern history - one from January 1969, the other from February 1986 - chanced to occur back to back.

As you would expect, the answer to that question is ?nothing good.? Well, almost nothing. California?s badly depleted reservoirs would certainly be refilled if the ARkStorm were to strike while the current drought?s effects were still fresh. The extra storage capacity now available in those reservoirs would, at least in some cases, mitigate the inevitable flooding. But the ARkStorm would still be a highly unpleasant experience.

On the assumption that the storm would occur in normal conditions, rather than following an antecedent drought, the USGS study anticipated flooding in nearly every corner of California, with the worst effects in the Central Valley but substantial damage also in southern California, from Los Angeles to San Diego, in the Bay Area and in other coastal and mountain locales. Total property damage, mainly from flooding, would approach $400 billion, of which scarcely more than 5 percent would be covered by insurance. Winds in some coastal locations could gust to 125 miles per hour. As many as 1.5 million Californians might be driven from their homes.

It sounds like the script of a Hollywood disaster film, but the ARkStorm scenario does not require us to believe that a cyclone of unprecedented strength or highly atypical course would blow in from the Pacific Ocean. There would be no mega-hurricane, no man-hunting twister registering F5 on the Fujita scale. Instead, an ?atmospheric ribbon? (the ?AR? in ARkStorm) of moist tropical or subtropical air would be carried into California on a series of more or less ordinary weather fronts, dumping rain at low elevations and even more rain in the mountains, where the mild air would raise freezing levels and cause early season snows to melt and contribute more runoff.

This ribbon of moist air is such a common feature on the West Coast that it has a widely known nickname, the ?Pineapple Express.? The only statistically unusual characteristics in the ARkStorm scenario would be its intensity and its duration. The government scientists who modeled the ARkStorm estimate that this sort of rainmaker strikes California every 100 to 200 years, making it what chief researcher Lucy Jones called ?not an extremely extreme? event.

In fact, the ARkStorm has been compared to the great California flood of 1861-62, which devastated the nascent city of Sacramento and turned much of the Central Valley into a vast inland sea. That winter, rain began falling across much of California around Nov. 8 and continued more or less without letup for some six weeks. A dispatch in The New York Times estimated the damage at around $10 million at the time, or around $230 million in today?s terms. Not too bad, until you consider that the state at that time consisted entirely of small frontier settlements, mining camps, old Spanish missions and untouched wilderness.

The point of a thought exercise like ARkStorm is to help us to better prepare. But how, exactly, would we rationally prepare for a once-in-several-lifetimes event like ARkStorm? The study?s authors talk about hardening infrastructure and taking other costly mitigation steps now, to avoid paying far more costly recovery and rebuilding costs later.

That advice makes sense when the question of preparing for an ARkStorm-level flood is considered in isolation. But life?s events, and the financial investments we make to prepare for them, do not happen in isolation. How much money should California, or the country, divert from public schools or first responders to prepare for ARkStorm? How much from the prevention, containment and mitigation of wildfires or earthquakes, both of which are far more common in the Golden State than massive floods? How much from transportation infrastructure (Hint: They could take every dollar from California?s bullet train project without hurting anyone), or restoring the state?s grossly abused rivers?

These questions don?t have right or wrong answers; they are judgmental, and thus inherently political rather than empirical. I do not fault USGS and collaborating scientists for developing the ARkStorm scenario, or for monitoring it and publicizing it. They contributed valuable information to the public discussion. Yet until an ARkStorm hits, hardly anyone will pay attention to the prospect, if only because nobody alive has ever seen one.

Probably the best chance of doing something to protect against an ARkStorm?s ravages is to do something that is not about ARkStorm at all - like building dams and reservoirs to increase California?s water storage, and aqueducts to move more water from where it falls to where it can be productively consumed. These facilities would come in very handy amid the drought searing the state at the moment, and they would also be valuable when and if the rains return more enthusiastically than Californians might wish.

Unfortunately, this is not a dam-building era. While a few existing structures might conceivably be upgraded, it is hard to even imagine a new reservoir of any significant size getting approved in California (or most other American states) today, let alone getting built before the next ARkStorm comes along.

This is probably a good time to get a great deal on a small boat in California, however. There are not many places where you can use one right now. But if you keep it in your garage, you might be glad to have it next time you have to row to a grocery store.

Following a directive by the commerce ministry, the department of telecommunications (DoT) has set up a committee, which will study the viability of the Chinese subsidy model and submit its report in the next few months.

The ministry had earlier commissioned the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relation (ICRIER) to study innovative incentive schemes in other countries and recommend measures that India could follow. The ministry gave the directive on the basis of this report.

?India?s subsidies in telecom are several years behind those of China and there is a need to synergise product and service development in an integrated way like China has done,? according to the ICRIER report. Subsidy and incentive schemes for the telecom sector in India are at a nascent stage, especially in the areas of product development, indigenisation of technology and research and development (R&D). According to a DoT official, the committee would prepare a detailed report on the possible subsidy schemes that India could replicate or innovate, based on the existing practices in China.

Interest subsidy of three per cent to telecom product makers for export of their products are also on the cards

A blueprint to set up three specific funds, with a combined corpus of Rs 17,500 crore has been finalised

One of such schemes, said the official, the financial support that the Chinese government offers to companies such as Huawei, has helped them to be competitive, while Indian companies lag. The DoT official said incentives like 10-year income-tax holiday, excise waiver and low-cost bank loans are likely to be considered initially. At present, 10 per cent excise duty is levied on domestic telecom equipment producers who are not located in special economic zones. India is projected to import electronic goods worth about $400 billion by 2020, from about $45 billion now. ?A large part of this would be telecom products. We need to reduce this as much possible and we are working towards it,? said the official. Besides imposing tax on import of telecom products, the government needs to look at rationalisation of taxes, tax incentives and developing integrated infrastructure and sale, as has been demanded by the industry for years, according to the ICRIER report.

The proposed concessions, said the official, seeking anonymity, are likely to enable telecom equipment makers competitive against their global counterparts. The government might also look at providing an interest subsidy of three per cent to telecom product makers for export of their products. The government has also finalised a blueprint to set up three specific funds, with a combined corpus of Rs 17,500 crore; to help the telecom sector develop a strong domestic manufacturing base, encourage entrepreneurship and promote R&D. These funds would provide its recipients start-up and angel funding, finance incubation centres and offer soft loans, besides giving interest subsidy to banks lending to telecom companies.

According to a study by research agency Ovum, Indian companies will constitute 6.6 per cent of the global demand for telecommunication equipment in 2014-15. The industry is expected to spend about Rs 46,000 crore on buying telecom equipment, excluding handsets. The bulk of this money will, however, be spent on buying imported equipment, mainly from Europe and China.

The telecom equipment business in India is controlled by five companies ? Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson, Nokia Networks, and Alcatel ? which have financial muscle to heft in big deals. According to the Telecom Systems Design and Manufacturing Association (TSDMA), Indian firms that design and manufacture and also have intellectual property, had a three per cent share of the nearly Rs 50,000-crore telecom equipment market in 2012-13.

Foreign companies that have factories in India would raise the share to 10-12 per cent. But the value added in India is less than 11 per cent, limited to system integration and packaging.

According to the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers? Association, the Indian market for core network equipment, excluding towers and batteries, is worth around Rs 25,000 crore but local firms do not contribute more than Rs 1,000 crore.

According to local telecom equipment makers, Chinese companies get support from their government and Chinese banks have billions of dollars in credit lines for companies buying Chinese equipment. The banks offer credit at two per cent interest, payable in 15-20 years and the interest becomes due only from the fifth year.

In February 2012, the government announced a preference policy in which 30 per cent of the orders of government departments would be reserved for local telecom gear makers, which would have to undertake a minimum value addition of 25 per cent.The policy extended the quota to the private sector, too, asking it to source sensitive equipment from local manufacturers.

You are far less likely to find a fake of Opus One

Maureen Downey reassures us that only certain old vintages of a short list of wines are targets for fakers.

Rudy Kurniawan may be in prison, but hundreds of counterfeit wines are still out there.

The good news is that based in large part on evidence federal investigators recovered from Kurniawan's home-counterfeiting lab, experts now know the wines most likely to be faked.

Maureen Downey, founder of Chai Consulting, is one of the world's leading experts on wine forgeries. She testified for the government in Kurniawan's trial, though she said Wednesday that she has some sympathy for him. Kurniawan was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

""Rudy sold $130 million worth of fake wine because other people told him to,"" says Downey, who blames retailers and auction houses for not taking more care with their goods. ""He's in a prison cell and they're out and living well. And the wines are still out there.""

Downey says she has been involved this year in trying to break up a ring of European counterfeiters who invite people to $10,000 tastings that include many fake wines. She has seen photos on the Internet posted by excited attendees, and noted that the exact same bottle was supposedly emptied months earlier.

""They sell the same bottles over and over again,"" she says.

Reassuringly, Downey says the list of fine wines that counterfeiters like to make is very short. She said has seen counterfeit Screaming Eagle, and Opus One CEO David Pearson said Wednesday he has seen one counterfeit bottle of Opus One.

But the Top 16 Counterfeit Wines are all European.

Here is the list, according to Downey:

Domaine de la Romanée-Conti

Henri Jayer

Domaine Dujac

Château Cheval Blanc

Château Petrus

Château Lafite Rothschild

Château Latour

Château Mouton Rothschild

Château Lafleur

Château Le Pin

Château Latour à Pomerol

Château Rayas

Jaboulet La Chapelle Hermitage

Sassicaia

Soldera Brunello di Montalcino

Bruno Giacosa Barolo



Downey adds that even on that list, only a few vintages have been counterfeited. There may always be a lure for counterfeiters to try to make a fake DRC wine in any vintage, but not so much for the others.

""Lafleur, outside of a couple of vintages, just isn't worth doing,"" Downey said.

Opus One's Pearson said that Château Lafite Rothschild was probably the most-counterfeited wine in China, but that so many fakes have been made that reputable Chinese wine shops are leery of carrying even real Lafite these days. Even with Lafite, some vintages are more likely to be safe than others.

Downey said the best counterfeit wine she ever tasted was a 1964 Lafite that had been sold as a 1961. The counterfeiter had simply scraped off a part of the last number to disguise it as the more valuable vintage. It wasn't a '61, but it was still Lafite.

""That bottle was rocking,"" Downey said.","Fri, 22 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/43/97/Opus-One-Chteau-Lafite-Rothschild-Jaboulet-10004397.jpg,"['counterfeited', 'lafite', 'vintages', 'downey', 'list', 'fake', 'counterfeit', '16', 'wine', 'opus', 'wines', 'seen']", ,none

But the Chinese government's unprecedented decision to investigate Zhou, which potentially paves the way for formal corruption charges, may not be quite the triumph many observers assumed. Perhaps the clearest signal comes from a recent assessment by the man at the helm of the corruption crackdown: Chinese President and Communist Party boss Xi Jinping.

""The two armies of corruption and anti-corruption are at a stalemate,"" Xi reportedly told a closed-door Politburo meeting in late June.

""In my struggle against corruption, I don't care about life or death, or ruining my reputation,"" a state-run newspaper in northeast China quotes him as saying, in remarks that have been described as ""shocking.""

Several state media outlets republished the report, which censors deleted later.

It's a glimpse into the party's inner chambers, and of the strength of internal opposition Xi is likely facing. It's also a sign of a potential backlash against the wider anti-corruption campaign, which is popular with ordinary Chinese fed up with endemic graft.

Until his retirement two years ago, Zhou commanded a vast security apparatus whose budget eclipsed even the military's. Now, he is accused of violating unspecified party rules. Criminal corruption charges could follow.

Observers see Xi as eager to make the anti-graft drive one of his signature policies, and to go at it with a blitzkrieg-like intensity. State media report that officials are being investigated at the rate of 50 a month, including, since February, two officials per month at or above the level of Cabinet minister.

State media have commented that China's leaders are determined to break tacit rules that politicians at the highest level are immune from prosecution, a tradition that has centuries-old roots in Chinese political culture.

But the many remaining corrupt officials ? both high-ranking, powerful ""tigers"" and lower-level ""flies"" ? are unlikely to sit around and wait to be picked off one by one, anti-corruption expert Guo Wenliang told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.

So ""the risk of a joint counterattack by the tigers is very, very great,"" said Guo, who teaches at Zhongshan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.

Among the tactics the ""tigers"" might use, he said, is turning the tables on leaders in charge of the anti-corruption drive ? by gathering evidence of their corruption.

There's no evidence of a counterattack so far. But the fact that it took so long for the government to announce the investigation into Zhou Yongkang suggests to many observers that it ran into stiff resistance.

Every year, China sees thousands of cases of grass-roots unrest, often triggered by official corruption in the provinces. But the threat of a political counteroffensive by corrupt officials recalls the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping famously dire prediction: ""If China runs into trouble, it will come from inside the Communist Party.""

Whether it's the costume dramas with bad production values, the scrubbed and censored documentaries, or the scripted talk shows, Chinese television can be really awful. After the millionth rehash of The Monkey King or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it's no wonder that producers at CCTV, China's state-run television broadcaster, are turning to other sources for inspiration. Taking a page from their American counterparts, reality shows have become a hit in China too. One particular variation of reality TV is extremely popular: prison confessions.

Naw Kham was a Burmese rebel turned drug kingpin. He was so effective in his land grabs and so loved by the populace of the Golden Triangle, where opium and heroin supported local livelihoods, that the Chinese authorities considered dropping a bomb from a drone to kill him. He earned the sting of Chinese public opinion when he killed a crew of Chinese sailors (who were probably drug mules working for one of Naw Kham's rivals). When he was finally captured, his trial was televised. The camera didn't pan away from him until he was led away to be executed by lethal injection.

Viewers at home, loved it, talked about it, and blogged about it, posting comments like the one above from China.com, which translates to, ""Naw Kham needs to die. Thirteen Chinese sailors [who were killed in the Mekong River Massacre] can't rest in peace."" The Naw Kham sensation struck such a chord that it paved the way for a new wave of popular television broadcasts.

One year ago, VICE reported on Eastern Lightning, a quasi-Christian cult in China with violent teachings and a mandate to defeat ""the Great Red Dragon"" (read: the Communist Party of China). In late May, Zhang Lidong, a member of Eastern Lightning, beat a woman to death in a McDonald's in eastern China, prompting national outrage as the cell-phone video of the incident went viral. Within days, Zhang, along with four other members of the cult who were present at the beating, were apprehended by Chinese law enforcement. Zhang was put in front of a camera so he could confess his crimes, even though he went on delirious rants about his victim being a ""demon and evil spirit."" His trial, however, did not commence until August 21.

It's not just hard criminals who are put on TV while wearing orange prison vests. Guo Meimei was an online sensation, and has been dubbed China's Paris Hilton. She grabbed hold of national attention in 2011 when she uploaded pictures of her Maserati and Lamborghini, even though she claimed to be a manager of the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC). It was later revealed that she was not actually employed by RCSC, but was the mistress of a man whose business was a fundraising partner of the organization. As rumors of embezzlement were afloat, donations to RCSC plummeted, severely affecting the aid work that they do in the earthquake-prone Sichuan province, as well as relief provided in other areas suffering from drought or flooding. Unbothered that her vanity was stemming the flow of much-needed aid to families who have lost all their possessions and homes, Guo continued to post pictures of beds of cash and hundreds of thousands of dollars in casino chips used in her high stakes gambling in Macau.

Last month, Guo Meimei was arrested for placing illegal bets during the FIFA World Cup. She too appeared on air with a confession, again without a trial. On national television, she talked about her gambling and said that she made money by charging men to spend the night with them, never taking less than $17,000 per encounter.

The internet lit up with replies, like the bloodthirsty comment below from Baidu, which translates to, ""I strongly suggest that we execute this nation-crumbling bitch after she confesses. If she doesn't go, it will be disastrous. The key is that she sets an example for vain women.""

Individuals who hit the Chinese government's political nerves are given the same treatment. Gao Yu is a journalist, press freedom advocate, and political analyst. As June 4 approached, marking the 25th anniversary of the Tianamen Square Massacre, she vanished. Having previously spent a total of seven years in jail for her writing?the charge was ""publishing state secrets""?friends of the 70-year-old Gao knew that she was in police custody. Shortly after her disappearance, Gao Yu was seen on CCTV, faced blurred out but her identity revealed. She ""confessed"" that her actions ""harmed the national interest,"" and that her actions were very wrong, though it is unclear what exactly she did was wrong. On air, she pleaded guilty and said she ""accepts her lesson."" None of those statements reflect decades of democracy and press freedom advocacy, or the beliefs of a UNESCO World Press Freedom Prize laureate.

Many other high profile inmates have been put on screen before their trials, all admitting to crimes and repenting their sins. Some have even been shown with marks on their bodies, prompting allegations of coercion and torture.

This type of public confession has its roots in a tumultuous period of modern China. When Mao was leading the country into economic ruin, struggle sessions were common. At these sessions, political rivals and capitalist roaders were publicly humiliated, berated, and abused before crowds of up to 100,000 until they denounced their capitalist ways, at times leading to execution. The struggle sessions were among the ugliest, most reprehensible things that happened to China under Mao, and sowed the seeds of unquestioning reverence that still plague the population today.

Fast forward to 2013, when Xi Jinping assumed the Chinese presidency. He barreled ahead in his fight against corruption, initiating a ""criticism and self-criticism"" campaign that targets government officials who took bribes, hunting both ""tigers and flies"" within the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. Taking down high profile criminals and rivals, and having them publicly denounce their old ways, also fits the campaign's designs. At the same time, state media has been promoting Xi's image more aggressively than any other leader since Mao. The cult of personality is back in vogue, and a strongman leader needs diversions from real problems like unsafe food, impossible urban real estate prices, and a rapidly growing wealth gap.

Last year, the Chinese Supreme Court ruled against extracting confessions through torture, but these broadcasts are telling a different story. Scapegoating is a common tactic of authoritarian regimes, but the blend of high profile confessions and repentance is potent. There is much power contained in the image of a well-known, notorious, hateable person placed in handcuffs, locked behind bars, denouncing previous beliefs and admitting wrongs, humbling herself within a cloud of prostration. Whereas the struggle sessions of the Mao era had thousands of attendees, the televised confessions of today are beamed onto the screens of over a billion people.

The schadenfreude that viewers express online is torrential, but if trial by television ever loses its popularity, the Chinese have a fall back: IS is giving them plenty of source material. The awful, unwatchable video of James Foley's execution just made it onto a massive public screen in Beijing, which perfectly fits China's desire to project a harmonious self-image to its own citizenry while portraying global chaos.

The distasteful has evolved into the surreal, and viewer ratings are only going up.","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.vice.com/vice/images/articles/meta/2014/08/27/televised-confessions-are-chinas-new-favorite-reality-tv-1413237852605.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MXhoO2NlbnRlcixjZW50ZXImcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6KiZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoq,"['reality', 'television', 'high', 'zhang', 'tv', 'national', 'taking', 'mao', 'chinas', 'china', 'televised', 'sessions', 'trial', 'chinese', 'favorite', 'confessions']", ,flood_and_drought

@sarmje

Water utilities have been at the center of international political unrest this year as a result of the ""water war"" in Crimea.

""Crimeans voted to break off from Ukraine and join Russia. Their vote represents the re-establishment of a historic cultural relationship. But take away the emotional side of the Crimean referendum and reality hits home -- the economic challenges that are yet to knock on their door,"" CNN reported.

Water service is among the major challenges.

""According to Ukrainian news agencies, [Ukraine's government] has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85 percent of fresh water from this canal, which was built in [between] 1961 and 1971,"" ITAR TASS reported.

That creates an expensive issue for Crimea, and for Russia, its new homeland. It will take up to $417 million to solve the problem of water service for Crimea, the report said.

The water problem emerged as a central front in the tug-of-war between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

""Satellite images show that [Ukraine] is deliberately trying to cut off Crimea peninsula's water supply by building a dam. In the meantime Russian scientists are trying to find ways to supply Crimea with fresh water,"" RT reported.

The result is an all-out ""water war.""

""Amid the water war between Ukraine and Russia; the former and the current occupiers of the Muslim Autonomous Republic of Crimea, harvest in the devastated Muslim country has been despoiled, but the water war may take more victims, with two major Crimean chemical plants near closure because of a water shortage,"" OnIslam reported, citing a Crimean official.

Crimea formerly depended on Ukraine for water, Pravda reported this month.

Ukraine ""provided up to 85 percent of fresh water supplies to the Crimea through the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper River. The water was used to irrigate farmland. However, after the reunification of the Crimea with Russia, the new authorities of Ukraine completely cut water supplies from the North Crimean Canal to the republic,"" the report said.

Russia is trying to solve the water problem.

""The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation delivers fresh drinking water to the Crimea from artesian wells,"" the report said.

""Experts from the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources are developing ways to supply fresh water to the Crimea from the Kuban River in the Krasnodar region to the North Crimean Canal which now receives limited water-flow, as Kiev tightens the lid,"" RT reported.

Russian official Dmitry Kirillov told reporters that the country is exploring its options.

?As one of options of providing the peninsula with water, we are considering an option of drawing water supply from the Kuban River and channeling it through the Strait of Kerch to the end portion of North Crimean Canal,? he said, per RT.

Desalination has also been viewed as a potential solution.

""Russia is debating the construction of desalination plants in Crimea to solve the peninsula?s water supply problem,"" RIONOVOSTI reported, citing a Russian official.

""[New] desalination technology and desalination plants could be used in Crimea, because there are many underground salt lakes on the peninsula. Singapore uses desalinized water for irrigation and for technical purposes; the same can be done in Crimea,"" a Russian official said.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/sites/favicons/wol-favicon.ico,"['ukraine', 'russia', 'supply', 'canal', 'russian', 'crimea', 'water', 'fresh', 'results', 'conflict', 'ukrainerussia', 'north', 'crimean', 'war']", ,none

62,62,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Why almonds are bad news for the environment - Quartz,https://qz.com/257341/why-almonds-are-bad-news-for-the-environment/,"This week another large study added to the body of known cardiovascular benefits of eating almonds. Every ounce eaten daily was associated with a 3.5% decreased risk of heart disease ten years later. Almonds are already known to help with weight loss and satiety, help prevent diabetes, and potentially ameliorate arthritis, inhibit cancer-cell growth, and decrease Alzheimer?s risk. A strong case could be made that almonds are, nutritionally, the best single food a person could eat.

Almonds recently overtook peanuts as the most-eaten ?nut? (seed, technically) in the United States, and Americans now consume more than 10 times as many almonds as we did in 1965. The meteoric rise of the tree-nut is driven in part by vogue aversions to meat protein and to soy and dairy milks, and even by the unconscionable rise of the macaron. But the main popularity driver is almonds? increasingly indelible image as paragons of nutrition.

This week?s research, led by the eminent David Jenkins, professor and research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto, suggests that in addition to almonds? idyllic monounsaturated fats, the cardiac benefits may be due to vitamin E, fiber, antioxidant phytochemicals (phenols, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and phytosterols), or arginine?and that?s just a partial list of almondic virtues.

This follows a massive study released last fall from Harvard that found eating nuts decreased mortality rates by 20%, and it builds on Jenkins? work done more than 10 years ago which suggested, in the American Heart Association?s journal Circulation, ?Almonds used as snacks in the diets of hyperlipidemic subjects significantly reduce coronary heart disease risk factors.?

That?s all wonderful, but coverage of almond-nutrition research necessarily affords a narrow vantage on health. It seems like every day someone asks me to dichotomize a health trend: good or bad. Almonds are a great example of why I?m terrible at doing that.

It was around the time of Jenkins? prior study, and amid the broader ?actually, fat isn?t categorically bad? movement in the US that almonds really got traction. We eat about the same amounts of other nuts as we did decades ago, but almond consumption singularly soared. (Pistachios are on the rise, but they are nowhere near almonds.)

The only state that produces almonds commercially is California, where cool winter and mild springs let almond trees bloom; 82% of the world?s almonds come from California. The US is the leading consumer of almonds by far. California so controls the almond market that the Almond Board of California?s website is almonds.com. Its twitter handle is @almonds. (Almost everything it tweets is about almonds.)

California?s almonds constitute a lucrative multibillion dollar industry in a fiscally tenuous state that is also, as you know, in the middle of the worstdrought in recent history. The drought is so dire that experts are considering adding a fifth level to the four-tiered drought scale. That?s right: D5. But each almond requires 1.1 gallons of water to produce, as Alex Park and Julia Lurie at Mother Jones reported earlier this year, and 44% more land in California is being used to farm almonds than was 10 years ago.

That raises ecological concerns like, as NPR?s Alistair Bland reported last weekend, that thousands of endangered king salmon in northern California?s Klamath River are threatened by low water levels because water is being diverted to almond farms. Despite the severe drought, as of June 30, California?s Department of Agriculture projected that almond farmers will have their largest harvest to date. If more water is not released into the river soon, Bland reported, the salmon will be seriously threatened by a disease called gill rot. If there?s one disease I never want to get, it?s gill rot.

Even as almond production increases in California, demand is driving prices ever higher. Other producers are getting into the game. In England, for example, the cost of almonds has almost doubled over the past five years, and sales of almond milk increased 79% in a year. ?The value of each kernel has gone up dramatically, and growers are looking for the best return on their investment, so they?re still planting almond trees at an alarming rate,? one farmer told BBC?s Peter Bowes. ?If you decided to plant an orchard right now, you would wait two years for available root stock to actually plant.?

The crop is so valuable in the UK, Bowes reported in Feb., there had been a spate of thefts and missing almond trucks. He wrote, ?Nut-nappers, as they have become known, have been making off with produce by the lorryload.? A truck loaded with nuts can be worth more than $160,000.

Almond theft is not a major issue in California, but as almond skeptic Tom Philpott put it in Mother Jones, the ecological implications of almond farming during a drought are ?potentially dire.? Over-pumping of aquifers threatens infrastructure like roads, which stand to collapse into sunken ground. Farmers can fallow vegetable fields during droughts, but almond trees need steady supplies of water.

California?s almond industry is also completely reliant on honeybees to pollinate its almond trees. The industry requires 1.4 million bee colonies, according to the USDA, most of which are brought to the state from across the country. Because of colony collapse disorder, honeybees are a commodity. The almond farmers? requirements represent approximately 60% of the country?s managed colonies. This year many of the mercenary pollinating bees brought to California died due to exposure to pesticides.

Anyway, when I buy almonds, I don?t think about having a hand in killing bees or salmon, or getting someone?s truck stolen or collapsing a road. It?s just a jumble of what?s ?good for me,? what I feel like eating, and how much things cost. Michael Specter?s feature on GMOs in last week?s New Yorker gets into how seven billion people on the planet will be 10 billion by the end of the century, and feeding that population might well be the greatest challenge to humanity ever. Thinking about going easy on almonds is sort of analogous to GMO dilemmas or buying organic, where the point isn?t really nutrition, it?s environmental consciousness and sustainability, which always come back to water. Thinking about that side of food makes it hard to write about nutrition in isolation. Anyway, almonds are good for our hearts.

63,63,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Lebanon sceptical of ?save water? effort - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2014/8/24/lebanon-sceptical-of-save-water-effort,"Lebanese campaign to save water amid a shortage is unlikely to work without government regulation, experts say.

Beirut, Lebanon ? Plastered across billboards, flashing across television screens, and splashed on pamphlets and stickers, a new message is suddenly everywhere you look in Lebanon: ?If you love me, save me some water.?

This year, in an attempt to mitigate a growing water crisis, the Ministry of Energy and Water has encouraged people to turn off their taps and conserve precious drops. But according to Lebanon?s National Water Sector Strategy (NWSS), which was adopted by the government in 2012, only approximately 10 percent of water connections in Lebanon are metered, meaning that the overwhelming majority of people pay the same rate, regardless of how much water they use.

So as people in Beirut continue to hose down sidewalks, wash their cars, take long showers, and flush their stairwells instead of mopping, the awareness campaign has left many wondering: What?s the incentive?

?A ?- shop anyway, so why would I save water when I pay the same rate per year??]

shop anyway, so why would I save water when I pay the same rate per year??]

?A lot of the time we don?t have any water at my [vegetable] shop anyway, so why would I save water when I pay the same rate per year?? said Fadi Hammoud, a shopkeeper in the affluent neighbourhood of Achrafieh in east Beirut. ?This all comes down to government mismanagement and, really, without a proper government, what are we meant to do? Water and electricity issues have long been a problem for us.?

The lack of metering also gives no incentive for ?water establishments to increase water supply or spend more on operation and maintenance? as water deliveries generate no extra revenue?, according to the Water Sector Assistance Strategy for 2012-2016, published by the World Bank.

Nadim Farajalla, associate professor of environmental hydrology at the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences at the American University of Beirut (AUB), said that while the campaign is well-intentioned, it is not educational.

?The government has no authority to prohibit wasteful use; [that?s why we need] legislation to allow water establishments and the Ministry of Energy and Water to control water consumption at all levels,? he told Al Jazeera.

?An advertisement campaign asking people to save water without actual instructions as to how to do that is useless. We cannot have financial incentives, as there are no metres at the household level in most areas of Lebanon, thus no one knows how much each household is using or abusing. If you can?t measure it, you can?t tax it.?

However, Randa Nemer, an advisor to Energy and Water Minister Arthur Nazarian, said the campaign was not about financial incentives. ?We are not telling people to save water so they pay less or more, the idea of the campaign is for children to tell their parents to save water not only for now, but for the future generation,? said Nemer, adding that she didn?t have exact figures on how much water Lebanon uses annually.

?It?s not about money, it?s about saving water for the coming generation,? she said.

RELATED: Beirut?s development caters to the affluent

Water scarcity has long been a concern in Lebanon, fuelled by a lack of precipitation, climate change, and mismanagement of the sector. This year, Lebanon experienced an unusually dry winter, where precipitation during the rainy season was half the seasonal average of 800mm, prompting widespread water shortages. This drought was also exacerbated by the influx of more than one million Syrian refugees into the country.

Aside from the awareness campaign, the ministry also has said it would dig more state-owned wells and erect more dams ?where possible?. The new wells are expected to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 cubic metres of water per day.

But Lebanese water resources expert Claude Tabbal, who has worked on water projects in partnership with the United Nations, said that digging new wells was not the answer to the water shortage.

?[The ?- over-exploitation of wells leads to the abstraction of [an] excessive amount of water, putting pressure on the aquifer and leading to seawater intrusion and the degradation of the quality of water.?]

over-exploitation of wells leads to the abstraction of [an] excessive amount of water, putting pressure on the aquifer and leading to seawater intrusion and the degradation of the quality of water.?]

?Digging more wells is particularly dangerous [in coastal places] like Beirut and all other cities on the coast because the practise and over-exploitation of wells leads to the abstraction of [an] excessive amount of water, putting pressure on the aquifer and leading to seawater intrusion and the degradation of the quality of water,? he told Al Jazeera.

?This is confirmed by the elevated total dissolved solids and chloride levels in well water samples. Today, everybody in Beirut is complaining about the salty taste of water [from] the tanks.?

This reality is evident in the seaside suburb of Hamra, one of the commercial hubs of Beirut. ?Hamra has had water shortages throughout the summer, but at my house we haven?t because we had a well underneath,? said an AUB student who lives in Hamra, who did not want to be named.

?If you don?t have a well underneath your apartment block then you?re [out of luck]; If you run out of water, you order a roof tank. But our groundwater is so salty because we?re now hitting the seawater. It?s gross,? the student said.

Farajalla said this was occurring because wells are being pumped at a higher rate than the recharge rate from snowmelt and other filtration in coastal aquifers allows, meaning that seawater is entering the wells. He said the construction of dams is a good long-term approach that would satisfy the need by capturing run-off during the wet season for use during the dry season.

?In the short-term we need to stop wasteful use of water, prohibit the use of fresh water in all water parks and restrict irrigation of annual crops, leaving water only for perennial crops such as trees and vines,? he said, adding that another long-term solution was to improve water conveyance and distribution systems so that leaks are minimised or eliminated.

THE STREAM: Water wars?

But it is not only those in Beirut who are feeling frustrated by a lack of water. Cristiano Pasini, country director of the UN specialised agency for promoting inclusive and sustainable industrial development in Lebanon (UNIDO), said Syrian refugees throughout the country were suffering.

Approximately 27 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon lack access to potable water [AP]

?Unfortunately the problem of water in Lebanon is much wider than industrial use,? he said, explaining that 27 percent of Syrian refugees lacked access to potable water.

According to UNHCR Lebanon?s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene update, many refugees have taken to drinking unfiltered water because of soaring temperatures and scarce water supply, which has put them at risk of water-borne diseases.

Farmers have also been hard hit by the water crisis. According to a report produced by AUB and the American University of Cairo earlier this year, more than 80 percent of farmers in Lebanon?s Bekaa Valley said they were facing water shortages, exacerbated by the country?s close proximity to Syria, which affects the quantity and quality of water available to the villages.

The report recommended that more efficient irrigation infrastructure and practises be introduced in the Bekaa, given that the area is the country?s largest water consumer and has very limited metering. And as the Lebanese continue to struggle through the last few weeks of summer, many are hoping the rainy season will bring just that.

In fact, many make comebacks. An investigation by The Beijing News found that out of 85 officials who had lost their positions over the past six years, more than one-third eventually returned to public-sector jobs.



Photo

The report focused on officials who had lost their jobs as a result of ?sudden incidents? ? deadly accidents or embarrassing scandals that became widely followed news stories. It also examined those with ?work-style problems,? referring to the exposure of embarrassing personal behavior, often in sex videos, and with ?discipline problems,? such as misusing public funds.

Prison time generally means the end of an official?s career. But for those who are merely dismissed, there is ample opportunity to bounce back.



Some of the most prominent officials who returned after high-profile dismissals served in the Hebei city of Shijiazhuang, the center of a tainted baby formula scandal in 2008 that left six infants dead and sickened an estimated 300,000. The mayor of Shijiazhuang, Ji Chuntang, took up a position in 2011 with the Hebei Department of Industry and Information three years after losing his job for trying to cover up the adulterated milk scandal. Wu Xianguo, the Shijiazhuang Communist Party secretary, resumed work in 2013 with a Hebei provincial work group on rural issues.

Perhaps the most charmed of the reincarnated officials is the former mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong. He lost that job in 2003 for his role in covering up the outbreak of the respiratory illness SARS. In 2007 he was named acting governor of Shanxi Province, then fired a year later following deadly mudslides. In 2010 he found a high-level position once again, as the deputy secretary of a Communist Party Central Committee department that manages the work of cadres nationwide.

One type of bad behavior, however, seems impossible to recover from: sex scandals. Following the 2012 exposure of Lei Zhengfu, a local official in the city of Chongqing who was seen in a hidden camera clip having sex with an 18-year-old mistress, 27 officials have been toppled by videos of their indiscretions, and not one has returned to office. If those officials were excluded from the overall count of dismissals, the proportion of those who returned to official positions would rise to about half, the newspaper said.","Tue, 12 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/12/world/12sino-officials01/12sino-officials01-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg,"['disappear', 'work', 'returned', 'secretary', 'hebei', 'videos', 'officials', 'scandals', 'dont', 'china', 'lost', 'sex', 'shijiazhuang', 'dismissed']", ,none

Alentejo in Portugal was the rather surprising wine destination choice of USA Today's readers

A list of the world's best wine destinations is more notable for its omissions than its inclusions.

A list of top wine tourist spots that doesn?t include France? Quelle horreur!

Nevertheless, that?s what USA Today readers served up when given the chance to vote on their top 10 wine destinations from a shortlist provided by two wine experts.

Kerry Woolard and Frank Pulice came up with a shortlist and readers promptly voted Portugal?s Alentejo as the place they?d most like to visit.

""Boutique wineries, full service hotels, great restaurants and of course terrific wines make for a great wine travel experience,"" Woolard enthused.

The newspaper was clearly taken with Alentejo?s charms.

""The food in Alentejo is rustic and authentic, taking full advantage of the agrarian lifestyle in the area,"" it reported.

""You won't find a developed coastline of hotels; instead Alentejo's beaches ? considered some of the most dramatic and beautiful in Europe ? require visitors to seek out lodging in independent guest houses. The Alentejo is like a trip back in time for wine lovers. The Faro and Lisbon airports are each less than two hours away.""

It wasn?t just France that was ignored. Spain, Germany and South Africa were also missing from the list, while Napa only made it as far as number six and the fabled Italian wine region of Tuscany scraped in to seventh place.

Canada?s Okanagan Valley, Maipo in Chile, Marlborough New Zealand and Croatia rounded out the top five.

Okanagan was lauded for its outstanding natural beauty as much as its wines, while Maipo won praise for being so close to the Chilean capital of Santiago. Marlborough?s Sauvignon Blanc was mentioned, as was its seafood, while the experts recommended seeing Croatia?s vineyards by sailboat.

The vote was part of the newspaper?s ongoing 10 Best Awards.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/43/63/vineyards-in-Okanagan-Canada-10004363-1407715548.jpg,"['shortlist', 'best', 'list', 'alentejo', 'maipo', 'figure', 'usa', 'regions', 'fails', 'readers', 'france', 'wine', 'vote', 'wines', 'woolard', 'worlds']", ,none

Twenty-one people have been convicted by a court in Hebei Province in connection with the murder of four miners in a scam to collect compensation money.

The killings followed the plot of the 2003 Chinese film ?Blind Shaft,? in which con men kill workers and then claim to be family members to extort mine owners. In the decade since the film came out, there have been a handful of similar incidents in China, and the brutal schemes have come to be known as ?Blind Shaft cases.?

The Handan Intermediate People?s Court handed down death sentences on Thursday for five of the accused, and the remaining defendants were given prison terms of up to 15 years, the court announced on its Sina Weibo microblog.



The authorities say the defendants, who were mostly from Sichuan Province, recruited men to work under false names in Hebei mines. They beat to death four men while they worked underground, fabricated evidence to make the deaths look like workplace accidents and then claimed to be relatives of the deceased to receive compensation money, the court said. They reportedly extorted 1.8 million renminbi, or nearly $300,000, in 2011 and 2012.

One of the accused, a 35-year-old woman named Wang Zhengxiu, befriended a target, 31-year-old Li Zihua, and urged him to take up a job as a miner, the Guangdong-based South Reviews magazine reported in July. The scam began to fall apart after Mr. Li was killed in 2012 when a group of the suspects beat him to death and then detonated explosives near his body to make his death appear accidental. The mine owners called the police because the people who claimed to be the dead man?s family seemed suspicious. The police later said the suspects did not seem sad, showed little interest in the cause of their loved one?s death and were quick to lower their compensation demands to end the matter quickly, the magazine reported.

China?s mines are notoriously dangerous, with more than 1,049 reported deaths in coal mines alone last year. Labor advocates say the pressure to reduce fatalities means that not all mine accidents are reported. And some mines operate illegally, adding to the pressure to cover up workplace incidents. Those factors all help criminals pull off the murder-for-compensation scam.

The mines of Liangwa village in Henan Province saw at least three such cases between 2005 and 2007.

In 2009, four people in Beijing were convicted in the death of a man in an illegal mine in the city?s Fangshan District. The mine owner refused to compensate them and fled. The suspects then sought to report the fabricated ?mine accident? to the local government, at which point their story began to collapse.

Three men were convicted by a court in Zhejiang Province in 2011 of throwing another mine worker down an elevator shaft. The chief suspect, Yu Yong, was sentenced to death.

But he denied taking any inspiration from the film. ?The idea to kill someone, pretend to be his kin and swindle the boss, that came at random,? Mr. Yu told a court in Wenzhou.","Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/07/world/07sino-coalminor/07sino-coalminor-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg,"['reported', '21', 'guilty', 'shaft', 'death', 'mines', 'men', 'province', 'convicted', 'film', 'chinese', 'court', 'echoing', 'suspects', 'murders']", ,none

Some neighborhoods have had no water for over three months. Women and children have to walk miles to nearest water source. Population demand water ""at least once a week"". Profit to be made from water attracts criminal underworld.

Karachi (AsiaNews / Agencies) - The exponential growth of the urban population and the aging of a now defunct hydration system has led to a dramatic water supply crisis in Karachi, Pakistan's most densely populated metropolis. According to experts, the problem is expected to worsen with the passage of time, and the anger and discontent of the southern city's citizens is rising, especially in the suburbs. In the slums people have set fire to tires and thrown stones at passing vehicles, chanting the slogan: ""We want water at least once a week.""

Unlike other cities, where the situation is less dramatic, people in Karachi go days without getting water from city trucks, sometimes forcing them to use groundwater contaminated with salt. The recent drought has contributed to worsening the situation and, in a city of 18 million people, the situation is destined to worsen.

Over the past three months, inhabitants of a little town called Yasmeen Islam, denounce that they have not received ""a single drop of water"" and protest ""is our last resort."" But the situation is not much better even in the richest districts, where water is supplied through tankers that fill the tanks only on certain days of the week.

Karachi draws most of its reserves from the River Indus, about two billion liters per day, and another 1.4 billion gallons from Hub dam in neighboring Baluchistan. However, in recent years the drought has dealt a blow to stocks and today only half of the daily requirement (4.5 billion liters) can be met.

The water business has attracted the interest of the underworld, in a volume of business that is multiplying with the passage of time and the worsening of the problem. The heads of the municipalities are trying to build another channel to draw from the Indus River, but even if the project gets the go ahead it will take at least four years for it to be completed and fully operational.

Meanwhile, citizens must invest more and more resources or travel increasingly longer distances for their daily water needs. Aisha Saleem, an elderly resident of Karachi, says that even the water they receive from institutions is salty. ""Every day, women and children - she adds - are forced to walk miles and miles to get water.""","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/PAKISTAN_-_crisi_idrica.jpg,"['worsening', 'population', 'water', 'karachi', 'billion', 'system', 'women', 'miles', 'walk', 'shortages', 'revolt', 'situation']", ,drought
70,70,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,California lawmakers considering historic shift in groundwater policy - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-water-20140810-story.html,"As California continues to endure a calamitous lack of water from the sky, the state could, for the first time, start to regulate water drawn from the ground.

Groundwater regulation has been politically poisonous since the state?s founding. But lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown?s administration are hoping to capitalize on the current parched conditions, and cautious cooperation from once-resistant interest groups, to pass a plan for a groundwater management system by the end of the month.

?This falls under the category of: Never let a crisis go to waste,? said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), an author of the legislation.

The drought has propelled water policy to the top of the Legislature?s agenda in the final month of its session. Brown and lawmakers are also negotiating revisions to a water bond measure scheduled for the November ballot. They?re at odds over how much borrowing voters should be asked to approve to pay for such projects as storage and groundwater cleanup.

Meanwhile, the drought?s effects have been buffered somewhat by groundwater reserves.

A study released last month by UC Davis found the state?s economy has taken a $2.2-billion hit this year because of the drought ? costs that would have been much higher except for increased pumping of groundwater. Researchers said increased reliance on underground reserves made up for as much as 75% of the water lost from surface sources.

There are no statewide rules on how much water can be taken from the ground. Since the Gold Rush days, groundwater has been considered a property right; landowners are entitled to what?s beneath them.

As the availability of water from lakes and rivers has become more inconsistent because of drought or environmental regulation, groundwater extraction has increased. That has caused more water to be removed from some underground basins, especially in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, than is being replaced.

?What we?re doing with groundwater is an equivalent to deficit spending,? said Lester Snow, director of the nonprofit group California Water Foundation and a former state secretary for natural resources. ?Something bad is going to happen? in the long run, he said.

Some water districts have started managing underground sources on their own; others have become regulated after long and costly court battles. But some key basins remain unregulated, and there are substantial gaps in information about the state?s groundwater supply.

The Department of Water Resources estimates the state?s wells number from 1 million to 2 million ? a significant variance.

?That shows you how out of whack the system is,? said Jay Ziegler, director of policy of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.

The legislative proposal contained in two identical bills would direct local agencies to create plans by 2020 for managing their groundwater. The plans could be customized to fit local needs, and the state could step in to enforce them if local agencies aren?t up to the task.

?We do recognize that local management is by far preferable,? said state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), an author of one of the bills.

The governor?s office has helped draft the proposal, buoying its prospects. If the legislation passes, it would mark a monumental shift for California, the only Western state that does not regulate groundwater.

?California hasn?t attempted to change water law this dramatically in 100 years,? said Dave Puglia, a senior vice president of Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.

Past efforts to enact statewide groundwater management have fizzled. Resistance remains, particularly among agricultural interests that are still deeply suspicious of state interference. That has become more pronounced as farmers have increasingly relied on groundwater for their crops.

Among other concerns, the agriculture interests, which hold substantial sway in the Capitol, fear that a new regulatory system could affect property values.

?If the legislation enacted creates even a perception of a loss of access to the groundwater that was accessible before, my land value goes down,? Puglia said.

The farming group wants limitations on when and how forcefully the state could intervene to enact local plans.

It is significant that farm groups are even negotiating, the legislation?s supporters say. And other key interests have changed their stance on state involvement.

?Ten years ago, we were for local control [of groundwater resources] no matter what,? said Tim Quinn, executive director of the Assn. of California Water Districts. ?Now, we?re for local control ? so long as the locals are managing responsibly.?

71,71,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Drought conditions plague Aandhra Pradesh almost every 5 years - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Drought-conditions-plague-Aandhra-Pradesh-almost-every-5-years/articleshow/40018979.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM/ HYDERABAD: Even as the two states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana continue to reel from a rainfall deficit this monsoon, weathermen say it is in keeping with the pattern of a drought-like situation every five years in the state of unified AP. Rainfall received so far by the two states during the ongoing southwest monsoon seems to be only lending more credence to this theory. Though the southwest monsoon season usually arrives around June 1, this year its onset was announced only on June 19 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), but the rainfall began in earnest only in the second week of July.

According to K Sitaram, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad centre, drought conditions have been reported in 1982, 1987, 2002, 2004, 2009 and now in 2014 in AP. ""Except for 2002 and 2004, and the 1990's the gap between two consecutive droughts in AP has been five years,"" Sitaram said.

""Comparing the rainfall as on August 9 of 2013 and 2014, it was deficient this year whereas it was excess in Telangana and normal in Andhra Pradesh last year. The main reasons behind the situation include the weak monsoon and unfavorable low pressures in the Bay of Bengal. Four low pressures formed in the Bay in July and one in the first week of August had no impact in the two states,"" Sitaram said.

The nine districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh should have received 305.6 mm rainfall as on Saturday in the ongoing monsoon season (June 1 to August 9), but received only 194.8 mm, resulting in a deficiency of 36%. Similarly, the four Rayalaseema districts should have received 189.5 mm rainfall in the season, but received only 135.7 mm, registering a 28% deficiency. However, the 10 districts of Telangana witnessed the highest deficiency of 49% in the season by receiving only 221.5 mm rainfall against its normal rainfall of 436.7 mm.

While Sitaram said the deficient rainfall this year was bound to have a negative impact on agriculture, power generation and drinking water supply, he was unable to pinpoint the reasons behind this peculiar pattern. ""We are unable to pin down the reasons behind the periodic drought conditions in AP. Earlier we had assumed that droughts prevailed due to the impact of the El Nino, a prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean surface temperatures as compared to the average values. However, that assumption did not hold true for some droughts because there was no El Nino effect observed in those years. Now, we are studying the presence of any negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or Indian Nino, which is an irregular oscillation of sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean. The negative phase causes cooler sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean as compared to the east part of ocean,"" Sitaram said.

Meanwhile, other senior weathermen from the Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC), Visakhapatnam, said this year's monsoon witnessed hot weather conditions. The temperatures also remained higher over the past five days due to clear skies. On Sunday, Rentachintala registered a maximum temperature of 38.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 35 degree Celsius, Tirupati clocked 38.4 degree Celsius, Machilipatnam 37 degree Celsius and Visakhapatnam Airport registered 34.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 33 degree Celsius, the CWC officials added.

This May and June, for example, were the hottest ones on record for the planet. Storms and droughts occur with increasing frequency. Glaciers are rapidly retreating, portending rising seas that could eventually displace hundreds of millions of people.

Effective countermeasures now could actually ward off many of these threats at relatively modest cost. Yet despite a robust scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are at the root of the problem, legislation to curb them has gone nowhere in Congress. In response, President Obama has proposed stricter regulations on electric utilities, which some scientists warn may be too little, too late.

Why aren?t we demanding more forceful action? One reason may be the frequent incantation of a motley collection of myths, each one rooted in bad economics:

Myth 1: The enormous uncertainty of climate science argues for a wait-and-see strategy.

The claim here is that reducing greenhouse gases would be a wasted expense if climate change ends up causing only minor problems. But uncertainty cuts two ways. Things might not be as bad as expected, but they could also be much worse.

In other domains, uncertainty doesn?t counsel inaction. Few people, for example, recommend disbanding the military simply because adversaries might not invade. In any event, many scientists now believe that storms and droughts caused by climate change are already causing enormous damage, so all that remains uncertain is how much worse things will get. And as Robert Shiller has written in this space, when the risk is as high as it now seems, economics tells us that insuring against worst-case calamities is prudent.","Sat, 02 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/business/3-VIEW/3-VIEW-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=298&w=600&s=8ce4c07c18dacbda92c3ac764b768f4ed30813212fd9e0d44fdc63d7c0c26064&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['climate', 'enormous', 'change', 'help', 'scientists', 'droughts', 'things', 'greenhouse', 'shattering', 'example', 'storms', 'uncertainty', 'myths']", ,drought

After years of drought Lake Mead, the main source of fresh water for the holiday hotspot, has hit the lowest level ever and Sin City is now facing its biggest crisis.



Athe Venetian hotel gondoliers punt tourists up and down a fake Grand Canal. There are six-foot waves in the sandy-bottomed pool of the Mandalay Bay, while the pool parties at the water complex of the Hard Rock Hotel with its underwater sound system are a legendary summer feature.



Even more legendary are the fountains: the one at Caesars Palace, which Evel Knievel once tried to leap on a motorbike and ended up in a coma, and the musical ones on the eight-acre lake at the Bellagio that reach 500ft and are a tourist draw in their own right Welcome to Las Vegas, the self-styled but undisputed entertainment capital of the world. Home to 15 of the world's 25 largest hotels it boasts 125,000 rooms for visitors, every one of them with an obligatory en-suite bathroom.



The city may sit in the Mojave Desert and get just four inches of rain a year but this is a place where everything is done to excess. The idea of cutting back on anything, least of all water, sounds unthinkable.



But take a trip 25 miles southeast to Lake Mead, the massive reservoir created when the Hoover Dam was built across the Colorado River, and you get a striking visual wake-up call. All around its 760 miles of rocky shoreline is a clearly defined line that locals call the ""bathtub ring"". Above it the rocks are brown and jagged but below they are shiny white. This is where the calcium in the water has stained the rocks - and the widening band of white is a powerful sign of how fast the level is dropping.



The lake, which supplies 90 per cent of the water to the two million residents of Las Vegas and its 43 million annual visitors, has been reduced by drought to the lowest level since it was filled in 1937 and is now at 39 per cent capacity. The surface reached a record high of 1,225ft above sea level in 1983 but is now at about 1,080ft. If the level drops below 1,050ft one of the two intakes that feed water to the city will become useless. Another 50ft and the other one would fail.



With the water level dropping by about a foot a week you can see why Professor Tim Barnett, climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, recently warned: ""The situation is as bad as you can imagine. It's going to be screwed - and relatively quickly. ""Unless it can find a way to get more water from somewhere, Las Vegas is out of business.""

Unless it can find a way to get more water from somewhere, Las Vegas is out of business Professor Tim Barnett, climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography

Most of the water from the Colorado River, which runs down to a trickle where it used to meet the Gulf of California, actually goes to agriculture. Seven states share its waters and under an accord struck at a time when Las Vegas was still tiny, Nevada gets just two per cent.



Nowadays the city is expanding at a massive rate and the population has more than quadrupled since 1980. But the reason Lake Mead is so low is that for the past 12 years the south-west of the United States has been suffering one of its periodic droughts. Recorded in the area for some 1,200 years these are a result of reduced snowmelt from the Colorado Rockies. The current drought is made worse by global warming: higher air temperatures make the lake water evaporate faster.



But meteorologist Mike Tsolinas, who writes about Las Vegas weather at miketsolinas.com, says it's wrong to say Sin City is drying out. ""Fortunately the Las Vegas Valley Water District is way ahead of the curve on this,"" he says. ""At 1,000ft Lake Mead would not be able to provide any water to Las Vegas because our intake valves would be pumping air. However a new project at 875ft is already twothirds done. By the time that happens, should it ever, Las Vegas will still have water. ""So the city will not run dry soon. We have at least enough water for everyone to come play in for another 30 years or so.""



Water consumption in the city itself is actually falling, despite the soaring population. It may come as a surprise considering its air of conspicuous excess but Las Vegas has had no choice but to become one of the most eco-conscious places in the US.



One misconception is the Bellagio fountains, which seem like such a ruinous waste of water but aren't fed from Lake Mead.The display is supplied by groundwater from an aquifer that is high in salt content and so would not be drinkable. Much more significant for conservation is that every drop of water going down a drain in a hotel bathroom or toilet is treated to near drinking-water standard and sent back to Lake Mead.



""We have been way ahead of the curve here in cultivating an ethic of conservation, providing people with the incentives to conserve, and we've been doing that for more than a decade now,"" says Bronson Mack of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.



""Compared to 2002, which is really when the drought started, our water consumption has dropped by 32 billion gallons yet our population has increased by almost half a million. ""In other words our water consumption has been cut by one third but our population increased by a quarter.""

Chinese officials are embracing a wide range of tactics in trying to suppress surging ethnic violence in the western border region of Xinjiang. There are, for example, frequent police raids on homes of suspected Uighur insurgents and executions of those found guilty by courts of ?terrorist activities.? There was also a recent proposal by President Xi Jinping to move more Uighurs to parts of China dominated by the Han, the nation?s main ethnic group, so the mostly Muslim Uighurs could be better assimilated into Chinese society.

Now there is 10-year-old Princess Fragrant, with her girlish braids, embroidered red dress and flowing silk head scarf.

She is the Han vision of a Disney princess transplanted to Xinjiang. Animators in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen are creating a 104-episode cartoon series loosely based on a historical Qing Dynasty imperial consort, the Fragrant Concubine, a Uighur woman who is shrouded in myth. Working under contract with the government of the oasis city of Kashgar, the site of occasional violent episodes, these animators have said their aim is to paint a portrait of ethnic harmony and paper over bloody conflicts in Xinjiang.



The plot of the series, which is expected to be broadcast in 15-minute-long episodes over two seasons, follows the adventures of Princess Fragrant, her brother and their ethnic Han and Kazakh friends as they travel across Xinjiang to rescue the princess?s father from the clutches of a greedy Western explorer.

?It shows that ethnic unity is the most powerful weapon in the face of adversity,? said the director, Deng Jiangwei, in a telephone interview. ?The princess and her friends also encounter other ethnicities and cultures along the Silk Road, and they learn that only by helping each other can you go far in life.?

The English-language edition of Global Times, a populist state-run newspaper, ran an article on Monday on the ?Princess Fragrant? series under the headline ?Xinjiang fights an ideology war through cartoon production.?

The producers, Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communications Company, got a contract last year from the Kashgar government to develop a cartoon that would show Xinjiang folk customs, the report said. It cited Sheng Jun, an official at the Xinjiang Bureau of Culture, as saying that ?Xinjiang authorities support the development of cartoons with the aim of maintaining social stability by boosting the solidarity of Han and Uighur people and the fusion of Han and Uighur culture.?

Mr. Deng said his company had been told by Shenzhen officials to work with Kashgar, a sister city, to ?boost the creative industry in Xinjiang.? The central government has been pairing up cities in Xinjiang with wealthier ones elsewhere in China to promote Xinjiang?s economic development.

Last month, Mr. Deng uploaded a trailer of ?Princess Fragrant? to Youku, a Chinese video site. It shows the princess and her companions in landscapes of snowcapped mountains, waterfalls and domed buildings.

?All the media reports on terrorism attacks in Xinjiang magnify the danger and deter tourism,? Mr. Deng said. ?To boost tourism, we want to show that Xinjiang is a beautiful and peaceful place.?

The trailer also has a scene of the princess dancing for guests at a banquet, which is in line with the popular depiction of ethnic minorities by the Communist Party. Propaganda posters, publications and television shows across China often portray members of the country?s 55 ethnic minorities as smiling folk dancers in colorful native garb.

Mr. Deng said half the production team was made up of Uighurs assigned to the show by the Kashgar government. ?They can make sure every aspect of the show is authentic,? he said. The creators have also ?enlisted the best musicians in Xinjiang to write the music, including two famous Uighur musicians,? Mr. Deng added.

However, the series will avoid mention of Islam, which is central to Uighur life. ?We try not to mention religion or politics,? Mr. Deng said.

The creative team has completed parts of the first season and plans to do a test run of a few episodes in the Uighur language in December on a Kashgar television station, Mr. Deng said. The company is in talks with China Central Television, the main state network, to broadcast the first season in late 2015 and the second season the following year.

Some foreign scholars are skeptical of whether the cartoon will win the hearts and minds of Uighurs.

?As you know, ethnic tensions in Xinjiang are at their highest levels in decades and many Uighurs feel under siege from an increasingly intrusive party-state, here perceived as both alien and Han, as it penetrates deeper into their daily lives,? said James Leibold, a senior lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne who studies China?s ethnic policies. ?Like other Han productions, I suspect Xinjiang?s majority Uighur population will see right through this latest piece of ethnic unity propaganda. They have their own narratives of Iparhan, ones that stress resistance to Qing/Chinese imperial rule.?

The story of ?Princess Fragrant? is based on the popular Chinese narrative of the Fragrant Concubine, named Xiangfei in Mandarin or Iparhan in the Uighur language, a historical figure from Xinjiang who in the 18th century was brought to Beijing by the Qianlong Emperor to be his consort. Contemporary Chinese propaganda campaigns have promoted her story as one that shows unity between ethnic Uighurs and the Han. (In fact, the Qianlong Emperor was ethnic Manchu, a people from the northeast forest that conquered China following the Han-ruled Ming Dynasty in the 17th century.)

A popular Uighur version of the Iparhan narrative says she resented the Manchus for invading her homeland and kept daggers hidden in her robes even after she was taken 2,700 miles to the imperial court in Beijing.

Chinese tourists in Kashgar flock to her so-called tomb at the Apak Khoja Mausoleum, a green-and-white-tiled Sufi shrine. Iparhan was said to be a descendant of Apak Khoja, a local leader from the 17th century, a time when ethnic Zunghars controlled the region. The Chinese legend goes that the consort was brought back to Kashgar for burial after her death.

But the legend appears to be just what it is, a popular tale. An essay on Islam in Xinjiang by Graham E. Fuller and Jonathan N. Lipman, published in the academic anthology ?Xinjiang: China?s Muslim Borderland,? opens with an exploration of the myth of the Fragrant Concubine and says there is ?undisputed evidence regarding the burial of the Qianlong emperor?s actual Muslim consort, under her palace name of Rongfei, among the Qing imperial graves near Beijing.?

Even the designation of ?Uighur? as an ethnicity did not exist until the 17th and 18th centuries, the scholars say. So nationalistic Uighur authors living outside China who have praised Iparhan as a symbol of the struggle against the Manchu-Chinese invaders are also appropriating her narrative for political purposes, they say.

?Clearly, these anachronistic arguments project contemporary social conflicts backward 200 or 300 years,? they write in the essay.

The authors conclude the first section of their essay with this thought: ?The superimposition of a particular reading of the myth of the Fragrant Concubine onto an Islamic shrine at once trivializes its religious significance and makes it part of a broader and discernible process, what might be termed the ?Disneylandization? of Islam and Uyghur culture in China.?

They continue: ?That is, it has been emasculated, folklorized, prettified, Hanified, and cast into the nationwide museum of safely packaged ethnicity that serves up exoticism and charm to tourists in China but precludes any hint of opposition in the past or present.?

The creators of the ?Princess Fragrant? television series plan to make a movie version for release in 2016 and a stage musical with ?interactive holograms,? Mr. Deng said. He added, ?We are also releasing a soundtrack album and merchandising.?

The historic Trefethen winery, severely damaged in the quake, looks like being saved

Sunday's 6.0-magnitude quake?did more damage to the city of Napa than the wine industry.

Beyond the fallen barrels and broken glass, the lasting image of Sunday's earthquake in Napa Valley might be Trefethen Family Vineyards' 127-year-old tasting room, which was bulging out and leaning noticeably to the right.

It turns out the building might be saved.

Trefethen CEO Jon Ruel said Monday that there is no cost estimate yet for restoring the building, but if it's possible, the family wants to do it.

""The building was built as a winery in 1886. It's very special because there are very few wineries standing from that period,"" Ruel told Wine Searcher.

""When we first saw it (Sunday), we thought, wow, that's it. The first engineer we had on site said: 'Wood is really resilient. If this had been a stone structure, once you have some cracks, that's it.' The upper stories shifted about four feet to the west. The building is still on the foundation. Based on what we can see, even the upstairs is still fine. In many ways, we can count our blessings.""

Ruel was not alone in feeling lucky one day after the worst earthquake in Northern California for 25 years. It measured 6.0 on the Richter scale and shook up southern Napa Valley?causing an estimated $1 billion in damage.

Saintsbury lost 30 cases of its library wines in Sunday morning's quake, yet co-founder David Graves knew that it could have been worse.

Nine years ago, Saintsbury lost 3000 cases of older wine it had stored in a warehouse on Mare Island to a fire set by an arsonist.

""That loss makes this one a little easier to put in perspective,"" Graves told Wine Searcher.

In 2005, Saintsbury's losses included ""wines that were made with the moral support of my family, many of whom were no longer with me,"" Graves said.

""Many of those wines were a manifestation of those relationships. That was a heavy blow. But that's done; this could have been worse. We're glad the earthquake didn't draw blood. My house is next to a house in Napa that's being condemned.""

Graves was one of many winery owners in Napa who came in to work on Monday to find the damage wasn't as bad as they feared.

More than 200 injuries have been reported but there were no fatalities, and Napa Valley Vintners said in a statement that ""there were no reports of winery employees being injured"".

Many wineries had broken glass and wine to clean up off the floor and some, including Lagier-Meredith, BR Cohn and Hess Collection, suffered severe losses. But, in most cases, wineries discovered Monday that earthquake-proofing their buildings had helped.

Bronco Wine Company, which has a huge distribution center near the epicenter in American Canyon, had ""a few bottles rattled,"" according to spokesman Harvey Posert.

Graves said: ""My next-door neighbor works for Treasury (owner of Beringer). He volunteered that their two-million case airport facility lost only a few cases.""

Hugh Reimer, COO of Jackson Family Wines, said: ""Our major distribution center is in American Canyon. We had a few hundred cases of breakage. The whole industry was fairly lucky it was a 6.0 and not a 6.8.""

One sign of the limited damage to the industry was the action at an online volunteer board set up by Wine Industry Insight. As of 5 p.m. Monday, while a number of people had volunteered cleanup assistance, no winery had posted that it needed volunteers.

Arpad Molnar owns a vineyard right at the epicenter of the quake. He said on Monday that there were several 10- to 15-foot long cracks in it, but no grapevines or irrigation lines were lost.

""The vineyard is called Poseidon Vineyard,"" Molnar said. ""Poseidon was known as the earth-shaker. It's an uncanny coincidence.""

More than 60 buildings have been red-tagged, meaning they are unsafe to enter. Considering that, the wine industry may have been let off lightly. Trefethen's building was the only winery building reportedly unsafe to enter on Monday. But Trefethen's production facilities, in a separate building, were undamaged.

Moreover, while the 1886 building is also used for storing up to 300 barrels of wine, only 10 barrels were in it at the time of the quake.

""My office looks like a tornado hit it, and every room looks like that,"" Ruel said. ""But our first concern was the wine. We had our 2013 Cabernet in tanks, and those are the tanks that moved around. But the floor was still dry and the wine was still in the tank and we were able to relocate our entire 2013 Cabernet, which was awesome.""

Graves said the timing of the earthquake was about as fortunate as could be. Most wineries have bottled their 2012 red wines and have barely started picking grapes this year, so only 2013 red wines were affected. And 2013 was California's largest harvest ever, so the overall wine market will never notice a difference.

""It happened at 3:20 in the morning,"" Graves said. ""A lot of people were out of harm's way by definition. Then you start to think about the cycle of what everybody does. If we'd had this in March, we'd have wine in barrels all over the floor. We were picking up empty barrels today, because all of our wine had been bottled. If it were two weeks later, we would have had full tanks. Our tanks were empty and they were thrown all around. I don't know what this would have done if they were full.""

Ruel said by 6 p.m. Monday, Trefethen was starting to feel almost normal.

For months, the political conversation among China?s chattering classes has been of ?tigers? and ?flies,? the big and small officials who are victims of President Xi Jinping?s anticorruption-campaign-cum-political-purge that is taking down hundreds, possibly thousands of people, as he consolidates power.

There?s ?Tiger Zhou,? Zhou Yongkang, the former security boss. And ?Tiger Xu,? Gen. Xu Caihou, a former deputy chairman of the Central Military Commission. Both were recently indicted, as have been many ?flies,? often for corruption, sometimes on political or morality charges.

But starting last week the chatter has been focusing on a new creature: a ?spider.? And prompting it was in part, at least, photographs swirling online that purported to show the removal from public buildings of the name of an influential former leader.



To be exact, of Jiang Zemin, who retired as the head of the ruling Communist Party in 2002 and as president in 2003, but has retained enormous influence through a network of allies in the party, the military and business, analysts said. To change China from a state congealing under corruption and economic vested interests, Mr. Jiang?s two decade-old network needs to be cleared away, they said.

?It?s like a web of privileged interest groups, and Jiang Zemin is the spider in the middle of it,? said Huang Jing, a professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.

Mr. Jiang, who will turn 88 on Sunday, is increasingly frail, with reports of his death circulating periodically, but his adherents are using his name to carry on, said Mr. Huang. He has a son, Jiang Mianheng, who is active in business and politics.

?He is the spider in the middle, but I think he is a half-dead spider,? said Mr. Huang. ?It?s the spiders around him that are trying to protect him and protect themselves. They use his name, use his influence, use his connections, but as long as he is still taking breath, he is still considered the godfather.?

Hence the reaction last week to the images circulating widely online, including via Weixin, or WeChat, that purported to show Mr. Jiang?s name being removed from public buildings bearing his calligraphy. In a political culture that values symbolism highly, such an act could be read as a sign that the ?spider? was the next ?tiger.?

Jiang Zemin inscription removed from outside wall of #China?s #PLA?! //t.co/NZKrrg1UkR //t.co/MKKY6fHUps ? TheresaFallon (@TheresaAFallon) 7 Aug 14

?Jiang was the backup to Zhou,? wrote one person who sent the images to friends, requesting that his name not be used because of political sensitivities. It was ?at least a warning? to Mr. Jiang, ?not to get involved,? he wrote, referring to the president?s purge of Mr. Jiang?s former allies such as Mr. Zhou and Mr. Xu.

It turned out that the photographs were probably old, or something other than what they seemed to show. But the conversation was real, as was the circulation of the photos last week.

?I?m highly suspicious this is from Xi directly,? Mr. Huang said of the photographs. ?It could be other people trying to please Xi Jinping? by circulating them online, he said.

One of several different images appeared to show the three characters of Mr. Jiang?s name missing from his own gold calligraphy atop the prestigious People?s Liberation Army General Hospital in western Beijing, known as ?301 Hospital,? which they have adorned since 1993.

On Wednesday, Mr. Jiang?s name was back up at the hospital. The building has been under renovation for months, and it?s possible they were taken down temporarily. Also on Wednesday, at least two other sites along Beijing?s grand, east-west axis of Changan Avenue sported his name: the Capital Museum and the National Center for the Performing Arts.

Calls to the hospital seeking an explanation went unanswered or were transferred to someone who hung up when the subject was raised. Another person said the hospital had no public relations unit or other way to comment to the media.

The fact that the images were circulating was significant, said Zhang Lifan, a political commentator in Beijing.

?Such a phenomenon says something about the situation,? Mr. Zhang said. ?So I think something did happen. His influence is being eliminated.? Recently, too, anticorruption investigators arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Jiang?s old power base, a place largely ignored until now in the campaign.

The warning for Mr. Jiang, if there is one, is nothing personal, said Mr. Huang, who thinks Mr. Xi is seeking compromise, rather than confrontation, with Mr. Jiang and his allies, though compromise on Mr. Xi?s terms. Rather, it?s directed by what Mr. Xi wants to achieve.

?If you look at Xi Jinping?s anticorruption campaign, of course it?s a political campaign, but it is also a way to break up the privileged groups,? Mr. Huang said. ?If you keep going, you see who is so-called commander in chief of all the prevailing interest groups, and that is Jiang Zemin.?

The problem is a chronic one in Chinese politics, said Mr. Zhang, the political commentator.

?Since Mao, we?ve had ?old people politics?,? he said. ?And that situation means that every new leadership has this problem and finds it hard to do what they want to do. So everyone has to cast off the old person?s political power.?

Meanwhile, other animals may be entering the menagerie of Chinese politics. The tweet below shows a standoff between a frog and a snake in a story carried by the newspaper Global Times, amid speculation that Mr. Jiang is the toad and Mr. Xi the snake:

80,80,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,New energy-rich sorghum offers ethanol without the corn - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/12/biofuels-energy-efficient-sorghum-nexsteppe,"As scientists around the world research biomass feedstocks ? trees, shrubs and grasses that are designed to produce energy ? a California startup called NexSteppe is betting that fast-growing, drought-resistant sorghum will emerge as a crop to sustainably fuel cars, trucks and power plants.

Sorghum, a millenia-old cereal grain, today feeds animals and people. It is turned into flour, syrups and beer, and used in gluten-free products. In Asia, sorghum is made into couscous, and across Africa, it?s consumed as a porridge.

Last year, though, NexSteppe introduced two new brands of sorghum seeds, dubbed Palo Alto and Malibu, that were bred expressly to be energy crops. They grow on marginal land and in a variety of climates, and they climb to a height of 20 feet after only four months of growth.

?Sorghum is naturally very heat and drought tolerant,? says Anna Rath, NexSteppe?s founder, president and CEO. ?It originated in Africa. It?s a camel of a crop, if you will.?

Although NexSteppe has done almost no marketing outside of Brazil, its biggest market, the company?s sorghum is now being grown by farmers in 15 countries, including China, India, South Africa, Germany, Canada and the US.

?We identified a market need that wasn?t being met,? Rath told me, when we met at NexSteppe?s office in South San Francisco, across the bay from San Francisco International Airport. ?Until now, crops have always been developed for animal feed and food?with the exception of cotton and tobacco. But there?s a growing need for energy that wasn?t being addressed.?

Rath, who is 38, is a former McKinsey consultant with degrees in biology and genetics, as well a doctorate from Yale Law School. She started NexSteppe with about $1m from friends and family in 2010. Since then, the company has raised about $40m from venture capitalists and from DuPont, which has major investments in biofuels, including a cellulosic ethanol plant under construction in Iowa.

NexSteppe isn?t the only company developing dedicated energy crops. Ceres, a small public company where Rath previously worked, breeds sorghum, switchgrass and miscanthus, but its products have been slow to reach the market. Meantime, the US government and university scientists backed by a 10-year, $500m grant from BP are extensively researching energy crops and biofuels production.

Why do we need dedicated energy crops? First of all, environmentalists say, reducing carbon pollution from the transportation sector will require widespread uptake of biofuels; vast, existing fleets of cars, trucks, buses and planes will need liquid fuels (but not gasoline or diesel oil) for decades to come. Second, most of the world?s biofuels today come from two feedstocks: corn in the US and sugarcane in Brazil. Neither is an ideal energy crop, experts say.

?We don?t view using food crops for fuel as a generally good idea,? says Heather Youngs, a senior fellow at the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a BP-funded research project at UC Berkeley. EBI is doing basic research on an array of crops with appealing sustainability profiles, including perennial grasses like miscanthus. Since 2006, the US energy and agriculture departments have also funded basic research into the genomics of plant feedstocks for bioenergy.

Brian Siu, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says biofuels ideally should be made out of organic waste or crops that don?t require much water or chemical use. ?We have a lot of concerns with corn ethanol,? he says. ?Corn is currently produced with a chemical-intensive process. It uses lots of fertilizers. It uses lots of pesticides.? Biofuels made from corn also cost more than fossil fuels, so they require government mandates or subsidies, which are controversial.

While sorghum is also grown for food, Rath says, it ?needs a lot fewer carbon inputs than corn or sugarcane?. It also produces more biomass per acre per year than corn or sugarcane. NexSteppe has commissioned an independent analysis of sorghum?s sustainability profile, but it?s not yet available.

That said, unlike corn or sugarcane, NexSteppe?s crops have been bred to optimize energy production. Its Malibu sweet sorghum is designed to produce easily accessible fermentable sugars for fuels, while its Palo Alto high-biomass sorghum aims to deliver a low-moisture feedstock for cellulosic biofuels and biomass boilers that produce heat and electricity. The company, which employs about 35 people, half of them scientists, uses conventional breeding methods, and does?t use genetic modification.

Brazil is ?our first, largest and most important market?, Rath says, because demand there is growing for both transportation fuels and electricity. Brazil also has dozens of ethanol plants and biomass boilers that are hungry for feedstocks to supplement local sugarcane. She sees opportunities for growth in China as well as in the US, where a half dozen or so cellulosic ethanol plants are expected to begin commercial production this year.

Over time, a variety of feedstocks are likely to emerge, depending on local conditions as well as government policy. Says Heather Youngs of EBI: ?There?s a saying that ?all biomass is local? and it?s really true.? The NRDC?s Brian Siu agrees, saying that the sustainability profile of a biofuel is ?highly determined by the feedstock and how and where we choose to grow it?. ?The ?how? and ?where? are very important,? he says.

81,81,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Theaters in China Screen Movies, and Viewers' Text Messages - The New York Times",https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/theaters-in-china-screen-movies-and-viewers-text-messages/,"Photo

A moviegoer?s worst nightmare or the coolest wave of the future?

The new ?bullet screen,? or danmu, model of movie-watching that has recently been introduced in select theaters in China can perhaps be most pithily summed up with the title of the 2010 Chinese action comedy ?Let the Bullets Fly.?

In this case, the bullets don?t refer to actual bullets, but to text messages that audience members send via their mobile phones while watching the film. The messages are then projected onto the screen, so that at any given time the scene may be overlaid with multiple ?bullets,? or comments, scrolling across the screen.



What might seem like a hellish scenario for those still keen on the solitary escapism associated with a traditional movie-going experience is meant to appeal to younger audiences for whom mobile phones have become lifelines and sharing one?s every thought ? even about something as banal as the air-conditioning in the cinema ? has become a way of life. Over the past month, several theaters around China have been experimenting with ?bullet screen? showings of films like the 3-D animated film ?The Legend of Qin? and the third installment of the blockbuster young-adult franchise ?Tiny Times.?

Since the release of ?Tiny Times 3? in July, its distributor, Le Vision Pictures, has organized several ?bullet screen? showings in Beijing as part of a post-release marketing strategy.

?We wanted to create a social experience and promote it among young people,? said Enya Sun, a public relations manager at Le Vision Pictures. ?If it was a Zhang Yimou film,? she said, referring to the celebrated Chinese film director, ?we probably wouldn?t do it, because it would be less focused on young people. But if it?s a movie oriented to very young people, we could potentially do it on a national scale.?

The idea behind ?bullet screens? originated in Japan, where they were first popularized by a Japanese ACG (animation, comics, games) video portal called Nicodou, which later became the inspiration for similar Chinese ACG video sites such as Bilibili.

While comments can be so numerous that they obscure the entire screen, many ?bullet screen? proponents say the point is often not to watch the actual video in any case, but to get together and ?tucao,? Chinese for ?spit and joke around,? about the silliness of the video.

?Even when the videos are boring, the viewers are getting together and entertaining each other,? Hiroyuki Nishimura, the Japanese founder of Nicodou, said in a 2008 interview with Wired magazine.

The feedback from viewers appears so far to have been positive.

?Implementing a ?bullet screen? doesn?t require that much technological capability and it is a good strategy for attracting audiences to somewhat controversial films,? said a user called Wuyun Zhuangban Zhe, writing on his Tencent WeChat public account about his experience at a ?bullet screen? showing of ?Tiny Times 3.?

In a photo posted in his description, audience members can be seen hunched over bright mobile phone screens as the film is projected on the screen before them. The user also noted that audience members could send text messages noting their seat number to the screen when their mobile phone batteries were running low, whereupon a theater worker would come around and provide them with a portable battery to recharge their phones.

A theater manager surnamed Zhang at the Luxin Cinema in Shandong Province told the China Youth Daily newspaper that for an Aug. 6 ?bullet screen? showing of ?The Legend of Qin,? 90 percent of the seats were filled, mostly by young people who texted in their thoughts at about 0.1 renminbi, or 10 cents, per message.

?Right now everyone thinks this is pretty novel and pretty cool,? Mr. Zhang told the newspaper. ?But in the long run this might have an impact on people?s attention spans during movies.?

Others remain wary of where ?bullet screens? might take the viewing experience, expressing concern about a possible barrage of commercial advertisements, hate texts or other sensitive content in real-time messages on the screen.

He Ping, a Chinese film director and former secretary general of the China Film Directors Association, voiced concern that the popularization of ?bullet screens? may subvert the aesthetic intentions of the filmmakers.

?If these ?bullet screens? become widespread in the future, they should first be authorized by the writers and directors of the film,? Mr. He told China Youth Daily.","Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/world/20sino-movies01/20sino-movies01-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg,"['screen', 'viewers', 'movies', 'mobile', 'young', 'messages', 'china', 'bullet', 'experience', 'film', 'chinese', 'theaters', 'screens', 'text']", ,none

A new California Association of Realtors report says in 2014, nearly half of investors said they purchased properties in ""more remote"" locations of the state including Sacramento, San Joaquin, Fresno, Kern, Merced, and Tulare, up from 27 percent in 2013.

The CAR's 2014 Investor Survey stated, ""Given the depletion of distressed homes on the market, investors are changing their strategy and are moving away from purchasing homes in more popular, urban areas in favor of more rural areas of the state where better deals can be found.""

That news jibes with Visalia city planner Josh McDonald's observation that builders are increasingly looking at buying some of the 5,500 approved lots in Visalia left over from the real estate bust now that the new city General Plan will be in place and the economy has recovered.

""We've seen lots of interest,"" he said.

Surplus City building bought

The Visalia development group called 120 W. Main includes Visalia realtor Matt Graham, farmer and developer Fred Lagomarsino, farmer and business owner Tommy Elliott and developer Harvey May. The group last week completed the purchase of the former Surplus City property at 315 E Main in Downtown, a 9,500-square-foot building. Surplus City closed its doors after many years in early 2014 and the owner put the property up for sale. A major remodel is now planned.

""We hope to lease it out to two retail users"" Harvey May said. ""We already have a letter of intent from a well known retailer for half the space.""

The group purchased the Mars pharmacy building at 124 W. Main a few years ago and did a major makeover. Now they say they will be getting the kind of user they were waiting for when Fresno's Sequoia Brewery opens, which they expect to by Christmas.

""We want to help rejuvenate these older properties,"" May said.

Downtown retail vacancy is extremely low, according to the chairman of the Downtown Visalia merchants group, Don Sharp.

""Besides the Surplus City space, I can't think of any other Main Street space available on the ground floor,"" said Sharp.

Property owner Sam Sciacca has said that the former Links space he bought is now spoken for, with a salon and wine-bar moving in and four apartments in the works upstairs.

Property owner George Ouzounian said he will install an elevator by the first of the year at his building on the corner on Main and Willis to help lease second story office space in the building.

California Hot Springs revival?

The rural enclave of California Hot Springs in southern Tulare County appears to be ready for some kind of revival with two plans in the early stages to build at least modest destination resorts here. The historical California Hot Springs itself, founded in 1882 and developed as a health resort that centered around the town's naturally pure hot springs water, now includes a water bottling facility. It is in escrow to be sold to an unnamed buyer soon. Nearby, a yoga center called Vendanta Spiritual Retreat is being planned by an L.A. group that recently purchased a Hot Springs Road ranch.

Tule Tribe member labors to keep Wukchumni language alive

Speaking of revivals, Marie Wilcox, an elder with the Tule River Indian tribe, is the subject of a film and New York Times video blog this week. After laboring with several years of hunt and peck on her older computer Marie created a Wukchumni language dictionary to encourage the reuse of the near forgotten language that was once spoken here by some 50,000 Yokuts. Today there are around 200 Wukchumni tribe members.

Drought's silver lining

What kind of company does better in a drought? How about a drip irrigation company or bottled water maker? Yes to both in Tulare County as Traver-based Streamline Irrigation is expanding its footprint north of town, ramping up to 16 employees and completing a new building, according to Mike Washam of Tulare County's economic development office who has assisted with the expansion. Washam said his office is also busy seeking grants to help in these drought times by offering to fund daily bottled water delivery to families who lost their wells, along with schools where low-income earners are abundant, schools with water contamination as well as water supply problems. About $1.5 million is expected to be funded.

Chinese reopen market for citrus

Drought may be flashing a red light but overseas demand for Valley crops continues to give the green light. Citrus growers suffering zero surface water delivery got some good news this month when China reopened their market after over years time. Industry sources say China had imported about 5 million cartons a year before a disease issue came up that is now resolved.

Batch plant seeks approval

Pismo-based Papich Construction wants to expand its Hwy 99/198 asphalt batch plant and make it permanent. It had been working with the city of Visalia to build a plant in the industrial park but now is pursuing a permit with the county at its present location near Goshen.

83,83,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate change will widen the social and health gap - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/climate-change-will-widen-social-and-health-gap/,"Climate projections suggest that, thanks to human activity, we will likely see an increase in extreme weather events, disruptions to agriculture, loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.

While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status.

Recently there?s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists, led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda.

My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices. I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health.

Inequities of man-made natural disasters

Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones. These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems.

Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage.

At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people. 6,069 people were reported dead while 4.1 million people were displaced, with 1.1 million houses damaged or destroyed. While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions.

Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild. The ?ooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities. Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport.

We see similar issues with heatwaves. Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat. This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths.

Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods.

Impacts on agriculture

? In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

Our agricultural systems are also under threat. Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production. This will affect people?s income, stress levels and sense of hope.

In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle. But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities. Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away.

This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities. These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts.

Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity. Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33 per cent increase in the price of vegetables and a 43 per cent increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events.

Rising food prices most affect the poor ? as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19 per cent. But, with 12 per cent of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face.

Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories. Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt.

Where does inequality come from?

Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities.

Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers.

Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes. The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average.

Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people. In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality. This might include: fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas.

This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment.

Bottled-water drinkers, we have a problem: There's a good chance that your water comes from California, a state experiencing the third-driest year on record.

The details of where and how bottling companies get their water are often quite murky, but generally speaking, bottled water falls into two categories. The first is ""spring water,"" or groundwater that's collected, according to the EPA, ""at the point where water flows naturally to the earth's surface or from a borehole that taps into the underground source."" About 55 percent of bottled water in the United States is spring water, including Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead.

Here?s Where Dasani, Aquafina, Arrowhead, and Crystal Geyser Get Their Water

Sources: U.S. Drought Monitor, Aquafina/Pepsi,

Dasani/Coca-Cola, Crystal Geyser

The other 45 percent comes from the municipal water supply, meaning that companies, including Aquafina and Dasani, simply treat tap water?the same stuff that comes out of your faucet at home?and bottle it up. (Weird, right?)

But regardless of whether companies bottle from springs or the tap, lots of them are using water in exactly the areas that need it most right now.

The Brands That Use Water Straight From Drought-Ridden California

Sources: U.S. Drought Monitor, Aquafina/Pepsi,

Dasani/Coca-Cola, Arrowhead/Nestle, Crystal Geyser;

logos courtesy Brands of the World; icons courtesy MapBox.

The map above shows the sources of water for four big-name companies that bottle in California. Aquafina and Dasani ""sources"" are the facilities where tap water is treated and bottled, whereas Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead ""sources"" refer to the springs themselves.

In the grand scheme of things, the amount of water used for bottling in California is only a tiny fraction of the amount of water used for food and beverage production?plenty of other bottled drinks use California's water, and a whopping 80 percent of the state's water supply goes toward agriculture. But still, the question remains: Why are Americans across the country drinking bottled water from drought-ridden California?

One reason is simply that California happens to be where some bottled water brands have set up shop. ""You have to remember this is a 120-year-old brand,"" said Jane Lazgin, a representative for Arrowhead. ""Some of these sources have long, long been associated with the brand."" Lazgin acknowledges that, from an environmental perspective, ""tap water is always the winner,"" but says that the company tries to manage its springs sustainably. The water inside the bottle isn't the only water that bottling companies require: Coca-Cola bottling plants, which produce Dasani, use 1.63 liters of water for every liter of beverage produced in California, according to Coca-Cola representative Dora Wong. ""Our California facilities continue to seek ways to reduce overall water use,"" she wrote in an email.

Story continues

Another reason we're drinking California's water: California happens to be the only Western state without groundwater regulation or management of major groundwater use. In other words, if you're a water company and you drill down and find water in California, it's all yours.

Then there's the aforementioned murkiness of the industry: Companies aren't required to publicly disclose exactly where their sources are or how much water each facility bottles. Peter Gleick, author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession With Bottled Water, says, ""I don't think people have a clue?no one knows"" where their bottled water comes from. (Fun facts he's discovered in his research: Everest water comes from Texas, Glacier Mountain comes from Ohio, and only about a third of Poland Springs water comes from the actual Poland Spring, in Maine.)

Despite the fact that almost all U.S. tap water is better regulated and monitored than bottled, and despite the hefty environmental footprint of the bottled water industry, perhaps the biggest reason that bottling companies are using water in drought zones is simply because we're still providing a demand for it: In 2012 in the United States alone, the industry produced about 10 billion gallons of bottled water, with sales revenues at $12 billion.

As Gleick wrote, ""This industry has very successfully turned a public resource into a private commodity."" And consumers?well, we're drinking it up.

In fact he had two Oscars for both producing and directing 1982?s eleg ant epic biopic, Gandhi. But considering the breadth of his career not only in those capacities, but particularly as an actor, it is astounding to me that the Gandhi wins represented his only nominations in a six-decade career that memorably started with the British World War II classic In Which We Serve in 1942. As an actor, Attenborough deserved far better than he got from the Academy.

It?s almost criminal, for instance, that he was overlooked in 1964 for his creepy performance in Seance on a Wet Afternoon as Billy, the weak, complicit husband who gets involved in a kidnapping so his wife, played by the great Kim Stanley, could become famous as a psychic.

Stanley got a richly deserved Best Actress nomination that year but Attenborough, who also produced the film, did not. I think it may have been his best performance. It?s definitely a film that holds up even 50 years later. In fact, so much of his work on screen remains memorable.

That same year as Seance, Attenborough was also memorable as Sergeant Major in the underrated Guns At Batasi. He did win a BAFTA award, the organization he would later head, as Best British Actor in 1964 for those two films.

Just a year earlier he stood out in a superb ensemble as Roger Bartlett, the mastermind behind The Great Escape. His expression as he realizes he is about to be killed is still haunting more than 50 years later. It?s sad to think virtually the entire key cast of that 1963 WWII classic are now gone, with James Garner?s passing earlier this summer.

Another memorable turn in uniform came in 1966?s The Sand Pebbles, where he was enormously engaging as Frenchy, a Navy shipmate of Steve McQueen?s on a gun boat patrolling the Yangtze River in 1926 China.

Attenborough, an RAF veteran, actually did numerous films donning uniforms in the course of his career. He won the Supporting Actor Golden Globe for Sand Pebbles and even repeated the feat the next year for his larger -than-life turn in 1967?s musical Doctor Dolittle. An Oscar nod might not have realistically been in the cards for the latter film, but instead of an Attenborough nod for Sand Pebbles, that distinction went instead to his unknown co-star Mako. Attenborough was every bit as good, if not better.

The Boulting Brothers films Private?s Progress and I?m All Right Jack were vintage British comedies and allowed Attenborough to show other sides of his talent. And he was excellent in director Guy Green?s drama The Angry Silence as a factory worker, for which he got another BAFTA nomination and which was his debut as a producer.

And I will forever be grateful for his emergence as a producer, if only to bring the brilliant 1961 drama Whistle Down The Wind into the world. Hayley Mills starred in the British classic, where kids befriend a bearded man they believe to be Jesus Christ. It was later turned into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and remains one of the greatest films ever about childhood. That and other early films he produced like 1963?s The L Shaped Room proved without a doubt this was an actor who also had great taste as a filmmaker.

Considering his penchant for appearing in war movies, it was somehow appropriate that his filmmaking career would take another major turn in his directorial debut for another , albeit wildly different kind of war film, 1969?s anti-war musical adaptation, Oh! What A Lovely War. The WWI set tale was full of witty numbers and arresting images, none more poignant than a never-ending shot of white crosses in a military cemetery. It packed a powerful punch and remains, I think, Attenborough?s best work behind the camera. And yes, I am including Gandhi in that assessment.

No question that Oscar champion was a great movie of its type and gave Sir Ben Kingsley the role of a lifetime but I think the reason it won those eight Oscars was that it was also perfect Academy fodder, just the kind of epic tale Academy voters loved then, and still do to this day.

It came out at Christmas 1982 and just swept through the awards season on an inevitable march to Oscar, overrunning the film many still argue today should have won Best Picture: Steven Spielberg?s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, which had been released in June and was in a genre not favored by most Oscar voters.

Spielberg was a good sport about it, though, and even brou ght Attenborough back in front of the cameras for another memorable big screen turn in Jurassic Park ten years after their battle for Oscar. (Read the statements about Attenborough from Kingsley and Spielberg in Deadline?s obituary here)

A new generation discovered Attenborough?s acting gift in that movie, and then a year later as Kris Kringle in the remake of Miracle On 34th Street. That role won an Oscar for Edmund Gwenn in the 1947 original but it didn?t do the same for Attenborough. Nevertheless it was nice to have him back in front of the cameras.

As for his other directorial work, it almost all was, like Gandhi, based on real people and situations, including 1992?s Chaplin, for which Robert Downey Jr. was deservedly Oscar nominated and probably should have won for his uncanny portrayal of Charlie Chaplin.

There was the powerful Steve Biko story, Cry Freedom , which brought Denzel Washington his first Oscar nod, Young Winston (1972), a rather dry biopic of the young Winston Churchill, and his final great work as a director, 1993?s Shadowlands, which starred Anthony Hopkins as writer and professor C.S. Lewis.

He tried his hand at another musical, the ill-fated movie adapation of the Broadway classic, A Chorus Line, but it flopped. A better effort outside of the biopic arena was 1978?s creepy and compelling Magic, with a superb performance from Hopkins.

Attenborough also brought all of that experience he had in WWII movies to bear in his all-star 1977 war flick, A Bridge Too Far. As combat epics go, it was a pretty decent one.

In fact as film careers go ? in front of and behind the camera ? Richard Attenborough?s career was more than pretty decent. He was a giant.","Sun, 24 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/seance-on-a-wet-afternoon_kim-stanleyrichard-attenborough_1964.jpg?w=301&h=202&crop=1,"['camera', 'sides', 'won', 'best', 'attenborough', 'appreciation', 'giant', 'richard', 'later', 'actor', 'career', 'film', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'oscar', 'true', 'war']", ,none

Flavourings are expensive by weight. They tend to be the most expensive ingredient of many food products. Onion powder is just one of those costly ingredients. Major potato chips brands like Pringles and Lay?s rely on onion powder to create some of our favourite flavours like sour cream and onion, cheese and onion, and onion rings.

Although the dehydrated onions equate to only 2 percent of the size of the onion market in volume. They are worth up to six times the value of the fresh onion market. Global onion powder prices have been increasing year-on-year since 2012 ? all in all a 20-percent price increase.

The US is the major producer of onion powder, producing over 100,000 tons annually, which accounts for around 50 percent of total global production. This is followed by India, who produces around 40,000 to 50,000 tons annually. China and Egypt each produces around 13,000 to 15,000 tons.

Last year global onion production fell in all major dehydrated onion producing countries due to drought conditions. The reduced output drove prices up in early 2013 but they were also influenced by increased input costs driven by a need for further irrigation. In the US, warm weather in March and April of 2013 led to reduced yields. So by season?s end, the US onion industry had processed 9 percent less than was estimated. This tightened supply was on top of the already low carry-over stocks left from 2012.

This year, the drought has continued causing concerns that the 2014 crop will be lower than estimated for the second year running. California, a major dehydrated onion growing state, officially declared drought conditions in mid-January. Unfortunately, the US is not the only country to be suffering with increased prices due to restricted supply. In India the new crop is expected to fall short of forecasts by 20 percent, and Egypt?s ongoing political turmoil is causing uncertainty of supply to the global market. Since current (and future) supplies of dehydrated onion product around the world are tight, there's little doubt that onion prices are going to leave us with a not-so-sweet taste in the near future.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://spendmatters.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Onion-powder.jpg,"['bad', 'jump', 'prices', 'global', 'potato', 'lovers', 'chip', 'supply', 'onion', 'tons', 'major', 'drought', 'market', 'powder', 'dehydrated']", ,drought

In the northern part of the country, drought has destroyed crops with food in short supply for the past three months. As local authorities get NGO activists to leave so as to limit food consumption, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists work together to help the population.

Kathmandu (AsiaNews) - The food shortages that have affected Humla District in northern Nepal for the past three months have deteriorated to such an extent that volunteers from NGOs have begun to leave the area to reduce food consumption.

The Humla area has suffered the most since drought hit Nepal in the past six months. Crops have failed, and food imports are expensive and limited by poor roads. Local residents are still hoping however that volunteers will return very soon.

""The district is in poor conditions,"" said Babita Lama, head of a Nepali NGO. ""'It hurts to say this, but if non-residents stay, they will use up supplies. The latter could last a big longer only if they are restricted to locals. In the six local Protestant parishes, clergymen have left. Still residents continue to visit and pray in them.""

""Here little food is being produce anyway and we are forced to import it every year,"" said Deputy District Chief Bam Bahadur KC. ""Local production only covers needs for three months. During the other nine months, we have to rely on imports. We shall try to do our best to resolve the situation as soon as possible.""

According to the government, more than 200 staff and volunteers from at least 20 NGOs are normally involved locally.

""Christians, Hindus, and Tibetan Buddhists are among the most active in the district,"" the official said. ""They help the poor by providing education and medical aid. This way, they also help them become aware of their situation and fight religious discrimination.""

""People do not want the volunteers who help us to go away,"" said Binu Rokka, a local resident.

DROUGHT is back on the political agenda ? as Premier Mike Baird visits the parched North West region of NSW today.

Mr Baird has flown to western NSW to see the impact of the more than two seasons of drought on local farmers.

This morning he is at Ed Fessey's property ""Bullabelalie"", near Weilmoringle, looking at capped and piped bores.

Cap and pipe the bores scheme

NSW's cap and pipe the bores scheme has been hailed as a success but it still has more work to do and future funding remains in limbo.

The scheme began in 1999, jointly funded by the State, Commonwealth and landowners under the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative.

To date about 400 free flowing bores have been capped, 18,000 kilometres of piping installed and more than 78,000 megalitres of water saved.

A third round of capping and piping in western NSW is set to finish midway through 2015.

However, the federal environment department said future funding for the program ?is yet to be determined?.

Mr Baird will be hearing about the scheme's success on today's drought trip.

On the tour

NSW Farmers representatives are with the Premier on his trip as well as the Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson.

NSW Farmers president Fiona Simson said she wanted Mr Baird to see first-hand the need to bring back in-drought support measures.

The government's in-drought support policy has recently fallen by the wayside, replaced by a policy to promote drought preparation.

?If you are in a rip-roaring drought, no matter how well prepared you are, you need in drought support measures,? Ms Simson said.

?I hope the government can reconsider its position and introduce a levy like Queensland, to get some cash moving into drought-stricken regional communities.?

Farmers in drought declared areas of Queensland are supported with $30,000 funding.

Labor hits back

Mr Baird?s drought tour is ?hypocritical window dressing,? according to opposition primary industries spokesman Steve Whan.

?Mike Baird has some front going off to the North West and telling (farmers) the government is doing all it can when he has cut funding for drought relief.

?During the millennium drought the Labor government provided 50 per cent subsidies for the transport of fodder and stock, those subsidies helped farmers keep their breeding stock alive so that they could rebuild herds in the good years.

?Farmers in the North West were receiving these subsidies up till June 30 when the Baird Liberal/National Government cut them off.?

Stock transport subsidies are now only available for de-stocking for animal welfare.

Visiting farmers is not new for the Premier.

?Vietnam may suffer from 5-6 typhoons this year,? said, Hoang Duc Cuong, director of the National Center for Hydro-meteorology Forecasting. ""That's fewer than previous years but we expect them to be of higher magnitude.""

Cuong was speaking at a teleconference Wednesday held by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control and Prevention, one month after Typhoon Rammasun swept through northern provinces, killing 27 people.

?We expect Vietnam will have 5-6 typhoons approaching from the East Sea, including 2-3 strong ones that will hit inland,? he said.

| August 21. 2014.19:00

A flip-flopping natural fluctuation in the Atlantic is behind a recent slowdown in surface warming ? and it?s not due to reverse for another ten years, according to new research.

The theory outlined in a paper published today in the journal Science disagrees with other research, which pins the blame for the so-called ?pause? on changes in the Pacific.

We talked to some other scientists working in the field ? and they don?t seem convinced.

Puzzle solving

Scientists know greenhouse gases are driving up global temperature. But data on land and the surface of the ocean shows slower than expected warming in the last 15 years or so.

Periods of slower and faster warming aren?t unusual. Scientists say the main reason we?re seeing one now is because more heat is finding its way to the deeper ocean, rather than staying at the surface.

But which ocean? Knowing where the heat is ending up might help scientists predict how long the hiatus will last.

More than 93 per cent of the heat reaching earth?s surface goes into the oceans. Just 2.3 per cent stays in the atmosphere. Source: Skeptical Science

Pacific or Atlantic?

This is where the new paper disagrees with most recent research, which points towards cooling in the Pacific Ocean as the driver of the hiatus.

The trade winds in the Pacific have been unusually strong since about 2000, a study last year showed. That?s been driving more heat into the deep ocean, lead author Dr Matthew England told us this week:

?[W[e know there?s been a big increase in the strength of the Pacific trade winds, and this provides a means for accelerating heat uptake in the western Pacific Ocean.?

Scientists think the shift in the trade winds is being driven by a larger natural cycle, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) cycling between its warm and cold phases.

But the new paper?s authors disagree, saying their findings ?don?t support [this] Pacific-centric view?. The heat going into the deep Pacific Ocean ?is not nearly enough? to account for the hiatus, they argue.

ARGO floats sink to a depth of about 1,500 metres and come back up to transmit data via satellite. The lifetime of each float is about four years. Source: Met Office

The new research uses data from ARGO floats ? a network of free-floating buoys travelling the world?s oceans taking temperature measurements in the top 1,500 metres..

The ARGO data show some heat going into the deep Pacific but not much, say the authors:

?[Our data} shows that during the 21st century, the increased [ocean heat uptake] below 300m occurs mainly in two ocean basins: the Atlantic and the Southern Oceans â?¦ The Pacific shows very little change?.

Since 2000, the North and South Atlantic oceans below 300 metres together took up slightly more heat than all of the other oceans put together, the paper notes. You can see this in the graph below. It shows the amount of heat absorbed by the global ocean (top) and individual ocean basins (smaller panels).

In the Atlantic and Southern Ocean, the top 300m (blue) only accounts for a small amount of the total heat stored in the upper 1,500 metres of the ocean (red).

Now look at the Pacific, where the red and blue lines sit much closer together ? meaning almost all the heat stays in the top 300m, rather than being carried off to deeper water.

The amount of heat going into the deep Pacific ocean isn?t enough to explain the hiatus on its own, say the authors. The Atlantic Ocean in particular is playing a far more important role, they argue.

A salty driver of change

The authors suggest unusually salty water in the subpolar Atlantic could have caused a huge slow moving ocean circulation in the Atlantic, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, to speed up.

A faster circulation means more water plunges from the surface to deeper depths at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, taking with it lots of heat. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s, the opposite happened. Less salty water slowed the circulation down, transporting less water to depth and causing the surface to warm faster, the authors suggest.

In the past, the Atlantic circulation has switched phase every 20 to 35 years, say the authors. Crucially, if they?re right, it means the hiatus could last another decade.

What do other scientists think?

A 2011 paper by Professor Gerald Meehl and colleagues first raised the idea that the Atlantic could play a part in the hiatus ? so the suggestion in today?s paper isn?t a new one.

But Meehl and other scientists who work in this area don?t agree the Atlantic Ocean mechanism dominates over the Pacific one in terms of causing the hiatus. England tells us:

?I still think the Pacific Ocean is playing the lead role in this ocean heat uptake but this study is important as it points to an additional role from the Atlantic and Southern Oceans.?

How long the hiatus lasts is likely to have more to do with when natural cycles in the Pacific shift again, rather than those in the Atlantic, Meehl adds:

?Given the available evidence, the IPO in the Pacific seems to be the main driver of the hiatus, and past hiatus periods as well. If, as in the 1970s, the IPO switches from negative to positive, there would be a resumption of more rapid warming.?

Part of the reason for other scientists? doubts about the new paper?s conclusions are because it uses a different method to previous research. ARGO floats have been collecting data since the early 2000s but only achieved global coverage in 2005, for example.

Professor Kevin Trenberth from the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research tells us the suggested Atlantic mechanism can?t explain the atmospheric disturbances recently, which have lead to extreme weather over the northern hemisphere, including the UK.

Pieces of a puzzle

The hiatus is a complex product of a combination of lots of factors and unravelling how their influences compare is likely to take some time yet.

On top of natural variability, there are smaller contributions from a dip in solar activity and a rise in aerosol pollution to consider, which have an overall cooling effect.

As for how much longer the hiatus will last, it?s probably fair to say making predictions with any degree of certainty is still quite a long way off.","Fri, 01 Jul 2016 14:05:15 GMT",http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/325877/where-is-global-warming-going_infographic_550x359.jpg,"['data', 'stick', 'pacific', 'hiatus', 'surface', 'scientists', 'oceans', 'decade', 'ocean', 'warming', 'atlantic', 'say', 'heat']", ,none
98,98,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN,Economic Milestone: Devaluation Of The Rupee (1966) - Forbes India,https://www.forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-devaluation-of-the-rupee-(1966)/38407/1,"Image: Getty Images Prime Minister Indira Gandhi?s move became very unpopular

On June 6, 1966, in one fell swoop, the Indira Gandhi government devalued the Indian rupee by 57 percent, from Rs 4.76 to Rs 7.50 to a dollar, triggering bitter criticism in the Parliament and media. The people, too, joined in claiming that this was the ultimate ?sell-out to America and the World Bank?.



The move, however, was in the offing for some time. Since Independence, India had held the dollar constant at Rs 4.76 in spite of increased trade deficits and a reliance on foreign aid to maintain a constant valuation. The final straw was the wars India fought (with China and Pakistan) and the shock of a major drought in 1965-1966. Each instance increased deficit spending, further accelerating the already severe inflation. Besides, the World Bank, largely funded by the US, fell short of its promised aid inflows to India.



Even though PM Indira Gandhi took all the flak for the move, her predecessor Lal Bahadur Shastri (who died of a cardiac arrest during his trip to Tashkent in early 1966) had set the stage for it. According to former diplomat BK Nehru?s account (in his book Nice Guys Finish Second), Shastri is also said to have ?eased out? his finance minister the previous year for opposing this devaluation.



The Indian government took the step to counter soaring inflation, but it turned out to be very unpopular and laid the foundation for distrust between the people and the government. The devaluation had its ramifications abroad as well; Oman, Qatar and the UAE, countries which used the Gulf Rupee (issued by the RBI), were forced to come up with their own currencies.



According to Rohit Lamba, post-doctoral fellow at Cambridge-INET at the faculty of economics, University of Cambridge, ?Strictly speaking, public perception/reception should not matter for macroeconomic policy. History remembers politicians and policymakers who do the unpopular but economically sound. However, no policy decision is or should be devoid of the politics of it, especially in a democracy. With the state of affairs as they were in 1966, the devaluation was unavoidable. We can argue how we got into that state but that is another debate.?
