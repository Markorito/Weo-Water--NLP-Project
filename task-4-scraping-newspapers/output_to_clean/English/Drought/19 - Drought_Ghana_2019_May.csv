The leader of the west African nation has encouraged the 33-year-old to make himself available for next month's continental showpiece

Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo has urged Kayserispor striker Asamoah Gyan to change his decision to call time on his international career, with just a month remaining before the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) starts in Egypt.

The President made his plea during a phone conversation with the 33-year-old, following a high-powered meeting with the leadership of the Black Stars on Tuesday. Gyan shocked the country when he announced his retirement on Monday.

The forward is Ghana's most capped player and the all-time top scorer of 51 goals in 106 matches. He had written about his displeasure at a decision made by the technical team to hand him the less prestigious and more advisory 'General Captain' role.

""The President of the Republic Nana Akufo-Addo, this afternoon, held a meeting with the Minister for Youth and Sports, the President of the GFA Normalisation Committee, and the Chair of the Management Committee of the Senior National Football Team, the Black Stars,"" director of communications at Ghana's presidency Eugene Arhin wrote in a new statement.

""The meeting, a continuation of the regular meetings the President holds with them, discussed, amongst others, the preparations being made towards Afcon 2019, and how to end Ghana’s Afcon trophy drought.

""Nana Akufo-Addo subsequently, also spoke on the telephone with Asamoah Gyan, and informed him of the considerable national disquiet over his decision to retire from the Black Stars.

""The President urged him, in the national interest, to rescind his decision to retire from the Black Stars, and make himself available for selection by Coach Kwasi Appiah.""

Meanwhile, Gyan is rethinking the whole matter and will make a new announcement on Wednesday. ""Later today, my manager [Sammy Anim Addo] will be speaking on my behalf regarding my retirement from the national team. I will also release a statement based on the telephone discussion with the president [Nana Akufo-Addo],"" Gyan tweeted on Wednesday morning.

The Black Stars technical team member shares his thoughts on the team's objective for the upcoming tournament in Egypt

Ghana technical coordinator Stephen Appiah has reiterated the Black Stars' desire to win the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, but insists the team are ""not under pressure"" to clinch the trophy.

James Kwesi Appiah's outfit are set for another attempt to rule the continent after a 37-year-title drought, having reached the semi-final of the last six tournaments and making the final in 2010 and 2015.

In Egypt, Ghana have been drawn in Group F alongside defending champions Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau.

“Our goal is to win the Afcon. We are not under pressure though,"" Appiah, a former Ghana international and captain, said as reported by Graphic.

""Personally, [even back in] my playing days, I usually didn't get under pressure. I have been under pressure only twice - that is [ahead of a 2006 World Cup qualifier] against Burkina Faso in Kumasi and another against Cape Verde.

“I realised that when I was playing, I just wore the jersey and went and played. But now that I am part of the technical team I see it to be difficult, the feeling is not the same.

“We will try to advise and encourage the players to do their best.""

Ghana will open their campaign against Benin on June 25 and face Cameroon four days later.

The Black Stars' last group game will be against Guinea-Bissau on July 2.

The winger sheds light on his immediate goal following his maiden invite to the national team ahead of the continental championship

Serbian-based attacker Samuel Owusu has set his sights on winning a place in Ghana's final squad for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

The 23-year-old was among the surprise names on a provisional 29-man roster unveiled for the four-time winners, which is set to be whittled down to 23 for the June 21-July 19 championship.

In his first ever call-up to the Black Stars, he is set to join the team for a pre-tournament camp in the UAE, which begins on June 1.

""It means a lot to me to be named in the squad to represent the country,"" Owusu told Ghanasoccernet.

""I was very happy and excited that fateful day.

""I believe in myself and I will train very hard to get my play in the final 23.""

Owusu's call-up is a reward for his fine form for club side Cukaricki in the Serbian Super Liga last season.

The former Genclerbirligi winger made 32 outings - all starts - netted seven times and assisted 10 goals to help the Hill Men finish the campaign in fourth position.

Ghana have been drawn against Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau in Group F for the Africa Cup of Nations.

The Black and Gold's boss has revealed a detailed update on the fitness of the Ghana right-back

Ghana have received an injury boost ahead of the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt as injured US-based fullback Harrison Afful is set to resume training by the end of the month.

The Columbus Crew right-back has been out of action since suffering a broken jaw during a Major Soccer League game against Atlanta United on March 30.

A return to practice before the end of the month will put him in a good position to be selected for the June 21 - July 19 Afcon, where the Black Stars have been drawn against Cup holders Cameroon, as well as Benin and Guinea-Bissau in Group F.

“The biggest thing is he [Afful] kept his nutrition up. He didn’t lose much [weight], which is rare. So that’s good,” Crew coach Caleb Porter said, as reported by The Columbus Dispatch.

“He’s pretty much on track to be cleared a couple of days before New York City FC [on June 1], but that’s not including fitness.

""That’s not including full contact and being in. So he’ll need a couple of weeks still to be ready.”

Ghana's hopes of ending their 37-year trophy drought but are currently facing a huge challenge by injuries to key players.

Leicester City defender Daniel Amartey is unlikely to make the team as he is just about finding his way back to fitness after picking up an injury while in league action in October last year.

Crystal Palace midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp is similarly on his way back to full fitness after picking up an injury in April while Udinese centre-back Nicholas Opoku has been out of action since the same month.

The Turkey-based duo of captain Asamoah Gyan and left-back Lumor Agbenyenu only recently returned from injuries.

The ex-Black Stars attacker shares his thoughts on the possible inclusion of Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng in the Ghana Afcon squad

Former Ghana international Nii Odartey Lamptey says the ultimate decision regarding Ghana's possible selection of Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt should be left with coach James Kwesi Appiah.

Barcelona forward Boateng, 32, and 34-year-old Muntari, who currently plays for Spanish second tier side Albacete Balompie, have both expressed an interest in joining the Black Stars for the continental gathering after a five-year absence.

The have been away from national duty since being sent home from camp during the 2014 Fifa World Cup in Brazil.

""You can't buy experience. Experience is important,"" Lamptey told Kwese Sports.

""If Kwesi Appiah and his technical team believe they [Muntari and Boateng] will help the team, why not?

""They [technical team] should be able to invite them, but if anything happens they [technical team] will be held responsible.

""Somebody like Sulley, you can't take many thing away from him but with Kevin, I have seen him play only once for the national team when we went to the World Cup.

""With Sulley, yes I can give him that opportunity.""

At the World Cup, Muntari and Boateng were both sent home on the morning of Ghana's must-win group game against Portugal for separate offences.

Boateng was handed an indefinite suspension for ‘verbal insults’ targeted at coach James Kwesi Appiah during training, while Muntari was sacked for a ""physical assault"" on a management committee member.

According to the Ghana Football Association, only a formal apology from each of the two players could open up an opportunity for a return to national duty.

Muntari sent in his apology in June 2016 but Boateng has remained unapologetic.

A white paper from a presidential Committee of Enquiry, which investigated matters relating to Ghana's controversial 2014 World Cup campaign, recommended that the two players be kept out of the national team.

The Camp Nou legend is hoping a managerial career will lead him back to Catalunya, but is aware that he needs to prove him deserving of the role

Xavi is making no secret of his desire to one day return to Barcelona as manager, but a Camp Nou icon concedes that “it’s not time yet” for him to think about filling such a role.

A man who spent 17 years as part of the first-team set-up in Catalunya is approaching the end of an illustrious playing career.

At the age of 39, the World Cup winner has announced he will retire at the end of the season with Qatari outfit Al Sadd.

Once his boots have been hung up, Xavi intends to move into coaching.

The dream is that he will prove as successful off the field as he was on it, allowing him to one day return to his roots at Barcelona.

He is, however, aware that he has a long road ahead and needs to prove himself deserving of filling such a post.

Xavi told TV3: “I don't see myself [coaching Barcelona] yet as I can't start my career as a coach of Barcelona's first team, it's not normal.

“I must prove myself as a coach and start from scratch. It would be too quick to go back to Barcelona, or to coach a La Liga team.

“It's obviously my objective to enjoy myself at Barcelona [as head coach one day], but I have to be very prepared and it's not the time yet.”

Despite having severed ties with Barca in 2015, Xavi has kept a close eye on events at Camp Nou.

He has seen Ernesto Valverde’s side close on a La Liga and Copa del Rey double this season, but a stunning Champions League semi-final collapse against Liverpool has left the Blaugrana waiting on more European honours.

“I think Barcelona have to dominate games again, otherwise it is impossible to win the Champions League,” Xavi added.

“That's what history tells us as Barcelona first won the Champions League when they were winning La Liga and dominating matches.

“I think that now we aren't dominating [games] much.”

Xavi will continue to support Barca from afar once his playing days are over, with an all-time great admitting that he has been incredibly fortunate to achieve as much as he has.

An eight-time La Liga title winner who also boasts four Champions League crowns, two European Championship successes and a World Cup to his name, said of his remarkable career: “Everything has been a fairy tale.

“The recognition on a personal and football level, as well as all the trophies, the experiences, what I have enjoyed on the pitch, and feeling important at Barcelona and with the national team.”","Sat, 18 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['league', 'xavi', 'day', 'prove', 'job', 'camp', 'barcelona', 'nou', 'coach', 'managerial', 'soon', 'la', 'wants', 'champions', 'liga', 'think']", ,none

Not to mention any other basic human needs. Such is the agony of millions of children, women and men in the eastern Somali land.

Plants and animals equally face the dilemma, but how can the sun shine on those kneeling when it is not yet shining on those standing? Massive crop failures and animal losses are recorded yearly. Rapid spread of diseases including cholera and diarrhea.

Have you considered if your water was to become sunken into earth, then who could bring you flowing water

The United Nations warned in March 2019 that 20 million people face the threat of famine in Somalia, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen and that “the world is facing the worst humanitarian crisis’‘.

But how many times has the United Nations not warned of severe droughts running into humanitarian crisis in Somalia? Even as recent as in May 2019.

What difference do warnings make in a region shooting itself in the foot with dragging conflicts that destabilizes the county every now and then?

The conflict factor

Undoubtedly droughts are natural phenomena. Prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall leading to water shortages.

This however occurs in several parts of the world although the intensity may differ. So why is that of Somalia worrying?

The land is entangled in nature’s web of seasonal droughts as a result of two seasons of no rainfall.

It is so intense that life is unbearable in most affected areas, causing acute shortage of food because of crops failure and animal death. This even caused many to evacuate the areas.

However, the incessant conflicts that spring up in these areas due to the constant struggles between successive Somali governments and Al Shabaab, to end terrorism and to create conditions for peace, defeats the efforts to reach the most affected.

It’s been over 25 long years of conflict in Somalia. Clearly not just the drought but the conflicts exacerbate the situation.

International community

Rainfall remains an uncontrollable factor in the Somali crisis equation and the struggle for peace keeps dangling, while millions of lives are just on the crossroads of death, as if waiting for it.

Refugees are being refused entry into other countries all over the world. How is the world expecting these innocent women and children to survive? And on who does the onus lie?

A disease that affects one part of the body, indirectly affects other parts too. This is an African proverb that originates from the Akans in Ghana. Although the international community is pushing in aid, the crisis must be faced head-on.

Efforts must be intensified to uproot or neutralize the growing conflict others are taking advantage of.

The spiritual factor

Could the crisis in Somalia have a spiritual dimension? Rainfall is one of the gifts of nature and considered a blessing from the creator of the universe.

What does Allah say about rainfall in the Qur’an, considering that majority of Somalis are Muslims, with a small community of Christians and other faiths.

“And we send down rain from the sky in a measured amount and we cause it to soak in the soil, and we certainly are able to take it away,’‘ says Qu’ran 23:18

“Have you considered if your water was to become sunken into earth,then who could bring you flowing water?’‘ Al Mulk 67:30 queries.

The same rain that survives lives is what the Bible emphasizes was used by God to destroy the disobedient in ancient days.

Throughout history, man has not been able to create rainfall, the most is to know if at all the rains will fall.

Like a double edged sword the Qur’an teaches prayers for seeking rain during times of drought. The prayer according to many scholars is similar to the one performed during the Eid prayers and can be performed where the Eid is performed.

As Somalis gear towards the end of the Ramadan season this year and prepare for the Eid, perhaps this could be the solution to this crawling crises.","Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/923971/1024x538_923971.jpg?1559055502,"['somalia', 'world', 'water', 'surviving', 'rain', 'eid', 'droughts', 'somali', 'crisis', 'need', 'quran', 'rainfall']", ,drought

The former England star says the current Three Lions winger has shown maturity well beyond his years

Shaun Wright-Phillips says that Raheem Sterling has proven to be the ""perfect role model"" for young players, despite the fact that the Manchester City star is still a ""baby"" himself.

Sterling was one of City's top players this season as the England star fired 17 goals while providing 10 assists during the team's Premier League title-winning campaign.

Meanwhile, the winger has also become one of the game's loudest voices when it comes to combating racism, having recently revealed that he wants to meet with the English FA and Premier League leaders in an effort to discuss the issue.

And Wright-Phillips says that level of maturity is hard to find in a young footballer, and that's what makes Sterling one to look up to.

""I’ve been very impressed with Sterling this year, both on and off the pitch, and he has shown that he is the perfect role model for a new kid coming through. He has seen what it takes, he has gone and done it and dealt with the bad stuff that has come with it, that he never even had a say in,"" Wright-Phillips told AmericanGambler.com.

""People forget that Sterling is still young, in footballing terms he’s still a baby. He’s meant to be learning but he’s dealing with things that a more experienced pro should be dealing with, and doing it perfectly. He’s answered everything in the right way by letting his football do the talking. It’s very powerful what he has done.""

Racism continues to be a problem across the footballing landscape, with Sterling one of several players calling for harsher punishments for offenders.

Danny Rose, Sterling's England team-mate, says that he has ""had enough"" of racist taunting and can't wait to retire because of how prevalent the abuse is in the game.

Wright-Phillips says he understands how hard it is to properly eradicate racism, but he does believe that banning fans is a good place to start.

""To an extent I agree that the FA hasn’t done that much to tackle the problem of racism, but it’s hard to police racism for the FA. How do they police it? Unless someone makes people aware of what has happened within a stadium, the FA would never know that it is happening,"" he said.

""I would just ban the fans. I think it’s everywhere and it’s just whether it comes out or not – some people get ahead of themselves and it just comes out.

""When I say ban the fans, not to punish people, but so that fans will start policing it themselves. I don’t want to bring my kid to a stadium and sit next to somebody who is shouting racist chants, because it’s going to make kids think that it’s okay to do it. It’s not only affecting players, but it is affecting kids that are growing up now, and are going to be bringing their kids in future.

""It needs to be nipped in the bud somewhere, and I would just ban those fans for life, and don’t allow them into any football stadium in England.""","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['fans', 'role', 'perfect', 'young', 'shaun', 'stars', 'model', 'pitch', 'fa', 'hes', 'star', 'raheem', 'sterling', 'praises', 'racism', 'wrightphillips', 'england', 'players']", ,none

Mahmoud Alaa converted a 55th-minute VAR spot-kick to give Zamalek a 1-0 second-leg win over Renaissance Sportive Berkane of Morocco and leave the teams tied at 1-1 on aggregate.

With no extra-time in CAF club matches, the final went to a shootout and Zamalek converted all five penalties to win 5-3 before a near-capacity crowd in the 86 000-seat stadium.

The regular-time penalty and those in the shootout were all expertly taken, with their power and placement giving Berkane goalkeeper Abdelali Mhamdi no chance.

Success came as a massive relief to the Cairo-based club, who play some fixtures at the Borg el Arab stadium almost 200km north-west of the capital for security reasons.

After winning nine CAF titles between 1984 and 2003, Zamalek failed to add another until the victory over Berkane in a match that kicked off late Sunday and stretched into Monday.

There was a mix of relief and joy for the predominantly Zamalek-supporting crowd after the shootout as they became the third most successful club in CAF competitions with 10 titles.

Al Ahly, Cairo neighbours of Zamalek and their greatest rivals for more than a century, have won 19 African titles and TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo 11.

It was the fourth time in 16 finals that a shootout decided the outcome with Hearts of Oak of Ghana, Stade Malien of Mali and MAS Fes of Morocco winning finals on penalties.

Second Swiss winner

Zamalek coach and former Tottenham Hotspur manager Christian Gross became the second Swiss handler to lift the Confederation Cup after Michel Decastel in 2007 with a Tunisian club.

The second leg result in Alexandria could have been different had Hamdi Laachir not squandered a clearcut early chance for Berkane, blazing over from close range.

Soon after, Zamalek came close to cancelling the 1-0 lead the Moroccans took into the return match when a Youssef ‘Obama’ Ibrahim lob beat the goalkeeper but went over the bar.

The Ethiopian referee initially ignored Zamalek penalty appeals early in the second half, but was persuaded by players to review a goalmouth incident and ruled that Najji Larbi handled.

Alaa blasted the penalty into the net, setting up a tense second half with Berkane sensing that if they scored an away goal, they would almost certainly win their first CAF final.

But an experienced Zamalek defence, backed by 31-year-old goalkeeper Mahmoud ‘Gennesh’ Abdel Rahim, held firm to force the penalty shootout.

Substitute Khalid Boutaib scored from the first spot-kick for Zamalek, then Laachir fired embarrassingly wide to immediately put Berkane on the back foot.

It proved a crucial miss as Alaa, Abdallah Gomaa, Youssef Ibrahim, and substitute Ayman Sayed scored for the Egyptian White Knights to finally end their African title jinx.

Success for Zamalek confirmed the north African dominance of the Confederation Cup with 11 winning club coming from the region.

Today, thousands of Africans are hitting the streets in towns and villages across the continent to demand climate justice and the end of fossil fuels investments, which are causing a climate crisis on a planetary scale. Organized under the slogan #AfrikaVuka (Vuka means “to awaken” in isiZulu), this regional day of action coincides with the celebration of African Day on May 25, a symbol of the aspiration of Africans to self-determination and the fight against the looting of natural resources.

Throughout Africa the fossil fuels business, particularly coal, continues to grow at an impressive rate. New coal-fired plants are being projected from South Africa to Senegal, from Kenya to Mozambique, via the DRC and Ivory Coast. In recent years, Chinese banks have become the last resort for African coal projects when other financial institutions refuse to finance these dirty fuels, the main source of carbon emissions. South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Ghana, Kenya and Madagascar are among the countries where Chinese investments in coal projects are envisaged in the coming years.

Deadly cyclones after a year of drought and water stress

In the space of two months, two powerful cyclones shook southern and eastern Africa. Cyclone Idai alone has taken the lives of more than 1000 people, with dozens of others still missing. The United Nations estimated that Idai and subsequent flooding caused damage worth more than $1 billion in infrastructure only. More than 100,000 homes have been damaged, with at least 1 million hectares of crops smashed. The city of Beira in Mozambique is by far the most affected, having been destroyed at 80%.

Extreme weather events like Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth have been particularly devastating on the African continent where the means of prevention and adaptation are weak and the response capacity rather limited. Such tropical cyclones could become more frequent and deadly as a result of climate change in countries that are historically the least responsible for global warming.

As the continent most affected by climate change, African countries must have a strong interest in limiting the temperature below 1.5° C as prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last October. For millions of Africans, it is a question of survival as the impacts of global warming hit them hard. For countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have experienced more frequent and intense climatic extremes over the past 10 years, a global warming scenario above 1.5° C would be particularly dramatic. South Africa, the biggest continental emitter of greenhouse gases, recently faced one of its most severe drought and water crises to date, in Cape Town, pushing the government to declare the water crisis a national disaster.

Africa is today at a crossroad, faced with a crucial choice: following an outdated and dangerous energy model that could dramatically increase its climate vulnerability, or turning resolutely towards a 100% renewable economy. A rapid transition without coal is technically and economically feasible. However, it will require strong political leadership, an immediate halt to proposed coal-fired power plants, clear plans to phase out existing power plants, in addition to a rapid and unprecedented roll-out of efficiency measures in the sectors of energy, agriculture, industry and transport.

Refusing to cross arms and helplessly see these natural disasters without taking action, African civil society is organizing and resisting. In Kenya, popular resistance has delayed the construction of the Lamu coal-fired power plant since 2014. Same story in Bargny in Senegal and San Pedro in Cote D’Ivoire, where the popular pressure and the opposition against the proposed coal-fired power plants are growing on a daily basis. In South Africa, banks that finance coal projects are under fire from critics to change their energy investment choices.

Young people are stepping up as leaders in the fight against climate change. Since the beginning of this year, there has been an increased number of mobilisations in high schools, campuses and public places, youth refusing to be condemned to a polluted future by greenhouse gas emissions that only benefit a handful of immoral investors and leaders. In Abuja, Nigeria, some 20 secondary schools will march to parliament, asking MPs to finally pass the climate bill and put the country on the path to climate justice.

Beyond requiring national leaders and financial institutions to engage more concretely in the fight for climate justice based on renewable energies, African civil society and environmental activists are sending a strong message that Africa is not for sale.

The reigning champions need a win to secure another title and the coach feels they deserve to be at the top of the table

Pep Guardiola says he wants his Manchester City players to be ""nervous"" as they look to seal the Premier League title on the last day of the season.

City are on the verge of a second consecutive title triumph as they approach Sunday's trip to Brighton holding a one-point lead over challengers Liverpool, who are at home to Wolves.

As the tension builds ahead of the title decider, Guardiola says his players will benefit from the expectation weighing on them.

""There's pressure but that's nice,"" the 48-year-old told Sky Sports. ""We are playing for something unique, to win the Premier League.

""It is difficult to win once in a lifetime, imagine two. The players have to feel the pressure, to be nervous, to know it will be difficult. But when that happens and it works, it's nicer.""

Guardiola's team have clawed their way back from being 13 points behind Liverpool at the end of 2018 to lead the table, having won all but one game since the turn of the year.

And the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach says the reigning champions are worthy of their place at the top after forcing their way back into the race.

""When we were three points behind Liverpool, people were saying that chasing them was better,"" he said. ""No, it was better to be leading because it is in your hands.

""We have won the last 13 games so we deserve to be in this position. And we are going to defend it.""

With one game left to go, the coach wants his side to go all out to ensure they take home the trophy when they line up against a Brighton side already certain to stay up this term.

""Go out there, be aggressive, be focused in all departments, and try to score as many goals as possible,"" he added.

""For a few weeks it has been in our hands. That's what we wanted.""","Sat, 11 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['title', 'pep', 'chasing', 'win', 'nice', 'man', 'better', 'won', 'liverpool', 'city', 'coach', 'way', 'leading', 'guardiola', 'pressure', 'boss', 'players']", ,none

After finishing runners-up on four previous occasions, FC Midtjylland have finally claimed their first Danish Cup with Australian Awer Mabil playing a decisive role.

Source: a1radioonline.com

The weather pattern in the northern parts of Ghana is characterized by low rainfalls and prolonged periods of drought.



For this reason, farmers in the upper east region, unlike their counterparts in the south, cannot engage in all-year-round cultivation of crops. They also lose many of their livestock because the animals die of thirst in the dry seasons.



The end result of this is the migration of the youth to the southern parts, in search of almost non-existent greener pastures.



To help mitigate this problem, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, as flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party in 2016, made a campaign promise to construct dams in every village in the Northern part of the country.



“You have been hearing me talking about “One District, One factory”. As far as this part of the world is concerned, I even want to go further and talk about 1 Village 1 Dam, to make sure that in every village, we have a functioning dam to support agriculture”



Nana Akufo-Addo, announced the “1 Village, 1 Dam” promise before the Bolgatanga traditional council. He was on a campaign tour of the Upper East Region, accompanied by his running mate Dr. Mahamadu Bawumia.



This campaign promised instantly became the talk across the country because it touched on a very important sector of the economy – Agriculture.



The New Patriotic Party eventually won the 2016 general elections and Akufo-Addo became the President of Ghana.



Perhaps, 1 Village, 1 Dam was not the only promise that resonated with the Ghanaian people but it certainly was one promise that gave farmers in northern Ghana some hope.



Paramount Chief of the Sekote Traditional Area, Naba Sigri Bewong recounts how on that day, Nana Akufo-Addo received his request for a dam in his area.



“He and the Vice President came to my palace and when they heard that, for 8 months this place became dry, no water, they felt sad and said they will do something about it”, he said.



Naba Bewong who confirmed that some dams have been constructed in his area in line with the promise, however, cannot tell whether or not, the dams can contain water for all year round farming.



Now in the third year of this government, not much is seen of the well-touted “1 Village, 1 Dam” policy in the Upper East Region.



The Upper East Region was allocated with 140 of the dams promised but only 40 are said to have been constructed so far, in all the 15 Municipalities and Districts of the region.



The 1 Village 1 Dam project first started in the Bongo District with a promise to ensure value for money.



Douglas Twum, the Engineer of the Construction Company awarded the contract, the Abooh 1 Company, at the time, assured the DCE and people of Bongo that they will ensure that good quality of work was done.



“When we went through the procurement process, we did not come victorious just because we have a company but we have the experience in building dams that is why we were able to go through”, he boasted.



The Bongo district was allocated 10 dams. But just 4 dams are at various stages of completion.



According to residents of the Bongo district, the construction of each of these dams lasted less than a week, raising questions as to whether any serious work was done on these dams.



“The way things are going, very soon it will silt up. So whatever the purpose for which it was constructed, I am not too sure.” Joseph Atisiba, Assembly member of Ayopia, stated.



Its depth is about 6 feet. To the far end of this dam is a fragile-looking embankment.



As shallow as the dam looks, a spillway has been created at one end. The very nature of this dam for the residents of Gono, makes it a death trap.



Similar sentiments were raised at Dachio, still in the Bolga East District. The dam there looks like 2-acres of cleared farmland surrounded by trees. The embankment has no stones to make it stronger. It looks weak and could break away in the event of a heavy rain.



The Chief of Dachio, Naba Akaliga II said he was optimistic that a new dam in his area will promote dry season farming but he was disappointed after seeing what was constructed as a dam.



Naba Akaliga II in an angry tone, described their newly constructed dam as similar to a football field.



“It’s only for children to be playing football but not a dam. It is a piece of Football Park being constructed. Because, the depth of the dam is not known, so in fact it is not a dam”, he quipped.



At Kajelo in the Kassena-Nankana West District, the embankment to the dam had been washed away at the time of my visit. The Assembly member for the area, Hilary Aniakwo lamented that the dam was shoddily constructed.









“You can see that there is shoddy work here. The compression of the dam is like they have just poured sand there and gone away. So the rain has exposed the shoddy work of the contractor”, Aniakwo lamented.



Apart from the poor quality of the dams, the contractors seem to have failed to put safety measures around them, to protect residents.



Residents of Bongo and Bolgatanga say the dams are death traps because 3 lives each have been lost in the two areas.



“One day, somewhere, around 3pm, I was in town when I received a call that 3 children, the ages were around 9, 10 and 11, got drowned in a newly constructed dam under the 1 Village 1 Dam project”, Assembly member for Bolga Soe, Richard Abagna stated.



The District Chief Executive for Bongo, Peter Ayinbisa says the drowning of residents in the newly constructed dams were due to construction defects which were yet to be corrected.



“I think in Bongo we have recorded 3 deaths or so. Every dam when you are constructing, you must make provision for a gentle gradient slops but in this case the contractor did not make that provision”, Mr. Ayinbisa told A1 news.



Upper East Regional Minister, Paulina Patience Abayage expressed regrets about the deaths recorded at the 1 Village 1 Dam project dams and vowed not to sign contract certificates for the dams that have defects.









“Some of them have been defective. Two of them have come to my attention so far; one in Kajelo in the Kassena-Nankana West District and one in Soe in the Bolga Municipality. The only thing I can assure you as the regional minister, is that, I sitting here will ensure there is value for money. So I have told the consultant that from now, I am putting on hold the signing of payment certificates”



The regional minister touted the NPP campaign promise as an achievement, indicating that the dams constructed will serve the purpose of all year round farming.



But President of the Millar Institute for Transdisciplinary and Development Studies, Professor David Millar who is also an agriculturalist and development consultant, thinks that the government has failed in the implementation of the 1 village, 1 dam campaign promise.



“And a test of a dam, give them three years, most of them will dry out if they are not well-designed. That is why I say for the whole idea, I will give them 20%, and the 80% is all failure.”



Professor Millar who was also a member of the National Development Planning Commission which once designed the 40-year development plan, lauded the idea of dams in Northern Ghana for all year round farming but said the implementation of the policy has so far, been poor.



“It is all part of the blame that we have for manifestos. If you want to do a plan based on manifesto, which is four years, and one year you are using it to learn on the job, the fourth year they are preparing for elections again, it means they are trying to implement many things in two years and it is not possible. Next year, they are going to be running around digging holes everywhere” he said.



The implementation of the 1 Village 1 Dam policy in the Upper East Region was meant to provide sources of water, mainly for farming and for animals to drink.



Unfortunately, it appears that the policy which could be providing jobs to many unemployed youth, is becoming a fiasco in the region.



On paper, 40 out of the 140 dams promised the region have been constructed. But even then, the work done on these dams can only be described as shoddy.



It remains to be seen though, whether the government will inspect the dams constructed so far and order for proper work to be done and perhaps, turn things around and deliver on the 1 Village 1 Dam campaign promise before its current tenure of office runs out.

22,22,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Kenya’s shilling management is flirting with disaster - The Africa Report,https://www.theafricareport.com/13216/kenyas-shilling-management-is-flirting-with-disaster/,"The IMF last year reclassified the shilling as a managed rather than a floating currency, leading to protests from the authorities who insist that the currency is fairly valued and that the only interventions are to reduce volatility.

The difference amounts to much more than word play, according to Reginald Kadzutu, chief investment officer at Amana Capital in Nairobi, in research published this month. The Kenyan shilling has lost 50% of its purchasing power since 2009, yet the exchange rate has declined by only 20%, the report argues. That implies a shilling overvaluation of 30%, Kadzutu argues: “It is a glaring picture that shows a mismatch in the national statistics.”

Kenya needs dollars to service its foreign debt and pay for imports. The trade deficit grew by 26% from 2013 to 2018, but the resulting demand for dollars is not accurately reflected in the exchange rate. “The country has been operating a managed shilling rather than a free float currency,” he says.

An overvalued shilling, Kadzutu argues, will make the country’s exports uncompetitive.

“The current account deficit will not go anywhere until the Kenya shilling goes to the level it is supposed to be.”

The deficit will be compounded by drought, meaning more grains imports, and the decline of the domestic industry, meaning more sugar imports, Kadzutu says.

“Controlled devaluation”

Kenya’s restrictive interest-rate regime has prevented banks from lending to the private sector as they cannot balance risk and return, Kadzutu argues. This has starved the private sector of credit growth. Kadzutu says that private-sector credit is growing at 4% instead of the required 12%, meaning the prospect of reduced tax revenue and higher debt.

Johnson Nderi, corporate finance manager at ABC Capital in Nairobi, does not agree that the shilling is being artificially supported. He says the stability is due to low inflation and remittances.

Nderi accepts that fiscal policy is a key weakness in a context of growing debt-service costs.

Recurrent expenditure is perennially above tax-revenue collection and one out of four tax shillings collected goes to paying interest, he says.

Kadzutu sees an economy that is “waiting for a spark” before imploding. The current framework will be able to sustain slow growth for the next three to five years, he argues. In the long run, he predicts a “drastic drop” in the level of the shilling that will cause the economy to collapse. A falling shilling, he argues, will lead to panic demand for the dollar, pushing the shilling further down and leading to a temporary withdrawal of foreign funds from the capital markets. The central bank will be unable to deal with the resulting supply-side inflation. Corporate defaults will increase, as will the number of non-performing loans held by banks.

To avoid such a scenario, Kadzutu says, Kenya should carry out a “controlled devaluation” of the shilling to allow it to reach its true market value. Businesses should reduce risks by cutting foreign-denominated debt.

Bottom line:

Secretly managed currencies usually get heavily punished in the end, with Turkey being a recent example. Kenya urgently needs to allow the shilling to find its true value.","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2019/05/Webp.net-resizeimage-5-1.jpg,"['meaning', 'kenya', 'management', 'argues', 'flirting', 'disaster', 'kenyas', 'managed', 'deficit', 'capital', 'kadzutu', 'currency', 'imports', 'shilling']", ,drought

24,24,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Global charity calls for funding to feed hungry Somali children - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/global-charity-calls-for-funding-to-feed-hungry-somali-children/,"International charity Save the Children on Thursday called on the international community to scale up funding to provide lifesaving services to children in Somalia’s semi-autonomous region of Puntland.

The charity said in a new assessment report that just one in four children in Puntland has access to sufficient food, meaning three in four children are far more likely to succumb to the impact of yet another drought, which is expected to devastate the region in the coming months.

“It is imperative that the international community step up to this challenge, and work with the government of Somalia to scale up our humanitarian interventions to ensure children and families have enough access to food through this critical time,” said Timothy Bishop, Save the Children’s country director in Somalia.

According to a needs-assessment conducted in March, 73 percent of the children in the surveyed households in Puntland are consuming two or fewer meals a day, with families reporting increased food prices and drought-related livestock deaths that have reduced their access to food.

The report notes nearly half of all respondents said the amount of food they eat has reduced over the past three months.

“As a result, families are borrowing from family and friends, and reducing the number of meals eaten in a day as a way to survive the acute food shortages they are experiencing,” says the report.

Bishop warned that without an immediate scale-up of funding to enable lifesaving services for drought-affected communities, the outcomes will be dire.

He said the Somali population, which has yet to recover from the 2017 drought, is now facing yet another major humanitarian crisis that cannot be ignored.

“We have the figures; we have the rain charts, and we know that without immediate action, children will suffer in the coming weeks and months,” Bishop said.

On Monday, the United Nations launched a Drought Response Plan, seeking 710 million U.S. dollars to provide critical lifesaving assistance to 4.5 million drought-affected Somalis in the most severely affected areas.

According to the UN, at least 2.2 million people in Somalia, including an estimated 930,000 children, are facing food shortages through the rest of the year due to the delayed and insufficient seasonal rainfall.

Vincent Kompany believes Manchester City have the hunger of a pack of lions as they approach a shot at history in the FA Cup final against Watford.

Pep Guardiola's men beat Brighton and Hove Albion 4-1 last weekend to prevail in a relentless title race against Liverpool, adding back-to-back Premier League triumphs to consecutive EFL Cups.

If City overcome a Hornets side they have already beaten twice this season they will become the first team to complete a clean sweep of England's domestic trophies in the same season.

And, with the treble on the line, Kompany is not about to let his team-mates take their collective eye off the ball.

""It's not about adding that achievement [the treble] to my CV, I don't care about my CV,"" he told reporters

""I know this team and they are like lions. When this team is hungry, they are such a special team. I'm going to do everything I can to put a bit of blood in that water, so this team gets even hungrier.

""My style is pretty simple. Every now and then, when things are getting too comfortable, I go a little aggressive in training or I speak up and say what I think.

""But the main thing is that these guys, together with the manager, are always able to understand what the priority is.

""We focus on winning games. Winning one [Premier League] title was not enough, it had been done before. Back to back – that is special.""

In City's penultimate game of the Premier League season, Kompany brought the house down at the Etihad Stadium with a screaming 25-yard winner against Leicester City – a moment he already ""feels like it happened two months ago"".

The 33-year-old Belgium centre-back lifted the FA Cup in 2011, when City ended a 35-year trophy drought by beating Stoke City 1-0, although heartache followed two years later at the national stadium when they were on the receiving end of an upset loss to Wigan Athletic.

It means he is on his guard ahead of what could be the last game of a decorated career with his club, as a new contract is yet to be agreed between City and their inspirational but frequently injury ravaged on-field leader.

27,27,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Moderate to extreme drought is affecting one-fifth of the country - Mexico News Daily,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/moderate-to-extreme-drought/,"Just over one-fifth of Mexico’s territory is affected by moderate to extreme drought, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).

The weather service said in a new report that 21.1% of the country is suffering from drought conditions, an increase of 4.4% compared to the previous report, published at the end of April.

“During the first half of May 2019, lower than normal rainfall was observed in much of the country, which caused an increase of moderate drought areas in the west, center and south . . . while in the border region between Guerrero, Oaxaca and Puebla a severe drought area has emerged,” the report said.

Part of the land in the catchment areas of the Coatzacoalcos, Grijalva and Usumacinta rivers is also considered to be in extreme drought, the SMN said, explaining that a total of 20 municipalities in Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca and Chiapas are affected.

In northern Veracruz and southern Tamaulipas, drought conditions have caused the deaths of thousands of head of cattle either because they didn’t have sufficient grass and water or because they became struck in mud while trying to drink from water-depleted dams.

Gonzalo Alemán, director of rural development in Altamira, Tamaulipas, said that 80% of the 600 dams on farms in the area are dry and that those that still have water will run out in a week or 15 days.

In the municipality of Tampico, drought has affected the water supply for 2,000 families, forcing them to rely on tanker truck deliveries.

While just over one-fifth of the country is officially in drought, a deputy director at the National Water Commission (Conagua) said that half of the nation’s territory is feeling the effects of a lack of rain.

“We have to remember that May is the month when the highest temperatures are recorded,” Víctor Alcocer Yamanaka added.

Wildfires spurred by the hot and dry conditions burned in more than half of Mexico’s 32 states last week.

Alcocer explained that the areas of the country suffering from drought this year are different to those affected in 2018.

“. . .Last year it was on the Pacific coast including Baja California . . . There was no drought in Veracruz, Chiapas, Tabasco or Campeche . . . The drought moved from the entire coastal zone of the Pacific towards the center [of the country] and downward,” he said.

Alcocer said that there has been no significant rain in the Coatzacoalcos, Grijalva and Usumacinta river basin areas for six months, adding that Conagua is taking action to protect the limited water available in the area.

“We already applied the program of anti-drought measures in those three rivers and the basin councils have been instructed to reduce water demand and supply the public using water tankers,” he explained.

The official said that weather forecasts indicate that drought conditions should ease in June, a month when the annual rainy season should start to bring much-needed precipitation to many parts of the country.

28,28,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Bundled green services drive farmer adoption of climate-smart agriculture - ICT Update,https://ictupdate.cta.int/en/article/bundled-green-services-drive-farmer-adoption-of-climate-smart-agriculture-sid09fc27ea3-bc04-4fcb-a0d1-3000a89b6756,"Experience with climate-smart agriculture (CSA) initiatives increasingly shows that delivering green services in isolation is an ineffective approach that produces disappointing outcomes. The provision of ‘bundled’ of products which are suited to farmers requirements is far more likely to promote CSA uptake, increasing sustainability and resilience to climate change as a result. Examples from different CTA projects show this approach in action.

Fatima is a farmer who grows crops and rears animals in Ayigbe rural community in Wenchi, Ghana to sell on the open market. She practises rainfed agriculture but complains that rainfall patterns are unpredictable or late, which makes it difficult for her to decide when to plant her crops and avoid losing them to drought.

Cocoa farmer Manti experiences similar challenges so has turned to producing charcoal as a way of supplementing his income. Due to the lack of electricity and high price of gas, charcoal is a popular and affordable energy source for many in his rural community. But charcoal production involves felling trees, resulting in deforestation, environmental degradation and global warming.

Not just technical knowledge

These stories paint a picture that matches the experiences of many rural farmers in ACP countries severely affected by climate change. FAO predicts that the global population is likely to increase to 50 billion by 2050, with most people located in developing countries, and vulnerable to climate change. But how do farmers view climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and what can enhance their capacity to adopt CSA solutions to ensure sustainable production and income?

Increasingly, it appears that technical knowledge alone may not be sufficient to increase farmer uptake of CSA practices. An approach based on making single green services available fails to consider other needs and circumstances. For example, helping Fatima to introduce good agronomic practices might increase crop yields, but she is also likely to need financial assistance and a good telecommunication network to enhance extension services. Most importantly, the services need to be market led, to ensure sustainability, and farmers need better access to markets, to secure adequate returns for their climate-smart efforts.

Bundled services in action

Bundled CSA services can come in different forms, but they must be designed to complement each other, if they are to provide the intended results. That may mean combining the public and private sectors. A case in point is Promoting of competitiveness of agriculture value in the Dominican Republic, a CTA-led project that partners with a private microfinance institute (ADOPEM) to provide micro-credits to farmers to implement good agricultural practices. Participating farmers are trained in sustainable agriculture and provided with services along the value chain for tuber crops, including marketing, storage, and handling of produce during transportation. As a result of this training, yields improved with banana rejection rates falling from 40% to 30% and exports of bananas boxes rose from 1,080 to 5,200.



The Scaling-up CSA solutions for cereals and livestock farmers in Southern Africa project offers farmers a bundled package that includes access to credit facilities, provision of extension services via SMS, and information about CSA practices in local languages. In Zimbabwe, the services are provided through the country’s Farmers Union, with information dissemination and digital registration of farmers handled by private telecommunications provider Econet. Overall, the project will increase the uptake of weather-based insurance by smallholder farmers; improve farmer’s access to weather information through the use of ICTs; improve access to technical interventions that increase crop productivity; and reduce risks under a changing climate.

Another example of a bundling service is CTA’s CLI-MARK project, which is working with private and public sector actors to scale up market mechanisms that increase the adaptive capacity of pastoralists in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. CTA has teamed up with the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction; the International Livestock Research Institute; private livestock insurers, Takaful Insurance in Kenya, and Oromia Insurance in Ethiopia; and weather data company aWhere, to facilitate the following:

design and delivery of a blended weather information system that incorporates the best of scientific and indigenous weather knowledge systems;

develop and implement mechanisms to scale up livestock insurance among pastoralists;

boost markets, trade and enterprises for women and youth to increase incomes and sustainable practices.

Through CLI-MARK, women’s producer groups have been able to increase fodder production, which has enabled livestock keepers to purchase bales of hay at much cheaper prices. All the indications are that a mix of blended interventions involving public and private sector players have a far better chance of producing long-term behaviour change that can lead to sustainable impact.","Sat, 18 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT","https://res.cloudinary.com/cta/image/upload/w_960,ar_1:1,g_faces:center,f_auto,c_fill/bundled-green-services-Adobe-Stock-1558707754302","['farmer', 'green', 'climatesmart', 'increase', 'csa', 'livestock', 'adoption', 'services', 'bundled', 'weather', 'sustainable', 'drive', 'farmers', 'rural', 'agriculture', 'private']", ,none

30,30,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Church rises from the waters once again as drought hits Chiapas - Mexico News Daily,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/church-rises-from-the-waters-once-again/,"A 17th-century church in Chiapas that has been covered by water for more than 50 years has once again shown its façade.

The Santiago Apóstol temple emerged after drought caused water levels to drop in the Nezahualcóyotl reservoir on the Grijalva river.

Drought is currently affecting just over one-fifth of Mexico’s territory including large parts of the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The Grijalva river catchment area is considered to be in extreme drought.

The church, built by Dominican friars in the town of Quechula in the mid-1600s, was completely submerged in 1966 as a result of the construction of the Nezahualcóyotl dam, which also flooded other nearby towns, forcing residents to relocate.

One rich landowner, Saúl Pérez, is said to have refused to leave his ranch but was forced to do so when water began lapping at his feet. His riches, including three chests of gold, were left behind and are believed to be buried under tonnes of sand at the bottom of the dam.

It’s only the third time since the reservoir’s completion that water levels have dropped enough to reveal the entirety of the colonial-era structure.

Despite being under water for more than half a century – and its age – the façade of the church is in relatively good condition. However, its walls collapsed during the powerful 8.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Chiapas in September 2017.

“It’s now falling to pieces,” local resident Antonio González Hernández told the news agency EFE.

“Five years ago [the structure] was intact. The bell tower was still in optimal condition.”

González said the church will disappear again during the rainy season, which runs from June to December. He explained that the water level dropped by 60 meters this year.

While the emergence of the church attracts tourists to the dam, bringing much-needed revenue into the region, the low water levels are causing problems for fishermen.

Osiel Álvarez Hernández said that catches have been down and that tree trunks in the water have damaged boats’ motors.

Located north of the state capital Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the Nezahualcóyotl reservoir was the first of several major dams to be built on the Grijalva river to generate hydroelectric energy.

The last time the Santiago Apóstol temple rose entirely out of the water was in 2015 when record drought conditions plagued southeastern Mexico.

31,31,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,GE Is Banking on Africa's Burgeoning Power Market - POWER magazine,https://www.powermag.com/ge-is-banking-on-africas-burgeoning-power-market/,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s power generation capacity is projected to surge 4% annually through 2040, and its current energy mix—which is today dominated by hydro and coal—will likely be more diversified as interest rises in renewables such as solar and wind, General Electric (GE) said in a white paper surveying market opportunities in the region that it released in May.

The region is characterized by a seeming “over-dependence on governments” to resolve an energy dilemma: “Governments are faced with investment, policy and regulatory framework challenges that oftentimes hinder their ability to fulfill the responsibility of providing affordable and reliable power,” the white paper says. However, with increasingly diverse funding from public and private sources, including innovative partnerships with private investors and independent power producers (IPPs), “the current narrative that two out of three people in the region needs access to electricity is expected to change,” it says. Among major trends the white paper highlights are that IPPs and public-private partnerships (PPP) will account for 35% of the region’s installed capacity, excluding South Africa, by 2020. “The IPP model, now the primary vehicle for investment in the region’s energy sector, is expected to grow in reach and beyond its current concentration,” it suggests.

“Transparent and credible regulatory oversight, dynamic power sector planning and committed and experienced equity partners further enable IPP participation in these economies,” GE noted. To date, Uganda, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal, Ghana, and South Africa have clear policies around private sector participation in their energy economies. In recent months, for example, 14 IPPs in Namibia committed to investing $111.7 million to add 70 MW of capacity to the national grid, reducing the country’s reliance on imports from the Southern Africa Power Pool. And in March 2019, the Development Bank of Southern Africa matched a $100 million fund extended to it by the United Nation’s Green Climate Fund (GCF) to support the development of microgrid projects. The $200 million investment is expected to add 330 MW of new generation capacity.

Africa has the crucial resources it needs to boost power capacity growth, the white paper suggests. Though many countries are eyeing renewables as part of decarbonization and decentralization efforts, “The timescale for development of renewables energy infrastructure means gas has a large window of opportunity to become the preferred fuel source in the short and medium term,” the paper says. Nigeria, Angola, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Senegal, for example, have large enough gas reserves for export to neighboring countries. Nigeria leads proven reserves at 5.3 trillion cubic meters, and Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, and Cameroon are key exporters of liquefied natural gas. The prospect of increasing regional trade from countries with gas, from Mozambique to South Africa and Nigeria to Western Africa, is also a growing trend.

Future market prospects, however, will also include increasing orders for solar power, especially for off-grid applications, as costs fall, and business models shift from peer-to-peer lending to the widespread use of mobile money technology. “In Kenya, M-Pesa, a platform that offers retail financial services via mobile phones, has enabled companies that provide rent-to-own solar energy solutions for the off-grid population through access to mobile money payments,” it notes.

Hydropower, which today accounts for more than 50% of generation in countries like Uganda, Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Togo, and Mozambique, will need to invest in storage systems to manage intermittency, especially due to climate events such as drought, and enable flexibility. Geothermal is also poised to see massive growth, from the current 664 MW installed region-wide to 15,000 MW—representing a $40 billion investment opportunity.

Digitization, through the broad spectrum of internet of things (IoT) solutions is also underway on a large scale as governments focus on increasing energy access and reducing transmission losses. “The proliferation of internet-enabled solutions such as smart grids, renewable energy integration, and automated metering are enhancing energy delivery optimization, particularly in South Africa and Kenya, where smart metering is reducing domestic and commercial consumption, increasing revenue collection rates and improving operational efficiency,” it says. However, the paper notes that digital technologies are poised to play a more-pronounced role in helping countries analyze and forecast power demand, provide customer insights, and improve the customer experience.

Yet, sub-Saharan Africa faces myriad challenges. Two factors that could determine the viability of the region’s energy sector are “financial sustainability of utilities and tariff affordability,” it notes. Utilities have historically struggled with operational efficiencies.

The region also depends heavily on power sector subsidies, which hampers the progression of cost-reflective tariffs. “Improving operational efficiencies by reducing combined transmission, distribution and bill collection losses as a percentage of dispatched electricity are key to closing the revenue loss gap. Pre-paid metering systems align electricity payments with income flow and improve the rate of payment to utilities,” GE said.

Another issue that investors grapple with, according to GE, is a “lack of well-structured projects, especially for transmission and distribution, that support attractive rates of return.” If the region improves future project economics through effective power sector reform and the reduction of inefficiencies in the energy value chain, it could attract a wider range of investors, including private offices, sovereign wealth funds, and individuals worldwide. “Ideally, the region aspires to achieve an energy economy that balances investment, affordability, access, and reliability,” the paper says.

Elisee Sezan, CEO for GE’s Gas Power business in sub-Saharan Africa, said in a statement to POWER that GE is working to roll out solutions to “foster collaboration through partnerships with governments, technology providers and the private sector.”

Among success stories cited by GE are a scalable microgrid system in Ethiopia and a smart grid solution in Botswana to help optimize the country’s grid response. GE equipment has also helped add 600 MW of power to Ghana’s grid; plants include the 424-MW Bridge Power project (Figure 3)—which will be the first liquefied petroleum gas-fired power plant in Africa and the largest in the world, and the Atuabo waste-to-power IPP, which will be the first TM2500 plant to use otherwise flared isopentane gas as a fuel source.

GE is also providing equipment to the 350-MW Cenpower IPP—the first licensed IPP project in Ghana—as well as the 200-MW Amandi power plant, a 9E gas turbine plant that is slated to come online this year. In Nigeria, GE says more than 3 GW has been “committed” to meet that country’s power generation ambitions. In Angola, GE is working on the 750-MW Soyo 1 combined cycle power plant, and it has installed 20 trailer-mounted gas turbine units. GE also delivered the Azito power plant, which produces more than a third of Cote D’Ivoire’s power.","Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/city-2096093_640.jpg,"['gas', 'africa', 'africas', 'energy', 'region', 'market', 'burgeoning', 'paper', 'plant', 'power', 'banking', 'private', 'sector', 'ge']", ,drought

Rarely troubled in Serie A, the Bianconeri had the title sewn up by Spring and it allowed them to focus on the holy grail of the Champions League. Summer addition Cristiano Ronaldo was expected to lead Juventus to the elusive continental triumph, but a shock quarter-final defeat to Ajax, followed by defeat in the Coppa Italia Semi-Final, meant even the Scudetto couldn’t mask an underwhelming campaign.

With a season that promised so much, a failure to make any headway on the continental stage could see a complete overhaul at the Allianz Stadium, as coach Massimiliano Allegri heads for the exit. The record books will show another league title, but this was hardly a vintage.

Player of the Season: Cristiano Ronaldo

The Portuguese superstar added a new level of glitz and glamour to Serie A upon his arrival from Real Madrid last summer and ended the campaign as Juventus’ top scorer.

After a slow start by his own incredible standards, going three matches before breaking his duck, the 34-year-old helped Juventus lift the Scudetto at a canter by firing in 21 goals and laying on 11 assists.

Indeed, his consistency up front ensured the void left by an out-of-sorts Paulo Dybala was not felt, although the Argentine may cite his new teammate as the reason why he failed to perform. Regardless, Ronaldo added another league title to his bulging trophy cabinet.

Best Signing: Joao Cancelo

Aside from Ronaldo, Juventus’ best piece of business was to bring in compatriot Joao Cancelo from Valencia to provide an attacking threat from right-back.

Having impressed for Inter last season, the Bianconeri stole a march on their rivals to land him and were duly rewarded with consistency and five assists from the back.

The Coach: Massimiliano Allegri

Another season, another Scudetto for Massimiliano Allegri, who takes his tally to six. However, cracks were starting to show in his relationship with the club and another European failure proved to be the beginning of the end.

Allegri leaves Juventus with 11 trophies to his name and proved once more that he is a mastermind of domestic dominance, but his failure to challenge for the Champions League leaves a blot against his record.

Memorable Moment

An opening day trip to Chievo was supposed to herald a new era at the club, with Cristiano Ronaldo making his debut in a Bianconeri shirt.

Such was the buzz surrounding his arrival saw a rush for tickets, sold at a hiked up price, and almost completely sold-out Stadio Bentegodi, whilst the world’s press descended on Verona for a look at the Portuguese in his new colours. The Ronaldo circus had truly hit Serie A.

The Bad

With seven consecutive Scudetti in the bag and an eighth looking like a formality, Juventus’ season hinged on a push for the Champions League, with Ronaldo brought in to deliver just that.

Having completed a stunning comeback against Atletico Madrid in the previous round, the Bianconeri were sent tumbling out at the Quarter-Finals by Ajax and instantly souring an otherwise successful season. Lacking the fight of their Dutch opponents, a home defeat spelled the end for Allegri and extended their drought to 24 years.

A water and energy solutions company based in Kenya, Davis and Shirtliff has called on the Kenyan government to enact a law that will make it compulsory for buildings including houses, apartments, offices, schools and industries to have rain water harvesters fitted to them.

According to a statement released by the company’s CEO David Gatende on Monday, May 6, failure to harvest rain water or making a policy towards it could hinder the country’s achievement of vision 2030.

“By 2030, Kenya’s population will be approximately 68 million and there is already pressure being experienced with regards to access to safe water. Having rainwater harvesting systems as part of building and construction codes is a sustainable approach that Kenya could adopt.

“People respond to legislation and it is the government’s responsibility to nudge people in the right direction.

According to the Astu, four-time winners, Black Stars is focused as they go in search for their lost glory in a bid to clinch the AFCON trophy for the 5th time having last won it in 1982.

He further stated that they understand the frustrations the teeming fans are going through after a 37-year wait for the title and a more reason why they are calling on Ghanaians to rally behind the team to break the AFCON drought.

“The trophy is always our target. We understand the frustrations the Black Stars have taken Ghanaians through. This time we would surely bring the trophy to Ghana” Atsu told GNA Sports. “I believe this time, we will make Ghanaians happy and we want them to support the team because the players are also frustrated that this generation has not won anything for the country. The fans have done enough to deserve a trophy so this AFCON is for them,” he ended.

Ghana has not won the competition since 1982 despite reaching the finals three times losing in 1992, 2010 and 2015.

The Black Stars have been drawn in group A alongside champions Cameroon, Guinea Bissau and Benin.

Ghana will kickstart their campaign against Benin on June 25, four days before facing defending champions Cameroon.

The Black Stars last Group game will be against Guinea-Bissau on July 2.

44,44,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Euromoney Capital markets: Funding Africa's future - Euromoney magazine,https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fdhb0l23n91z/capital-markets-funding-africas-future,"Makhtar Diop has enjoyed a long and varied career, in politics as well as at international financial institutions. He was recently appointed vice-president for infrastructure at the World Bank, after six years as its vice-president for Africa.

Yet, when asked to name the greatest achievements of his career, he does not hesitate. He promptly cites Senegal’s first sovereign credit rating, for which he worked during his short tenure as that country’s finance minister at the turn of the century.

Seeking a rating was neither a simple nor an obvious ambition at the time. South Africa, rated by Moody’s since 1994, was then the exception rather than the rule on the continent. To gain the support of Senegal’s then president Abdoulaye Wade for this endeavour, Diop told Wade that he would shoulder the blame if the bid failed. If it went smoothly, however, Wade would take the credit.

Wade agreed and Diop’s effort succeeded: Standard & Poor’s rated Senegal.

Obtaining that recognition was a game changer for Senegal and the broader region.

“To people working in the City of London or on Wall Street who were looking to Africa, it was difficult for them to make a distinction between countries,” Diop says of the time before credit ratings reached the continent.

After Senegal, many other countries received ratings and investors finally started to acquire a more granular understanding of the opportunities and challenges of Africa’s markets.

The introduction of sovereign credit ratings was just one step in Africa’s developing and often fraught relationship with credit. Today, more African countries than ever have access to international debt, while local market infrastructure is also undergoing reform in an effort to promote equity and debt capital markets at home.

To people working in the City of London or on Wall Street who were looking to Africa, it was difficult for them to make a distinction between countries - Makhtar Diop, World Bank

Investors are eager to tap into the continent’s potential and African issuers have a pressing need for capital. An estimated $100 billion a year is required to fund infrastructure projects alone across the region.

Benedict Oramah, president of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), says Africa needs a decade of capital raising at that pace – for a total of $1 trillion – to bring its infrastructure up to an acceptable level.

“That is more than the combined budget of African countries over the period,” he says. To raise that much, he insists, “attracting private sector money is critical.”

But does the continent have access to sufficiently deep pools of funding to meet that objective? And can African investors contribute to this effort? As Euromoney celebrates 50 years of African coverage, bankers and policymakers look back on decades of capital raising and consider the challenges and opportunities ahead for the continent’s many hopeful issuers.

Euromoney’s first big story about African finance came in 1978, when the magazine devoted its cover to Nigeria’s second-ever jumbo loan. Six of the largest banks in the world had agreed to underwrite $500 million for the African borrower. Nigeria was then earning an impressive $12 billion a year in oil export revenues and banks were eyeing the newly rich developing state with great interest.

But the deal quickly ran into problems. For one, Nigeria’s economic situation was fast deteriorating as its imports were rising much faster than its oil exports. More damaging still, the country’s military government had failed to inform its lenders of other debt it had incurred, as well as of an ongoing legal dispute with wide-ranging implications for its creditors.

More generally, the deal was plagued with immense confusion among international banks over Nigeria’s projects. There were charges of misrepresentation on both sides, threats and counter-threats, and an overarching sense that neither side understood the other’s goals and sensitivities.

As the Nigeria loan neared signing, a lead manager asked: “Can we rely on their creditworthiness after this?”



Makhtar Diop, World Bank

Enthusiasm

Although particularly arduous, that early sovereign debt deal exemplifies the many struggles African countries have faced in raising capital. Issues of hidden debt, endless legal battles and confusing term sheets still sometimes affect the continent’s access to credit today, as does a sense that international investors fail to grasp the specificities of African markets.

Still, when Euromoney surveyed Africa’s credit risk in May 1980, there was much cause for enthusiasm. The African Development Bank, then Africa’s best risk for bankers, according to this magazine, was raising hundreds of millions of dollars at competitive rates and with heavy oversubscriptions. It had by then successfully raised money through government borrowings, commercial loans and even a bond issue.

Algeria, then one of the biggest borrowers on the continent, was managing to improve the terms it commanded. Kenya had just raised its first Eurocredit, for $200 million, through a general purpose loan – a great achievement at the time, as most banks preferred to lend for specific projects.

Nigeria had struggled with its jumbo loan not long before, but the country was still, in theory at least, one of the best risks in Africa thanks to its Opec status and its other natural resources.

In the aftermath of the Soweto riots of 1976, South Africa lost access to foreign credit for two years; by the turn of the decade, international banks were willing to do business with the state once again.

Following these early advances came harder times for the continent’s sovereign issuers, however. European and US interest rates were rising, world trade was contracting and commodity prices were in free fall, making developing countries increasingly unlikely to repay the debt they had taken on.

In the late 1970s only two African states needed IMF help. By 1981, 21 African countries drew loans from the IMF – with all the pain the fund’s structural adjustment programmes bring. Senegal, Liberia, Togo, Sudan, Central African Republic, Uganda, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and Madagascar were in recession.

Some African borrowers were still attractive to international finance in the very early 1980s, including Angola, Kenya, Tunisia, Algeria, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Gabon, Cameroon and Zambia.

“Africa may be in recession, but it’s still an exciting continent,” one American banker told Euromoney at the time. “There are so many under-borrowed countries.”

First among the borrowers was Nigeria, which in 1981 took 60% of syndicated credits to sub-Saharan Africa. Seventy-three banks led or co-led loans to Nigeria that year, against 25 in 1980.

But by June 1983, Euromoney was writing ‘The loan drought hits Africa’. It had become clear that the global contraction of the syndicated loan market had halted Africa’s progress.



Benedict Oramah, Afreximbank



The Latin American debt crisis, which began with Mexico’s default in 1982, had wide-ranging consequences for commercial banks’ risk appetite, compounding Africa’s credit problems.

Oramah thinks back on that time as “a lost decade for the continent”.

Before the 1980s, Africa’s growth had been faster than Asia’s, he recalls.

“After that debt crisis happened, Africa went into a massive decline,” he says.

Per capita growth in gross national product was negative for most of the decade.

“Africa lost access to the trade- and project-finance funds it had been getting,” Oramah adds. “Africa lost a great [deal of] momentum.”

Speaking to Euromoney in 1990, Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank, said the continent had learned the lessons of the previous decade.

“It is true that today, all over the continent, there is a strong will from government to see the private sector play a major role in development activities,” Ndiaye said. “They know there are problems with [inefficient] bureaucracies, but here again many countries are trying to correct the situation.”

The decade certainly got off to a promising start, with the repeal of apartheid legislation in South Africa bringing about a lifting of sanctions for that country. Planeloads of bankers and investors were arriving, Euromoney’s August 1991 cover story recorded, and capital was flowing in to the country.

But South Africa was then – as now – something of an outlier. Outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Africa’s equity capital markets were thin and illiquid, as they still largely are today.

By mid 1994, the four largest Africa funds – Alliance Capital’s Southern Africa fund, Morgan Stanley’s Africa fund, Fleming’s New South Africa fund and Emerging Markets Management’s Africa fund – had between them raised over $400 million. But there was still little for them to invest in.

Excluding Johannesburg, sub-Saharan Africa’s 12 stock markets had a combined market capitalization of just $12 billion.

Beyond equity, much of the continent had still not recovered from the debt woes of the 1980s. By 1996 the situation had become so bad that the IMF and World Bank put in place an initiative to provide special assistance to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC).

Although global in scope, the programme identified 30 sub-Saharan African countries as highly indebted, out of a total of 36. In 2000 alone, 17 sub-Saharan states were admitted to the programme, including Benin, Ghana, Senegal and Zambia. The initiative has so far provided $76 billion in debt-service relief, most of it to Africa.

The situation since then has changed markedly. After Senegal received its first sovereign credit rating under Diop, a dozen other African countries swiftly followed suit, finally giving sub-Saharan African borrowers an avenue for credit beyond bank loans and development agencies.

Among these was Ghana, which emerged from the HIPC programme in 2006. The following year it entered the bond market, with a B+ rating from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch under its belt. Having just discovered oil and gas, the country needed funding to build the required infrastructure.

Peter Sullivan, head of public sector Africa at Citi, worked on that deal. He tells Euromoney that it took a year to bring the country to market because of investors’ unfamiliarity with the issuer and the issuer’s unfamiliarity with the market.

“Some people mixed Ghana with Guyana,” he says of the bond’s roadshow. “It was scary at times. Initially there was a lot of education to be done, on both sides.”

Still, Ghana was somewhat more fortunate than other would-be African issuers.

“Most people had a sense of where Ghana was on the map,” says Sullivan.

Ghana raised $750 million with a maturity of 10 years, making it the only sub-Saharan sovereign bond issuer other than South Africa at the time. Investors were eager for African exposure as countries emerged from the HIPC programme.

Ghana’s debut was four times oversubscribed and in the years that followed, countries as varied as Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Rwanda, Zambia, Namibia, Ethiopia, Morocco, Tunisia and Cameroon all came to market.

“There’s still a lack of supply from the region,” says Sullivan, but the situation has improved. “Investors have certainly come up the curve in their knowledge and appreciation and differentiation of African issuers.”

Bolaji Balogun, head of investment bank Chapel Hill Denham, agrees.

“These markets are now substantially more open than they were,” he says. “I remember doing the first foreign investor trades in Nigeria back in 1996. That was a lifetime ago.”

Compared with what one sees today, he adds: “Those were very, very small trades.”

Affordable

Following the financial crisis of 2008, quantitative easing by the world’s largest central banks has generated increased capital flows to emerging markets in general and to Africa in particular, as investors hunt for yield.

This has helped establish Africa’s place in the international debt markets, generating large books and more affordable rates for many of the continent’s issuers.

In March this year, Ghana gathered a book of $17 billion for a tripartite bond issue of $3 billion, including a tranche due to mature in 31 years. A month earlier, Egypt issued a $4 billion bond, including a 30-year tranche, which was also heavily oversubscribed.

Nigeria was the first African sovereign to test investor appetite for such long paper in 2017, issuing $1.5 billion of 2047 funding to strong demand. Such distant maturities now look set to become commonplace.

On the back of the sovereigns, you have large businesses also being able to now start tapping the international market” - Hasnen Varawalla, Absa

Yvonne Ike, head of sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa at Bank of America, worked on the latest Ghana bond issue.

“An increasing amount of foreign currency liquidity is being made available for the right quality names out of Africa,” she says. “The maturity profiles are increasing and the frequency of the issuers is also increasing.”

Twenty-one countries on the continent now have outstanding sovereign Eurobonds, from just 10 nine years ago. Issuance reached a record of $28.4 billion in 2018.

“Across the last 10 years, one thing you’ve of course seen is more and more countries having access to the sovereign bond market and issuing sovereign bonds,” says Hasnen Varawalla, co-head of banking at South Africa’s Absa. This has had a positive collateral effect across the continent.

“On the back of the sovereigns, you have large businesses also being able to now start tapping the international market,” he says.

Among these newcomers is Nigeria’s Access Bank.

“We are regular issuers in the Eurobond market,” says its chief executive, Herbert Wigwe. “Go back 25 years, how many Nigerian banks could do that? But now, because of best practice, people are beginning to see the levels of governance and transparency are there for people to access money more and more in the international markets.”

Nor is the continent resting on its laurels. Ghana, for one, is considering even longer-dated paper, with a debut century bond said to be in the offing. While some find the prospect unlikely, Miguel Azevedo, Citi’s head of investment banking for the Middle East and Africa excluding South Africa, believes it may happen.

“If Argentina can do it, why not?” Azevedo tells Euromoney. “People believe that the probability of things worsening in the very long future is very low. They can only improve; hence time is probably a good idea. And it comes with a pick-up in yield, of course.”

Beyond century debt, other innovations are also reaching the continent. Nigeria pioneered the first-ever SEC-registered diaspora bond in 2017, raising $300 million from Nigerian expatriates, and last year it issued Africa’s first sovereign sukuk. In 2017, Nigeria also became the first African country to issue a green bond. Kenya may soon follow. It has innovated in another area already, raising its first retail bond, purchasable via mobile phone, in 2017. While that deal attracted less demand than many had hoped, such debt could become more common in coming years.

Options

Saif Malik, co-head of banking for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered, says that Islamic finance is one area likely to gain traction following Nigeria’s sukuk issue. StanChart plans to tour Johannesburg, Nairobi and Lagos in June this year with partner Islamic Finance News, to discuss this form of lending with government officials and private-sector players.

“There’s a need for more education,” says Malik.

“We see our role in these markets as finding different pools of capital,” he adds.

Options for capital raising are certainly growing.

“You see railroads in Tanzania being done through a Turkish ECA [export credit agency] partner and a Turkish company,” says Malik. “You see hospitals built in Angola through the UKEF [UK Export Finance] guaranteeing it, and similar projects in Zambia with power.”

Bpifrance, the French public investment bank, is among the foreign institutions providing new pools of capital on the continent. The organization has launched a direct investment fund of €77 million to invest in African companies, as well as in French companies looking to grow in Africa, and is looking at other means of supporting economic growth on the continent.

Pedro Novo, head of export finance and export promotion at Bpifrance, says: “The idea is to provide the necessary capital on a continent where liquidity is scarce to accelerate and structure the growth of companies that have the requisite technical, industrial and human capacities and deserve to be supported, when banks provide limited financial support to industrial development in the medium and long term.”

Although his role is global in scope, Novo spends more than half of his time on projects related to Africa.

People believe that the probability of things worsening in the very long future is very low - Miguel Azevedo, Citi

Meanwhile, projects of public importance but with limited commercial value can still benefit from support from institutions such as Afreximbank. The bank just recently lent $15 million to fund an upgrade of Juba airport in South Sudan.

“It would be naïve to expect to see other commercial banks rushing to South Sudan today,” says Oramah at Afrexim.

But perhaps the most transformative new actor in African debt has been China, which lent more than $10 billion a year to sub-Saharan countries between 2012 and 2017, and last year pledged a further $60 billion to the continent.

Among the largest recipients of Chinese investment have been Angola, Ethiopia and Kenya, where Chinese lending has funded large infrastructure projects.

“China provides Africa with a valid option,” says Ike at BofA.

These loans typically target areas of great importance to Africa’s development, she says, with transport, power, mining and communications the top priorities.

“The other good thing about the Chinese loans is they’re done very quickly,” she adds.

Similar bilateral loans from the west take up to nine years to be negotiated, she says, whereas Chinese debt can take just a few months.

Upgrade

The development of local markets has also started to bear fruit. Most sub-Saharan African capital markets regulators are now members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, meaning that they meet certain global standards. As a result, capital markets policies and practices are being updated across the continent.

Last year alone, Malawi launched a depository; Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana upgraded their depository platforms; Ghana started to operate its single depository for government securities, equities and bonds; Namibia launched a depository development project; Nigeria launched a securities lending capability; and South Africa completed the upgrade of its bond settlement platform.

There is more to come. Nigeria is expected to introduce a new derivatives market; Kenya to launch a derivatives exchange; South Africa to upgrade its equities’ settlement platform; Angola to open its equity market to global investors; and Ethiopia to open a stock exchange.

South Africa is introducing the ‘twin peaks’ model of financial regulation pioneered in Australia, while Tanzania and Zimbabwe are both reviewing their capital markets acts. The stock exchanges of Johannesburg, Casablanca, Nigeria, Nairobi, Mauritius and francophone west Africa are working together to share information and address liquidity constraints.

Hari Chaitanya, head of investor services product management for transactional products and services at Standard Bank, says of these changes: “Improving liquidity, driving new listings and increasing intra-Africa investment rates will also improve access to African opportunity.”

Challenges do remain. The tightening of monetary policy in the US and Europe may lessen the appeal of African borrowers to international investors, leading to higher rates and shorter maturities.

Moreover, while some indicators show debt levels to be low – sovereign borrowers’ outstanding Eurobonds represent well under 20% of their respective GDPs – once all borrowing is factored in, especially that from China, over-indebtedness is becoming an issue for some. And while Chinese lending has its advantages, some bankers warn that the terms attached can be opaque and overly favourable to the creditor.

Djibouti is one country where warnings are being sounded over the level of Chinese debt. The east African state incurred heavy debt for Belt and Road projects and could struggle to pay it back.

And issues of governance still plague certain borrowers. Mozambique has been embroiled in a scandal surrounding its sovereign borrowing for the last six years. Debt raised to fund a fishing fleet was redirected to other uses instead, without investors’ consent.

While international debt and equity markets are technically open to African corporates, only a few take advantage of that opportunity. Last year saw just two noteworthy IPOs connected to Africa – petroleum company Vivo Energy and microfinancer ASA International on the London Stock Exchange – and corporate bond issues are also rare.

“Very few companies have access to the bond market,” says Arnold Ekpe, the former chief executive of Ecobank, “because the requirements are so stringent. You have to ask yourself whether it’s worth your while.”

Corporates need credit ratings to enter the market, so as Malik says: “To issue a bond is not a cheap exercise.”

He adds: “Investors find it a lot easier to wrap their heads around a sovereign than a corporate in Nigeria, for example. It’s an education process: we’re talking to a number of corporates at the moment in South Africa and just a couple of other markets in Africa that are looking at this. But it takes time.”

Meanwhile, despite capital markets reform, local markets remain deficient. Many stock exchanges are little more liquid than they were in the mid 1990s, in part because African capital is restricted in its movement. African pension funds hold an estimated $700 billion, but little of it is being deployed to support business growth.

“Historically, it’s been very much focused on government securities and real estate,” says Sullivan at Citi. “If you’ve looked in the last 10 years, you drive from the airport in Lusaka, you see a new mall that goes up, and who’s financing that mall? It’s the pension fund.

“It’s a good thing, but too much of a good thing,” he adds. “What you’re not seeing as much as you would like to, is the broadening of the investment options or opportunities. Part of that is the local capital markets, which are not as liquid as they need to be. They don’t have the scale.”

Restriction

Often, this money is also restricted from travelling abroad, where markets might be more appealing. Kenyan pension funds, for example, can really only invest in the Nairobi Stock Exchange, Sullivan says, meaning promising markets such as Rwanda or Uganda are out of reach.

“It can’t get that natural geographical diversification, so it’s restricted,” he explains. “So where is it going to put its money? Government securities.”

Miguel Azevedo,

Citi

IPOs of African stock are rare and often take place outside Africa because of the lack of liquidity in the home markets. And promised privatizations, which would bolster exchanges’ appeal to investors, are slow to happen.

Azevedo, for one, does not see any great improvement among the smaller stock markets. The exchanges in Johannesburg and Lagos – and to a lesser extent, those in Nairobi, Casablanca and Cairo – will remain the only active equity markets on the continent for the foreseeable future, he argues.

But many are hopeful that these issues are being addressed. African capital – savings, pensions and central bank reserves – have grown substantially and may be put to work as markets harmonize across borders. Regional economic collaborations such as Ecowas in West Africa and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement are furthering this effort.

Once investors are convinced that their investment in the one African market is in fact an investment in the broader region, more capital is expected to pour in, not just for sovereign bonds but also for corporate bonds and equity deals.

“We think that private investment will come when people are confident that the market exists,” Oramah says.

Meanwhile, bankers say that investors have developed a far greater understanding of African markets than they once had. When the ‘tuna bond’ scandal emerged, it did not affect perception of governance risk beyond Mozambique. And Africa’s borrowers are also becoming increasingly savvy in their dealings with China, as the risks and constraints of that relationship have become more obvious.

Local markets are beginning to show potential. One example was the 2017 listing, on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, of Vodacom’s operations in Tanzania. That deal was worth more than $200 million – equivalent to all of the Tanzanian IPOs over the previous decade. Not only was it very large by that market’s standards, but it also received heavy retail support.

The continent still needs support from the development partners, the DFIs, the Europeans, the Chinese. But more importantly, we have to take our destiny in our own hands” - Benedict Oramah, African Export-Import Bank

“This is the kind of thing we very much want to be part of because it’s important for the development of Africa,” says Absa’s Varawalla. “We had 40,000 retail investors participate. That’s important, because one of the things you do want to see in Africa is a broader participation in the equity capital markets.”

To further develop the market, Novo at Bpifrance argues, the solution is likely to be greater cooperation between all of the different players now providing capital to Africa.

“The future is a logic of increasingly blended finance,” he says, “with a far greater cooperation between public and private actors, in operations with DFIs [development finance institutions], development banks, private banks, private and public insurers. We’ll see co-funded and co-insured operations with the public and private sectors working together, in particular in the priority sectors that are education, power, sustainable development and the agro-industry.”

One example of this is a €100 million contract between Dakar and the French company Fonroche to provide solar streetlights to the city. Co-funded by the French state and Bpifrance, the sale is “the deal of the century” for Fonroche and helps bridge Senegal’s infrastructure gap.

“We have built the foundations,” Oramah concludes. “The cotinent still needs support from the development partners, the DFIs, the Europeans, the Chinese. But more importantly, we have to take our destiny in our own hands. Africa has a pool of resources to be able to challenge itself. We need to be more imaginative in finding ways to move those resources towards what would make things better for all of us.”","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.euromoneydigital.com/dims4/default/01cf91a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/619x325+80+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Feuromoney-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F4b%2Ffe7f706bd6e9e9cff0f0aa03f4f4%2Fafrica-future-780.jpg,"['funding', 'sovereign', 'debt', 'africas', 'market', 'capital', 'future', 'african', 'markets', 'investors', 'africa', 'bond', 'countries']", ,none

The journey, which started from London in August 2018, took the cyclist eight months to arrive in Ghana.

She passed through six other African countries – Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea and Cote D’Ivoire.

Ms Ray told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that her cycling journey was to erase the perception that cycling for long distances could only be undertaken by men.

“If a man can travel thousands of kilometres alone and feel safe, then a woman can equally do same,” she said.

Ms Ray said she made friends in Ho, the Volta Regional Capital, in 2008 when she volunteered for a Non-Governmental Organization in Ghana and promised to visit again but opted to use the bicycle to fulfill that promise.

She said the green environment of Ho made her feel closer to nature and persuaded her to visit again after 11 years.

Ms Ray said riding through villages in some African countries made her understand the challenges people in rural areas faced daily to survive.

She said one of the main challenges she encountered was the strong winds in the desert, which slowed her pace and made visibility poor, making the journey tiring.

The cyclist said her bicycle broke down in Mauritania due to some unpaved roads she used but was able to fix it to continue the journey.

She bemoaned the lack of respect for cyclists by some drivers, and said she was “carelessly” knocked down by a taxi driver in Senegal, which further delayed her journey for a month.

48,48,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,S. Africa’s cane growers blame sugar imports for revenue loss - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/s-africas-cane-growers-blame-sugar-imports-for-revenue-loss/,"The South African Cane Growers Assassination (SACGA) said it has suffered massive revenue and sales losses due to imported sugar being dumped into the local market.

In an interview with Xinhua, SACGA’s chairperson Graeme Stainbank said the sector lost 2 billion Rand (141million U.S. dollars) in 2017/18 financial year which has prompted the group to call for government’s intervention.

“The financial impact is massive. For every ton of sugar that is imported, the local industry has to export the same volume on the dumped world market, at prices well below the cost of production,” he said.

He said several countries including those in the European Union (EU) were responsible for dumping sugar into the local industry.

He said there were significant volumes of duty free sugar imports impact them from Swaziland.

Stainbank said their members suffered the losses on the back of the drought, saying if there’s no intervention more sugar cane growers would be forced out of business.

Trade and Industry department spokesperson Sidwell Medupe said, “both the association and the department agree that there’s a need to urgently address the potential threats associated with increasing replacement of local sugar with imports.”

Medupe said South Africa’s sugar sector must “diversify” its products to increase its revenue and sustainability.

49,49,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,2018/19 Premier League: Martin Tyler's end-of-season stats special - SkySports,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11719651/2018-19-premier-league-martin-tylers-end-of-season-stats-special,"The 'Undrawables', unchanged lineups, quickfire reds and fastest-ever goals - we have all the best stats after a record-breaking Premier League season.

Martin's Starting Stats

It is only the fifth time the presentation of the Premier League trophy has taken place on an away ground - the previous four being Blackburn at Anfield in 1994/95 and Manchester United at Middlesbrough in 1995/96, at Everton in 2003 and at Wigan in 2008.

It was also the fourth time Man City had lifted the Premier League trophy, but the first time at an away ground, while it was the first time the title had been decided on the final day of the season since 2013/14, when City again pipped Liverpool to the championship.

All eight times in Premier League history the league has gone down to the final day of the season, the side top going into the last day has gone on to win the title. The last time that did not happen was in 1989 when Arsenal snatched the then First Division title from Liverpool.

This was the first time three players - Sadio Mane, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mohamed Salah - have all shared the Golden Boot with more than 20 goals. In 1997/98, Chris Sutton, Dion Dublin and Michael Owen shared the award having each scored 18 goals, while in 1998/99 Owen, Dwight Yorke and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink did the same having netted 18 times as well.

1:16 Watch Man City lift the Premier League trophy

It was a record-breaking season after 1,072 goals (2.821 per game) were scored, the most ever in a 38-game Premier League campaign, beating the previous record of 1,066 set in 2011/12.

City, meanwhile, have beaten all other 19 teams in the Premier League this season, the second successive campaign they have done that. The only other top-flight side to have ever achieved this were Preston North End in consecutive campaigns in the first two seasons of the Football League in 1888-90.

It was the fourth time Vincent Kompany had lifted the Premier League, equalling Roy Keane and one behind John Terry and Sergio Aguero's goal at Brighton took him to 164 in the Premier League, moving him above Robbie Fowler into sixth place in the all-time scorers list. Riyad Mahrez scored his 49th English league goal at the Amex, Ilkay Gundogan netted his sixth Premier League goal - the German's best return in a season for City - and Aymeric Laporte's goal means the defender has scored five times in all competitions for the club, all away, all headers and all from set pieces!

Finally, Glenn Murray scored his fourth goal in five appearances against City, having previously been on target for Crystal Palace and Bournemouth against them in the calendar year of 2015. However, his previous goal against them for Brighton was in a League Cup tie in 2008!

Best stats from the 2018/19 Premier League season

AUGUST

Rapid impact

Daniel Sturridge scored just 24 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Liverpool, is this the quickest goal by a substitute on opening day? Robert

MARTIN SAYS: Only two players have scored inside a minute of coming on as a substitute since the opening day of the 2006/07 season (when Opta started tracking this stat), and one of them is Sturridge.

However, his goal is not the fastest in that time.

SEPTEMBER

Perfect starts

Has there ever been another Premier League season where three teams have won their first four games? Lloyd

Image: Manuel Pellegrini endured a tough start to the season with West Ham

MARTIN SAYS: It has only happened once before in the Premier League era.

Back in 2009/10, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester City had 100 per cent records after their first four games. Chelsea went on to win the title, so perhaps that will be an omen for them, or Liverpool - or Watford, of course - this season.

Winning your first four games is no mean feat, it has happened 18 times prior to this season and seven of those teams went on to lift the title.

Charlton had a perfect record at this stage in 2005/06, but went on to finish 13th, the lowest finish of any of the teams on the list.

All 17 of the other sides to have started with four straight wins have finished seventh or higher - which is a nice omen for Watford fans!

End of an away-day drought

Georginio Wijnaldum finally scored away from home in the Premier League at Wembley on Saturday, so which current non-defender now holds the record? Phil

2:59 Highlights from Liverpool's 2-1 win at Tottenham in the Premier League

MARTIN SAYS: After 57 away games for Newcastle and Liverpool, Wijnaldum did at last score in the Premier League this weekend to end his draught on the road.

So that means of those non-defenders still playing, Matt Ritchie now holds the record for most away matches without netting, which stands at 38 for Bournemouth and Newcastle.

Interestingly, Swansea's Leon Britton holds the record by a non-defender for most home games without scoring, having gone 80 Premier League matches without finding the net at the Liberty Stadium.

Ritchie, however, did finally score away from home in the Premier League at Bournemouth in March

OCTOBER

Same starters

Wolves named the same starting XI for their opening seven games. Who has named the same line-up the most times during a Premier League season? Mary

MARTIN SAYS: Wolves are only the third team in Premier League history to name the same starting XI for their opening seven games of a season.

The two sides to have done so previously are Leeds United (1992/93) and Aston Villa (2008/09), but neither stretched that run to eight matches.

That means if Nuno Espirito Santo chooses the same 11 players at Crystal Palace on Saturday, then Wolves will set a new record.

To answer your question, the record for the same starting XI being named the most often in one season was set by Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, who selected the same starting XI 17 times in the first season of the Premier League in 1992/93 (not in a row).

That team was: Schmeichel, Parker, Irwin, Bruce, Pallister, Ince, Sharpe, Giggs, Hughes, McClair, Cantona

That consistency helped United to win the Premier League that season though it was a 42-game campaign.

The record for a 38-game season is 13 matches which was achieved by Leicester in 2015/16 and Chelsea in 2016/17 - both of whom won the title.

Leicester 2015/16: Schmeichel, Simpson, Fuchs, Morgan, Huth, Kante, Drinkwater, Albrighton, Okazaki, Mahrez, Vardy

Chelsea 2016/17: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Luiz, Alonso, Moses, Kante, Matic, Pedro, Hazard, Costa

However, Birmingham City's starting XI was also the same in 13 matches in the 2009/10 and they only finished ninth!

Birmingham 2009/10: Hart, Carr, Johnson, Ridgewell, Dann, Carsley, Bowyer, Ferguson, McFadden, Larsson, Jerome

Wolves would go on to name the same starting XI for the first nine matches of the season

Fulham's struggles

Fulham haven't kept a clean sheet yet. What's the longest wait for a clean sheet at the start of a season? Martin

Image: Fulham's defence shipped goals at the start of the campaign

MARTIN SAYS: Fulham may not have got a clean sheet in their first 10 games, but Blackburn did not keep a clean sheet until the 28th game of the 2011/12 season, and it proved costly as they were relegated from the Premier League.

Norwich went 22 matches without a clean sheet in the 2011/12 campaign but avoided relegation, finishing 12th in the table.

Bolton also stayed up in 2009/10 after not keeping a clean sheet in their opening 21 matches.

However, Leicester were relegated in 1994/95 after a 19-game run without a clean sheet.

Worryingly for Fulham they have conceded at least twice in nine of their 10 games this season.

If they continue at this pace they would set the record for most games of conceding two or more goals.

Ipswich conceded two or more goals in 28 games in the 1994/95 season (a 42-game season) while Wolves conceded two or more in 27 games in the 2011/12 campaign.

Fulham did finally manage to keep a clean sheet in their 18th game of the season in a goalless draw at Newcastle in December

NOVEMBER

Scoring runs

Leicester are the only side to score in each of their Premier League games this season. What's the longest streak to start a season? Harry

MARTIN SAYS: That record belongs to Arsenal, who scored in every Premier League game in 2001/02 when finished seven points clear at the top of the table.

Chelsea scored in 21 straight games to start the 2006/07 season, with the run ending with a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on January 2.

Manchester City started last season with a 20-match scoring run, going on to win the title in record-breaking style despite a 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve.

Manchester United started the 2011/12 season by scoring for 19 successive matches, a run that was ended by a 3-0 loss to Newcastle on January 4.

Arsenal (2007/08), Chelsea (2009/10) and Norwich (1992/93) all started seasons by scoring for 18 matches in a row.

Leicester's scoring run from the start of the season lasted for 11 games until coming to an end with a goalless draw at home to Burnley in November

Passing masterclass

How many passes did Manchester City put together before Ilkay Gundogan scored on Sunday? Is it a Premier League record? Harry

1:09 Manchester City scored a superb third goal after a 44 pass move, the most for a goal in the Premier League since Juan Mata scored for Man Utd against Southampton in September 2015

MARTIN SAYS: Gundogan's goal, at the end 44 passes, wrapped up the points for Manchester City on Super Sunday.

The goal consisted of the most passes for a goal in the Premier League since Juan Mata scored for United against Southampton in September 2015, where they put together 45 passes.

Mata put the finishing touch on that after Memphis Depay's shot had come back off the post.

However, that passing sequence was not quite enough to go to the top of the list in terms of Premier League goals scored since the 2006/07 season when Opta starting collecting the data. Mata's effort sits second in the list behind Tottenham's 48-pass sequence against QPR in 2014 with Nacer Chadli scoring in a 4-0 win.

DECEMBER

Record-breaking day at Anfield

Liverpool had 36 shots on goal against Man Utd at Anfield on Sunday, but is that a record for both clubs? Joe

2:57 Highlights from Liverpool's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the Premier League

MARTIN SAYS: Since Opta began collecting this type of data in 2003/04, United have never faced as many shots as they did in their 3-1 loss at Liverpool.

Prior to that Super-Sunday contest, the highest number of efforts on goal United had had to deal with was the 33 Arsenal managed at the Emirates in February, although the difference being the visitors recorded a 3-1 win on that occasion.

As for Liverpool, Sunday's 36 shots was not quite the most they have ever had in the last 15 years - but it was not far away, with that record coming against Everton of all teams when Jurgen Klopp's side had 37 efforts in a 4-0 win at Anfield in April 2016.

In fact, before the game with United, that Merseyside derby was also the last time all 12 outfield Liverpool players had at least one shot on goal.

JANUARY

Marathon Men

I read that Bernardo Silva covered an amazing 13.7km in Manchester City's win over Liverpool. Is that the most by a player this season? Freddy

MARTIN SAYS: His industrious showing in the 2-1 win was the joint-highest distance covered by a single player, matching his own record of 13.7km set against Tottenham in City's win at Wembley earlier this season. The energy he showed was also backed up by his interception count, which was the most completed by any player in that classic encounter at the Etihad. Plus, he assisted the opening goal for Sergio Aguero as well!

When looking at the top 10 for distance covered, Chelsea midfielder Jorginho appears twice having clocked up distances of 13.6km and 13.1km against Liverpool and City respectively. Christian Eriksen covered a fourth-highest 13.2km in Tottenham's win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, while Liverpool's Jordan Henderson ran 13.2km in that clash at the Etihad Stadium.

Perhaps not surprisingly, all 10 of those players are midfielders, who are expected to cover every blade of grass in the modern game.

Incidentally, no other player this season beat the 13.7km Silva ran in those two games

De Gea's Golden Boot

After Martin said on commentary during Man Utd's 1-0 win over Spurs at Wembley on January 13: ""They get Golden Gloves goalkeepers, so David de Gea should get a Golden Boot,"" in reference to the numerous stops the Spaniard made with his feet that day, the United No 1 has been in contact with his own question for Mr Tyler!

Thanks for the framing idea, Martin! Was that the most saves made with feet in a game? 😉 @SkySportsPL #TylersTeasers pic.twitter.com/f13cN1yFTt — David de Gea (@D_DeGea) January 22, 2019

I see I made four saves with my feet against Tottenham the week before last, but is that the most in a Premier League game this season? David de Gea

2:55 Highlights from Manchester United's 1-0 win against Tottenham in the Premier League

MARTIN SAYS: Can I first say how absolutely delighted I am to hear from David and he has maybe now opened the door for other players to ask questions about their own careers!

Now, as for the question itself, the four stops David made with his feet to help United beat Spurs 1-0 is indeed a record in the Premier League this season, beating the three that Bournemouth's Asmir Begovic made in a 2-1 loss at Newcastle in November.

In fact, you and Asmir are the only 'keepers to have made more than two saves with their feet in a Premier League match this campaign.

FEBRUARY

'Pen-sational'

Burnley finally were awarded a penalty on Saturday - how many games had it been? Stuart, Woking

Jack Stephens handball in the box in the final stages of Burnley's clash with Southampton ended Burnley's 67-game run without a spot-kick, which was by far the longest current run of any side in the Premier League this season.

Huddersfield now top the table for the amount of games without a penalty being awarded as their defeat at Chelsea was their 36th league game in a row without a spot kick. At 2-0, new Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert was out of his seat and protesting after Elias Kachunga tumbled inside the box after a challenge from Andreas Christensen but nothing was given.

However, when it comes to the overall Premier League record, the Terriers still have some way to go before matching Wimbledon's record of 91 games without being given a penalty between 1997 and 2000.

No place like home

I see Aguero has also scored nine Premier League hat-tricks at the Etihad - is that a record for a single ground? Kelly

2:58 Aguero recorded his ninth top-flight hat-trick at the Etihad in City's 6-0 mauling of Chelsea

MARTIN SAYS: Aguero's ninth Premier League hat-trick at the Etihad is indeed a record for one stadium, beating the previous record he had jointly held with Thierry Henry.

The Arsenal forward had managed eight trebles at Highbury, Blackburn striker Alan Shearer got seven at Ewood Park, Liverpool frontman Robbie Fowler recorded six at Anfield and Manchester United forwards Ruud van Nistelrooy and Dimitar Berbatov both registered four at Old Trafford.

Incidentally, Aguero has also now moved level with Shearer on 11 Premier League hat-tricks in total, although the latter also scored a First Division hat-trick for Southampton against Arsenal in April 1988.

Age is just a number

Is Roy Hodgson now the oldest coach to manage in the Premier League? Jake

Image: Hodgson became the oldest manager in the Premier League this season

MARTIN SAYS: Not quite, but almost! The Crystal Palace manager was 71 years and 184 days on the date of his most recent Premier League game, at home to West Ham on February 9.

However, Bobby Robson was 71 years and 192 days old when he took charge of Newcastle United for the final time at Aston Villa in August 2004.

That does mean, though, that when Hodgson takes Palace to Leicester on Saturday, Feb 23, he will become the oldest-ever Premier League manager.

Interestingly, Attilio Lombardo - another Palace boss - is the youngest-ever Premier League manager after he coached the Eagles for the first time aged just 32 years and 67 days against Villa in March 1998.

MARCH

Tottenham lose their title

With Tottenham's ""Undrawables"" campaign over, who has gone longer than 28 games at the start of a top-flight season without taking just a point? Danny

Image: Hugo Lloris saves Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty at Wembley in March as Spurs finally drew a game

It was bound to come to an end one day, but Spurs have Hugo Lloris to thank for their run of games without a league stalemate coming to an end against Arsenal!

Only two other top-flight clubs have gone on a longer run at the start of a season than Mauricio Pochettino's side.

In 1896, Stoke played 30 league games in the top division without drawing, winning and losing 15 each, while in 1920, West Brom went 29 league games without a draw (21 wins, eight defeats).

Of course, stretching back to last season, Spurs had gone 32 matches in total without being held prior to Saturday's stalemate.

First fouls

Anthony Knockaert was booked after 28 seconds against Crystal Palace. Is that a record? (Jamie, via email)

Image: Knockaert picked up a yellow for a challenge on Luka Milivojevic in the opening moments of Palace's game with Brighton in March

MARTIN SAYS: I recall Vinnie Jones being booked after three seconds for Chelsea against Sheffield United in March 1992 in the old First Division and also after five seconds for Sheffield United against Manchester City in 1991.

As for the Premier League era, we asked our friends at Opta and Anthony Knockaert's booking has been registered as the second fastest since their records began in 2006/07.

The Brighton winger was just two seconds slower than Stephen Warnock, who was playing for Blackburn when he was shown a yellow card after just 26 seconds in a game against Hull in March 2009.

Ki Sung-Yueng's booking for Swansea against Bournemouth on New Year's Eve 2016 came after 30 seconds, while Vincent Kompany was shown a yellow card after 31 seconds in a game for Manchester City against Burnley earlier this season.

APRIL

Record-equalling Terriers

Is Huddersfield's relegation the fastest we've seen in the Premier League? Ali

MARTIN SAYS: Huddersfield are just the second team to be relegated from the Premier League in March - March 30 to be precise. Derby also went down with six games remaining on March 29 in the 2007/08 season.

Huddersfield's relegation was sealed with them on 14 points after 32 games played, while Derby and Sunderland (2005/06) were both on 11 points at the same stage of their relegation seasons.

Meanwhile, the Terriers have won three games, compared to Derby's one, and scored two more goals (18) than that Rams team had managed after 32 matches of the 2007/08 season (16).

Salah's half century

Mo Salah finally ended his wait for his 50th Premier League goal at Southampton on Friday Night Football - even though he had to wait a while he must be one of the quickest to do it for the Reds? Have any players reached 50 Premier League goals quicker? (Jeff, Bootle)

2:42 Salah's goal against Southampton was his 50th league strike for Liverpool

MARTIN SAYS: Mohamed Salah's 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool in his 69th game for the Reds means he is the quickest Liverpool player to reach that landmark - Fernando Torres previously held the record with 72 games.

Salah notched his 49th in his 62nd match for the club and had to wait a while to reach 50, but is still substantially quicker to his half century than Luis Suarez (86), Robbie Fowler (88) and Michael Owen (98) took to reach the same total.

Alan Shearer's 50 goals in his first 66 games for Blackburn is the Premier League record, while Ruud van Nistelrooy took 68 games to reach his half-century for Manchester United, meaning Salah is the third fastest in the league's history for one club.

No foul play

Wolves didn't concede a foul against Brighton on Saturday, which I don't remember seeing before. Has this ever happened in the Premier League? Jeff

MARTIN SAYS: Good spot! Our friends at Opta can help with this one, but their records only go back to the 2003/04 season. In that period, no other team has gone through a Premier League game without conceding at least one foul.

There have been five teams who have conceded only one foul in a game.

At the other end of the scale, West Ham conceded 34 fouls in one game against Spurs in 2007, including a last-minute penalty which Jermain Defoe missed. That's more than one every three minutes! No side has conceded more in a Premier League game since the 2003/04 season.

Liverpool get to the point

Liverpool could get to 97 points this season and might not win the Premier League. Has that ever happened before in the English top division? Claude

MARTIN SAYS: If Liverpool win their final three matches, their tally of 97 points would be their best ever in the era of three points for a win.

If their previous records are adjusted to three points for a win then they would fall one short of their best ever top-flight season. They would have got 98 points in 1979, when they won Division One. However, that was a 42-game season and they had four more games!

The highest points tally (again adjusted) to fail to win the top flight came from Leeds' haul of 91 back in 1971 (Arsenal would have won the league on 94).

The next best runner-up was Manchester United, who - as you may remember - lost out on goal difference to neighbours Manchester City in 2012 with 89 points.

So if Liverpool do reach 97 points and lose out to a City side on 98 points, it will be a remarkable statistical achievement.

Every second counts

Shane Long scored the quickest Premier League goal of all time last week, but by how many seconds did it beat the previous best? (David, Hereford)

MARTIN SAYS: It took Shane Long 7.69 seconds to score at Vicarage Road last week during Southampton's 1-1 draw with Watford, beating the previous record - set by Ledley King for Tottenham at Bradford in the 2000/01 season - by 2.13 seconds.

0:39 Shane Long admits he is proud to have scored the fastest ever Premier League goal, but would have been happier had it been the winning goal against Watford

Talking of quick Premier League goals, Naby Keita got on the scoresheet after just 15 seconds during Liverpool's 5-0 win over Huddersfield on Friday night, the club's fastest-ever Premier League goal.

Now, because our friends at Opta only have exact times of all Premier League goals since 2006-07, we cannot tell you whose record the midfielder has beaten.

0.07 - At just seven seconds, Shane Long's strike against Watford is the fastest ever scored in @premierleague history. Record. #WATSOU — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 23, 2019

But these Liverpool players have all scored in the first minute of a Premier League match: Stan Collymore (v Wimbledon, Nov 1996), Robbie Fowler (v Middlesbrough, Dec 1996 and Bolton, Nov 1997), Maxi Rodriguez (v Fulham, May 2011) and Martin Skrtel (v Arsenal, Feb 2014).

MAY

Home discomforts

Huddersfield ended the season with just 10 home goals in the Premier League. Has anyone ever scored fewer? (Barry)

Image: Huddersfield have scored only 10 goals at home in the Premier League this season

MARTIN SAYS: In short, no. Huddersfield's tally of 10 in the fewest of any team in Premier League history. In fact, no team in the top four divisions have scored fewer home goals this season.

Huddersfield share the record for fewest home goals with Manchester City. Stuart Pearce's side did not score a home goal after New Year's Day in the 2006-07 season.

They are also the first club in top-flight history to fail to score twice in any home game across the season. Given their lack of goals, it is no surprise Huddersfield have won only two league matches at the John Smith's Stadium in 2018/19. That is one more than Derby, in 2007-08, and Sunderland, in 2005-06, managed though.","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://e0.365dm.com/18/04/1600x900/skysports-tyler-martin-tyler_4290677.jpg?20180423131600,"['tylers', 'league', 'united', 'win', 'endofseason', 'record', 'premier', 'games', '201819', 'scored', 'goal', 'stats', 'special', 'season', 'martin', 'manchester']", ,none
50,50,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,National Theatre Successfully Holds a Mother’s Day Treat - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/national-theatre-successfully-holds-a-mothers-day-treat/,"The National Theatre seem to have found their mojo in the entertainment arena after some sort of resurgence in its programming and events.

From ‘Agoro’, ‘Tiera Pura’, to ‘Harriet Turbman’ and others, it has been back to back impressive theatrical productions from the folks at the National Theatre.

The recent drama, ‘Only Mother’s Can Tell’ shown last Saturday was another testament of how theatre has been revived by the National Theatre.

“Only Mothers Can Tell,” was performed by the National Drama Company, a resident Theatre Company of the National Theatre to mark the 2019-Women week and a prelude to the Mother’s Day celebration.

The play highlighted the unquantifiable love of a mother to her children and mankind.

It captured a young cowherd, called Zuzu, who fell in love with a girl within the same age limit named Iseda. But as per tradition in their village. All maidens after undergoing their puberty dance line up for the king to choose one as his wife.

Unfortunately for the young love birds’ relationship was dealt a massive blow after the king chose Iseda as his wife at her puberty stage.

But the two love birds continued to meet secretly by a well called “Ancient Well”, which was where they first met as lovers. The shared a lot of secrets using the well as a symbol of their secrecy as Iseda got pregnant for Zuzu.

But the King didn’t know the Prince of his throne was not his son, neither did the Prince know the King was not his biological father. It was only the mother who could tell indeed.

The music in the play drove forward and heightened the excitement and suspense throughout.

The tournament, comes off on Monday, May 13, at the home ground of Liverpool FC, Anfield, UK.

Team Wilmar would be joining seven other teams at the SC Trophy Finals to compete for the ultimate crown.

The Standard Chartered Road to Anfield Tournament is an international 5-aside football tournament that provides local markets with a platform to actively engage clients, staff and stakeholders.

It is hinged to the Bank’s Liverpool Football Club sponsorship. Winners of competitions in the various markets receive an all expenses paid trip to Anfield, the home of Liverpool FC to join other winners to play in an eight – team tournament to determine which team emerges as the best for a particular year.

Whiles in Liverpool, Team Wilmar Africa watched the final home match between Liverpool FC and Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday May 12.

They would receive coaching from a Liverpool Legend to prepare for the SC Trophy Finals as well as engage in other activities.

Asiedua Addae, Head of Corporate Affairs and Brand & Marketing at Standard Chartered said, “we are excited about Wilmar Africa’s participation in this money can’t buy experience and competition. We are rooting for them and believe they would excel and be the first African team to lift the SC Trophy at Anfield”.

Godwin Kowero, executive secretary of Africa Forest Forum (AFF), said that the workshop will be held on May 20-24 in Nairobi and will be attended by over 100 delegates.

“We shall also be commemorating a decade of our work in the continent during the workshop,” Kowere told journalists.

Kowero revealed that AFF will also be launching eight training compendiums on various aspects of climate change in forestry.

He noted that AFF has taken a leading role in creating awareness on the role of forests and trees in national economic development, livelihoods and environmental stability in all the African countries.

“We have provided a bridge between science-based knowledge and good policies to support sustainable forest management by effectively working within a science-policy-management framework,” he added.

AFF was founded in 2007 as a platform that could support African forestry stakeholders to discuss and mobilize resources for improved management and use of their forest and tree resources.

The event is organized by AFF in collaboration with the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI).

Trailing 1-0 from Saturday's first leg at Pride Park, the Rams fell behind early on to a Stuart Dallas goal (24), but Jack Marriott (45), Mason Mount (46) and a Harry Wilson penalty (58) put them ahead in the tie.

Man of the match: Jack Marriott

Dallas then grabbed another to level proceedings (62) but Gaetano Berardi's late sending off handed the ascendancy back to Derby, and Marriott clipped in the late winner (85) to secure a 4-3 aggregate win.

Frank Lampard's side will now go on to face Aston Villa - who beat West Brom on penalties on Tuesday night - in the final on Monday, May 27. Although the one negative from their night was Scott Malone's late red card that will see him miss that game at Wembley.

A game of twists and turns at Elland Road

Leeds got the breakthrough on the night after 24 minutes. Pablo Hernandez swung a fine free-kick into the box that evaded everyone on its way through and rattled the far post before bouncing kindly back to Dallas, who graciously converted into a virtual open goal.

1:22 Derby’s players had a cheeky response to Leeds fans singing ‘stop crying Frank Lampard’, a reference to the ‘spygate’ incident earlier in the season.

Team news Kemar Roofe and Adam Forshaw were injured, so Patrick Bamford returned up front for Leeds and Jamie Shackleton came into midfield. Derby's only change from the first leg saw Mason Bennett replace David Nugent up top.

Lampard rolled the dice before half-time as he withdrew Duane Holmes and introduced Marriott, and the move paid dividends just 33 seconds later as the substitute found the equaliser on the night after 45 minutes, capitalising on a mix-up at the back between Liam Cooper and goalkeeper Kiko Casilla to pounce and slot the ball into an unguarded net.

Image: Leeds will play in the Championship again next season

Just 40 seconds after the break Derby found the goal that levelled the tie at 2-2 on aggregate as Wilson found the space on the edge of the area to flick the ball into Mount, and he finished calmly past Casilla.

And the turnaround was complete after 58 minutes as Liam Cooper hauled down Mason Bennett off the ball in the box, and Wilson stepped up to send Casilla the wrong way from 12 yards.

Derby fans started to chant ""Leeds are falling apart, again"" but they would eat their words just four minutes later as the home side found the equaliser. Incredibly it was Dallas again, as he sprinted down the line and cut inside into the box and curled an absolute beauty into the bottom corner. 2-3 on the night, 3-3 on aggregate.

Leeds were in the ascendancy but the pendulum swung again in the 78th minute. After nine yellow cards had been dished out it seemed inevitable that one would eventually turn to red, and Berardi duly obliged as he picked up his second caution for a lunge on Bradley Johnson.

And with five minutes remaining Derby made them pay. Richard Keogh, of all people, found himself charging deep into Leeds territory before playing a fine ball into Marriott, who clipped the crucial finish over Casilla that sent his side to Wembley.

It was some surprise, even with his goal drought, that Marriott didn't start the game in the absence of Martyn Waghorn and David Nugent. But Lampard introduced the striker just before half-time and his decision to do so was swiftly rewarded as his goal triggered the comeback, before he later scored the all-important fourth to send Derby to Wembley.

The managers

Marcelo Bielsa: ""It's a painful situation and we are very disappointed. It's not necessary to analyse, during the season the games that could have allowed us to find a solution to all possibilities we couldn't make a different for those games for the same reason as today.

4:13 Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa gives his reaction to Sky Sports after the defeat to Derby at Elland Road.

""In the first half we should have finished with two goals more, but we finished [level] and in the second half it's a game that broke immediately.

""The chances of the opponent ended in goals and ours not. It's meaningless explaining that we had as many chances as the opponent in the second half and in the first we made more, it should have made a difference.""

Frank Lampard: ""We were 1-0 down, I said to the lads everyone had written us off. It's 1/8 for them to go through or something, everyone says they've beaten us three times, but we made a little tweak, and it worked brilliantly but you need bravery on the ball and the lads showed it.

3:35 Derby boss Frank Lampard says his side still aren't done but was proud of the team's bravery after they beat Leeds 4-2 to reach the Championship play-off final

""The workrate through the year, players coming in, we're not there yet, I watched Villa do this, but the players deserve it. The performance tonight, we were the better team over two legs, we should have had a penalty, but it was a brilliant performance from the lads.

""There's work to do, this isn't the end, we're underdogs again and we'll have a tough game against a brilliant Villa team, but we're there.""

56,56,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Forest Commission finds issues with report on forest cover loss - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/forest-commission-finds-issues-with-report-on-forest-cover-loss/,"The Forestry Commission has described as inaccurate a report by the World Resources Institute (WRI) claiming that Ghana witnessed a 60 per cent change in forest cover loss between 2017 and 2018.

The Commission, in a statement, said the methodology used by the WRI to reach the conclusion was erroneous and did not capture the exact

situation on the ground.

“The WRI report indicates a 60 per cent change in loss and not a 60 per cent loss of forest cover in one year (2017-2018). A further interrogation of the original research data, however, indicates this figure to be 31.3 per cent,” it said.

“We wish to state that the conclusions arrived at in the publication are based on a faulty methodology as well as a misunderstanding of current controlled agricultural practices in Ghana.”

The Commission said the WRI report looked at tree cover and not forest cover.

While the Commission acknowledges that negative farming practices and illegal mining contributed to deforestation and forest degradation, it said everything was being done to reverse the trend.

It said within a six-year period, from 2012 to the end of 2018, there was a marginal increase of 1.96 per cent in the country’s forest cover from 6,235,102.32 hectares to 6,357,876.03 hectares at the end of 2018.

“The Forestry Commission holds on to its mission to sustainably develop and manage Ghana’s forest and wildlife resources. It will, therefore, continue to engage in forest improvement and protection activities to restore Ghana’s forest cover,” the statement said.

“Ghana is, indeed, not alone in this fight to keep the forest heritage for the present and future generations. A number of initiatives has, accordingly, been put in place to address this challenge.”

In this direction, the statement said the Forestry Commission had put in place a lot of interventions to improve forest cover.

These include REDD+, an internationally accepted mechanism to combat climate change, which implements Climate Smart Cocoa Practices among other things, setting up of rural service centres for easy access to farm inputs; and increased cocoa extension services and replanting of old cocoa farms.

The private sector and the Government had also signed onto the Cocoa and Forests Initiative to halt deforestation in the chocolate and cocoa supply chains by promoting climate-smart cocoa practices.

The country has also signed onto the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the European Union to help combat illegal logging, under which Ghana was strengthening its law enforcement capacity by developing a robust wood traceability system.

There is also the Youth in Afforestation Programme that employed more than 60,000 youth to help in afforestation throughout the country.

Since its inception in April 2018, this had culminated in the planting of over 22,000 ha.

The Commission had also engaged the private sector in plantations development and as at the end of 2018, over 50,000 hectares have been planted.

“The increase in the open forest is attributable to the on-going plantation development drive, both public and private, as well as the regeneration stimulated by the opening up of the closed forest,” the statement said.","Sun, 19 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/forestry-commission.jpg?fit=640%2C400&ssl=1,"['statement', 'loss', 'report', 'cent', 'commission', 'wri', 'private', 'cocoa', 'finds', 'practices', 'issues', 'forest', 'cover']", ,none

58,58,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,AC Milan fail to qualify for Champions League: Never-ending nightmare drags on - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/ac-milans-never-ending-nightmare-drags-on-with-champions/rta98hy0agkn1m3qdlx09hco3,"AC Milan's never-ending nightmare drags on with Champions League failure

It was hoped that Leonardo, Gennaro Gattuso and Paolo Maldini could bring the glory days back to San Siro but they are all now facing the sack

For five minutes on Sunday evening, AC Milan were in dreamland.

Leading 3-2 at SPAL, the Rossoneri had moved above bitter rivals Inter into Serie A's fourth and final Champions League place thanks to Empoli's surprise equaliser against the Nerazzurri at San Siro.

Then, Radja Nainggolan's 81st-minute strike changed everything.

Despite Empoli's brave bid to level matters – and save themselves from relegation in the process – Inter held on, surviving a succession of near-misses, the most remarkable of which saw Danilo D'Ambrosio divert a cross against his own crossbar.

As the Nerazzurri's players celebrated one of the most dramatic finales to a season in Serie A history, their Milan counterparts were left crestfallen in Ferrara. They had won their final four games of the season yet it felt like it was all for nothing.

Even their coach, Gennaro Gattuso, a renowned hard-man, admitted: ""I slept very little in the last few days and now, mentally, I'm in pieces.""

It wasn't supposed to end like this. Paolo Maldini's long-awaited return to Milan last August was meant to herald the dawn of an exciting new era for the Rossoneri, after one of the darkest periods in their entire history.

After the chaos and constant uncertainty of the tenure of Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux., American hedge fund Elliot Management had turned to club men to restore order and stability.

""The beautiful thing about today is that we now have myself, Paolo and Gennaro in the sporting sector of the club,"" Leonardo enthused ahead of the start of the 2018-19 season.

With the Brazilian serving as sporting director, Maldini working alongside him as sporting strategy & development director, and Gattuso continuing in his role as head coach, Milan had tasked three former Rossoneri team-mates with reawakening one of the traditional giants of the global game.

However, this veritable dream team has been unable to drag the seven-time European Cup winners out of a seemingly never-ending nightmare.

It is now eight years since their last Scudetto; five since they last competed in the Champions League.

The latter drought is killing the club.

In desperate times such as these for Italian football in general, qualification for Europe's premier competition has never been so important.

It's estimated that Champions League football would have guaranteed Milan an estimated €50 million in additional revenue next season, a significant sum of money for a club that ranked 18th in this year's Deloitte Football Money League – which ranks the game's highest earners – below the likes of Schalke and Everton.

The Europa League, by contrast, offers €20m at most, with the television market pool share a determining factor.

Of course, while Milan have finished fifth, there's no guarantee that they will even be allowed to compete in continental competition next season.

With the threat of further sanctions hanging over them for failing to meet Financial Fair Play (FFP) targets, the Rossoneri – who were originally banned from competing in last season's Europa League before launching a successful appeal – are now reportedly willing to cut a deal with UEFA that would see them excluded from this season's competition.

The thinking is that having failed to meet their primary objection (Champions League qualification) they may as well take the hit of going a season without European football, using that time in exile to try to balance their books.

It is a risky ploy, of course. The only reason Milan made it back into last year's Football Money League was their run to the last 16 of the Europa League, which played a significant role in their 8 per cent increase in revenue in 2017-18.

European football is that influential for Serie A clubs, given how far they have fallen behind their Spanish and English rivals in terms of commercial revenue and the value of TV rights deals.

As Deloitte noted earlier this year, ""The latest domestic broadcast rights sales process delivered an increase of just three per cent for the three-year cycle that commenced with Sky Italia and DAZN in 2018-19...

""Despite the commencement of a new international rights cycle, delivering an increase of 81% on the previous reported minimum guarantees, distributions to Serie A clubs will see limited growth until at least the next cycle beginning in 2021/22.

""Therefore, further revenue increases for Italian clubs will depend on a club’s ability to deliver growth in matchday and commercial revenue streams, as well as success in UEFA competitions.""

Without Champions League football – or, worse again, any European football at all – Milan are going to be hit hard.

Leonardo even admitted earlier in the season that the club's summer transfer plans would be determined by their final Serie A standing.

""If this Milan finishes fourth, then we will have a major window in June,"" the former Brazil international explained.

""However, if the club's goals are not met, there will be no major signings and the current players on big deals will not be retained.""

His services are unlikely to be retained either, though, and Maldini's position is also at risk.

Milan have quickly lost faith in both and new Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis, who arrived in December after quitting Arsenal in September, is planning to completely overhaul the club's sporting staff.

However, Gattuso, who has for so long seemed like a dead man walking, there is still an outside chance he could be granted a stay of execution, given the dearth of proven, top-quality alternatives.

The former midfielder has admitted his frustration at the fact that Milan had their Champions League destiny in their hands for so long – thanks in no small part to a 10-game unbeaten run earlier this year – only to throw it away by winning just one of the six games that followed their demoralising derby defeat on March 17. Indeed, the Rossoneri were in the top four until losing at Torino in week 34.

However, he maintains that, taking the season as a whole, he did a good job with the players at his disposal. Crucially, Gazidis agrees.

""Despite the victory [over SPAL],"" Gazidis commented, ""we're quite disappointed at having failed to qualify for the Champions League.

""However, the team fought hard right until the end and I want to thank them for their efforts in overcoming the difficulties we had in terms of injuries and other setbacks.""

Whether Gattuso gets to keep his job remains to be seen but Gazidis does, at least, enjoy a good rapport with Gattuso, who is nothing if not admirably honest.

The former Arsenal man also believes that Leonardo botched Milan's transfer market last summer, when the likes of Diego Laxalt, Samu Castillejo and Gonzalo Higuain arrived at the Giuseppe Meazza..

Consequently, despite the successful January additions of Lucas Paqueta and Krzysztof Piatek, Gazidis and the World Cup winner have never quite seen eye to eye, which is why Leonardo is now likely to take up a job with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) and be replaced at Milanello by Lille sporting director Luis Ocampos.

Given their financial limitations, Gazidis believes that Milan must now focus on youth and unearthing rough diamonds – areas in which Ocampos excels.

In short, Milan plan to start over. Again.

59,59,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,The biggest breakthrough in agriculture to help feed the planet may come from outer space - CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/indigo-ag-improving-yields-with-microbes-satellite-imaging.html,"A four-year-old start-up called Indigo Ag is the No. 1 company on the 2019 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. Indigo Ag is out to feed the world and help farmers make a good living without harming the planet. And one secret to its recent growth is hidden in the stars. Using satellite imaging and geospatial intelligence, it's created a living map of the world's food supply. The quest to increase food production remains critical as the global population grows from around 7.5 billion today to a projected 9.8 billion by 2050, according to data from the United Nations. Intensification of food production in the last decade has contributed to deforestation, declines in soil health and freshwater resources, plus an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers and other food businesses are now struggling to rein in their negative environmental impacts. With 920 employees, Indigo Ag is best known for making non-GMO seed treatments that help farmers maximize their yield on row crops, including soybeans, rice, wheat, corn and cotton. The treatments consist of naturally occurring microbes, like plant-friendly bacteria and fungi. Farmers apply them to their seeds as a spray or powder coating before planting.

Eventually, the start-up plans to develop microbes to aid the growth of other crops, including coffee and high value nuts, fruits and vegetables. But for the time being, the company is focused on grains. Indigo Ag's newer seed coatings aim for more than yield improvements — they encourage desirable traits in plants, like soybeans that yield more oil, or grains that are more palatable to certain livestock, for example. They also reduce farmers' needs for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, says Indigo Ag CEO David Perry. Traditional chemical ""inputs,"" as they're called in the industry, can cause water pollution, harm wildlife, have damaging side effects on soil and hurt the health of people who work with or ingest them. In one famous case, a team of scientists led by Louisiana State University and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium found a New Jersey-size ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico, caused largely by the runoff of fertilizers and other waste from farms around the Mississippi River. According to Ben Riensche, a sixth-generation farmer in Iowa who grows corn and soybeans on 18,000 acres, Indigo Ag's seed coatings improve crop yields, typically by more than 10%. He has been working with the company for three years as a customer and a research partner. Indigo Ag tests and runs control groups in four of his fields when they're developing new seed treatments.

Riensche says Indigo Ag's approach is appealing to farmers who want help growing through rough conditions like drought or when a disease or pest infestation is threatening to encroach. But farmers also want to improve their bottom line. ""Let's face it, crops face stress every year. No two years are alike. Hot, cold, wet, dry, early or late — I'll tell you what has to be the fertilizer strategy. But if you can help my plants overcome stress in the field, and help me produce the same yield with less inputs, or produce higher-value crops using something from the biome? It's better for my business and better from an environmental standpoint."" In 2017 Indigo Ag had notched a few hundred customers. By 2018 that number had ballooned to 5,000 food producers growing food on 1 million acres. The company expects to see 25,000 growers using its technology to produce food on 4 million acres by the end of this year. The company is on target to surpass annual revenue of $1 billion in 2019, Perry says, partly owing to its international expansion. It now operates outside the U.S., in Argentina, Brazil and Australia, along with a joint venture with Mahyco Grow in India.

Agricultural Revolution 2.0

Indigo Ag's chief of operations for North America, Rachel Raymond, says it's been hard for the agriculture industry to attract a next generation of farmers, including in the U.S. That's because most farmers here are figuring out how to cope with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather. At the same time, they have been hit by new tariffs and uncertainty around trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, previously a major buyer of soybeans and other row crops. The USDA expects net farm income in 2019 — a measure of farms' profitability — to clock in 49% below its highest level of $136.1 billion in 2013 and below farms' historical average of $90 billion from 2000 to 2017. Perry and Raymond say that by bringing better forecasting, transparency and products to the market, they're out to make farming less of a commodity business and more reliably profitable. Since farmers want to grow profits as well as crops, Perry has pushed Indigo Ag to expand its offerings beyond microbiology into software and services for farmers.

Indigo Ag rolled out a farmer's answer to eBay or Amazon — the Indigo Marketplace — with select customers in June and a public launch in September last year. The platform connects growers with buyers who want the ingredients they purchase to meet exacting specifications. For example, to meet local environmental standards or hit corporate sustainability goals, some businesses will want to buy grains that were grown using less water or producing lower amounts of greenhouse gas emissions than average. For the convenience of getting just what they want, with no phone calls or travel required, buyers are willing to say how much they'll pay ahead of a harvest. That's a good thing for farmers trying to anticipate prices or demand. More from CNBC Disruptor 50:

One major buyer on it is Anheuser-Busch InBev, the holding company behind beers including Budweiser, Stella Artois and Hapi (from China's Harbin Brewery). After the marketplace gained traction, Indigo Ag began hearing more from farmers about their other needs — like transporting their grains to customers or storing their grains safely and quickly when floods were threatening to destroy their crops.

In the same way that Google maps can tell you anytime a new Starbucks appears on the corner, we want to have that same level of information about our food supply. David Perry Indigo Ag CEO

So Indigo Ag rolled out another service, Indigo Transport, which links carriers to growers and other bulk commodity shippers across the U.S. Indigo Ag has also been gathering genomic information on plant microbes, which it uses to predict whether a certain bacteria or fungi will help a plant survive and thrive in shifting environmental conditions. In December 2018, Indigo Ag acquired Tellus Labs, a company that parses complicated images from satellites to figure out what's growing, where on Earth and in what conditions, each day. Incorporating this technology allows Indigo Ag and its customers to monitor the world's food supply and figure out where to focus their efforts next. As Perry explained: ""In the same way that Google maps can tell you anytime a new Starbucks appears on the corner, we want to have that same level of information about our food supply. As an example, we now know every field that corn and soy is growing on in North or South America. We can estimate the yields on those and update that on a daily basis."" Farmers look at this information and make decisions about what to plant, when to harvest and when to take certain protective measures, he added. The company has also introduced new seed treatments for smaller grains, including oats, barley and rye, says Raymond. She's looking forward to the day that whisky and beer made with her customers' crops show up at her favorite watering holes. Indigo Ag directly challenges the business interests of some of the largest companies in the agricultural sector — where M&A and venture investing have accelerated in recent years — including Nutrien, Mosaic, BASF, Sygenta (now part of Chinese giant ChemChina), Corteva (DowDuPont's agricultural sciences division) and Bayer (which acquired Monsanto). Bayer has lost nearly 50% of its value since the Monsanto merger and a series of billion-dollar court settlements related to its Roundup weedkiller.","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105903667-1557413561196symbiota_b_088.jpg?v=1557916321,"['indigo', 'ag', 'biggest', 'feed', 'help', 'planet', 'space', 'come', 'perry', 'including', 'breakthrough', 'company', 'farmers', 'billion', 'crops', 'agriculture', 'outer', 'food']", ,flood

The Ghana international has been linked with the Red Devils - among other big clubs - and his representative considers him to be an elite player

Thomas Partey is better than Paul Pogba, according to his agent, with the Atletico Madrid midfielder generating talk of interest from the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Inter.

This is not the first time that the Ghana international is said to have registered on the transfer radar of leading sides across Europe.

His potential has been noted for some time and, at 25 years of age, is now approaching his peak.

The same can be said for World Cup winner Pogba, who is a year older, but questions continue to be asked of his form and ongoing presence at Old Trafford.

Were a man being heavily linked with Real Madrid to be on the move this summer, then United have been told that they could do worse than look to Spain for a replacement .

Partey is considered to be a more all-round performer than a French counterpart and has a release clause of just €50 million (£44m/$56m) in his contract at Atletico.

Jose Daniel Jimenez Pozanco told FcInterNews of a highly-rated performer, who does not always get the recognition his displays deserve: “He is like Pogba, he’s a box to box player, but he is better than the Frenchman.

“That is because he does more defensive work. I feel that because he is African, he gets much less media coverage than the Manchester United player.

“I first watched him play in Ghana, I immediately recognised his qualities and thought that if he could improve on a tactical level, he would be one of the best in the world.

“I told him he must listen, learn and remain humble. A person should always remember where they came from and he has got where he has through hard work. Nobody handed him anything.”

If a scramble for Partey’s signature were to be sparked, then sides in England would be expected to head the queue.

Inter, though, are piecing together ambitious plans for the future – with Goal revealing their interest in appointing Antonio Conte as the club’s next manager – and Italy could be another potential landing spot .

Pozanco added on the reported interest being shown in Partey from San Siro: “There is no reason why he won’t move to Italy. Inter, like Atleti are a top team.

“He has a €50m release clause and in football anything is possible, just look at Diego Godin leaving to join Inter and Antoine Griezmann possibly on his way to Barcelona.”","Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['sides', 'release', 'partey', 'transfer', 'paul', 'thomas', 'midfielder', 'talked', 'united', 'better', 'pogba', 'interest', 'ghana', 'work', 'unitedlinked', 'told', 'talk', 'manchester']", ,none

Nigerian Water Minister Adamu’s ‘Battle To Reclaim Lake Chad’

May 16, The {Daily Trust} of Nigeria has published an article on the efforts by Nigeria’s Water Minister Suleiman Adamu for the inter-basin water transfer to reverse the shrinking Lake Chad with Transaqua.

“Perhaps, the most cheering moves by the present administration in the last three years in the water sector is the renewed interest to save the drying Lake Chad,” says the article, reporting that Adamu organized the International Conference on Lake Chad, Feb. 26-28, 2018 in Abuja.

“Experts at the conference, including the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) agreed with the position of the Federal Government of Nigeria that it was time to find workable solution to recharge the drying Lake, which they said had depleted from its original size.

“One of the workable solutions suggested at the conference was to transfer water from the Congo Basin to the Lake Chad Basin [Transaqua, ed.], which Nigeria’s water minister says is technically feasible based on earlier studies conducted by a Chinese company, PowerChina….”

“Experts agreed that transferring water from Congo Basin down to the Lake Chad is a herculean task that requires huge money and time and thus its impact cannot be felt immediately,” the article says, quoting some engineers who say feasibility studies might take years. This is the view of those who put the cart before the horse, and want to first see whether the color of flamingos will be affected or if rare species of snakes would be threatened, before proving the technical feasibility of the project.

However, as concerns financing, “Hope rises recently, when the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to help raise $50 billion for a project to help raise $50 billion for a project to help revive the drought-stricken Lake. President Muhammad Buhari was said to have written to the UN scribe to co-chair the fundraising session with him and his acceptance response was delivered by the President of the African Development Bank, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina in Abuja. With this many believe that if the current efforts to reclaim the lake are sustained or intensified, glory days lie ahead.”

Nigeria’s President Buhari Continues Organizing Support for Transaqua

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari won the support from the President of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, for the “inter-basin water transfer” to save Lake Chad, the technical name for the Transaqua project. Meeting Espinosa in Abuja, May 7, Buhari “stressed the role the international community needed to play in the endeavor, since recharging the lake was beyond the financial power of the affected countries,” says a statement issued by Buhari’s spokesman Femi Adesina.

In a separate meeting with Espinosa, Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said: “We are looking to have the support of the UN and your support in particular, to address this challenge. One of the mechanisms we have identified is to recharge the Lake and it is going to be capital intensive efforts and something in the order of $40-$50 billion estimated and clearly, we are going to leverage on the international community because this is a huge resources and we look for your support.”

On her side, the UNGA President Espinosa, a native of Ecuador, said: “It is a huge thing. And as a geographer, I can tell you. When I look at the map of Lake Chad and that in less than 40 years, this lake went from 24,000 something to 2,000 square kilometers, I have concluded that this is one of the major climate change disasters in this continent.

“So, that is a very touching example of how we need to tackle development and security together. President Muhammadu Buhari has told us also that there is no peace and security without development and there is no development without peace,” she said.

President Buhari had described the combined effect of the impoverishment and terrorism in the Lake Chad region. “The condition of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country is pathetic. We have at least a million children who neither know their parents nor where they come from.” Damage to infrastructure, particularly in the Northeast, has been horrendous: “Bridges have been blown up, schools, hospitals, churches, mosques, and other buildings have been destroyed. All these will be rehabilitated, and every form of international help is welcome.”

Russia’s Growing Involvement in Africa’s Nuclear Power Projects

In an article in OilPrice.com today, Vanand Meliksetian, an energy and utilities consultant, points out the growing Russian interest in Africa’s energy development in general, and in establishing nuclear power in Africa in particular.

After showing that energy poverty is a significant problem in Africa in holding back its economic potential, he writes: “Russia’s energy industry, in comparison, is booming. Its state-run nuclear energy company Rosatom has an order book of 34 reactors in 12 countries worth $300 billion. Recently, Moscow has set its eyes on Africa where most states have either already struck a deal with the Kremlin or are considering one.”

The lack of access to a reliable and affordable source of energy is a severe impediment to Africa’s economic development. Also, Africa is urbanizing much faster than the rest of the world. African cities are expanding by 8% every year compared to 2% globally — which puts even more pressure on the existing energy systems.

In view of this development, Russia is keen to offer nuclear power to the African countries by working out deals which would allow them to adopt nuclear power. “The Russian deal is particularly appealing to countries lacking nuclear know how, due to Moscow’s comprehensive offers regarding financing, construction, and operation of the facilities. Currently, Rosatom is experimenting with a contract known as build-own-operate, under which ownership of the plant remains in Russian hands while energy is sold to the host country. This new type of contract is appealing to several African states which lack the means to finance construction.","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lake-chad-transaqua.jpg?fit=457%2C461&ssl=1,"['president', 'support', 'energy', 'development', 'buhari', 'water', 'save', 'working', 'nigeria', 'lake', 'chad', 'power', 'nuclear']", ,drought

A combination of extreme temperatures nearing 40 C and a three-month dearth of rainfall in the region has deprived the monkeys of access to sufficient water.

Alfredo Martínez Alfonso, a municipal police officer in Chancarral, Minatitlán, the location of a large wildlife refuge, said nearly 10 monkeys have died.

Most are “mothers who then leave their young behind as orphans. Everything has dried up, so the animals have been dying throughout the months of April and May . . . they do not have water, and so they do not have any way to get nutrients.”

Resident Dolores Morales told the news platform La Razón that the area has never seen such a dramatic decline in the howler monkey population due to drought.

“The [death] of the monkeys is something we have never seen before. I have lived here for 25 years . . . and in all that time we have not ever heard of any deaths from a drought until now.”

Howler monkeys spend most of their lives in tall trees of the rainforest. Now, residents say, the survivors can be seen in the trees among the hanging corpses of the drought victims. Alejandrina Martínez Jiménez, another Chancarral resident, said locals have left water and food for the monkeys in an attempt to keep them alive.

“We brought them water. A girl climbed up [a] branch . . . and that’s where we left them water, but we do not know if it is high enough that they can climb down to get it. It is such a shame to see the poor animals die since they are so much like humans.”

Residents of nearby Hidalgotitlán rallied on Sunday to help. For three hours yesterday morning they gathered donations of fruit that was delivered later to Chancarral.

Howler monkeys are becoming increasingly rare and are threatened by hunting and habitat destruction. Some experts believe that howler monkeys could become extinct within the next 35 years.

There were about 30 believed to be living in the Chancarral area.

The importance of this neglected experience has been elucidated by a growing body of qualitative research, which we systematically reviewed and synthesised. Methods and findings We undertook systematic searching to identify qualitative studies of women’s and girls’ experiences of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Of 6,892 citations screened, 76 studies reported in 87 citations were included. Studies captured the experiences of over 6,000 participants from 35 countries. This included 45 studies from sub-Saharan Africa (with the greatest number of studies from Kenya [n = 7], Uganda [n = 6], and Ethiopia [n = 5]), 21 from South Asia (including India [n = 12] and Nepal [n = 5]), 8 from East Asia and the Pacific, 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean, 5 from the Middle East and North Africa, and 1 study from Europe and Central Asia. Through synthesis, we identified overarching themes and their relationships to develop a directional model of menstrual experience. This model maps distal and proximal antecedents of menstrual experience through to the impacts of this experience on health and well-being. The sociocultural context, including menstrual stigma and gender norms, influenced experiences by limiting knowledge about menstruation, limiting social support, and shaping internalised and externally enforced behavioural expectations. Resource limitations underlay inadequate physical infrastructure to support menstruation, as well as an economic environment restricting access to affordable menstrual materials. Menstrual experience included multiple themes: menstrual practices, perceptions of practices and environments, confidence, shame and distress, and containment of bleeding and odour. These components of experience were interlinked and contributed to negative impacts on women’s and girls’ lives. Impacts included harms to physical and psychological health as well as education and social engagement. Our review is limited by the available studies. Study quality was varied, with 18 studies rated as high, 35 medium, and 23 low trustworthiness. Sampling and analysis tended to be untrustworthy in lower-quality studies. Studies focused on the experiences of adolescent girls were most strongly represented, and we achieved early saturation for this group. Reflecting the focus of menstrual health research globally, there was an absence of studies focused on adult women and those from certain geographical areas. Conclusions Through synthesis of extant qualitative studies of menstrual experience, we highlight consistent challenges and developed an integrated model of menstrual experience. This model hypothesises directional pathways that could be tested by future studies and may serve as a framework for program and policy development by highlighting critical antecedents and pathways through which interventions could improve women’s and girls’ health and well-being. Review protocol registration The review protocol registration is PROSPERO: CRD42018089581.

Author summary Why was this study done? A growing body of qualitative research has highlighted the importance of menstrual experiences for the health and well-being of women and girls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Qualitative research has identified an array of factors contributing to experiences but has not developed clear theory to direct intervention and evaluation. What did the researchers do and find? We systematically searched and critically appraised the body of qualitative studies of menstrual experience in LMICs.

We identified overarching themes and mapped the relationships between them to develop a directional model of menstrual experience.

Women and girls reported impacts of negative menstrual experiences on physical and psychological health, education, employment, and social participation.

Both resource limitations and the sociocultural context contribute to menstrual experience. What do these findings mean? Women’s and girls’ menstrual experiences are complex and multifaceted, but across LMICs, consistent factors contribute to experiences.

Findings advance the development of problem theory in menstrual health, and the developed model can be used as a framework for developing interventions and evaluation.

Future interventions should seek to address identified antecedents of menstrual experience, including knowledge, social support, restrictive behavioural expectations, and the physical and economic environment.

Introduction Each day, more than 300 million women are menstruating [1]. There is increasing recognition that this natural process is experienced negatively and presents a barrier to health and gender equality in low- and middle-income contexts [2]. A growing body of qualitative research has been critical to highlighting this issue. Early studies focused on adolescent girls reported that menstruation was experienced with discomfort and fear [3–5]. Access to clean, reliable materials to absorb menses, supportive sanitation infrastructure, and biological and pragmatic information about menstruation were highlighted as core challenges [6, 7]. Studies suggested that these challenges negatively impacted school participation [4, 8, 9], health, and well-being [10, 11, 12, 13]. Fewer studies of adult women have highlighted that they too lack resources and support [14, 15], which may contribute to stress and absence from employment [16, 17]. In response to growing advocacy, programs and policies seeking to address menstrual needs have emerged rapidly. Development of these interventions has drawn largely on qualitative literature, with limited high-quality quantitative research and controlled trials available [18, 19]. However, this use of qualitative evidence has been anecdotal and situated, drawing on individual studies that may be restricted in scope and have limited generalizability beyond their context. Thus, the first objective of this review was to undertake a systematic search and synthesis of extant qualitative studies to draw out common themes, as well as appraise the coverage and quality of existing research. The second objective of this review was to draw on the rich body of qualitative evidence to advance understanding of menstrual health. Program-orientated scoping research has often identified lists of factors important for menstrual experience, alongside lists of consequences for health and education. However, pathways between the variety of contributors and their impacts remain poorly understood [20]. Menstrual health research has tended to draw on programmatic models rather than detailed problem theory. One common model includes a Venn diagram with three circles: knowledge, menstrual products, and sanitation (e.g., [21, 22]). This may also include cultural norms and social factors as a broad concept surrounding the three core circles. These Venn models provide an intuitive high-level picture and pillars to inform programming. However, they do not provide a detailed problem theory, mapping relationships and aetiological pathways to hypothesised impacts on health and education. For example, we would expect different causal pathways contributing to reproductive tract infections than to mental health. The need for detailed problem theory becomes more salient when, in responding to the many challenges for women and girls, actors develop increasingly complex, multicomponent interventions, with many desired outcomes. A lack of clarity around core concepts, or terminologies, in menstrual research has further complicated the development of problem theory. Early efforts were united around ‘menstrual hygiene’. This was defined as ‘women and adolescent girls using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the menstruation period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials’ [6], providing a target for improving the effective and hygienic management of menses. However, because this definition does not include other menstrual needs highlighted by qualitative studies, more recent versions have expanded the definition, adding that ‘[women and adolescent girls] understand the basic facts linked to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with dignity and without discomfort or fear’ [23]. Dissatisfied with the coverage and physical focus of ‘menstrual hygiene’, more recent efforts have discussed ‘menstrual health’, suggested as ‘an encompassing term that includes both menstrual hygiene management (MHM) as well as the broader systemic factors that link menstruation with health, well-being, gender, education, equity, empowerment, and rights’ [21]. This term may be useful to describe a broad field of research and practice and facilitates the consideration of menstrual disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, endometriosis). However, although the use of ‘menstrual health’ or expansions to ‘menstrual hygiene’ may be beneficial for more comprehensive advocacy, neither addresses the underlying lack of unified problem theory. Thus, through an interpretive approach in this review, we seek to evolve problem theory and concept definitions by providing a more nuanced model and iteratively identifying aspects of menstrual experience. In sum, this systematic review and metasynthesis had 2 overarching objectives: (1) synthesise and appraise the extant qualitative research on women’s and girls’ menstrual experiences and (2) interpret findings across studies to develop an integrated model of menstrual experience mapping relationships between contributing factors (antecedents), menstrual experience, and the consequences of poor experiences for health and well-being (impacts).

Methods The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018089581 and is reported according to PRISMA guidance (S1 PRISMA Checklist). Search strategy and selection criteria The search strategy was designed to capture studies reporting on women’s and girls’ experiences of menstruation. Searches were undertaken in 11 databases (Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, Embase, Global Health, Medline, Open Grey, Popline, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, WHO Global Health Library) using a prespecified, piloted strategy reported in Table 1. Searches were completed in January 2019 with no language of publication or date restrictions applied. Comprehensive grey literature searching and hand searching were undertaken. Organisations attending to menstrual health were identified through participation in reports [7, 21], stakeholder meetings [2], and online searches. Websites (see list in S1 Text) were searched using relevant terms (e.g., ‘menstrual’, ‘menstruation’). Citations of included studies and reference lists of large menstrual health reports were searched [7, 21]. Results were exported into EPPI-Reviewer 4 (EPPI-Centre; https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914). Two authors (JH, AS) independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening to determine eligibility (JH). PPT PowerPoint slide

Embase search strategy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002803.t001 Studies were eligible if they reported qualitative analysis of the menstrual experiences of women and girls residing in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) as defined by the World Bank [24]. Studies that included women from LMICs now residing in high-income countries, or that combined populations from LMICs with those in high-income settings, were excluded. While these experiences also deserve increased attention, this review sought to synthesise the large set of studies situated in LMICs to inform evolving policy and practice in these regions. Studies exclusively concerning the acceptability of menstrual suppression were excluded. Studies focussed on puberty more broadly, or the use of sanitation infrastructure, were only included when they reported on experiences of menstruation. For example, studies that included lists of puberty education needs that referenced menstruation but did not report on women’s or girls’ lived menstrual experiences were not included. Similarly, studies focussed on menopause, premenstrual syndrome, or polycystic ovary syndrome were not eligible for inclusion. Studies capturing the menstrual experiences of populations with menstrual disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, endometriosis) were eligible. Menstruating women and girls were the target population; thus, studies were excluded if they focused exclusively on girls’ premenarche, key informants, or males. Where key informant interviews were analysed alongside women’s and girls’ experiences, studies were included, but analysis focused on the experience of the target population. Qualitative and mixed-methods studies reported in peer-reviewed or grey literature were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they did not report any qualitative analysis or results (e.g., qualitative responses were back-coded for quantitative description). Following full-text screening, study research questions were extracted and iteratively grouped. Three groupings emerged: studies broadly focused on menstrual experiences, studies of experiences of menstruation for those with dysmenorrhea or disorders, and studies of experiences of menstrual interventions or products. Because the review aimed to provide a synthesis of menstrual experience and advance problem theory rather than explore the role of interventions, the third grouping was excluded from the present review but was retained for analyses reported elsewhere. Study quality appraisal Included studies were appraised using the EPPI-Centre checklist [25]. This checklist assesses methodological quality across recommended domains: sampling, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and privileging of participant perspectives (see S1 Table) [26, 27]. The checklist also facilitates generation of overall trustworthiness taking into account the first 4 ratings (sampling, data collection, analysis, and support for interpretation), as well as relevance to the review (relevance to the review question, privileging and involvement of participant perspectives), rated as low, medium or high. One author (JH) appraised the quality of all studies; 10% were independently appraised by a second author (GJMT), with 100% agreement. Analysis Reflecting the research questions, we employed a thematic synthesis approach [28], or an approach that seeks to describe themes as recurrent ‘units of meaning’ within and across studies, to synthesise insights from individual studies [29, 30]. We then used these themes to generate thematic networks to facilitate repeated comparison of the relationships between these themes. The use of thematic networks was appropriate as it includes (a) the explicit step of evidencing themes against specific statements and quotes from included studies and (b) the development of relationships between themes to form a network. The use of thematic networks reflected a lines-of-argument approach to meta-ethnography [31]; that is, drawing on the synthesis of qualitative research (meta-ethnography), we sought to go beyond merely describing a phenomenon to interpreting and understanding the social processes underlying it as part of an integrated scheme, such that no one study captures the entirety of the phenomenon (lines of argument). Analysis was undertaken in 4 steps: The findings of high- and medium-quality studies were thematically coded using NVivo 12 (QSR International; https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/nvivo-products) by the first author. Throughout initial coding, multiple mappings of the relationships between themes were generated. Representative quotations and core sections of text corresponding to each theme were recorded for each included study. Emergent themes were discussed among the authorship team, and multiple mappings of the relationships between themes were generated until authors reached consensus on a representation with the greatest explanatory power. Findings of low-quality studies were assessed for their fit with the proposed themes and integrated model. Low-quality studies supported the primary analysis, and no new constructs emerged. This is akin to the ‘sensitivity analysis’ common in systematic reviews of qualitative research, in which themes are checked to see if they rely on low-quality studies alone [30]. Using Nvivo 12, all studies were recoded against the consensus themes and integrated model for validation.

Discussion This systematic review had 2 overarching objectives: (1) to synthesise extant qualitative studies of women’s and girls’ menstrual experience in LMICs and (2) to integrate findings across studies to develop a directional model of menstrual experience to advance problem theory in menstrual health research. Despite different settings and populations, the narratives and lived experiences that emerged reflected consistent themes, with manifestations that differed by context. Mapping relationships between themes highlighted the multidimensional nature of menstrual experience. The integrated model produced illustrates pathways through which distal and proximal antecedents influence menstrual experience and ultimately result in impacts on physical and psychological health, education, employment, and social participation. Metasynthesis identified multiple components of menstrual experience. Menstrual practices, such as the type of material used, represented only one of these and directly contributed to physical health outcomes alone. Women’s and girls’ perceptions of their menstrual practices and environments emerged as a critical independent theme connecting practices to other impacts such as school absenteeism. In addition, confidence to manage menstrual bleeding and to undertake other activities during menses, as well as experiences of shame and fear, were salient contributors to psychological, social, and educational outcomes. Distal antecedents—the sociocultural context and resource limitations—underlay more proximal factors. Experiences captured in qualitative studies revealed knowledge of the biological, reproductive, and practical aspects of menstruation as a source of confidence, shame, and perceived acceptability of practices and environments. Social support enhanced or diminished experiences. This was closely connected to behavioural expectations that were placed upon women and girls and were enforced through discipline and cultural practices and ideals of cleanliness or femininity. Such expectations and broader menstrual stigma were internalised, influencing experience and self-concept. Poorly supportive physical infrastructure, such as a lack of water and sanitation facilities, made it difficult for women and girls to undertake their preferred menstrual practices in privacy and safety; in addition, the economic environment restricted access to preferred materials, soap, and pain relief. Included studies represented a broad range of contexts, although the majority attended to the experiences of school-aged girls. Amongst this group, we achieved early saturation of impacts and antecedents. Qualitative studies identified different relative contributions of antecedents such as the physical environment, knowledge, or behavioural expectations (particularly explicit restrictions) for girls in different settings, which have implications for programming in those areas. However, researchers should reconsider burdening future populations to identify these same factors and should focus on more detailed research questions. Greater depth in understanding the transmission of social norms and behavioural expectations, as well as confidence during menstruation, requires more attention. Experiences of adult women, particularly in the workplace, were under-researched. The experience of pain and menstrual disorders was poorly integrated in included studies and did not reach saturation. Most studies relied on FGDs. This approach was often selected to source priorities for intervention but meant that studies more often captured shared experiences of the school environment, rather than deep understanding of individual experiences that may yield greater sociological or psychological insights. Strengths and limitations The model presented differs from previous nonsystematic summaries that have generated lists of considerations to improve menstrual experience but have not specified directional relationships. Systematic searching identified a large body of literature, facilitating clarity in the identified themes. Metasynthesis remains an evolving methodology for the review of qualitative literature [30, 110–112]. This work draws on current best practice guidance [26, 27, 29, 30, 112]. As in all reviews, the findings are limited by available studies. The majority of included studies came from sub-Saharan Africa, and findings may be more representative of this context. We identified no studies from China, and studies from the Middle East and North African countries were more frequently undertaken in urban, more highly educated populations, though this reflects the global focus on menstrual hygiene research in specific geographical areas. Despite extensive searching, eligible studies may have been missed. A small number of studies in languages other than English were included; however, searching was only undertaken in English and may not have identified all available publications. Study quality was appraised using a tool designed for qualitative studies. This may have resulted in poorer scoring of mixed-methods studies that were considered only based on their qualitative components. Finally, as with any systematic review of qualitative research, a different team of researchers may have generated different insights. However, our focus on consensus themes and auditable methods lends credibility to our results as presented. This review included a large volume of studies. This presented the opportunity to draw themes and an integrated model across a broad range of contexts and populations. Region-specific reviews, or reviews with more targeted research questions, may have space to provide deeper insights into specific questions or region-specific challenges. Implications for research and practice Findings of our synthesis have implications for research and practice. To date, developed interventions have sought to improve menstrual experience by investing in education (to improve knowledge) and menstrual products (to improve the economic environment), two of the core pillars of existing menstrual health frameworks [19, 113]. Social support, the physical environment, cultural restrictions, and the perception of menses as dirty and needing to be concealed were all highly salient in included studies, yet these risk factors have received limited attention in interventions. Furthermore, these factors likely represent important covariates that should be considered when not the focus of interventions. The integrated model presented here offers a more nuanced framework to inform theories of change in program development and to assist evaluation strategies. Awareness of multiple, interconnected constructs also aids the identification of unanticipated harms. Models focused exclusively on menstrual practices have assessed only physical harms such as infections. Our integrated model suggests that changes to girls’ perceptions of their practices may cause distress as they struggle to adopt new practices advised in education interventions in an unsupportive physical environment. Interventions that focus on products may maintain menstrual stigma and reinforce behavioural expectations that concealing menses is paramount. Such interventions may have positive impacts on containment in the short term but risk greater harms if access to more reliable menstrual materials is unsustained. Results have implications for the design of quantitative studies. To date, these have evaluated links between menstrual practices and impacts (e.g., sanitary pad use and school attendance) [18, 114]. Our integrated model suggests that this is an indirect relationship and is unlikely to capture the true effects of menstrual experience on psychological, educational, and social outcomes without attention to the other components of experience that mediate this relationship. This integrated model should inform hypotheses for more detailed quantitative studies to test the pathways emerging from qualitative research and subsequently inform intervention research. Furthermore, it may serve to inform measure development for identified components of menstrual experience, antecedents, and impacts. The definition ‘menstrual hygiene’ outlined in the Introduction fit poorly with the integrated model resulting from this metasynthesis. This definition provides an unclear list of menstrual practices, incorporates one mention of perceptions of the menstrual environment but not practices, and refers to physical facilities for disposal only. Recent expansions on this definition to include menstrual knowledge conflates menstrual experience with antecedents [115]. As presently defined, ‘menstrual hygiene’ may reflect an incomplete set of menstrual rights or needs, or it could be amended to capture menstrual practices as have emerged here. Findings of this review suggest that terminology and construct definition in menstrual health research may need to be expanded to recognise the many components of menstrual experience and contributing factors. Conclusions In sum, extant qualitative studies have identified consistent negative impacts for health and social participation resulting from poor menstrual experience. This large body of qualitative evidence emphasises the need for practitioners and policymakers to attend to menstruation to improve the physical and psychological health, educational attainment, and social participation of women and girls. The integrated model presented advances the development of problem theory in menstrual health research and highlights important factors to consider in future research and practice. Menstrual experience is characterised not only as the hygiene practices undertaken to manage menstrual bleeding but by women’s and girls’ perceptions of these practices, their confidence to manage menses and engage in other activities while menstruating, and their experience of shame and containment. Through synthesis, we elucidate antecedent pathways and highlight the multiple components of menstrual experience that must be considered for effective interventions and comprehensive quantitative evaluation.","Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002803.g002&size=inline,"['themes', 'menstrual', 'experience', 'metasynthesis', 'low', 'health', 'model', 'qualitative', 'menstruation', 'studies', 'systematic', 'research', 'girls', 'womens', 'middleincome', 'experiences', 'review']", ,none

The Olukoya Boys attacker has expressed his joy after ending his goal drought in their home win over the Changi Boys

MFM’s Kabir Adeniji netted his fifth goal of the season in Monday’s Matchday 21 fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League league in the 2-1 win over Katsina United.

Adeniji had a great start for Fidelis Ilechukwu’s men when he scored four goals in the opening 10 games of the league season but he was unlucky not to add to that tally for their next 10 matches.

“It has been a mixed season for me but I didn’t allow this to appear on my face and in my game because it is not easy to fail to score in over 10 games,” Adeniji told Goal.

“I will be indebted to my coaches for not putting me under pressure throughout this period. I was supported and it made me have a relaxed mind knowing that my bad spell will soon end. I was elated to end it in our last game with Katsina United.

“It was a special moment for me and I hope that I get on the scoresheet again this weekend against Sunshine Stars. It will be a shame if we are unable to qualify for the Super Six after so much effort that we have put into it since the beginning of the season. We must put everything into it to ensure that we surprise them in Akure.”

Adeniji’s five goals have helped the Olukoya Boys to be on the cusp of qualification for the play-offs. MFM are currently in fourth place on the NPFL Group A table with 32 points from 21 matches. They need an away win against Sunshine Stars and also hope that Katsina United either beat or draw against Enyimba.","Thu, 23 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['support', 'kabir', 'barren', 'league', 'saved', 'stars', 'win', 'olukoya', 'club', 'mfms', 'spell', 'sunshine', 'katsina', 'season', 'adeniji', '21']", ,drought

The former Nigeria international ended a seven-game drought to help the Yellow Canaries end the season on a high

Victor Moses was on target as Fenerbahce secured a 3-1 victory over Antalyaspor in a Turkish Super Lig game on Sunday.

Having last scored in their 3-2 victory against Rizespor in March, the on-loan Chelsea winger ended the his scoring drought with his strike at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium.

Miha Zajc opened the scoring in the 13th minute after receiving a pass from Mauricio Isla to put the Yellow Canaries on the path of victory.

Then, in the 33rd minute, Mevlut Erdinc leveled procediings for Bulent Korkmaz’s men before Eljif Elmas restored the lead to the home team.

Moments before the end of the game, Moses – who led Fenerbahce’s attack - sealed the victory for his side after he was set up by Jailson.

The former Nigeria international featured for the duration of the game as the Yellow Canaries grabbed their 11th win to end the season in the sixth spot on the table with 46 points from 34 games.

The six stadiums that will be used for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt this summer

2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) hosts Egypt, are no strangers to hosting major sporting events as the country has one of the best stadia infrastructures available on the continent.

The expansion of the competition from 16 nations was always going to prove a hosting challenge and when the Confederation of African Football (Caf) announced its decision to strip Cameroon of the right to host the 2019 Afcon finals after lengthy delays in preparations, Egypt and South Africa were the only realistic options with only seven months to go until the first match kicked off.

Caf was convinced by Egypt's enthusiasm and infrastructure readiness and announced Egypt as hosts in January 2019, after which the Egyptian Football Federation revealed these stadiums as the six venues to host Afcon 2019 matches.

Cairo International Stadium

City: Cairo

Capacity: 75,000

The historic home ground of the Egyptian national team, as well as domestic clubs Zamalek and Al Ahly FC, the Cairo International Stadium was opened in 1960, renovated in 2005 and again this year ahead of the finals. It is the largest stadium in the capital with a seated capacity of 75 000.

It is located in Nasr City in Giza and it has hosted the 1986 and 2006 Afcon finals and was also used during the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

This venue is set to host six Group A matches, a Round of 16 match, a quarter-final, a semi-final and the tournament final.

30 June Stadium

City: Cairo

Capacity: 30,000

This was the only stadium that needed no renovations ahead of the 2019 Afcon. It was built by the Egyptian Air Defense Forces in 2012 and is the main venue of the Air Defense Sport Village.

The stadium is the home of Egyptian Premier League side Pyramid FC and is used for athletics events when it is not hosting football matches.

30 June Stadium will host all Group C group stages matches, a Round of 16 match, a quarter-final and one semi-final in the 2019 Afcon finals.

Al Salam Stadium

City: Cairo

Capacity: 30,000

The Al Salam Stadium has been named as the third stadium in Cairo to host Afcon fixtures. The stadium was originally built in 2009 for the U-20 World Cup and its capacity is 30,000.



It is due to host seven group matches, one Round of 16 match and a quarterfinal in this year's Afcon 2019 finals.

Alexandria Stadium

City: Alexandria

Capacity: 20,000

This 20,000-seater is located in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and is regarded as the oldest football Stadium in Egypt and one of the oldest still in use across the whole of the continent, having been built in 1929.

The stadium is home to Egyptian Premier League sides Al Ittihad, Smouha and Olympic Club and it is known locally as the ‘home of football’.

Five group stage matches and one Round of 16 match are scheduled to take place here.

Suez Stadium

City: Suez

Capacity: 27,000

People of the Canal Region will be delighted with the news that Suez will finally host its first international tournament at its favourite stadium, Suez Stadium, for the first time since it opened in 1990.

This stadium will host five group stages matches, a round of 16 match and a quarter-final clash.

Ismaila Stadium

City: Ismaila

Capacity: 18,525

Arguably Egypt’s most beautiful city, Ismaila, will be amongst the Afcon 2019 host cities. The stadium holds 18,500 and is the home of Ismaily SC in the domestic league and will host three Group D matches and one Group E match.

76,76,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Executive Committee of GIMPA GRASSAG Sworn into Office - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/executive-committee-of-gimpa-grassag-sworn-into-office/,"An eight-member Executive Committee of the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) Chapter of the Graduate Students Association of Ghana (GRASSAG), has been inaugurated in Accra.

The newly established GRASSAG GIMPA Chapter, which is under the Presidency of Raphael Apetorgbor, would spearhead the affairs of the Association for the 2019/2020 academic year.

Other members include Mr Adamu Mohammed Iddrisu, Vice President; Mrs Mariama Dauda, Treasurer; Mr George Keteku, Speaker; Mr Eric Ofosu Asare, Public Relations Officer and Mrs Fuseina Issah, Women’s Commissioner.

The rest are; Mr Christopher Flomo, General Secretary and Alhaji Yussif Baba Suleman, Organiser.

The Committee was inducted into office by Mr Osei Kwame Griffiths, Chairperson of the Judicial Committee of GRASSAG-GIMPA.

Professor Phillip Duku Osei, Deputy Rector of GIMPA, tasked the student leaders to be accountable not only to the student body, but to the authorities they work with, and Ghana as a whole.

He also underscored the need for the executives to nurture the under-graduates as well as ensure that their welfare was completely taken care of; thus better customer service, adding that “this is why we have set up two offices, Office of the Dean of Students and Office of the Dean of Research and Graduate Studies”.

Prof Osei said this was planned with an objective to grow the Graduate School, as such, GRASSAG- GIMPA had two key Offices to support their programmes, especially research programmes.

The Deputy Rector said Ghana was at a point, where it needed lots of graduate products with critical thinking and were able to do problem analysis; “to resolve all the numerous problems we have in our communities and at the national level”, he added.

Mr Apetorgbor also noted that through effective education and proactive policies, GRASAG-GIMPA was determined to build a welcoming mcommunity for all post graduate students and the entire GIMPA fraternity.

He said the efficiency of proactive leadership lied in effective accountability.

Mr Apetorgbor recounted that in as much as they would want to be seen as visionary and proactive in their dealings in managing the affairs of GRASAG -GIMPA, they would not forget to keep an accuracy in their timing and positive attitude in handling their records and activities.

“In fostering the model of School of Graduate Students, GIMPA GRASAG upon its inauguration will focus on ensuring due process, that enable students have ample opportunity to voice their grievances in a manner that is clear and fair to all”, he added.

He said the executives would stand up to the day to day challenge in fixing problems and issues that needed to be timely addressed, to get the desired results, while formulating future plans and event to put their agenda ahead of time.

He expressed the hope that with multitude of student concerns and obligation, he believed the drive of proactive leadership would be able to stay up to task and strive to be effective, productive, and efficient in all proceedings.","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gimpa-grassag.jpg?fit=517%2C480&ssl=1,"['proactive', 'mr', 'executive', 'osei', 'committee', 'gimpa', 'graduate', 'ghana', 'student', 'students', 'sworn', 'grassag', 'office']", ,none
77,77,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,UN Secretary-General to honour two fallen Ghanaian Peacekeepers. - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/un-secretary-general-to-honour-two-fallen-ghanaian-peacekeepers/,"Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour all UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948.

He will also preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 119 military, police and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives in 2018 and early 2019.

Two fallen peacekeepers from Ghana is among the 110 who will posthumously receive the Dag Hammarskjold medal: Frank Sammy Kwofie who served with the UN Police in the United Nations – African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID); and CPL Mercy Adade who served with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)

During a special ceremony, the Secretary-General will award the “Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage” posthumously to Private Chancy Chitete of Malawi.

The medal is named for a Senegalese peacekeeper who was killed in Rwanda in 1994 after saving countless civilian lives. This is the first time the medal has been awarded since the inaugural medal was presented to Captain Diagne’s family in his honour in 2016.

Private Chitete served with the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and was killed last year while saving the life of a fellow peacekeeper from Tanzania who had been badly wounded during an operation against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which was aimed to stop attacks on local towns and to prevent the disruption of the Ebola response.

His comrade survived, and Private Chitete’s heroism and sacrifice helped the peacekeepers achieve their objective of protecting civilians and forcing the ADF to withdraw from the area. It is planned that Private Chitete’s family will receive the medal on his behalf during the Peacekeepers’ Day commemorations in New York.

In a video message to mark Peacekeepers Day, the Secretary-General said: “Today we honour the more than one million men and women who have served as UN peacekeepers since our first mission in 1948. We remember the more than 3,800 personnel who paid the ultimate price. And we express our deepest gratitude to the 100,000 civilian, police and military peacekeepers deployed around the world today and to the countries that contribute these brave and dedicated women and men.”

Ghana is the 9th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping. It currently contributes nearly 2,800 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Mali, the Middle East, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and the Western Sahara.

The global theme for this year’s commemoration is ‘Protecting Civilians, Protecting Peace’. In his message, the Secretary-General’s said: “This year, the United Nations marks 20 years since the Security Council first mandated a peacekeeping mission to protect civilians. Peacekeepers protect men, women and children from violence every day, often at great personal risk.”

Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “UN Peacekeeping deploys to some of the most complex and difficult places, protecting some of the world’s most vulnerable. We are working in partnership with Member States to implement the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative to strengthen peacekeeping, including to improve how we protect civilians, which is at the heart of our work. For hundreds of millions, peacekeeping is the last best hope and it needs all our support.”

The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine.

While the Day will be marked at UNHQ on the 24th, UN missions and offices around the world will commemorate the Day on 29 May.","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ghanaian-peacekeepers-.jpg?fit=770%2C400&ssl=1,"['protecting', 'ghanaian', 'peacekeepers', 'day', 'women', 'peace', 'honour', 'secretarygeneral', 'mission', 'served', 'lives', 'medal', 'peacekeeping', 'fallen']", ,none

81,81,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,EAC Assembly calls for more funds to agriculture sectors - Uganda,http://www.busiweek.com/eac-assembly-calls-for-more-funds-to-agriculture-sectors/,"The East African Legislative Assembly has once again reiterated the need to implement the Malabo Declaration as a means to ensuring food security and transformation of the agricultural sector among the member states.

A report from of the Committee on Agriculture, Tourism and Natural Resources on Budgetary Enhancement in the Agricultural Sector presented to the House by the Committee Chairperson Mathias Kasamba recently, states that despite its potential towards fighting poverty among the regional states, the agriculture sector has been growing slowly over the years and continues to attract limited funding from governments.

Kasamba said the sector’s funding is still below the continental benchmark of 10%. This he said has negatively impacted the sector and is a big obstacle in attracting the youth to participate in the sector.

African Leaders, in 2013, adopted a Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) known as the Maputo Declaration 2003. They agreed that all governments should at least allocate 10% of their national budget to the agriculture sector but very have implemented it yet Agriculture sector is key in contributing to the gross domestic product.

Engineer Habib Mnyaa called on the Assembly to collaborate more closely with the relevant committees in the national Parliaments to allow for the push of enhanced budgets.

Amb Fatuma Ndangiza noted that agricultural sector is crucial in the economies of the partner states and the region.

“Agriculture remains to be critical in all the EAC partner states with 70-72% of the citizens in the region depending on the Agriculture Sector,” the legislator said.

Pierre Celestin Rwigema informed the House of the necessity to secure ready market for farmers’ produce within the region. Furthermore, the legislator reiterated improved infrastructure would allow for smooth movement of the agricultural produce.

Why Agriculture sector needs enough resources

The agriculture Sector is a major contributor to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the East African region, accounting for 31.3% in Kenya, Uganda (25%), Burundi (34.2%), Tanzania (30%), Rwanda (33%) and South Sudan (34.5%).

Recently, various farmers Organization from the East African Community member states presented their views to the regional Assembly where they demanded budget increment for the sector.

Hakim Baliraine, the Chairperson of the Eastern and Southern Africa small holder farmers forum (EASFF Uganda chapter), told East African Business Week that poor funding affects technological transfer between farmers and researchers.

“The agriculture sector is currently facing with the challenges associated with climate change, many farmers have lost their Livestock’s due to drought but if government had allo9ocated enough resources , the sector ministry could use part of the financial resources to construct water dams such that there’s availability of water during the dry seasons,” he said.

He added that limited resources means government cannot recruit enough agricultural extension services providers yet such professionals play a big role in the sector.

Big things are expected of the Brazil coach when he arrives in Europe this summer – but the same was said about the France legend in Monaco

When Bruno Genesio stands down from his job as Lyon head coach after Friday’s match against Nimes, he can reflect on his role with a feeling of satisfaction having accomplished his mission to get OL back into the Champions League.

It was, however, achieved in a scrappy and dissatisfying manner from the point of view of the fans, who will be egging on Chelsea to beat Arsenal in next Wednesday’s Europa League final, as that will offer their club automatic entry into the group stage proper rather than leave them with two rounds of qualifying to negotiate.

Whether Lyon dive straight in with the big boys or are forced to wade through the treacherous waters of the preliminary fixtures, they will have in charge of them a man who knows Europe’s biggest competition intimately.

Sylvinho, winner of two European Cups with Barcelona, will be the figurehead to lead Lyon into their new era, supported by club legend Juninho, who has been installed as the new sporting director.

Amid a backdrop of protest from the fans, unhappy with the performance of the board, coaching staff and players this season, comparisons have been drawn between his appointment and that of Thierry Henry as Monaco head coach last October.

Henry’s relationship with his former club lasted a mere 20 matches and four months, during which time they plumbed new depths as the former Belgium assistant struggled to cope with the demands of man-management in a major role.

There were other handicaps, of course, including poor summer player recruitment and a plague of injuries, but there is little doubt he underachieved.

Given that Sylvinho’s career has mirrored that of the France legend, he will be aiming for a very different fate at Parc OL.

Both the Brazilian and Henry joined Arsenal in 1999 and would go on to reconnect in Barcelona, where both played out their last meaningful days of their top-level careers in Europe.

When they moved into coaching, both started out as assistants and had significant spells at national level, with Sylvinho serving as Tite’s right-hand man with Brazil and Henry a key figure in Roberto Martinez’s Belgium set-up.

While Henry had limited experience at club level, Sylvinho has cut his teeth with four years in various club jobs around Brazil and with Inter in Serie A.

Indeed, ex-Nerazzurri coach Roberto Martinez has been one of his chief sponsors in the media, talking up the potential impact he could have at Lyon.

“He's a good coach and a great person, he really knows football,” the former Manchester City manager told Eurosport. “I'm sure he's ready. He will achieve great things.

“When he was at Inter with me, he did absolutely everything. What struck me most is that he was tactically very prepared. He will opt for an offensive game. Next season, Lyon will play a nice game.”

Sylvinho arrives in France with no past experience of Ligue 1, yet tasked with revolutionising one of the country’s leading clubs.

Despite their third-place finish this season, there is a sense of underachievement, both in terms of their non-existent title challenge and with regards to a silverware drought that now stretches back to the Coupe de France in 2012 – a dire period for a club so accustomed to success over the last 20 years.

What can Lyon expect from their new boss tactically, then?

As he has never taken charge of a team previously, it is difficult to know exactly what his philosophy will be, but given that he has worked closely with Tite, it is likely his thinking mirrors that of the Brazil coach.

A modern, possession-based approach with a lot of attention to pressing and counterattacks is likely, with Tite having held long discussions with the new Lyon boss about Manchester City.

Indeed, Brazil have used some of Pep Guardiola’s ideas, such as moving the full-backs into a central midfield position when facing a low block.

Furthermore, one Brazil insider described his fitness levels as “absurd” and suggested that the Lyon players can look forward to a good deal of physical conditioning.

However, Sylvinho is not just about brawn; when put up in front of the press he has spoken well about tactical questions, no doubt catching the eye of Juninho, who was ultimately responsible for his appointment.

Former Arsenal team-mate Emmanuel Petit says this acumen has long been evident in the South American.

“He was someone with intuitive intelligence who knew how to respond to tactical problems on the field,” he told RMC. “He had a mentality that was incredible, always getting up when it was hardest, always having the right word.

“He’s broken the tradition of the Lyon, and that’s not going to please everyone at the heart of the club, but OK...

“He was a guy who would always question the importance of each drill at training. He had Guardiola and Arsene Wenger as coaches. He’s been brought up in the schools that practise the play that Lyon want.”

If Henry’s failure at Monaco was partly caused by his inability to relate to his players, Sylvinho has a long track record of being a more down-to-earth personality.

As former Barcelona goalkeeper coach Juan Carlos Unzue told L’Equipe: “He was always willing to bring something to the group, regardless of his personal situation, whether he was starting or not.

""This kind of player is ideal to become a coach. He did not lack ambition, but he accepted his role.”

In short, things were never too straightforward for him during his playing career, which drove him to learn to forge strong relationships with those around him and to ask his coaches about the intricacies of their plans.

Despite apparently being well prepared for the tests ahead, he is currently crossing the final bridge required to take up the Lyon reins as he is in Italy finishing off his UEFA coaching qualification, which he is expected to pass next month before taking charge in the Rhone Valley.

Then, the challenge begins for real. For once, this is not a time to be following in Henry’s footsteps.","Fri, 24 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['brazil', 'barca', 'hero', 'lyon', 'france', 'sylvinho', 'disaster', 'club', 'learn', 'coach', 'henry', 'told', 'season', 'players', 'exarsenal']", ,drought
83,83,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,Wine in Greece: rediscovered country - Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/cbbefe38-4a27-11e9-bde6-79eaea5acb64,"George Skouras’s winery, a sleek modern building set among trim rows of vines near the village of Nemea, is a popular stop on tours of the wine-growing regions of the northern Peloponnese. The nearby hillsides are home to the Agiorgitiko grape variety that Skouras, who studied winemaking at Dijon’s Burgundy university, has cultivated for more than 30 years.

To many Greeks, Skouras is the vintner who put Greek wine on the international map. Agiorgitiko, a versatile red wine grape believed to have been grown in the Nemea region for more than 3,000 years, was the variety he chose to make a high-quality wine for export.

“We used a mix of Agiorgitiko and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in an upland valley where the temperatures were cooler. The wine was aged in French oak barrels, which was quite an innovation at the time,” he says.

Launched in 1986, Megas Oenos (ancient Greek for “great wine”) is still one of Skouras’s top sellers. About 45 per cent of his annual production is sold abroad, mostly in the US, Canada and Germany.

George Skouras

Skouras’s portfolio also includes medium-priced wines for export and a cheaper range sold in Greek supermarkets and restaurants catering to tourists. “We have a brand with a screw top that retails for about €6 a bottle. It’s a very drinkable wine,” he says.

Greece’s wine industry has changed dramatically since Skouras started his business in the mid-1980s. Then, there were 70 wineries in the country, many owned by local co-operatives that sold wine in bulk to households and restaurants. By 2008 — the year the recession began — that number had risen to 500, and mid-priced Greek wines could be found in specialist wine stores across Europe. As the economy went into free fall, there was explosive growth in new wineries, many on Aegean islands where winemaking had been all but abandoned. More than 1,400 Greek wineries are now in operation.

“Several big producers collapsed and closed because of the crisis, so there was space for more small growers to join the market,” says Skouras. “They’re shaking up the industry in a positive way, trying out different grape varieties and exporting on a small scale.”

Skouras inspecting the vines

The FT’s wine columnist Jancis Robinson says of Greek wine today: “You only have to look at a wine list in Greece to see what treasures (and unfamiliar names) it has to offer the curious wine drinker.”

Greek wineries produce about 300m litres a year, compared with 650m in Portugal, a similar-sized economy with a long tradition of winemaking. Greece’s wine revenues total some €900m a year, against €1.6bn for Portugal.

“The crisis encouraged different kinds of people to try their hand at winemaking and several years of rapid tourist growth gave them a ready-made market,” says Konstantinos Lazarakis, Greece’s first master of wine.

A typical new grower might be a former banker or businessperson investing their redundancy payment in a vineyard, or a pair of jobless young graduates moving to the countryside to plant vines on family-owned land, Lazarakis explains. Greece has plenty of local agronomists to provide advice to novice growers plus a growing cohort of professional winemakers with experience of working in Italy, France or Australia.

The crisis has also given a push to Greece’s reputation as a maker of high-quality wines. Established producers facing financial pressure ramped up exports, while smaller operations had to sell abroad to survive. “Prices became more competitive and consumers abroad realised just how good Greek wine has become,” says Lazarakis.

In the 1990s Greek winemakers believed it was important to work with international varieties such as Cabernet, Syrah and Chardonnay to prove that a Mediterranean newcomer could compete with established New World producers. But as their confidence grew, winemakers began blending local with international varieties, creating distinctive flavours that appealed to local and foreign consumers.

Semeli winery near Nemea

“There still wasn’t a lot of trust in the quality of the Greek varieties. It was felt blending made them more reliable,” says Leonidas Nasiakos, a winemaker at Semeli, a high-end producer near Nemea.

Over the past decade, however, the proportion of Greek to international varieties has been reversed. “We use 90 per cent indigenous varieties now,” says Nasiakos. One reason is that the quality of wine from indigenous grapes improved as winemakers adopted modern cultivation methods, moving to low yields and acquiring new machinery.

Terroir has become important, too: in Nemea the most sought-after slopes for planting new vines are 700 metres above sea level, yielding wines with higher acidity and greater potential for ageing, says Nasiakos.

Another reason is that many more varieties have entered commercial production as Greek producers explore the country’s exceptionally rich heritage of indigenous wine grapes, following a worldwide trend among growers to recover long-forgotten “exotic” varieties that can produce distinctive new wines.

Kostas Bakasietas, the owner of Greece’s largest vine nursery, near Nemea, has identified 180 indigenous varieties that had fallen out of use and “rediscovered” another 60 whose names have been forgotten. “It’s endless: the more you explore, the more you find. I think we’re still at the very beginning of this process,” he says.

Armed with a degree in viticulture from the University of Montpellier in France, Bakasietas started travelling around Greece 14 years ago, scouring neglected vineyards for rare and unknown grape varieties. “An elderly farmer would point out a rogue vine in a corner of his vineyard, or you might spot an unusual-looking vine leaf in a monastery garden,” he says.

It’s endless: the more you explore, the more you find. I think we’re still at the beginning of this process

Bakasietas’ research includes trawling through old winery records, books and manuscripts. He notes that the earliest written description he knows of Agiorgitiko came from a sixth-century Byzantine text. Asked to name some of the 40 forgotten varieties he has experimented with that have commercial potential, Bakasietas mentions two white varieties, Zakynthino and Makripodia from the Ionian Islands, and Mavrostifo, a red wine grape from the northern Peloponnese.

However, Greece’s four flagship varieties — Agiorgitiko; Xinomavro, another versatile red wine grape grown mainly in northern Greece; and two aromatic white grapes, Assyrtiko from the volcanic island of Santorini and Moschofilero from the Peloponnese — are unlikely to be displaced quickly.

Assyrtiko is now grown in several regions of mainland Greece and has become the first Greek variety to acquire an international reputation: growers in Turkey, South Africa and Australia have planted the drought-resistant vine.

Other varieties have become more widely known. Roxane Matsa, the owner of a small organic vineyard north-east of Athens, was among the first growers to experiment with Malagousia, a dry white wine grape variety that was on the brink of extinction when it was rediscovered by a professor of oenology in the 1970s.

Semeli winemaker Leonidas Nasiakos

Matsa contributed to its revival over the following decade by distributing thousands of cuttings to other growers. “I was convinced it was a variety for the future, one that could be successful on an international scale,” she says. The vine is now widely cultivated in Greece and ranks close behind Assyrtiko as the country’s most sought-after white grape variety.

Then there is retsina — a white wine laced with resin from the Aleppo pine as a preservative — which gave Greek winemaking an unenviable reputation for decades. Dismissed by many as “paint-thinner”, traditional retsina is now hard to find in Greek supermarkets. But new retsinas — made from Assyrtiko and the widely grown white wine grape Roditis, rather than the traditional Savatiano grape, and containing only a hint of resin — are popular with many who decried the original version.

Meanwhile, the separate qualities of Savatiano, native to the Attica region around Athens, have been rediscovered. “Savatiano is a wonderful grape, with an excellent aroma. It’s making a welcome comeback,” says Matsa.","Sun, 19 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F8edc8a78-6fc8-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,"['grape', 'white', 'wine', 'rediscovered', 'varieties', 'country', 'variety', 'growers', 'international', 'greek', 'winemaking', 'greece']", ,drought

Match Preview

Chelsea should come into this match on a high, with the Blues having secured Champions League football for next season and set up a Europa League final with London rivals Arsenal in two weeks' time, but this has still been a bit of a rough season for the club.

Sarri's public meltdown at goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga ignoring his orders in the Carabao Cup final, an impending transfer ban, and now the projected departure of star man Eden Hazard have really dampened the club's season.

The timing of the friendly has also drawn the ire of Sarri, although the match was organised back in March before Chelsea knew their Europa League fate and a final appearance was only a possibility.

""As a coach, I am a little bit worried because I know very well that the team now needs rest,"" said Sarri. ""So it is not the best way to prepare the final. I have to look to my players, not Arsenal’s, so I know very well that my players need to rest.

""I want to speak to the physical staff, to the doctor and then we will need to prepare the programme.

""They will need three or four days of complete rest. I am not worried about the physical side so much. It is more difficult to recover mentally because, in a match like a final you spend, usually, a lot of energy and then of course your levels go down. It is not always easy for them to go up again.”

By contrast though, Chelsea have had a much better season than New England, who sit bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference. The club are undergoing major changes in coaching staff after Brad Friedel was sacked as head coach, Mike Burns sacked as general manager, Mike Lapper appointed as interim head coach, and then Bruce Arena appointed as head coach and sporting director. Arena will not start the former role immediately.

This match should see Chelsea's forwards strike fear into the American side's weak defence, with the likes of Oliver Giroud, Gonzalo Higuain and Willian all trying to show they should be in the Europa League final starting line-up.

Five Blues youngsters will also be on display, and will be hoping that they can demonstrate to Sarri that they deserve playing time next season.

Don't expect Chelsea's key players to go the whole 90 minutes, though, as the Blues boss will want to keep injury risks to a minimum.

On the other side of the pitch, New England's players will be trying to demonstrate to their new head coach that they are worthy of a position at the club.","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['live', 'league', 'players', 'match', 'tv', 'squad', 'channel', 'final', 'vs', 'preview', 'chelsea', 'revolution', 'england', 'stream', 'sarri']", ,none
85,85,Drought_Ghana_2019_May,"Zimbabwe: Anthrax suspected in the deaths of elephants, buffaloes and other wildlife - Outbreak News Today - Outbreak News Today",http://outbreaknewstoday.com/zimbabwe-anthrax-suspected-deaths-elephants-buffaloes-wildlife-88851/,"Zimbabwe: Anthrax suspected in the deaths of elephants, buffaloes and other wildlife

By NewsDesk @bactiman63

Anthrax is suspected in the deaths of several wildlife animals in Zambezi Valley, according to a Sunday News report. Several animals have died including at least eight elephants, several buffaloes, impala, hyenas.

This follows an outbreak last year that killed more than a dozen hippos in the Binga District of Zimbabwe.

Anthrax is endemic along the whole Zambezi Valley and because of this drought, the spores are now being exposed to the surface. For example, we had some heavy downpours which lasted two days after a prolonged drought which washed away the topsoil and exposed the lower part of the soils where the spores are. The wildlife will be drinking from those pools of water that will be infected with anthrax. We could have lost several wild animals,” said Hwange District Veterinary Officer Dr Lovemore Dube.

Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected.

It infects humans primarily through occupational or incidental exposure with infected animals of their skins.

Anthrax is caused by the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. This spore forming bacteria can survive in the environment for years because of its ability to resist heat, cold, drying, etc. this is usually the infectious stage of anthrax.

When conditions become favorable, the spores germinate into colonies of bacteria. An example would be a grazing cow ingests spores that in the cow, germinate, grow spread and eventually kill the animal.

The bacteria will form spores in the carcass and then return to the soil to infect other animals. The vegetative form is rarely implicated in transmission.

There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of anthrax. People get anthrax by handling contaminated animal or animal products, consuming undercooked meat of infected animals and more recently, intentional release of spores.

There are three types of human anthrax with differing degrees of seriousness: cutaneous, gastrointestinal and inhalation.","Mon, 20 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://outbreaknewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/800px-African_elephant_male.jpg,"['infected', 'buffaloes', 'zambezi', 'deaths', 'elephants', 'germinate', 'valley', 'zimbabwe', 'wildlife', 'animals', 'bacteria', 'suspected', 'anthrax', 'spores']", ,drought

The project has 18 partners (8 African and 10 European) that come together once in six months to discuss progress and strategies for the continuation of the project. A two-day progress meeting began today, May 20 in Greece which will enable various project partners update the entire team on the progress being made in the various sub-section of AfriCultuReS. The last progress meeting was held in South Africa last year – read about it here. African partners on the project represents Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sahel Region and Niger.

SUMMARY OF AfriCultuReS

Integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system

AfriCultuReS aims to design, implement and demonstrate an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system that will support decision making in the field of food security. AfriCultuReS delivers a broad range of climatic, production, biophysical and economic information, for various regions in Africa. AfriCultuReS applies geospatial science to sustainable agricultural development, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, and poverty alleviation in Africa.

Key players

AfriCultuReS, supported by the GEO Secretariat, involves all key players of AfriGEOSS, GEOGLAM, SIGMA, ARTEMIS, African Drought Observatory and other initiatives as well as partners representing the diversity of African agricultural systems, in an effort to push forward the services provided by current systems, with innovative fusion of data from multiple sources (EO, in-situ, citizen-based crowdsourcing, climate services and weather, crop models) in a vertical manner. Crop yield and biomass prediction models is enhanced through the fusion of EO data and climate models, emphasizing the use of the complementary sensors of the EU Sentinels constellation.

Geospatial products are combined in a spatial Decision Support System (DSS) to enrich decision making and risk assessment. The geo component of the DSS is compliant with the GEO’s interoperability standards, allowing its integration with the current services of the GEOSS Common Infrastructure.

African networks

The African partners and collaborating networks are essential for local training and promoting further use of the project tools. Social innovation is used to increase the number of involved stakeholders and to boost the flow of information in a user-friendly manner. The final target is to produce a web tool that supports early decision-making for the stakeholders of African food production.

But in Malawi, certain communities were spared because of flood mitigation projects sponsored by the World Food Program.

Residents of Mwambananji village, in the Zomba district of southeast Malawi, were among millions of people hard hit by the El Nino weather phenomenon in 2015, which caused drought and floods.

The floods damaged houses and washed away thousands of crop fields, leaving 6.7 million people in dire need of food assistance. This is nearly half of Malawi's population.

Kenneth Scott was one of the affected villagers. He said “they were heavily affected by the floods which completely left their houses in water because of the water coming from the nearby rivers.”

But this year, Scott was not affected by the floods caused by Cyclone Idai, which killed 60 people and displaced nearly 90,000 others in the country’s 15 districts, including Zomba.

Besides flood mitigation efforts, the WFP continues to provide non-food items like tents to flood survivors in the affected area in Malawi.

This is largely because of a World Food Program-funded project designed to mitigate the impact on communities living in flood-prone areas.

The program, started four years ago, is helping more than 10,000 households in Blantyre, Balaka and Zomba districts.

Kiganzi Nyakato heads the WFP sub-office in southern Malawi.

“So, what we do is that we work with the communities to see how we can stabilize their food production. So its farming techniques or the type of seeds they are using, and also we work with them to have vegetable gardens,” said Nyakato.

The program also requires beneficiaries to work in groups to dig deep trenches and construct concrete blockades across rivers, trapping water runoffs during flooding.

Scott said the construction projects paid off when Cyclone Idai struck in March.

He said there were heavy rains this year, which would, ""have put our lives at risk. Maybe you would not have found us here. But the deep trenches which we dug helped trap all the water that would have damaged and washed away crops. Because of this, only a small amount of water reached the homes.”

?Scott, however, said the challenge is that poverty is forcing some people to vandalize the blockades and cut down trees that were planted to contain soil erosion.

He said, “We wish that residents who live in surrounding areas could be financially empowered through loans in order to start some businesses that would help put a stop to the vandalism.”

In the meantime, the WFP continues to provide food and non-food items to flood survivors in the affected areas.

Liverpool need to be wary of the Spaniard who has been a high-impact substitute for Spurs in the road to the final...

If Tottenham Hotspur are to end their eleven-season trophy-drought, Fernando Llorente might just be the person Spurs could look for inspiration against Liverpool in their 2018-19 UEFA Champions League final.

The 34-year-old, in his role of a backup striker, has not garnered much game time in the two seasons he has been with the Londoners. But after filling in for the injured Harry Kane numerous times this season, the former Juventus marksman has proved his worth.



In 11 starts and 23 further appearances from the bench across all competitions, Llorente has scored only eight goals this season. But, it is in the Champions League that Llorente has had more of an impact for Spurs.





His solitary assist in Europe this season came three minutes after coming onto the pitch in the group stages. He set up Harry Kane as Spurs completed a come from behind win against PSV at Wembley.

It was in the Round of 16 that Llorente got his first goal, making yet another immediate impact off the bench. He replaced Christian Eriksen in the 86th minute and a couple of minutes later, netted in to make it 3-0 against Borussia Dortmund in the first leg away from home.

Arguably one of the greatest games this season was the second leg quarter-final between Manchester City and Spurs at the Etihad Stadium. The Blues were leading 4-3 on aggregate after losing the away leg 1-0. Llorente came on in the first half itself for an injured Moussa Sissoko and in the 73rd minute, guided the ball home from a corner to make it 4-3 on the night.





Despite Kane’s unavailability in that game, Mauricio Pochettino started with Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min up top but it was left for the wily old fox in Llorente to clean up the game for Spurs.

Even in the semi-final second leg over at Amsterdam, Ajax were leading the tie 3-0. Pochettino realized his mistake and brought on Llorente for the final half and he held up the opposition end, drawing defenders towards him and allowed other the freedom to create. Lucas Moura benefited from this as the Brazilian scored a hat-trick to lead Spurs to the final.

Whether Kane is deemed fit for the final or not, the experienced Llorente is not a bad option to have on the bench or even start as he can be trusted to change the game in Madrid in the all-English battle for the crown.

After seven years at Stamford Bridge, the 28-year-old has to decide what he wants next, says former Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips

Shaun Wright-Phillips has urged Eden Hazard to make the right decision over his future, whether it be staying at Chelsea or moving to Real Madrid.

Former Chelsea midfielder Wright-Phillips has explained that Hazard can either make the switch to the Spanish outfit with the greater potential to win trophies, or remain at Stamford Bridge as the club’s main player.

Hazard has already stated that he has made a decision on his future, but Wright-Phillips does not believe it will have been an easy choice for the Belgium international.

“It’s a hard one because Chelsea is an amazing club, the fan-base is amazing and the owners are amazing as well – everything about the club is amazing but it’s a hard one for Hazard,” said Wright-Phillips, speaking exclusively to AmericanGambler.com.

“You have to ask yourself how far do you want to go in your career, what do you want to achieve and that will make his decision.”

Wright-Phillips spent three years at the west London club, but says it will come down to the matter of winning trophies that may persuade Hazard to move on.

He added: “Hopefully Chelsea can go out and win the Champions League again, win titles again, but if they can’t then what does Hazard want?

“Does he want to win these things or does he want to be Chelsea’s main player – that’s a question that only he can answer.”

If Hazard does choose to make the move, it could spell problems for Chelsea given their current impending transfer ban, but Wright-Phillips doesn’t think this will be an issue for next season.

“I don’t think the transfer ban will hinder Chelsea because they have enough players in their squad now, and they have enough players on loan, which are clearly of a Premier League standard so they can call them back,"" he continued.

“So I don’t think the ban will hinder them that much – we’re forgetting that they have something like 40 players out on loan.

“Of course not all of them are worthy of a place in the Chelsea side, but there’s a lot of people with the potential and this could be the start of somebody’s career by bringing them back and giving them a run in the team, and maybe even the next England superstar, or French or Belgian superstar on our hands.""","Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['target', 'urged', 'transfer', 'hard', 'amazing', 'win', 'eden', 'star', 'future', 'hazard', 'madrid', 'chelsea', 'real', 'does', 'wrightphillips', 'players', 'think']", ,none

Pule, who won the PSL title, MTN8 Cup and Telkom Knockout Cup with Wits, is keen to help the Buccaneers end their five-year trophy drought

Winger Vincent Pule feels that it is time for Orlando Pirates to deliver the goods for their own supporters.

The Buccaneers have now gone five seasons without a major trophy having finished as runners-up both in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and Telkom Knockout Cup this past season.

Pule, who scooped the Goal of the Season accolade at the PSL awards ceremony on Sunday, reflected on the Soweto giants' campaign.

“We have to give the supporters something next season. We worked hard this season but unfortunately, we didn’t get anything,"" Pule was quoted as saying by IOL.

""We have to work harder next season. We have to collect more points at home next season in the league. We have to work hard together to get more than 57 points,"" he continued.

Pule joined Pirates from Bidvest Wits prior to the start of the 2018/19 season and he revealed what made him feel at home at the Soweto giants.

“Pirates are a big club. You need to have a big heart to succeed at Pirates. I remember the first day when I got there, I found coach Micho (Sredojevic) and Rulani (Mokwena),"" he added.

""They were sitting together and talking a lot about our previous games at our previous clubs and emphasizing our strong and weak points,"" Pule explained

""I immediately felt at home. They made us feel at home. It was an unbelievable feeling when we got there,"" he added.

Furthermore, Pule said as a team, they have recovered from the disappointment of missing on the PSL title.

“We’ve recovered from that disappointment. It was a learning curve for us and we’ve grown. When we lost against Baroka FC, we sat down and said, 'look what happened has happened and it is gone, we have to move on,"" he added.

""We pushed hard to win the league after losing to Baroka. We played well but unfortunately I think we lost the league when we drew against Cape Town City,” he concluded.","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['league', 'vincent', 'pirates', 'points', 'hard', 'win', 'pule', 'trophies', 'psl', 'cup', 'wits', 'orlando', 'season', 'work']", ,drought

The ex-England international is giving no thought to his future at present, with a play-off final date and promotion shot with Derby his sole focus

Ashley Cole is not ready to call time on his playing career just yet, with the former Arsenal and Chelsea defender taking aim at the Premier League again with Derby.

At 38 years of age, the legendary left-back is approaching the end of his playing days.

When the day comes to hang up his boots, he will do so as one of the most decorated performers of the modern era.

Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League successes were savoured while with Arsenal and Chelsea, before going on to spend time with Roma and MLS side LA Galaxy.

Cole returned to England in January to link up with Derby on a short-term deal and has helped Frank Lampard’s side to reach the Championship play-off final.

With the Rams now one game away from returning to the top tier, a veteran defender is not ready to make a definitive decision on his future.

Cole told RamsTV ahead of an outing against Aston Villa at Wembley – a venue he knows well from having collected 107 caps for his country: “To be honest I have not really thought about it [retirement] because at the minute it is not about me.

“It is about trying to get Derby County into the Premier League. I have to look at the bigger picture.

“I am lucky enough to play, hopefully, if I make the team. It is unfortunate for Scotty [Malone] to miss out [through suspension], which I am disappointed in. It would have been nice for him to play as well.

“I am happy that I am playing but in terms of me, I don't know. I am trying not to think about that yet. I just want to try and do my best on the day and get Derby promoted.

“Then I will sit down and think about what I am going to do.

“I don't want to try and put the focus on me and kind of confuse myself. I know how my body feels, I know what I can bring or what I can't bring any more.”

Cole’s last Premier League appearance came back in May 2014, with a 2-1 victory over Cardiff bringing an end to an eight-year spell at Chelsea.

The success he enjoyed at Stamford Bridge was enjoyed alongside Lampard, with his current manager handing him 11 outings across all competitions since his arrival at Pride Park in January.","Fri, 24 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['league', 'arsenal', 'delays', 'star', 'playing', 'trying', 'premier', 'try', 'chelsea', 'cole', 'ashley', 'retirement', 'thought', 'know', 'derby']", ,none

The experienced defender is confident that the Buccaneers will end their five-year trophy drought in the new 2019/20 campaign

Orlando Pirates captain Happy Jele has stressed the importance of winning the 2019 edition of the Carling Black Label Cup which was launched on Tuesday.

The popular pre-season match which features two of the biggest football clubs in the county, Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, could not be played in 2018 due to the Fifa World Cup.

It is now scheduled to return at the iconic FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on the 27th of July 2019.



Jele reflected on the 2018/19 campaign which saw Pirates finish second in the Premier Soccer League and also lose to Baroka FC in the Telkom Knockout Cup final.



""We had a great season and we showed that we wanted to win (some silverware), but the sad part is that we have nothing to show for it,"" Jele told the media.

The 32-year-old player stated that Bucs will pick up from where they left off in pursuit of silverware in the new campaign.



""We are looking forward to next season. We want to keep the momentum going and try to win some silverware for the team,"" he added.



Pirates have lost to Chiefs in the last two editions of the Carling Black Label Cup, but Jele is confident that they will defeat their arch-rivals and set the tone for the new season.



""It is a pre-season game. Winning the trophy will boost our morale going into the new season and it will also show that we mean business,"" he concluded.



Pirates are the most successful team in the history of the Carling Black Label Cup having lifted the trophy on four separate occasions.

Match Preview

Roma know that if they want to return to the Champions League next season, anything less than a perfect nine points from their remaining three matches leaves them vulnerable.

They sit sixth in the Serie A standings and to break into the top four they will have to overhaul Atalanta, who are three points beyond them, and AC Milan, who edge them on head-to-head record.

With 62 goals scored, they have been one of the most exciting teams to watch this season, yet their tally of 47 against is the highest by far in the top eight.

For head coach Claudio Ranieri, signing off with Champions League qualification would be a dream end to his one-year tenure in the Eternal City, which he confirmed would end at the conclusion of the season.

“My job ends with the last three games,” he explained on Friday. “I always knew that would be the case. I chose to come here for this season finale because I’m a Roma fan and I wanted to put my enthusiasm at the service of the team.”

A 1-1 draw with Genoa last weekend has jeopardised those hopes, but Ranieri wants his team to channel that emotion.

“It’s important to show our fans the desire for revenge,” he said. “We have three games left and we mustn’t leave anything to chance. We mustn’t have any regrets.”

If Roma are driven forward by frustration in this game, it is pride that must push Juventus on to greater things.

The title has already been theirs for the best part of a month and since then they have been held to 1-1 draws against Inter and Torino.

Having been dumped out of the Champions League by Ajax at the quarter-final stage, they have now won only one of their last six fixtures – an unusual barren run for the Old Lady.

Speculation continues to surround the future of head coach Massimiliano Allegri, with reports linking Antonio Conte with a return to Turin among other coaches.

If this is to be his swansong at Juve, where he has spent the last five years and has helped the team continue to dominate Italian football, he will want to make sure he goes out on a high – and that means overcoming a tough opponent like Roma before next week’s hosting of in-form Atalanta.","Sun, 12 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['juventus', 'live', 'league', 'roma', 'tv', 'squad', 'channel', 'vs', 'preview', 'espn', 'kluivert', 'champions', 'season', 'stream']", ,none

The former Red Devils striker doesn't think the club can solve its crisis in the transfer market alone and is cautious about links to Gareth Bale

Michael Owen doesn’t think that Manchester United can overhaul their squad in just one transfer window, but backed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to promote young players to boost his side’s fortunes.

Many have been calling for a clear-out at Old Trafford this summer but the ex-United, Liverpool and Real Madrid forward doesn’t believe it’s possible for United to extract value for players if they try to offload too many.

He did say he sees some hopes of recovery for United under Solskjaer, but admitted he also saw a regression.

“It’s quite hard to get rid of more than three or four players in one window, particularly if you want something in return,” Owen told Press Association Sport.

“I thought I had a better handle on United in that I believed they were a better team than they had shown under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and [Jose] Mourinho.

“And we saw that for a dozen games or so when Solskjaer came in but there was a relapse.”

Owen believes United’s failure to qualify for the Champions League will hurt any recruitment drive, suggesting instead they look within the club structure.

“The squad obviously needs some surgery and it won’t be easy without Champions League football next season – great players want that,” the 39-year-old continued.

“So I don’t think it’s realistic that they’re going to be able to make 10 changes in one summer.

“One thing I’m sure we’ll see under Solskjaer next season is a big push on youth.

“I expect we’ll see four or five of their talented youngsters step up from the academy and I think one or two of those could go on to be proper Manchester United players in the future.”

Owen was not so certain of the financial wisdom of signing Gareth Bale, a player he is well-placed to understand.

Bale has cut an increasingly isolated figure at Real Madrid this year, a club where Owen spent one difficult season, and he sympathises with the Welsh winger.

“I wouldn’t want to be somewhere I wasn’t wanted and if Gareth feels he isn’t getting the love he deserves than maybe it is time he came back.

“I’m sure there are lots of clubs that would love to have him but he’s at the point in his career when he’s not an investment anymore.
