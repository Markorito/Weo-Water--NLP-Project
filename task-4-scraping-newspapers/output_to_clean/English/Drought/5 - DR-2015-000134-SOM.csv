0,0,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Horn of Africa facing worst drought in 60 years - The Catholic Register,https://www.catholicregister.org/features/item/20900-horn-of-africa-facing-worst-drought-in-60-years,"JIJIGA, ETHIOPIA - At the end of June the Famine Early Warning Systems Network of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization issued a warning about dry conditions in Ethiopia, Somalia and the rest of the Horn of Africa. On July 5 the UN called it “the worst drought in 60 years” in the Horn of Africa, with Ethiopia and Somalia worst hit.

Travelling through the affected Somali province of Ethiopia in August, everywhere I went people spoke of the failure of this year’s rains.

“This year we have a big fear because of a shortage of rain,” said Fr. Teklebirhan Yemataye in Jijiga. “We don’t know what will happen.”

“We call this a drought in which one camel carries another camel,” said Jijiga Catholic development office manager Muluken Asnake.

The phrase means that as herders are forced to sell their livestock rather than watch them starve, prices are depressed. Thus, when a man with two camels sells one, the supplies he can buy from the sale can be easily carried by the remaining camel.

As Muluken and I travelled through Togo Wuchale Kebele an hour east of Jijiga, farmers stopped us to show us their dry wells. There are 53 wells in the area originally drilled 70 years ago by Italian missionaries. Some of them are as deep as 55 metres. For the first time ever, they’re all dry.

This is the frontline in the war on climate change. When Pope Francis writes in Laudato Si, “This is why the Earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she ‘groans in travail,’ ” he’s talking about the landscape of southern Ethiopia. When the Pope reminds readers of “the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet” he is telling us that drought in a far off country isn’t a marginal or scientific issue. It’s a human issue that touches the whole human family.

The men we met in togo Wuchale Kabele told Muluken about members of their families who had fallen into the wells trying to draw water from a great depth, back when there still was water. They spoke of children and livestock falling into the wells. They asked whether the East Hararghe Catholic Social Development Organization could cap the wells and provide either pumps or a motorized system for drawing the water in buckets. Drawing water by rope from 50 metres down has left their hands cut and swollen.

They call it “milking water.”

They also ask about the possibility of drilling a new, deeper well.

Abdulai Hassoun, a community elder in Meknis sub-kebele, spoke about the coming disaster.

“Now our first priority is to drill a bore hole,” he said. “As you see the crops are drying. It’s 20 kilometres to drinking water.”

His family has been selling its animals for money, but the money won’t last long.

By the time I arrived back in Toronto the Famine Early Warning Systems Network was reporting widespread livestock deaths throughout the region.

Abdulai Hassoun lived through the famines of 1973 and 1984-85. He has never seen the country this dry. In early August he was very worried.

Along the way we met a woman drawing water from a 40-year-old cistern used to collect rain water. As she was loading plastic jerry cans onto her donkey’s back she told us the water used to be good for drinking. A glance at the brownish-green liquid established that was no longer the case.

“We have three priorities,” Mukulen told me. “The first one is water. The second one is water. And the third one is water.”

Near the village of Muhammed Ali, the development organization of the Hararghe Catholic Secretariat has built a sort of artificial lake lined with plastic sheeting to collect and preserve rain water. They’ve planted drought-resistant bushes all around it to slow soil erosion from the constant wind. They call it the GTPALE Project and they’ve built it with money from the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace and Secours Catholique Caritas France using a Sudanese design. It’s almost complete, except for the water.

A big puddle of brown water at the bottom of it attracts an unlikely few waterfowl to the middle of the desert. But the water level is 20 or 30 centimetres below the pipe that leads out of the artificial lake, where the water would be fed into tanks to be used for irrigation.

At my hotel back in Jijiga I buy a bottle of mineral water. The blurb on the side of the bottle says: “The rain that falls over the Awash Basin of Ethiopia, after sifting through layers of sand and rocks for thousands of years, becomes a crystal clear, refreshing mineral water. On the receiving end of this precious commodity is the modern mineral water treatment and bottling plant of Vita Springs. As a result, our customers, starting with you, can enjoy the taste and health benefits of a perfectly balanced, clean mineral water.”

Even in a drought, some of us drink.","Sun, 20 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.catholicregister.org/media/k2/items/cache/9cce575fa280ef6ec16e6d4190b60cba_L.jpg,"['water', 'africa', 'facing', 'mineral', 'development', '60', 'drought', 'worst', 'jijiga', 'organization', 'catholic', 'wells', 'horn', 'ethiopia', 'rain']",

The programme, which will be implemented in collaboration with the Somali Red Crescent Society and the Kenya Red Cross Society, will target communities affected by one of Africa’s most protracted and yet often overlooked humanitarian crises.

Successive cycles of extreme drought and floods in Somalia, combined with the consequences of decades of violence and insecurity, have left many communities without access to durable livelihoods and exposed to chronic food insecurity. As a result, millions of people have fled their homes to other parts of Somalia or into neighbouring Kenya.

Elhadj As Sy, the Secretary General of the IFRC, said the prolonged nature of the humanitarian crisis in Somalia and northern Kenya had created a sense of apathy among many donors. “The crisis currently facing millions of people in the region is avoidable and therefore unacceptable,” he said. “This agreement will help us alleviate the impacts of this crisis on a group of particularly vulnerable people. It will make them stronger and more resilient to future shocks.

A demonstration of solidarity and shared humanity

The Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran is contributing 2.3 million Swiss francs ($2.4 million US dollars) toward this effort. The President of the Red Crescent, Professor Seyed Amir Mohsen Ziaee, reiterated his National Society’s commitment to supporting vulnerable people around the world in close cooperation with the IFRC.

“This is another important opportunity where the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IFRC can further complement one another and leverage on our vast network of Red Cross and Red Crescent members to develop long-term solutions to food insecurity in Africa,” said Dr Ziaee.

Dr Ziaee emphasized that, through increased cooperation and collaboration, sustainable and long-term solutions can be delivered by strengthening the capacities and resilience of individuals and communities in Africa.

“We look forward to carrying out this partnership with the IFRC and through close cooperation with the Somali Red Crescent Society and the Kenya Red Cross Society. We hope that through this Hunger Resilience and Food Security Programme, we will provide more effective support to those in greatest need, starting with the vulnerable people from Somalia,” said Dr Ziaee.

The Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran has plans to expand this programme, first into other countries in East Africa and then to other regions on the continent affected by food insecurity. An estimated 60 million people across sub-Saharan Africa do not have enough to eat this year, and there are predictions that food production will deteriorate further in the coming months.

“We invite fellow humanitarian partners to collaborate with us in expanding the Hunger Resilience and Food Security Programme in Africa,” said Dr Ziaee.

IFRC Secretary General, As Sy, welcomed the leadership and commitment of the Red Crescent.

“The presence and support of the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran in many countries far away in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and now Somalia, responding to acute humanitarian needs, is an example of a shared humanity that goes beyond borders,” he said.","Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ifrc.org/favicon.ico,"['kenya', 'security', 'society', 'food', 'crescent', 'ifrc', 'islamic', 'iran', 'resilience', 'red', 'sign', 'republic', 'africa', 'vulnerable', 'improve', 'iranian', 'strengthen', 'somalia']",

By Alex Kirby

One of Africa’s most volatile regions has become increasingly dry over the last century and faces a future of rising tension if this trend continues, US researchers say.

They say the rate of drying in the Horn of Africa is both unusual in the context of the last 2,000 years and in step with human-influenced warming. And they think the drying will continue as the region warms.

“Right now, aid groups are expecting a wetter, greener future for the Horn of Africa, but our findings show that the exact opposite is occurring,” says one of the study’s co-authors, Peter deMenocal, who heads the Centre for Climate and Life at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

“The region is drying, and will continue to do so with rising carbon emissions.” The study, published in the journal Science Advances, was based on evidence stretching back for 40,000 years.

Sediment core

The researchers used a sediment core they had extracted from the Gulf of Aden to infer past changes in temperature and aridity. After matching the core’s record with 20th-century observations, they concluded that drying is likely to continue across Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia.

That contradicts other models, which have suggested that future warming might bring rainier weather patterns that could benefit East Africa.

“What we see in the paleoclimate record from the last 2,000 years is evidence that the Horn of Africa is drier when there are warm conditions on Earth, and wetter when it is colder,” says lead author Jessica Tierney, associate professor of geosciences at the University of Arizona.

Global-scale models used to predict future changes as the climate warms suggest that the region should become wetter, primarily during the “short rains” season from September to November.

However, the new study suggests that those gains may be offset by declining rainfall during the “long rains” season from March to May, on which the region’s rain-fed agriculture relies.

“If we can simulate rainfall in these arid tropical and subtropical regions better, we can understand the future impact of climate change”

The authors say the region has been racked with political instability and violence as it has dried. The Horn of Africa has suffered droughts every few years in recent decades − creating humanitarian crises as famine and violence spread.

In Somalia, as the political situation deteriorated amid the droughts of the 1980s and 1990s, hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the country, and pirates began raiding ships off the coast.

The 40,000-year old sediment core has already yielded insights into Africa’s climate. In 2013, Tierney and deMenocal showed that the Sahara, which once used to burst into verdant life with regular rainfall, suddenly dried out over a century or two, during a warm period about 5,000 years ago – not more gradually, as many researchers had thought.

Their work provided evidence that climate shifts can happen quite suddenly, even if the forces driving them are gradual.

This latest study uses isotopes from leaf waxes found in the sediment sample to compare rates of drying over the past 2,000 years.

Plants reflect the environment that sustains them. When the climate is drier, leaf waxes are more enriched with deuterium, or heavy hydrogen isotopes, while leaf waxes from wetter climates reflect the more abundant rainfall through the presence of the normal hydrogen isotopes.

The researchers found an increasing shift toward heavy hydrogen in the last century as the climate − which had experienced a wet period during the Little Ice Age (1450-1850 AD) − dried out.

Climate modelling

Their findings suggest that climate modelling, frequently done at a global scale, would benefit from region-specific studies with higher-resolution results in high-impact areas such as the Horn of Africa

Tierney says: “If we can simulate rainfall in these arid tropical and subtropical regions better, we can understand the future impact of climate change.”

The development agency Oxfam says Ethiopia is facing a major emergency, with 4.5 million people needing food aid because of successive poor rains this year.

Oxfam’s representative in Ethiopia describes the situation − attributed to the El Niño periodic climate phenomenon in the Pacific − as “the start of a major emergency, which is expected to be serious and long”.

Meanwhile, parts of West Africa are suffering from the aftermath of severe floods − also attributed to El Niño − that have ruined crops and destroyed homes in Burkina Faso and Niger.

The eight original refugee camps have morphed into towns that, together, are now one of the most densely populated areas in the world, home to 1.7 million people. Separate from the U.N.H.C.R. and with a different mandate, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East was founded in 1949 for around 750,000 Arab Palestinians forced to flee their homes in 1948. But with no peace deal or return in sight, the agency looks after their five million descendants at a cost to the international community of over $1 billion a year. The agency was supposed to be an exception, but Gaza now looks like the rule. In Dadaab, the United Nations resettles around 2,000 refugees annually to Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States. But the birthrate in the camp of 1,000 a month will always outstrip that effort.

As refugee populations spiral higher, host nations usually move toward ever stricter encampment policies. Kenya is one of the strictest; last year the police rounded up thousands of refugees found outside designated camps and incarcerated them in the national stadium. Pakistan has threatened several times not to renew refugee status for Afghan refugees, and periodically attempts to force people back to Afghanistan. In Jordan, refugees have the right to move and work in theory, but authorities have reportedly issued no new work permits since 2014 and have begun coercive administrative measures to keep them in the camps.

To leave Dadaab, residents require a “movement pass,” just like under apartheid. Acquiring one usually involves a bribe. Thus, members of the third generation that is now beginning life in Dadaab may well spend their whole life in the camp. If they win one of the fiercely contested slots at secondary school, they could gain diplomas and degrees online or through the mail, but when there’s no viable path to a free future elsewhere, education in the closed camp is a cruel trick: There are no jobs except volunteer positions with the aid agencies that run the hospitals, schools and social programs, and these pay a fraction of what Kenyan staff members receive for doing the same job.

One might expect that in such circumstances, talent would curdle into bitterness, but the most striking thing about Dadaab is that the miserable conditions do not seem to have engendered radicalization. People are frustrated, but until now, the isolation of the camp and the United Nations mantras on rights and gender balance have fostered a subdued but tolerant society in which women are more emancipated than their sisters back in Somalia.

This is the ultimate contradiction of camp life: how to locate hope for the future in a desperate situation that appears permanent. People are trying. Life in Dadaab and all the other camps is a daily exercise in manufacturing hope. But for many, the fiction of temporariness no longer holds. And we are seeing the results of that realization washing up on Europe’s beaches.","Fri, 09 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/opinion/10rawlence/10rawlence-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=be9ee96d26ad30aaacc9c80a6eff79b1b40ce642b112ee598ed3b5d343f16e2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['nations', 'times', 'united', 'refugee', 'camp', 'life', 'refugees', 'york', 'camps', 'dadaab', 'work', 'agency', 'crisis']", 
4,4,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Illegal overfishing and the return of Somalia’s pirates - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/10/6/illegal-overfishing-and-the-return-of-somalias-pirates,"Plunder of Somali waters by foreign fishing vessels could mean the return of hijackings, locals warn.

Durduri, Somalia – A hundred years ago, it was a bustling port that served the vibrant fishing community living along Somalia’s coastline, the longest on mainland Africa.

Now, Durduri is a sun-bleached, wind-swept, white-sand graveyard of stone structures. There is no harbour, no jetty. The drying and smoking house is just a tumble of bricks.

This is one of many historical coastal trading towns that have risen and fallen with empires. When the busy trade routes moved away, fishing was one of the few lifelines left.

Talk to locals now and you will find this too has dried up – they say there are no more fish in the sea. They blame not the pirates who brought the attention of international law enforcement to Somalia’s waters, but the foreign fishing boats that have plundered sea-life stocks.

Inside Somalia’s Eyl, families pay for piracy crackdown

And if things don’t change, they say, a return to piracy will be their only way of survival.

‘They take everything’

Ahmed Mohamed Ali walks disconsolately along the beach at Durduri, 100 kilometres west of the port city of Bosaso, perched on the northeastern point of Puntland, Somalia’s semi-autonomous northern state.

Ali said he was forced to quit fishing, the only job he has ever known, after a foreign fishing ship bore down on him and his colleagues one night at sea.

“It was a huge ship. We fled for our lives. Had we not it would have all been over and we’d have been dead,” the 27-year-old told Al Jazeera.

Large foreign vessels “come at night and take everything”, he said, gesturing angrily out to sea. “With their modern machinery, there is nothing left.”

And the Somali fishermen can’t match them. “We don’t carry guns; we don’t even have any weapons,” he said.

Ali’s accusations are backed up by two new pieces of research, conducted by separate Somali development agencies, which suggest that international fishing vessels – particularly Iranian and Yemeni, but also European ships including Spanish – are illegally exploiting the East African nation’s fish stocks on a massive scale.

Legacy of piracy

In a country torn apart by civil war, without a federal government until as recently as 2012 following more than two decades of fighting, the population of 10.5 million largely suffers from a crippling paucity of economic opportunities.

Somalis say illegal, unlicensed, and unregulated fishing forced them to turn to piracy 10 years ago in order to recoup their losses. “We got fed up and took guns to the sea,” said one Bosaso fisherman, Mohamed Adan Ahmed.

Piracy put a stop to illegal fishing, but these findings suggest it was merely a hiatus; now that international anti-piracy task forces have halted the hijackings, illegal fishing vessels have returned.

In 2014, 86 percent of Somali fishermen spotted foreign fishing vessels close to the shore, according to a report by international charity Adeso, which conducted interviews down the length of the coastline over a six-month period last year.

Sightings were more frequent in Puntland and have more than doubled in the last five years, according to the IUU Fishing in the Territorial Waters of Somalia report.

It first became a problem in the mid-1990s, according to Halimo Isman, who said at the time she was the only fisherwoman working in Durduri’s waters.

In the new village that has sprung up close to the old port, she told Al Jazeera huge foreign fishing vessels dwarfed the Somalis’ small, fibreglass skiffs. “It became impossible to share waters with them.”

Her family were originally pastoralists, but, like many Somalis, they lost their livestock in a drought, so came to the coast in search of a new livelihood. Isman married a fisherman in 1987 and he taught her how to fish, repair nets, and dry the catch of the day.

“Fish, including sharks, were available everywhere,” the 55-year-old recalls. But in 1996, she quit. The seas were out of fish, she said. Today, Isman keeps goats and sheep and grows vegetables and date palms on the brackish land.

Search for a better life

Foreign vessels take three times more fish than Somalis do – 132,000 metric tons each year compared to 40,000 by locals – another report released in September said.

From 12 months’ research, the agency Secure Fisheries found the amount of fish being harvested is unsustainable. Illegal vessels are harvesting tuna stocks at the maximum capacity, leaving nothing for Somalis, it said.

“Piracy can come back because people have nothing,” said elder Saed Jama Yusuf, speaking at the harbour in Bosaso, where his fellow fishermen bemoaned their feeble catches. “We will make preparations, gather our resources for funds.”

The federal government’s Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources was unavailable for comment, but Minister Mohamed Omar Aymow has previously denied there is a risk of piracy returning.

“There is not a big fear,” he told Voice of America in September. “We don’t have pirate men who are organised like the group we are fighting against now [Al-Shabab].”

However, in March two Iranian vessels suspected of fishing illegally were seized by Somali pirates, an incident described as the first successful hijacking in three years. The crew of one ship escaped after nearly five months, while the others remain in captivity.

“If the illegal fishing doesn’t stop, people will look for alternatives – like piracy, joining al-Shabab, becoming criminals, or migrating,” said former fisherman Ali.

Last month, residents of Durduri told Somali news agency Hiiraan Online that members of ISIL had arrived on a boat and taken as many as 40 young men.

With no work available, it is easy for such violent groups to recruit young men, Ali warned.

Somalis are warning locals will have no choice but to return to piracy because of overfishing by foreign trawlers [Karel Prinsloo/Adeso]

Will anyone help?

The challenges of policing Somalia’s waters are enormous. The 200-nautical-mile economic exclusion zone, representing 830,390 square kilometres, is far larger than its land area.

The maritime police in Bosaso, where human smugglers shelter migrants trying to sail north across the Gulf of Arden – one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes – operate on a shoestring budget of less than $10,000 per year, said Colonel Mohamed Ali Hashi.

Coastguards are volunteers, dressed in makeshift uniforms, cobbling money together for fuel, he told Al Jazeera.

Hashi, the commander of Bosaso’s maritime police, said foreign vessels are employing Somalis on board as armed guards, but he has “no speedboats, no firearms”.

“If the government doesn’t authorise me to fight illegal fishing, I can’t,” he said. “Since NATO has been here, piracy is down but illegal fishing has increased. NATO and the EU never help us, never give us a hand.”

Robert Mazurek, director of the Secure Fisheries agency, told Al Jazeera “the international community has done very little to combat [illegal] fishing in Somali waters”.

Asked for a response to the accusation, NATO responded: “Actions to counter illegal fishing would breach the scope and capabilities of the mission.”

RELATED: The other side of Somalia’s pirates

So what is the way forward for Somalia’s fishing industry and security in its waters?

Development organisations want new legislation, improved information sharing between international and regional bodies, increased use of satellite tracking to identify vessels operating there, and investment in local fisheries infrastructure.

“We need more concerted efforts, advocacy, a holistic approach to address both illegal fishing and to support local communities affected by illegal fishing practices,” Adeso programme director Abdi Mohamed Dahir told Al Jazeera via email.

Locals such as Ali believe Somalia’s rulers must take responsibility.

“We have a government but it’s fragile,” he said. “A strong government that could protect our seas would be a solution. There is no other way.”","Tue, 06 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8d564d0e98b3459f9be048ad04d6f21e_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['return', 'piracy', 'overfishing', 'international', 'pirates', 'vessels', 'foreign', 'somalias', 'fishing', 'somali', 'told', 'fish', 'illegal']",

A severe drought hit the Horn of Africa in 2011. Credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images

The Horn of Africa is growing drier, threatening food security for millions of people — and this change is driven by global warming, according to an analysis published on 9 October in Science Advances1. The finding casts doubt on projections suggesting that the region will become wetter as global temperatures rise.

Jessica Tierney, a molecular palaeoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and her colleagues extracted regional temperature and precipitation records from deep-sea sediment cores drilled from the Arabian Sea. They show that twentieth-century drying in the region is unusual in the context of nearly 2,000 years of rainfall, and that it is linked with recent warming trends.

“You have to conclude there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the decline in rainfall,” says Chris Funk, a research geographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara. That contradicts prior studies2 that have associated the drying trend with the natural variability of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures.

Pirates at sea

Understanding past climate change in the Horn of Africa is difficult. Instrumental records and natural records of climate are rare — there are no permanent lake basins and scarcely any trees in the area.

So to reconstruct these historical patterns, co-author Peter deMenocal, a palaeoclimatologist at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, sailed with a team to the Gulf of Aden. The team drilled into the sea floor and collected cores from a depth of 869 metres.

The journey was perilous. The team embarked in early 2001, just before piracy, terrorism and political unrest made the region dangerous for scientific work. The ship operated without radio, lights or radar along the coast of Somalia and Yemen, and received updates on pirate attacks by fax.

Winds transport large quantities of dust from the region into the gulf, depositing about 32 centimetres of sediment every 1,000 years. Tiny fossilized organisms and other material trapped in these layers provide a detailed account of past climates, allowing researchers to reconstruct conditions in five-year increments from 1850 t​o ​​2000, and every 10 years prior to 1850. “It’s an enormously high sedimentation rate. A lot of mud per unit time gives great records,” says deMenocal.

Leaf history

Back in the lab, Tierney deciphered changes in the region’s temperature and rainfall from ad 100 to 2000. To reconstruct past sea-surface temperatures, she and her colleagues looked to tiny marine microorganisms — types of archaea — that alter the chemical structure of their membranes as the water temperatures cool or warm.

The team deduced information about aridity using the chemical composition of leaf waxes from terrestrial plants, which mix with dust and become trapped in sediment. “Plants are kind of a rain gauge. The waxes that they make record drought stress on land,” says Tierney.

Rain that falls during dry periods is rich in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Leaf waxes that contain higher levels of deuterium thus signal dry spells.

Tierney found that deuterium levels decreased during the Little Ice Age (1450–1800), the wettest period of the past 2,000 years in the region. But they rose sharply during the twentieth century, in step with local sea-surface temperatures — a sign of aridity. “It has been this dry before, but the rate of change is unusual,” says Tierney. Short bouts of dryness appear in the record around ad 700 and 900, but this aridity is more variable than the steady increase in dryness observed through the twentieth century.

“The relationship seems to have held up quite robustly,” says Funk.

Dry prospects

East Africa has experienced spring droughts in 8 of the past 16 years3, which have contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths and widespread food insecurity. Yet global climate models project a wetter East Africa by 2100.

The region has two rainy seasons, agriculturally important “long rains” from March to May, and “short rains” from September to November. Global climate models suggest that the short rains will become more intense as an atmospheric pattern over the Indian and Pacific oceans, called the Walker circulation, becomes weaker in response to global warming.

But these models have overestimated the impact of the Walker circulation on the short rains and underestimate the changes during the long-rain season, says Tierney. Others say that the Walker circulation may become stronger.

For now, regional models and observations may do a better job of predicting the impact of global warming on rainfall in the region. One such modelling study projects increased aridity by mid-century, and the subsequent collapse of some of East Africa’s crop-growing seasons4.

“We can’t assume the Horn will get wetter — the palaeoclimate data certainly don’t suggest that,” says Tierney. “We need to work harder to understand what the long rains are going to do.”

CHG and FSU scientists combined their datasets, performed a gap analysis, and then acquired additional stations from the Kenyan (76 stations), Tanzanian (60), and Ethiopian (226) Meteorological Agencies. The Kenyan data were used to update the FSU archive. While special focus has been made on acquiring data over the past 30 years, the CenTrends data set covers the 1900–2014 period. Data density over the early part of the 20th and 21st centuries varies substantially by decade and country. The CenTrends interpolation process (kriging) quantifies the uncertainties associated with these changing densities, and in our validation section we describe techniques for quantifying the statistical validity of multi-annual precipitation changes.

The Nicholson East African archive was based primarily on Africa meteorological agency data, augmented with observations from the University of Bergen and Cologne and a historical archive of 217 stations covering the Serengeti region of Kenya and Tanzania. The CHG, archive, on the other hand, is based primarily on global sources: version 2 of the monthly Global Historical Climate Network30 (GHCN), the GHCN daily station archive31, the National Climatic Data Center’s Global Summary of the Day (GSOD), and the World Meteorological Organization’s Global Telecommunication System (GTS) dataset.

When evaluating GHA precipitation data sets, it is important to remember that the GHA covers 3.7 million km2 (Table 1), an expanse equal to half the area of the continental United States. Spread irregularly across this vast region is a sparse network of precipitation gauges, with a spatial distribution determined by history, settlement patterns, and patterns of livelihood (Fig. 1a–c). Station densities tend to follow annual precipitation totals, with moist highland cultivated areas having more gauges, in contrast with the arid almost unmonitored pastoral regions of eastern Ethiopia, Somalia and eastern Kenya. Table 1 lists the average number of monthly CenTrends station observations for the month of May, by country and source, over the 1900–2014 time period. Also shown, for comparison, are the average number of observations from the GHCN monthly archive, the best globally available set of monthly station observations. The CenTrends station data set has more than twice as many observations as GHCN. It should be recognized that the station density of the CenTrends data is still low (1 station per 10,483 km2). While we suggest below that the interpolation methods used by the GPCC (inverse distance weighting) produces similar results to the CenTrends’ interpolation method (kriging), the latter approach allows for the calculation of spatially varying error fields. Unfortunately, as noted by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre8, the number of stations being provided by national meteorological agencies and the GHCN has plummeted over the last decade (cf. Fig. 8 in ref. 8). In the GHA, this has manifested as a substantial erosion (Fig. 1a–c) in the number of GPCC ‘observations’ (GPCC v6 0.5° estimates with a least one station observation in that grid cell). There were 187 GPCC observations in 1996–2000, 159 in 2001–2005 and only 50 between 2006 and 2010. In 1996–2000, 2001–2005, and 2006–2010, the CenTrends had 404, 333 and 276 observations in the GHA (Fig. 1a–c). The CenTrends had 2.2, 2.1 and 5.5 times as many observations in these five year periods.

Table 1 Area of the countries covered by CenTrends and the average number of CenTrends stations used for each country for each month or season. Full size table

Ethiopia and Tanzania are each roughly the size of Spain and France combined; the Ethiopia 2006–2010 GPCC product had ~4 observations in Ethiopia and ~6 observations in Tanzania. These gaps, and the complete or near absence of robust data records in many areas, underscores the pressing need for better data sharing protocols and agreements.

The same type of comparison between the CenTrends, GHCN and GPCC station densities, extended over time (Table 2), shows the most marked differences during 1981–1999 and 2000–2014, when the GHCN and GPCC densities declined precipitously. The number of GPCC ‘observations’ shown in Table 2 are based on the number of 0.5° GPCC version 6 grid cells that have at least one station observation. While these counts may slightly under-represent the number of GPCC stations, these counts tend to follow the number of GHCN observations closely. The GPCC archive exhibits the same recent decline as the GHCN archive. In Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi the CenTrends archive has substantially more observations. In these periods the CenTrends data set has 3.6 and 28 times as many observations as the GHCN and 2.7 and 4.0 time as many observations as the GPCC v6 archive. Unfortunately, many national GHA observations are not being transmitted to international station archives via systems like the GTS. It should be noted that the CenTrends acquisition process is still a work in progress: gaps remain in Ethiopia prior to 1961, in Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Eritrea and Somalia after 1999, in Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Somalia prior to 1921, and in Eritrea prior to 1941. Efforts will continue to improve the FSU/CHG archive.

Table 2 Comparison of the number of stations in the CenTrends and GHCN monthly and daily data sets Full size table

The final CenTrends station data base is produced through a tiered merging procedure. In the first step, FSU researchers assimilated stations from the large (1400+ stations) FSU African archive, national meteorological agency data sets, and rain gauge observations provided by colleagues at the Universities of Bergen and Cologne. The University of Bergen is part of a Nile Basin hydrologic consortium that updated station records for some stations in the Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in exchange for the FSU archive for these countries. FSU also obtained a data archive for the Serengeti that contains 217 gauges in Tanzania and Kenya, with observations covering the period 1902–2001. FSU combined and quality controlled these stations. The CHG researchers then added observations from the GHCN monthly and daily data sets (Table 3). For the final period (2000–2014) the CHG also added a small number of screened and quality controlled stations from the GSOD and GTS networks (Table 3). While these data had little impact on the CenTrends data set, their inclusion helps integrate the CenTrends data set with the CHG’s 1981-present near real time station enhanced satellite-based precipitation estimates32. These data will also be used to produce updates to the CenTrends data set (see section 2.8).

Table 3 The average number of station observations available for the month of May over sequential 20 year time periods Full size table

Note that there are important differences in the overall coverage between countries. Tanzania and Kenya have relatively dense observation networks stretching back to 1900, especially in the Serengeti region. Ethiopia, on the other hand, has very few available stations available before 1961. After 1961, however, an active meteorological agency and accessible data sharing policy provide good coverage through 2014. Coverage in Eritrea and Somalia is limited in general.

CenTrends quality control procedures

The CenTrends station data were quality-controlled by researchers at FSU and the CHG. Potential data issues were identified based on: i) comparison with climatological means, ii) the identification of extreme standardized precipitation index values33–35, iii) the identification of extremely wet monthly observations, iv) the identification of potentially questionable zero values during rainy months, and v) the identification of stations exhibiting low correlation and covariance with neighboring stations or with the rainfall series for the geographical region in which they lie. These issues were examined visually, through spatial and temporal plots of station data. Potential 1981–2014 anomalies were also examined through visual comparison with the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) imagery32. Comparison with CHIRP helped identify both problematic low observations, especially zero values during months with heavy satellite-observed convection, as well as probably correct extreme wet observations—very high monthly rainfall totals accompanied by high satellite-observed convection or similarly extreme values at neighboring stations.

Daily GHCN, GSOD, and GTS data were converted to monthlies if at least 85% of the days were complete. The GHCN monthly30 and GHCN daily data36 undergo extensive quality control procedures at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The CHG added extra levels of scrutiny for daily GSOD and GTS data. Some GSOD data were found to exhibit repeating values on adjacent days. For example, a string of daily observations might be: 0.0000, 0.0000, 87.653, 87.653, 87.653, 0.0000, …. If a monthly GSOD record had either three or more duplicates, or duplicates totaling to more than 30 mm, the monthly record was omitted. The probability of five digits being the same two or three times is small.

The daily GTS and GSOD values underwent additional screening to flag potential missing values coded as zero. This is a substantial problem with both of these information sources, and can produce completely erroneous ‘droughts’ in the midst of a rainy season, as missing data are coded as zeros and passed through the automated GSOD and GTS networks. If the daily GSOD and GTS values were zero for a given day, but the daily CHIRP precipitation was above the long-term (1981–2014) average daily rainfall intensity, that daily station value was treated as missing. Additional checks were made for spurious zero values for the monthly accumulations. If the station reported a zero monthly value in the GTS or GSOD, but CHIRP indicated 20 mm or more, that station data was treated as missing. Finally, the GTS and GSOD were only used to fill in the last part of the data record (2000 onward), and were only used when higher quality data were not available. The actual number of GTS/GSOD observations used was very small (Table 3).

Climatologically assisted interpolation of seasonal anomalies

The CenTrends dataset is based on a Climatologically Aided Interpolation (CAI) approach24. CAI breaks a climate field into two components: a static background climatology, and a time varying anomaly surface. In this application (which works with seasonal or annual totals), we can express an individual CenTrends grid as the sum of these two components:

(1) C = R ¯ + I

Where C represents an nx×ny matrix of CenTrends precipitation values, R ¯ is a matrix of long term average rainfall, and I represents a matrix of interpolated station anomalies. The CAI approach takes advantage of the ‘skill’ inherent in good high resolution climatologies24. An additional advantage of the CAI approach is that working with station anomalies, as opposed to raw station totals, mitigates the impacts of changing spatial networks.

In East Africa the effect of changing station network can create large spurious variations due to the sparse number of observations and the complex topography and climate. Orographic effects play a large role37, and precipitation can vary radically over short distances. When working with simple precipitation totals, for example, the effect of a wet high elevation station disappearing from an archive can create the incorrect semblance of drought. One approach to mitigate this problem is to use standardized anomalies of long homogeneous station archives grouped into climate regions10,11,37,38. Here, we use the CAI technique, because gridded precipitation fields are easier to use for many food security and climate adaptation applications. Sample applications relevant to East Africa have been the identification of food security hot spots where drying, population growth, poverty and agricultural extensification coincide39,40 and research linking Kenya warming and drying trends to stunting and malnutrition in Kenya41.

Another benefit of the CAI approach is that high resolution climatologies can take advantage of the higher number of long term climate normals, since there are typically many more of these than time-varying monthly observations. The CenTrends analysis uses the Climate Hazards Groups Precipitation climatology (CHPclim) as a background climatological mean state14,42. The CHPclim (http://dx.doi.org/10.15780/G2159X) uses moving window regressions to take advantage of local correlations between gauge normals and mean satellite precipitation to produce high resolution rainfall climatologies. In regions like Ethiopia, where sparse data and complex topography combine to create complex season cycles37, most precipitation is accompanied by high cumulonimbus clouds43. The frequency of these cold cloud tops, which can be observed by geostationary satellites, tracks fairly closely with East African precipitation43–46. CHPclim draws on this relationship to produce global climatologies that perform better in the GHA than the most commonly used global climatologies -- the University of East Anglia's Climatological Research Unit (CRU) climatology47 and the Worldclim48 global climate layers. For example, during Ethiopia’s main growing season comparisons with independent validation data indicated monthly mean absolute errors of about 9 mm month−1 for the CHPclim, in contrast with errors of more than 30 mm month−1 for the CRU and Worldclim datasets42. For this study the 0.05° resolution CHPclim climatology was resampled to 0.1° to keep data sizes reasonable.

Calculating CenTrends seasonal anomalies

The CenTrends monthly station data was accumulated into four sets of seasonal totals covering the boreal spring ‘long’ rains (March-June), the boreal summer monsoon rains (June-September), the boreal fall ‘short’ rains (October-February), and a set of annual accumulations extending from October-September. Twelve sets of monthly grids were also created. As we discuss below, working explicitly with seasonal totals supports the explicit mapping of seasonal standard errors. Monthly data were also provided, however, to give users flexible access to the data.

Seasonal station totals with at least one missing value were treated as missing. Monthly and seasonal station time series were converted to arithmetic anomalies by subtracting the 1960–1989 mean. The 1960–1989 time period was selected because of its high station density (Table 2).

CenTrends interpolation procedure—defining the variogram

The CenTrends data set was interpolated using kriging, an optimal geostatistical interpolation technique first developed in South Africa for geological mining applications28,29,48. While almost all interpolation techniques are based on linear combinations of neighboring observations, they differ in how they estimate the relevant weighting parameters. The Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, for example, uses a modified version of Shepard’s inverse distance weighting procedure49, as implemented in the Spheremap package24. The CRU, on the other hand, uses a weighting based on a local tessellation (triangulation) of the rain gauge network25. Kriging, on the other hand, bases its interpolation weights on an explicit empirically-derived representation of the relationship between the expected variance between any two locations in space. This relationship is a function of distance. The empirical relationship between distance and variance is first estimated using all possible pairs of observations, binned into distance categories. These observed variances are then fit with a numerical equation that can estimate the variance given the distance between any two points. This function can then be used to define a set of optimal (in a least squares sense) interpolation weights for any given target location and distribution of observations. Perhaps more importantly, this distance decay function can also be used to estimate the standard errors of the kriging estimates.

Figure 1b shows an example variogram, based on the average observed variance between the GHA gauge anomalies for March-June. These values (circles) have been calculated over all the March-June seasons between 1960 and 1989, when the most data was available. The next step in the kriging process fits the empirical variance values using a numerical function of the ‘nugget’, ‘range’ and ‘sill’. This fit is shown with the continuous line in Fig. 1b. The ‘nugget’ refers historically to a piece of ore, the smallest unit of space, and expresses the expected value when the distance goes to a very low value. The high nugget of the CenTrends data probably reflects both issues with the data and the fairly high variability of convective rainfall at small spatial scales. Most of the monthly station data used in the CenTrends data set was obtained as monthly values. The high nugget may be due, in part, to the treatment of missing values within the month in some subset of our data. These missing values may have been ignored, or treated as zeros, resulting in some large discrepancies between neighboring stations.

The range, 5 degrees in this case, reflects the distance at which the expected correlation between any two locations will be zero (~550 km near the equator). The sill specifies the expected variance at this distance, which is identical to the total variance of the original station anomalies. We use these parameters to specify a continuous function specifying the variance as a function of the distance between any two locations: V(d( a , b )). V(0) will equal the nugget. V(range) will equal the sill. Subtracting V(d( a , b )) from the sill gives us the expected covariance between any two locations:

(2) C o v ( a , b ) = s i l l − V ( d ( a , b ) )

Where Cov( a , b ) is the expected variance between any two locations a and b. Cov( a , b ) is solely a function of the distance between a and b , d( a, b ). In linear kriging systems, these covariance estimates are used in manner very similar to multivariate regression, which uses the covariance of the predictors ( XTX ) and the predictors and predictand ( XTy ) to find an optimal set of coefficients.

CenTrends interpolation procedure—ordinary kriging

The covariances defined in equation (2) are used to produce ordinary kriging estimates for each location, based on a set of 20 surrounding stations. Ordinary kriging refers to the simplest form of kriging system. While many other approaches, such as techniques incorporating spatial trend terms are possible, ordinary kriging was selected because it is the most transparent, and explicitly limits the contribution of each station to the range specified by the variogram model. The solution to kriging systems closely resembles those used to determine regression parameters via least squares minimization50.

(3) w = C − 1 s

w represents the solution of the kriging system, the weights of the surrounding neighbors. The final estimated interpolated anomaly (elements of I in equation (1)) at a given location will be calculated as i = w T n ′ , where n ′ denotes a set of neighboring station anomalies. C is an augmented matrix of n-neighbor+1 by n-neighbor+1 co-variance estimates C = [ C o v ( n i , n j ) 1 1 0 ] . Cov(n i , n j ) is determined via equation (2) and the distances between each pair of neighboring points. The operator C−1 acts to remove the expected covariance among the predictors (stations). s is an augmented vector of expected covariances between each of the station observations and the location (l) being predicted w = [ C o v ( n i , l ) 1 ] . The closer the station is to the target location, the higher its expected covariance and the higher its weight will be, subject to the influence of C−1.

While kriging requires an explicit fitting of a variogram model, it is generally held as more reliable than automatic procedures such as the inverse distance weighting used in Spheremap or the triangulation process used in the CRU data set. Kriging, for example, has been used to validate the GPCC dataset8 and satellite rainfall estimates in Uganda46. The main advantage of kriging is that the variogram, station locations, and target locations can be used to develop explicit estimates of the expected standard errors, based on the density and distributions of the observations.

In summary, the two terms of equation (1) are produced independently. The CHPclim data, based on dense in situ gauge normals, high resolution satellite fields, elevation and moving window regression estimates are used to represent the long term mean climatology. Deviations around this mean are based on the CenTrends gauge observations, interpolated using ordinary kriging. This kriging was carried out in the R statistical program, using the gstat package developed by Edzer Pebesma (www.gstat.org)51,52.

Code availability

The code used to produce the CenTrends data set was written by Chris Funk and is freely available on dryad along with the CenTrends data (Data Citation 1).

Planned update schedule and naming protocol

We plan on updating the CenTrends data set once each year, probably each spring. Data from globally available sources (GHCN, GSOD, and GTS) will be augmented, if possible, by data acquired from national meteorological agencies. The year will be appended to the version number (1) to represent these sequential updates (CenTrends v1 will be followed by v1.2015, v1.2016, …. Changes in version number will represent either a change in the algorithm or spatial domain. Prior versions of CenTrends will be archived, and kept publically available. We would hope that version 2.0 covers all of Africa.","Tue, 29 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fsdata.2015.50/MediaObjects/41597_2015_Article_BFsdata201550_Fig1_HTML.jpg,"['africa', 'set', 'monthly', 'trends', 'precipitation', 'centennial', 'dataset', 'observations', 'centrends', 'greater', 'kriging', 'stations', 'station', 'data', 'horn', 'used']", 
7,7,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Conflict drives 'unacceptable' figure of 795 million people facing hunger - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/12/conflict-drives-unacceptable-figure-of-795-million-people-facing-hunger,"Levels of hunger in the developing world have fallen by nearly one third since the turn of the century but an “unacceptably high” number of people still do not have enough food to eat, largely because of the spread of armed conflicts, this year’s global hunger index has warned.

There are 27% fewer hungry people in the world today than at the turn of the century, according to the 2015 index, which was released on Monday by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide.

But despite this progress, “the level of hunger in the world remains unacceptably high, with 795 million people still going hungry, more than one in four children affected by stunting, and 9% of children affected by wasting”, the index said.



The index assessed the level of hunger in 117 countries where the issue is considered to be a problem and where data is available. It takes into account undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality.

There are “serious” concerns about the level of hunger in 44 countries and “alarming” signs in eight other nations, the index said.

Armed conflict, which has cut civilians off from food supplies, is behind high levels of hunger in Central African Republic, which ranked bottom of this year’s index, according to Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide.



“You can contrast where there has been progress and go to Ethiopia and Rwanda, where the hunger levels have fallen substantially,” MacSorley said.

Conflicts have become more deadly since 2008. Despite the number of active wars falling from 63 in 2008 to 42 in 2014, the number of people killed in conflict areas has soared from 56,000 to 180,000 over the same period.

These intensifying wars are driving hunger in some of the world’s poorest countries, MacSorley said. Hostilities often drive civilians to deplete food stocks, making them more vulnerable to future food insecurity.

“Preventing civilian access to food markets, food production and/or food aid is the equivalent of using hunger as a weapon and is therefore a direct violation of human rights and international humanitarian law,” said Jean-Michel Grand, executive director of Action Against Hunger UK, an international NGO.



Many of the countries affected by the most violent conflicts in the world today – including Syria, South Sudan and Somalia – did not have enough data on hunger to be included in this year’s index. In total, 13 countries had to be omitted from the index because of a lack of available data.

In September, world leaders committed to the wide-ranging sustainable development goals (SDGs), which aim to end extreme poverty, address the impact of climate change and reduce inequality by 2030. SDG2, the second goal, seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture over the same period.

MacSorley said: “Without peace, ending poverty and hunger by 2030 will never be achieved. The time has come for the international community to make conflict prevention, mitigation and resolution a far higher political priority.”



But humanitarians are optimistic that the world can make progress towards meeting SDG2.



Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, said: “We are more confident today than ever before that we can end hunger, provided we do not rest on our accomplishments.”



Grand said: “If world leaders are serious about fulfilling their ambitions to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030, as stated at the sustainable development summit held less than a month ago at the UN general assembly in New York, then they must start by launching meaningful peace processes in war-torn countries where millions of people are denied access to food markets, food production and/or food aid.”

Last year’s index warned that widespread consumption of poor-quality food, dubbed “hidden hunger”, is affecting two billion people.

The 2015 index includes data on child stunting and child wasting instead of just on the number of underweight children in a given country. This provides “more accurate information on undernutrition, enabling better humanitarian programming decisions to be made”, Grand said.","Mon, 12 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e80e5da4b115b97c7a783c09a789df14c7f1bac/0_99_2304_1383/master/2304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=653c3f1e589a7be365a82bd51be4a6f0,"['million', 'conflict', 'figure', 'facing', 'international', 'world', 'food', 'number', 'child', 'drives', 'unacceptable', 'end', '795', 'hunger', 'index', 'countries', 'wasting']", 
8,8,DR-2015-000134-SOM,This Ugandan innovation is a possible solution for viable drinking water in drought ridden areas - Ventures Africa,https://venturesafrica.com/this-ugandan-innovation-is-a-possible-solution-for-viable-drinking-water-in-drought-ridden-areas/,"Dr. Samuel Otukol, a Ugandan has invented a Water Distillation System Process (DSP) which works by evaporating salty or unclean water at low temperatures before it is condensed into fresh water. Using this technology, condensation is achieved at a much lower cost than using reverse osmosis.

Otukol, the President of Ultimate Water Solutions with a background in forestry, created the DSP to make alternative sources of viable drinking water available in drought ridden areas or where only sea water is available. In a recent interview, Otukol recalled how severe the drought in his home area in Uganda was, which forced him to trek long distances to search for water.

Drought is major feature in most East African countries and occurs when there is a long period of low rainfall in a particular region. In 2011, a severe drought occurred in several East African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Somalia, caused by an ocean-atmosphere disturbance known as La Nina.

The drought, which interrupted rainfall for two consecutive seasons, led to a mass crop failure and about 50 percent loss of livestock, also caused a shortage in crop harvest and milk production. As a result, the price of food was inflated. About 9.5 million people were in need of assistance and at the end of the drought in 2013, over 100,000 people died as a result of starvation, diseases and other causes.

Farmers typically suffer the most in a drought because with water shortages, they are not usually able to meet crop water demands. Also, because water sourced during the drought period is often polluted by chemicals, access to clean water is limited.

Droughts also reduce availability of electricity and the economy is usually adversely affected because of this reduction in crop exports.

For African countries with poor electricity supply, the Water Distillation System Process also works with solar energy so that many countries can benefit from its ability to mitigate the unpleasant effects of drought.","Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://venturesafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/water-wallpapers-12-1024x640.jpg,"['viable', 'areas', 'water', 'ridden', 'crop', 'drinking', 'system', 'usually', 'ugandan', 'using', 'solution', 'drought', 'african', 'countries', 'works', 'possible', 'innovation', 'somalia']",

12,12,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Ethiopia food crisis worsens - eNCA,https://www.enca.com/africa/ethiopia-food-crisis-worsens,"ADDIS ABABA - The number of hungry Ethiopians needing food aid has risen sharply due to poor rains and the El Nio weather phenomenon with around 7.5 million people now in need, aid officials said Friday.

That number has nearly doubled since August, when the United Nations said 4.5 million were in need -- with the UN now warning that without action some ""15 million people will require food assistance"" next year, more than inside war-torn Syria.

""Without a robust response supported by the international community, there is a high probability of a significant food insecurity and nutrition disaster,"" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in a report.

The UN children&39;s agency, Unicef, warns over 300,000 children are severely malnourished. (The report below contains an earlier estimate.)

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which makes detailed technical assessments of hunger, predicted a harvest ""well below average"" in its latest report.

""Unusual livestock deaths continue to be reported,"" FEWS NET said. ""With smaller herds, few sellable livestock, and almost no income other than charcoal and firewood sales, households are unable to afford adequate quantities of food.""

Ethiopia, Africa&39;s second most populous nation, borders the Horn of Africa nation of Somalia, where some 855,000 people face need ""life-saving assistance"", according to the UN, warning that 2.3 million more people there are ""highly vulnerable"".

El Nio comes with a warming in sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, and can cause unusually heavy rains in some parts of the world and drought elsewhere.

Hardest-hit areas are Ethiopia&39;s eastern Afar and southern Somali regions, while water supplies are also unusually low in central and eastern Oromo region.

Food insecurity is a sensitive issue in Ethiopia, hit by famine in 1984-85 after extreme drought.

Today, Ethiopia&39;s government would rather its reputation was its near-double-digit economic growth and huge infrastructure investment -- making the country one of Africa&39;s top-performing economies and a magnet for foreign investment.

Still, nearly 20 million Ethiopians live below the $1.25 poverty line set by the World Bank, with the poorest some of the most vulnerable to weather challenges.

Ethiopia&39;s government has mobilised $33 million (30 million euros) in emergency aid, but the UN says it needs $237 million.

Minster for Information Redwan Hussein told reporters at a recent press conference that Ethiopia is doing what it can.

15,15,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Syrian civil war forces first withdrawal from Arctic Global Seed Vault - Wired.co.uk,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/syrian-war-leads-to-doomsday-bank-withdrawal,"NordGen/Dag Terje Filip Endresen

Syria has been forced to make the first withdrawal from a global seed bank to replenish local supplies. An unlikely fallout of the civil war, the withdrawal will see 130 boxes of seeds first deposited into the vault by Syria returned to the Middle East.

The seed bank in Syrian city of Aleppo was a hub for growing seeds and distributing them across the region before the war. The facility is no longer producing seeds and, while it is still storing them, the International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) has requested the return of 130 of 325 boxes it had deposited in the global vault. The total supply of 325 boxes contained 116,000 samples.

ICARDA was forced to move its headquarters from Aleppo to Beirut in 2012 because of the conflict, which has forced over 11 million people from their homes and killed around 250,000.

The Global Seed Vault, created in 2008, is located 800 miles from the North Pole on the Norwegian island of Svalbard. It houses over 865,000 seed samples of 4,000 different at risk plant species from across the world. It preserves the genetic data of seeds that are also stored in banks across the world. These local deposits can be accessed readily, whereas Svalbard supplies should only be requested as a last solution in the event of natural or human disasters.

It was set up in the wake of a number of disasters that made the need for a secure facility urgent: ""War in Rwanda, Burundi, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan has destroyed seed collections -- and the Pavlos station in St Petersburg, Russia's biggest field collection, is threatened by property developers,"" Cary Fowler, then executive director at the Global Crop Diversity Trust told WIRED in 2010.

Buried within a mountain, the Svalbard facility is designed to withstand a bomb, typhoon, flood or even a powerful earthquake. Seeds in the vault can be kept alive for 100 years.

One of the samples deposited by the ICARDA was Lathyrus, which can survive severe droughts. ""It's a sweet pea,"" Fowler said. ""You will find it as an ornamental plant, but in Ethiopia, Somalia, India and Bangladesh it is a food crop. It's incredibly hardy, the most drought-proof crop in Ethiopia, and still lives when everything else dies. ""Two years ago I was with a farmer in Ethiopia and there were fissures on his land that you could put your arm in, up to the elbow, and this plant was still flowering. It is pest-resistant, survives floods and has the highest protein content of any food legume. A very important crop for poor people.""

The Svalbard bank is not a ""Doomsday"" plan. It was expected that technical issues would be the likely cause for withdrawals -- equipment failures or mismanagement in country banks around the world.","Wed, 23 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT","https://media.wired.co.uk/photos/606da0845113453af573462a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/svalbard.jpg","['seeds', 'war', 'bank', 'crop', 'civil', 'world', 'vault', 'svalbard', 'withdrawal', 'arctic', 'seed', 'global', 'plant', 'forced', 'forces', 'syrian']", 
16,16,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Five Risks to ASEAN Growth - Global Risk Insights,https://globalriskinsights.com/2015/10/five-risks-to-asean-growth/,"Last week, the Asian Development Bank downgraded the 2015/2016 growth rate forecasts for most ASEAN countries, and the region as a whole. The latest revised figures revel some of the risks that continue to challenge growth prospects in the region.

Sub-regional growth has been revised down to 4.4 percent from an initial forecast of 4.9 percent, owning to various domestic factors such as disappointing growth in Thailand, slow government spending in Indonesia and the Philippines, wavering business confidence in Malaysia, and external shocks such as falling global energy prices and slowing growth in China.











(Source: Asian Development Outlook Supplement, July 2015, Asian Development Outlook 2015 Update: Enabling Women, Energizing Asia. Key: yellow: initial forecast in March, green: forecast unchanged, red: downward revision, blue: upward revision)

The latest cut in growth figures underlines the major risks and uncertainties that continue to weaken growth prospects in Southeast Asia. Five risks in particular will threaten growth in the ASEAN.

Internal political struggles

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has reported slowed government spending in the region, as well as waning business confidence. For instance, Indonesia is dealing with a political struggle between the ruling coalition and opposition camp in the House of Representatives. This in turn has hampered projections for government infrastructure spending for much of 2015.

Similarly, public spending will gradually accelerate but is expected to miss government targets. Furthermore, due to lack of unity within his administration, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has reshuffled his cabinet.

Thailand’s level of public spending is recovering from the political disruptions in 2014, and has started to pick up this year, but projections still lag behind goals. The 1MDB corruption scandal in Malaysia has led to a deprecation of the Ringgit, and has undermined business confidence.

Elections generate post-election uncertainties

November elections in Myanmar and 2016 elections in the Philippines also add uncertainty to the growth prospects in those countries. The ADB sees greater than usual uncertainty for the Philippines; business is concerned as to whether a new administration would continue with the current economic reform agendas. Particular concern exists in the infrastructure, social welfare, and education sectors, where the current administration has made significant progress.

In the case of Myanmar, businesses are concerned about who will be president following the historic election in November this year. The role of the military is expected to remain dominant, while Aung San Suu Kyi, though constitutionally barred from the highest post, is expected to see her party (NLD) perform well.

Hence, the power struggle between the military and pro-democracy political parties will persist.

Droughts and floods hurt agriculture

Southeast Asia is one of the world’s most disaster prone regions, yet is also heavily reliant on agriculture. Floods and droughts caused by El Niño in several Southeast Asian countries have hurt the agricultural sector. Myanmar has experienced the worst floods in decades this year, and is expected to see both production and export reductions for rice and other crops.

In Thailand, drought has hit agricultural output hard. With declining rural incomes and high household debt, private consumption in 2015 will be slow. Similarly, Indonesia is suffering its worst drought since 2010; with as much as 80% of the country affected. The Philippines also saw no year-on-year growth in agricultural production in the first half of 2015. Drought conditions in Vietnam have also damaged coffee and rice production and if prolonged could further weaken growth in the agricultural sector while pushing up food prices into 2016.

Low energy prices retard government revenues

Falls in prices for energy and other commodities have also hurt the growth of some ASEAN countries. Low oil and gas prices have crumpled government income in Brunei, which relies on hydrocarbons for two-thirds of its GDP. The ADB has reported that export revenue for crude oil, refined petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas in Malaysia plummeted, the result of the steep drop in oil and gas prices.

Slow growth in China hurts ASEAN

ADB has also cut down the growth forecasts for China from 7.2 percent in March down to 6.8 percent for 2015, and from 7 percent to 6.7 percent for 2016. China is the largest trading patenr of many Southeast Asian countries, and the largest partner of ASEAN, as a whole. Weak demand from China has undermined exports performance in many Southeast Asian countries.

Optimism remains

While the ADB has slashed growth forecasts for the region for 2016, it expects growth to rebound in 2016 to 4.9 percent with improvements in exports and accelerated infrastructure spending.

The inauguration of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of this year will also see a strengthening of trade links between member countries and a step towards an integrated market.

Tourism, one of the vital industries of many SEA countries, has also remained resilient and continues to drive growth, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines.","Sat, 03 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/globalriskinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ASEAN-Flags.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1,"['risks', 'growth', 'philippines', '2015', 'prices', 'political', 'southeast', 'business', 'countries', 'asean', 'spending', 'asian']",

In the past fiscal year, the campus cut water use by 27 percent, exceeding the city's Stage 3 Water Emergency reduction goal of 25 percent, and water managers continue to look for ways to save even more.

The campus and its efforts were recognized as a top performer in conserving water and protecting water quality by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and is featured in its 2015 Sustainable Campus Index.

The success is the result of hard work from people across campus who stepped up to help lower campus consumption in a variety of ways - reducing irrigation, encouraging behavior modification, sharing more information with users, and installing low-flow faucets, toilets, and pumps.

""Conserving water on campus is everyone's job,"" said Elida Erickson, interim director of sustainability. ""In addition to reducing usage, the campus is looking at ways to harvest and reuse water.""

Since spring 2014, a group of staff and students, has met monthly as the Water Working Group. Members come from all parts of campus - labs, the farm, the arboretum, housing and more. Santa Cruz Water Department conservation manager Toby Goddard offers an update on the city's usage and the status of the San Lorenzo River and the Loch Lomond reservoir.

The group shares campus usage and savings, and explores ways to do more.

In a recent meeting, Energy Manager Patrick Testoni reported that the campus is off to a strong start for the 2015-16 year, lowering its summer months' usage by a cumulative 24.3 percent.

""Achieving water reduction targets on campus requires effective engagement of students, staff, and faculty,"" Testoni said, ""and our success speaks to the collaborative approach we have had between these groups on campus.""

The Water Working Group put together a list of projects that could quickly reduce usage. The projects included laboratory equipment and ultra-low-flow toilets and faucets retrofits in some of the busiest campus areas.

Additionally, low-flow shower heads were installed in campus residence halls along with reminders to aim for a 5-minute shower.

The campus also has invested in cellular broadcasters connected to its 400 water meters that allows it to track usage across campus by the hour. This level of detail also alerts water managers to identify potential leaks. Several have been detected - and fixed - since the retrofits began in May.

Campus water use per capita has declined for more than a decade. The campus baseline use - a three-year average from fiscal years 2003-2005 - is 14,200 gallons per person a year.

In fiscal year 2012, the campus used 9,100 gallons per person, a 36 percent reduction from the baseline. Today's per capita use is at about 8,400 gallons per year, a 40 percent decline from the baseline.

Today, total annual campus water use is 20 million gallons less than 20 years ago, even though campus population has grown.","Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/images/student-water-pledge-500px.jpeg,"['gallons', 'group', 'water', 'seeks', 'goal', 'toilets', 'working', 'reduction', 'usage', 'savings', 'fiscal', 'ways', 'campus', 'exceeds']", 
19,19,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The Key to Ending Global Hunger Is on the Battlefield - TakePart,http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/10/15/global-hunger-war,"When the United Nations announced new goals for reducing global food waste last month, the plan was couched in terms of helping those who don’t have enough to eat. By limiting the amount of food we throw away, the idea goes, we can limit the amount of people who are hungry too. But according to this year’s Global Hunger Index, which was published Wednesday by the International Food Policy Research Institute, to eradicate global hunger for good, we may need to work a little harder to achieve world peace.

The kind of “calamitous famines” that kill more than 1 million people “have vanished,” according to an essay by Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Program, included in the report. “The end of the Cold War, the adoption of international human rights norms, and the rise of globalization” are key factors that allowed the elimination of massive famine, he wrote. But all is not rosy in the world. Just because governments can no longer easily starve an entire population without the world knowing about it does not mean all nonnatural famine (as in the case of drought or other natural disaster) has been eradicated. “When famine or acute hunger occurs today, it is usually the result of armed conflict,” de Waal added.

Between 1970 and 1997, agricultural losses owing to conflict averaged $4.3 billion annually, according to the report, “exceeding the value of food aid to these countries.”

In the past, governments have regularly used hunger as a weapon. “Scorched earth” campaigns—when an army burns or otherwise ruins natural resources or food—have been used by armies since ancient times. Herbicidal weaponry such as the Agent Orange the U.S. used in the Vietnam War caused not only a loss of agricultural crops but also topsoil damage that led to flooding. In 1977, the Geneva Convention banned the practice of harming civilians either directly or through destroying necessary resources, though that has not entirely stopped the practice.

But a conflict doesn’t have to directly raze farmland to decrease food security. As the FAO has noted, this doesn’t make the impact on life less severe. War can harm more people through hunger and malnutrition than direct violence can. A report by the Wilson Center showed that, on average, peacetime production levels were 12.3 percent higher than during conflict periods—though in some countries the difference was as high as 44 percent.

RELATED: TakePart World and Global Citizen Present: Nutrition

However, tactical starvation is often over faster than in decades past. De Waal gives the example of the Israeli siege of Gaza, which “involved tight control of basic supplies to the territory.” While this caused “extreme” deprivation, it “stopped short of crossing the line into mass starvation.” In the history of warfare, this counts as progress.

In the last 15 years, Global Hunger Index scores have dropped by 27 percent overall. The number is calculated by looking at the percentage of the population that is undernourished and the percentage of children under five who suffer from stunting or wasting or who die before reaching that age. Not all countries had this data to draw on, including places with recently recorded high levels of hunger, such as Somalia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As a result, the true global effects of hunger may be higher.

While conflict can cause starvation, hunger can spark violence too. The catalyst for 2011’s Arab Spring was a sudden rise in food prices after the government reduced bread subsidies. Natural disasters that lead to difficulty accessing or purchasing basic food supplies can also “contribute to political unrest,” the FAO noted in its 2015 report on food insecurity. Syria’s civil war in particular has been linked to a drought that ravished the country’s farmland.

Similarly, the peacetime eradication of malnutrition and hunger may make conflict less likely in the future. Luckily, there is lower hanging fruit than creating world peace. The IFPRI report shows that the area of Africa south of the Sahara has the highest levels of hunger. Some of the countries in this area have experienced periods of relative economic growth, while others are still recovering from recent conflict. One thing these countries have in common is that “more than two-thirds of the region’s population relies on agriculture for income, including more than 90 percent of the region’s extreme poor,” according to the report. Despite the large numbers of people participating in farming, productivity is low.

It may still be easier to attempt to help farmers increase productivity than try to ensure conflict never returns to these areas. As many studies have noted, it’s easier to keep peace in a region that’s prospering.","Thu, 15 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/hunger-war.jpg,"['conflict', 'war', 'world', 'food', 'report', 'key', 'global', 'battlefield', 'hunger', 'countries', 'waal', 'according', 'ending']", 
20,20,DR-2015-000134-SOM,"As El Niño gets stronger Australia gets hotter, drier and more ready to burn - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/as-el-nino-gets-stronger-australia-gets-hotter-drier-and-more-ready-to-burn,"El Niño conditions are set to intensify across much of Australia, with extremely dry conditions expected to heighten the risk of drought and bushfires, the Bureau of Meteorology has said.



The bureau has updated its outlook for the rest of the year after Australia experienced its third driest September on record, with large parts of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania getting very little rain.

The chance of a drier than normal October for southern Australia is about 70%, with the probability rising to 80% in Victoria where the state government is attempting to find ways to get water to parched areas in the west of the state.

El Niño is a periodic climatic event in which waters of the eastern Pacific warm, triggering a slew of weather changes around the world. In Australia it is associated with reduced rainfall and warmer temperatures.

The current El Niño, which will last throughout the summer, is considered one of the top four on record in terms of strength. It has been balanced by another trend, the Indian Ocean dipole, in which warmer waters off Indonesia help bring moisture, and therefore rain, to Australia.

But the bureau said this had changed in the past eight weeks, with waters in the eastern Indian Ocean now 1C cooler than normal. The warmer waters are now found off Africa, bringing rain to countries such as Somalia.

“We’ve had these two systems competing against each other, but now the El Niño is being reinforced – the wetter influence is being overrun by the drying influence of El Niño,” said Andrew Watkins, climate predictions manager at the bureau.

“This means that the odds of a dry October are very strong, at a time that is very important for agriculture and also bushfires. We have already seen fires in Victoria, which don’t normally happen until summer, so that’s not a good sign.”

Hundreds of bushfires have broken out in Victoria over the past week. Two homes, two sheds and two vehicles were confirmed destroyed on Wednesday from a 4,000-hectare blaze near the town of Lancefield. The fire started from a planned burn-off, prompting an independent inquiry.

Melbourne had its warmest early October day on Tuesday, with temperatures reaching 35C. Sydney and Adelaide have also experienced a string of days over 30C before cooler conditions moved in.

The bushfire and natural hazards cooperative research centre has forecast a greater than normal risk of bushfires across much of south-east Australia this year, with climate change making fire seasons longer.

“While summer is usually the time associated with the highest bushfire risk in the southern states across Australia, bushfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer,” said Richard Thornton, the centre’s chief executive.

“We know from research on recent large fires that many people living in high-risk bushfire areas are still under-prepared and ill-informed on the dangers and the preparations needed.”

The bureau said waters in the eastern Indian Ocean should start to warm again in November, bringing a slightly better chance of rain in Australia in November and December.

“Our model suggests there will be more even odds in terms of dry conditions in November,” said Watkins. “But given the strength of El Niño, it would be difficult to bet on a wet end to the year. There will be average rainfall at best.”","Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c502340314b7b4e0188b290c84718a019c9d15/0_346_4658_2798/master/4658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e735008a2c2be638642fd54ee34d0e85,"['hotter', 'warmer', 'ready', 'niño', 'drier', 'burn', 'conditions', 'waters', 'bureau', 'bushfire', 'bushfires', 'gets', 'stronger', 'australia', 'victoria', 'el']",

2015-10-07

Madagascar is world famous. Mention the island, the planet’s fourth largest, and most people think of its astonishing biodiversity, its lemurs, or – especially – the eponymous animated films.

Few know anything about Madagascar’s droughts, its floods, its chronically malnourished population or its defunct health system. Few know that Madagascar is one of the least developed countries in the world, or that its humanitarian situation is one of the most severe.

This is hardly unusual. Poverty fatigue is real, and it can be hard to interest anyone outside the development community in the fates of poor African countries.

But even on this scale, Madagascar is an outlier. Even within the development community, Madagascar continues to be neglected.

In late September at a hotel in the capital, Antananarivo, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) gathered foreign journalists to discuss this problem. Their contention is that Madagascar is a ‘donor orphan’: a country that should be getting lots of development assistance, but isn’t. This is a source of frustration to many aid workers in Madagascar, who confide – off the record – that their head offices don’t always get it.

Madagascar is neglected by the development community

The scale of Madagascar’s humanitarian crisis is dramatic. According to UNICEF, the country’s 23 million inhabitants have the worst access to water and sanitation in the world. Nearly half of the rural population practise open defecation. Neonatal and maternal mortality rates are rising. It has the fourth worst chronic malnutrition situation in the world.

One in four children don’t go to school, with only a third of those who do completing primary. A harsh climate brings regular emergencies: there were devastating floods in one part of the country earlier this year, and an even more devastating ongoing drought in another, and the country is buffeted by regular cyclones (it is the fifth most cyclone-prone country in the world).

A near bankrupt central government means that there is little government response to these humanitarian issues. Despite this, international aid to Madagascar has actually decreased over the past few years, and shows no signs of picking up again. Several theories may explain this apparent neglect.

The first, and most compelling, is that its geographical location – as an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean – means it has little geostrategic interest for most donor countries. Madagascar is not on the fault lines of any major conflict; it is not an intersection on a major trade route; it is not home to vast reserves of oil. Moreover, the ocean prevents Malagasy problems from spilling over into neighbouring countries, because there are no neighbouring countries. The ocean insulates Madagascar from the rest of the world.

Madagascar is a 'donor orphan' - a country that should be getting lots of assistance, but isn't

The second is that Madagascar, again because of its unusual position and history, falls into too many different regional organisations. These include the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, the International Organisation of la Francophonie, and the Indian Ocean Commission. All of these take some, but not full responsibility for Madagascar – and often have different, and not necessarily complementary, approaches to dealing with the country.

Another theory is that the nature of Madagascar’s crisis does not lend itself to donor intervention. It is easier to justify funding in conflict situations, or in highly visible disasters like earthquakes or tsunamis, or for high-profile epidemics like Ebola or HIV/Aids. Madagascar’s problems tend to be less ‘sexy’.

Chronic malnutrition, which affects 47% of Malagasy children under five years old, is a largely invisible crisis, because the damage it inflicts is mostly inside the brain. This does not lend itself to heart-wrenching photographs. It is notable, in this context, that the highest-profile international engagement with Madagascar, the SADC mediation efforts, was designed to address the political crisis sparked by the 2009 coup – not the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis.

David Zounmenou, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Security Studies, points to another factor. ‘Geography or even linguistics might have something to do with the apparent neglect of humanitarian issues in Madagascar. However, we can add that, again, the country is a victim of “post-crisis neglect syndrome,” where international attention declines once there is an election to restore a semblance of normalcy in conflicts areas.’

Elections in 2013 ostensibly closed the chapter on four years of political crisis sparked by a coup in 2009, although new President Hery Rajaonarimampianina has done little to solve the humanitarian crisis. Many donors were also scared away by the crisis itself, or defeated by the sanctions imposed on Madagascar in the wake of the coup.

Madagascar’s status as ‘donor orphan’ also raises a more general question: how do donors differentiate between the various crisis-stricken countries competing for their attention? What goes into the value judgments that are made to determine who gets money and attention, and who doesn’t?

Violence is usually more newsworthy than slow-moving humanitarian disasters

Clues can be gleaned from another profession which makes similar judgments, often about the exact same situations: journalism. Various crises compete for attention on the front page, and foreign correspondents must work hard to convince their editors to set aside resources for travel. David Smith, Africa correspondent for The Guardian, told ISS Today that a combination of factors decides what he covers, and what he doesn’t.

Needless to say, Madagascar doesn’t often make the cut. The Guardian caters primarily for a British audience, and historical ties play an important role in content decisions. Zimbabwe, for instance, gets plenty of attention. Cost is important, so trips to out-of-the-way places like Madagascar are usually expensive to justify. The nature of the crisis also plays a role: like it or not, violence is usually more newsworthy than slow-moving humanitarian disasters.

In other words: not all crises are created equal. And, most importantly, the amount of attention a crisis receives is not merely a function of its severity. This has major implications for journalists, researchers and development professionals. It’s clear that headlines are not a reliable guide to the significance of either political or humanitarian crises, and nor is donor attention. To understand our world better – to distribute scarce attention and resources more equally – we need to look beyond these metrics.

Until then, the likes of the humanitarian crisis in Madagascar will continue to fly under the radar, with millions of people affected by its neglect.

12:55 p.m. Simon Belcher lay on his front beneath a black Range Rover, breathing deeply, wanting to unsee the pile of mangled bodies a few yards in front of him. He turned his head toward his wife, Amanda, who was hiding beneath a white 4x4 to his right. “I love you,” he mouthed silently before resting his head on the pavement. The bullet that had struck Simon a few moments earlier passed through his torso and right arm while shrapnel from an exploding gas canister had torn into his abdomen. An unexploded hand grenade lay nearby. The masked gunmen, two of them, with military webbing slung around their bony shoulders and AK-47 assault rifles in their hands, had disappeared. Inside the mall, Simon guessed. The blood from his wounds began to pool around him until it reached his ear, forming a seal. Suddenly, the muffled noises from within the five-story building were amplified, as if he had put a glass to a wall. Over the birdsong, car alarms, and ringing of the unanswered mobile phones of the dead and wounded, Simon could now hear gunshots, explosions, and screaming. On Saturday, Sept. 21, 2013, the Somali militant group al-Shabab carried out an assault on Kenya’s Westgate Mall in one of the worst terrorist attacks in the country’s history. A group of young gunmen stalked the halls and stores of the upscale Nairobi shopping center, and methodically murdered at least 67 people. News of the attack seized the world’s attention, dominating international media coverage for days. But much of that reporting was confused and contradictory, mirroring the litany of false and misleading statements made by Kenyan authorities. There were between 10 and 15 gunmen, the interior minister said. Two or three of them were Americans, said another cabinet minister. Together they took hostages, used heavy explosives, and pulled off a three-day siege, according to other government sources. Except none of these things were true. Far from a dramatic three-day standoff, the assault on the Westgate Mall lasted only a few hours, almost all of it taking place before Kenyan security forces even entered the building. When they finally did, it was only to shoot at one another before going on an armed looting spree that resulted in the collapse of the rear of the building, destroyed with a rocket-propelled grenade. And there were only four gunmen, all of whom were buried in the rubble, along with much of the forensic evidence. During the roughly three-and-a-half hours that the killers were loose in the mall, there was virtually no organized government response. But while Kenyan officials prevaricated, an unlikely coalition of licensed civilian gun owners and brave, resourceful individual police officers took it upon themselves to mount a rescue effort. Pieced together over 10 months from more than three dozen interviews with survivors, first responders, security officers, and investigators, the following account brings their story to life for the first time since the horrific terrorist attack occurred exactly two years ago. 9:00 a.m. The morning of Saturday, Sept. 21, was warm with a startlingly clear sky. Arnold Mwaighacho squeezed into a 12-seat minibus taxi for the half-hour commute from his home in the ramshackle town of Uthiru, on the outskirts of Nairobi, to his workplace in the city’s upmarket Westlands neighborhood. The flow of traffic was leisurely along the new multilane highway that skirted the sprawl of slums, connecting the city’s outlying workforce to its central commercial hubs. After exiting the minibus, Arnold walked the last few hundred yards along the pavement toward the imposing sand-yellow edifice of the Westgate Mall. The 22-year-old had been working as a waiter at Urban Gourmet Burgers since it opened earlier that year on the mall’s ground floor. Even after five months, the swankiest shopping center in the city had lost none of its capacity to impress. Not that Arnold could afford to, but it was possible to blow a small fortune on Nike trainers and Adidas tracksuits, iPhones and Samsung tablets, jewelry and watches, and designer clothes, both imported and local — all without leaving the confines of the building. Besides the burger joint where Arnold worked, there was a casino, a multiplex cinema, sushi and teppanyaki restaurants, a ceviche and tapas bar, and a café selling home-baked almond croissants and fresh-brewed Kenyan coffee. Young, confident, and good-looking, the Urban Burgers employees were mirror images of the clientele the restaurant hoped to attract. There was a calculated trendiness about the place. Waiters wore jeans and black T-shirts. The menu was written on a wall-to-wall blackboard above the brushed metal and black matte counter. Spotlights hung from a section of scaffolding, and the sound system played the latest R&B-inflected pop. The décor was industrial, and the paintwork was done by a star of the local graffiti scene. It wasn’t cheap — burgers sold for between $8 and $9 — but it was popular with a mix of foreign tourists, expats, well-to-do Kenyans, and teenaged mallrats. Arnold liked the place: The people were good; the tips were good; it was all good. Arriving at 9:00 a.m., Arnold joined colleagues who had become friends to prep the restaurant for the busiest day of the week. The first customers stepped through the glass door into Urban Burgers almost as soon as it opened at noon. The choice tables were on the terrace outside, a perfect people-watching spot next to the mall’s main entrance. Within 20 minutes, there were four groups of customers outside ordering drinks and burgers. Inside the mall at the Dormans coffee kiosk, Michael Kariuki rushed from table to table hustling for tips. He had landed his job as a barista and waiter just three weeks earlier. Nestled in the atrium on the ground floor, Dormans was in a prime location for catching shoppers as they walked from the mall’s main entrance toward the popular Nakumatt supermarket. Michael had arrived late for the morning shift, getting in just before 7:00 a.m. No matter: It was an unusually slow start that Saturday morning, and the 25-year-old settled in to help clean up the espresso machine and set tables for the day.

By noon, business had picked up. Michael was nearing the end of his shift, and he was keen to leave on time so that he could meet up with some friends to watch the “Safari Sevens” international rugby tournament that afternoon. Outside, taxis dropped shoppers off at the main pedestrian entrance on Mwanzi Road, where a flight of steps ran between Urban Burgers and the Tapas Ceviche Bar up toward two sets of double-height glass doors and, beyond them, the mall’s soaring atrium. A little further down the road was the vehicle entrance. At the security barrier outside, car trunks and doors snapped open, and cars were given cursory inspections before passing the automatic security booms on their way to underground or rooftop parking lots. There were fewer spaces than usual on the roof that Saturday because of a children’s cookery competition that had set up along one side of the parking lot with tents, tables, gas hobs, and a small crowd of children and parents. A lime-green Mercedes pulled into the right-hand lane, where it stopped before the barrier with Ben Mulwa, a 32-year-old businessman, in the passenger seat. His friend, the driver, popped open the trunk for the security check. Inside on the 2nd floor of the mall, Katherine Walton, a 38-year-old American, had finished an early lunch of pizza and fried chicken in the food court with her five children, aged between 13 months and 14. She had given her two oldest kids, Blaise and Ian, some cash and sent them down to Nakumatt to pick up a few groceries. Nakumatt is Kenya’s answer to Wal-Mart. Its flagship outlet, spread over two levels at the back of the Westgate Mall, brought in more than $60 million a year in sales of everything from groceries and alcohol to sofa sets and children’s toys. As was usual for a Saturday morning, it was heaving with customers. Fred Aluhondo, an electrical technician working in Nakumatt’s lighting concession, had arrived before 8:00 a.m. The 36-year-old’s work that morning was complicated by a series of power cuts that came more frequently and lasted longer than normal. He began to wonder whether there was a problem with the store’s backup generator. When he heard a muffled bang just before 12:30 p.m., Fred assumed his fears had been realized: The generator must have blown.

12:25 p.m. A silver Mitsubishi Lancer cruised along Mwanzi Road. When it stopped close to the mall’s main entrance, four men got out, their faces wrapped in black scarves, shoulder bags and ammo pouches slung around their bodies, and assault rifles in their hands. They threw two hand grenades onto the terraces along the front of the mall and started shooting. Arnold was attending to customers on the terrace of the burger restaurant, leaning against the railing with his back to the road. He turned toward the noise as the second grenade exploded close by. He felt something hit him hard in the chest and head, knocking him flat on the ground. Just before he blacked out, he heard someone shout, “Allahu akbar!” Standing nearby, Irene Mwelu, another waitress, felt something whizz past her head and then heard a crack as the glass door behind her shattered. She scrambled inside. The blast that knocked Arnold to the floor did not reach Faith Muiva, who was also stationed on the restaurant’s terrace. She glimpsed two men with masked faces strafing the mall with their AK-47s before she bolted inside. Almost at once, Faith crashed to the ground clutching her leg, where she had been shot. Kennedy Mungai, a slight 21-year-old barista who was manning the counter, saw Irene race in from the terrace and Faith tumble after her. At the restaurant’s entrance, more people were falling over one another as they surged into the mall’s atrium. Irene and another girl, Ruth Macharia, rushed to join them while Faith, bleeding, dragged herself across the floor toward Kennedy. They hid behind the counter and waited. The four gunmen moved quickly, splitting into pairs. One pair made for the main pedestrian entrance, while the other continued along the front of the building toward the vehicle entrance. In the queue of cars waiting to enter the car park, Ben realized his lime-green Mercedes was boxed in, with the barrier in front and more cars behind. The shooting was getting louder, closer. He leapt from the car and made for a flowerbed by a low wall to his left. Two gunmen appeared. One fired a burst of shots into the security cubicle, killing the guard inside and then turning toward Ben and another guard, who was crouched slightly in front of him. The man fired. The first bullet hit the guard in the head, spinning him onto the concrete and splashing Ben with blood. The second shot struck the ground, splintering shards of stone into Ben’s knee. He fell over and lay still, praying. The two gunmen didn’t stop to check who was dead. They fired as they walked, hitting people in their vehicles driving out of the basement car park. They continued up the ramp toward the rooftop. The initial explosions and gunfire triggered pandemonium inside the mall. Sandeep Wadhwa, a 46-year-old fruit and vegetable supplier who provided food for the rooftop cookery competition, had stepped into the elevator on the ground floor a moment before the attack began. The glass doors slid closed on a mundane cacophony of voices and piped music. They opened again on the second floor to the sound of shooting and screams.

Looking over the balustrade and down into the atrium, Sandeep saw people running. He dropped his shopping and joined others rushing for the exit. “Move out! Move out! We’re under attack!” he shouted as he raced for the door. Sandeep made straight for the children’s cookery competition, shouting at people to run. One of the organizers told him to calm down, saying it was probably just a robbery and would be over soon. “You fucking shit!” Sandeep shouted back. “This is a bloody terrorist attack! Switch off the gas burners, we’re under attack.” Simon and Amanda Belcher had arrived at the rooftop parking lot a few minutes earlier. They were at a security checkpoint at the upper pedestrian entrance when a panicked mass of people forced them back. There were more explosions and rapid gunfire. This is no robbery, Amanda thought. She turned to Simon: “We need to get the fuck out of here.” Hand-in-hand, they ran toward the edge of the car park and leaned over the parapet wall to see if there was a clear way out. Instead, they saw two men with guns and black scarves obscuring their faces striding up the ramp. One of them pointed at Simon and Amanda. The couple ran as far as they could, to the furthest corner of the car park, and threw themselves underneath a pair of SUVs that were parked next to each other. Seeing the gunmen reach the upper car park, Sandeep, too, realized it was too late to do anything but hide. He lay on the ground inside one of the cooking gazebos with his head beneath a tablecloth. Whatever was going to happen next, he didn’t want to see it.

The gunmen stalked across the upper car park, heading for the mall’s entrance. Then they stopped, turning toward the tents that were set up for the cookery competition and the dozens of people, many of them women and children, huddled in the corner nearby. One tossed a hand grenade in their direction, then ducked behind a car. There was a deafening explosion and, in the ear-ringing silence that followed, the cries of injured children, their parents, and grandparents. The grenade spat shrapnel through the body of the man lying next to Sandeep, who felt something like a punch hit his own lower back. Reaching around, he found blood on his fingers. He played dead as the gunmen moved closer. A second hand grenade flung toward the knot of people did not explode. The shooting on the rooftop was deliberate. Bullets were not sprayed. They were placed: bang… bang… bang. Then a pause. Then a voice: “In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We’ve come to kill you Christians and Kenyans for what you are doing in Somalia."" The story of the Westgate Mall attack begins in Somalia, Kenya’s neighbor to the northeast, which has been embroiled in an anarchic civil war for more than two decades. In 1991, a coalition of clan warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre. Soon afterward, conflict and drought provoked a famine that in turn triggered a U.S.-backed U.N. aid and peacekeeping mission. It turned into a disastrous manhunt as American Marines tracked down Gen. Mohammed Farah Aideed, a notorious militia leader accused of killing peacekeepers and stealing aid. On Oct. 3, 1993, two U.S. helicopters were shot down and 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in what Somalis call the Battle of Mogadishu and which is depicted in Mark Bowden's 1999 book, Black Hawk Down, and the 2001 film of the same name. By 1995, the United States and the United Nations had withdrawn, Aideed had won, and, for the next decade, the warlords ruled. Militant Islam in Somalia dates back to at least the 1980s, but it came of age in 2006, when a grassroots movement called the Islamic Courts Union took control of the country, ousting the warlords. After years of conflict, hunger, and violent death, Somalis welcomed the ICU. But in the post-9/11 world, Washington did not. Fearing another Taliban, the United States encouraged and supported an invasion by neighboring Ethiopia, and in late 2006 East Africa’s most powerful military rolled across Somalia from the west all the way to the capital, Mogadishu, on the Indian Ocean. The ICU was shattered, but one of its most radical factions, known as al-Shabab, transformed itself into an Islamic nationalist insurgency, fighting first the Ethiopians and then the African Union force that replaced them. Al-Shabab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who took over in 2008, moved the group closer to al Qaeda, attracting foreign jihadis and deploying suicide bombers for the first time in Somalia’s history. Godane’s vision was internationalist. In 2010, he sent suicide bombers to Uganda, where they killed 74 people in coordinated attacks on a restaurant and a rugby club where people were watching the soccer World Cup. Al-Shabab reached its zenith that year, controlling most of southern Somalia and much of the capital. The transitional Somali government was besieged, relying entirely on foreign troops for its control of just a few blocks of Mogadishu. Mortars would land regularly in the hilltop government compound; improvised explosive devices killed government officials and passersby; gun battles were daily and deadly, kidnappings commonplace. Mogadishu earned its reputation as the most dangerous city on earth. In a harbinger of the Islamic State’s ambitions, al-Shabab administered territory, provided services, and levied taxes — none of which the Western-backed Somali government could manage. In 2011, Kenya sent troops into Somalia to create a buffer zone between the two countries after a series of kidnappings of aid workers and tourists that Nairobi blamed on al-Shabab. The threat of retaliation against Kenya’s “foreign crusaders” was almost immediate, and the blowback has since grown in scale and ambition. At first, al-Shabab sympathizers dropped grenades at down-at-heel bars or bus stops, injuring handfuls of people. Then came bigger, more complex IED attacks and foiled plots to bomb tourist hotels on the Kenyan coast. For many Kenyans, it was a question of when — not if — there would be a big attack on one of Nairobi’s malls, which stand as symbols of the country’s secular vision for a consumerist middle-class future — the very antithesis of an Islamic jihadi worldview. When the assault on the Westgate Mall happened, it was shocking — but not surprising. Kenyan, U.S., British, and Israeli intelligence all missed any signs of the plan, which involved just a small number of people. All it took was four young men with a willingness to die, four assault rifles, and a handful of grenades: low-tech, low-cost, low-profile, and hard to stop. Even now, little is known about the four Westgate gunmen. The only one so far conclusively identified was 23-year-old Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, born in Somalia and brought up as a refugee in Norway. Norwegian security forces confirmed his identity only this month, scotching rumors that he may have escaped the mall. The other three were also believed to be young Somalis: Ahmed Hassan Abukar, Mohammed Abdinur Said, and Yahya Ahmed Osman grew up in a country that existed in name only, wracked by war and routine violence, where al-Shabab offered an alternative to the venality of warlords and predations of foreign armies. 12:40 p.m. Standing in the corner of the rooftop car park, Ahmed Hassan Abukar, a.k.a. Khattab al-Kene, surveyed the dead, the wounded, and the terrified. “If there is any Muslim here, they can go,” he said. “I can see you have women and children.” “Yes! We have children,” answered Kamal Kaur, a radio DJ and an organizer of the cookery competition, who was crouched on the ground with her young son and daughter. “You did not spare our women and children. Why should we spare yours?” Kene answered. Then he and his partner, Mohammed Abdinur Said, a.k.a. Umayr al-Mogadish, opened fire. Lying just inches from the killers’ feet, Amanda Belcher was surprised at how clear, steady, and confident Kene’s voice sounded. Not like a fanatic at all. No different, she thought, than if he were a greeter welcoming shoppers to the mall.

The two shooters opened fire again. A bullet grazed the head of Seema Manji, the wife of another radio DJ called Aleem, who was also struck by shrapnel. Blood poured from Seema’s wound onto her baby daughter, whom she cradled in her arms. Aleem knew that if he did not act now he would not get another chance. He stood up, his left eye bloodied and swollen shut, and approached the gunmen as he recited the Shahada, the Islamic creed, which he knew despite being Hindu: “There is no god but God and Mohammed is His prophet,” Aleem said in English. “Are you Muslim?” asked one of the gunmen. “Yes, yes I am,” said Aleem. “Is this your woman?” “Yes, she is.” “Ask her to cover up,” he said. Then pointing with the barrel of his gun, he said, “Leave.” And they did, clutching one another and scurrying toward the exit ramp. Elaine Dang, a 26-year-old American who was a judge in the cookery competition, was surprised. She was too far away to hear what Aleem had said, but he was a friend and she knew that he was Hindu. She thought, “If he’s walking away, then I have hope.” Another woman stood up, raising her hand. She also asked to leave. The gunmen asked her a question about the Islamic faith. When she failed to answer correctly, one shot her dead. Another man stood, begging for the women and children to be spared. He, too, was shot. Elaine kept her head down, using her yoga breathing exercises to stay calm, wondering how she would get out of this alive. The shooting started up again, and hiding beneath the car, Simon was hit. Sandeep tried to crawl to safety as bullets skimmed over his head. One of the shots broke a gas pipe and set the propane alight, scorching his right arm. He stifled a cry of pain. Another volley of bullets hit a cooking gas cylinder, which exploded. Even the gunmen seemed surprised by the blast, and Elaine used the distraction to scurry under a table. She was bleeding from a shrapnel wound to her right thigh, and a chunk of her right arm, just below the elbow, was missing. Still bleeding beneath the car, Simon watched in horror as a couple and their child tried to run and all three were shot down, crumpling to the ground in front of him. There was more shooting as the gunmen moved around the rooftop, picking out targets and firing. Then suddenly it stopped. Less than 30 minutes after they had come onto the roof, the two attackers made their way into the mall, leaving behind them bloodied corpses, empty bullet casings, and an eerie quiet that was soon broken by the crying and moaning of the injured and traumatized. Minutes passed, and the gunmen did not return. Slowly, people who could move began to crawl out from their hiding places under or behind cars, or to drag themselves away from the heaped bodies in the corner. The two other gunmen, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a.k.a. Abu Baara al-Sudani, and Yahya Ahmed Osman, a.k.a. Omar Abdul Rahim Nabhan, were unleashing similar carnage inside the mall after walking in through the main entrance on Mwanzi Road. Both men paused to reload their weapons before entering the mall. Each had fired a full 30-round magazine in just the first few minutes of the attack. Sudani, in a loose black jacket and white trousers, fired through the open door of Urban Burgers and then walked in. Faith, Kennedy, and another colleague, Anne, were hiding behind the counter. Seeing Sudani walk in, Anne gasped, drawing the gunman’s attention. He shot, and she collapsed with a cry and a sigh on top of Faith who was hunched up out of view. Then he turned to a white couple laying on the floor clutching each other in front of the counter, where they were afforded some protection from the initial shooting on the road but none from the door where the gunmen now stood.

“Fucking Americans!” Sudani said in English. Then he shot them both with bursts of fire from his rifle. Neither was American: Australian architect Ross Langdon, 32, and his pregnant partner Elif Yavuz, a 33-year-old Dutch malaria specialist who was due to give birth two weeks later, were both hit multiple times and died. Ross’s body came to rest on top of Elif’s in a last, futile attempt to protect her. Niall Saville, a 35-year-old British development economist, and his South Korean wife, Moon Hee Kang, were also shot repeatedly at close range and left bleeding on the floor. Outside on the terrace, Arnold came to. His right eye was swollen shut, and he was bleeding from the chest. He heard the gunfire and saw the upturned tables, chairs, and broken glass. Two customers lay by the door, wounded and moaning. Arnold smeared blood across his face and played dead. He prayed and concentrated on the Justin Timberlake song “Mirrors,” which looped over and over again on the restaurant’s sound system. While Sudani was in Urban Burgers, Nabhan walked to the door of Little Soles, a children’s shoe shop just opposite the burger joint. Nancy Kadesa, the 25-year-old cashier, was hiding in a small storage area behind a louvered door at the back of the shop. Her colleague lay flat on the floor by the till. There were three customers in the shop, including a white man. Nancy peeked through the slats in the door as Nabhan, standing in the shop entrance, fired a volley of six bullets into the white man. One round smashed through the door Nancy was hiding behind, inches from her head. She slid to the floor and shut her eyes.

1:00 p.m. The mall had only five exits: the basement car park, the rooftop car park, the main pedestrian entrance, an emergency exit in the back corner (of the mall’s six emergency stairwells only one led directly to the outside), and a delivery area for the Nakumatt supermarket. The four gunmen controlled two of them, and no one inside or outside knew how many more terrorists there were. Hundreds of people had found their way to the Nakumatt service entrance, either through the store or via the nearby emergency exit, and were rushing onto the street outside. Satpal Singh, a turbaned 38-year-old Sikh, directed terrified shoppers and diners from the upstairs food court into a large bookshop that occupied most of one side of the mall directly beneath the cinema. Others made for the Millionaires Casino, a beauty salon, and other shops on the second floor. Doors were shut and locked, and people huddled at the back of the shops, hoping they would not be seen. Dozens of people crowded into a storeroom at the Java House coffee shop, blocking the door with a refrigerator. In the bookstore, security guards pulled down the rolling shutter, and Satpal told the 30 or so people inside to put their phones on silent. As the gunfire increased in volume and frequency, both outside in the car park and downstairs on the ground floor, the group made its way up the escalator from the bookshop to the cinema above. From there, Satpal could see into the mall through the large upper windows as Mogadish and Kene, black scarves around their heads, strode around the upper floor. They seemed as interested in gazing around the mall’s shiny interior — almost with a sense of wonder — as they were in searching for targets to shoot. Downstairs on the ground floor, the other two terrorists were also hunting for people to kill. Faith Wambua and her two children, aged 21 months and 9, were playing dead. They had been at the main entrance when the attack started and were part of the initial surge of dozens of panicked people who tumbled into the mall. Faith scooped her toddler son, Ty, into her arms and took her daughter, Sy, by the arm. They ran toward the Dormans café in front of Nakumatt and lay down on the ground between the counter and a railing. Michael, the waiter and barista, was on the other side of the counter. He saw a running man fall to the ground in front of him. “I’ve been shot,” the man said in surprise as Michael hauled him onto his feet. They staggered into Nakumatt together. Faith wanted to follow, but knew that with her two children she would move slowly and be a big target. She stayed where she was. Faith could see a young woman in a black T-shirt and black jeans — the Urban Burgers uniform — crouching behind a pillar and talking on her phone. Faith’s phone started ringing. She shut off the call, switched her phone to silent, and then rang back. It was her domestic helper: “This is Faith. We are at Westgate. We’re being shot at. We’re dying,” she said. Then she ended the call. Faith kept eye contact with the woman from Urban Burgers. It was Ruth. Faith tried to signal to her, asking, “What’s going on?” “What can you see?” Ruth signaled back with upturned palms, raised eyebrows, and an open mouth: “I don’t know.” A man’s voice called out, “Mama! Mama!” Faith did not answer, but turned her head slightly to look. She saw light-colored trousers and a black jacket: It was the terrorist, Sudani. Faith heard him talk to Ruth for a moment and then heard two shots, deafening and heartbreaking. Ruth was flung against the pillar by the close-range fire. An empty shell casing spun out of Sudani’s rifle and skittered across the floor, coming to rest a few inches from Faith and her children.

Terrified, Faith pressed Sy and Ty to the ground. She had been praying for deliverance, but now she amended her prayer: “Jehovah, please remember us in the resurrection,” she whispered. Just a few yards away, Katherine crouched with her three young daughters. When the shooting started, Katherine had been waiting for her two sons outside Nakumatt. In the brief moment between the first explosions and the panicked dash for safety, she had time to think, “This cannot be happening!” Katherine seized her daughters’ hands and bolted left. The first potential hiding place they came upon was a cardboard promotional stand for a new tablet computer. Katherine pushed her two older daughters inside and then crawled in herself with her youngest, Petra, in a sling. The cardboard stand provided cover, but no protection at all. The initial chaos and pandemonium was followed by an eerie quiet, punctuated by deafening gunshots that echoed through the mall. Then came footsteps: slow, almost casual, Katherine thought. Nabhan passed Faith and her children. He passed the body of a man, shot in the head outside Barclays bank, and turned left toward Nakumatt. His stride was nonchalant. He looked around, like the gunmen upstairs, more curious than wary. Katherine was bewildered. It seemed as if the killer was out for a stroll, casually ambling around the emptied mall. He was just yards away, but did not see them huddled in the tablet stand. Instead, he fired three rounds from the hip into prone bodies lying in the open. Nabhan was joined by Sudani, and together they entered Nakumatt, the largest and busiest shop in the mall, with hundreds of terrified shoppers and workers cowering inside. Michael had helped the injured man reach the rear of Nakumatt, where there was a door to the delivery area in the refrigerated section just beyond the meat counter. He laid the man down on the ground among scores of other people, some wounded, most simply terrified. The man was bleeding and thirsty, so Michael went back into the shop to get water. He was running low between the aisles, bent over at the waist, when he felt a stab of heat and pain in his left buttock that spun him to the ground. Realizing he had been shot and that the gunmen were now inside the superstore, Michael scrambled back to his feet. But a moment later, more shots struck him. One bullet passed clean through his right arm, tearing the flesh but missing the bone. Another struck his left elbow. Michael stumbled to the back of the shop, slipping in his own blood. The gunmen didn’t give chase. Instead, they walked over to the meat counter, where many people, including 35-year-old Amber Prior and her two children, were hiding behind the refrigerated display counter.* “I can see him, I can see him,” a young Kenyan girl whispered as one of the gunmen approached. Amber didn’t believe anyone would shoot into a mass of huddled women and children. Until they did. The shots were aimed and fired deliberately. Amber lay partly on top of her 6-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son to shield them. She felt a bullet thump into her left thigh but stayed still. After seconds that felt endless, the shooting stopped and the footsteps moved away. Their killing spree at the rooftop cookery competition over, Kene and Mogadish took the escalator down to the first and then the ground floor. Then they also entered Nakumatt. Kene found a man hiding beneath a statue of an elephant — the shop’s emblem — by the entrance. He barely broke pace as he passed, raising his rifle and shooting the man in the gut. By 1:15 p.m., 45 minutes after the attack started, all four gunmen were together in the superstore. There had been no security response. The only resistance they had met was from a policeman guarding a bank on the first floor who had fired, wounding Sudani in the lower right leg, leaving him limping. A boy lay next to Amber on the blood-slicked floor, behind the meat counter. He was wounded and whimpering, his dead mother and sister next to him. Amber squeezed his hand urging him not to cry out. “Hold my hand, close your eyes, and pretend to be dead,” she said. She sent a text message to her husband: “I’ve been shot.” The minutes ticked by. Moans fell silent as the injured succumbed to their wounds. Then came the footsteps again. This time there was a voice too, speaking in clear English with a light Somali accent. Security footage shows Amber Prior and her two children. One of the four gunmen walks a civilian out of the Nakumatt supermarket. “If there’s any children alive here, we’ll let them go. We won’t hurt them,” said Kene. Amber got to her feet and begged him to let her children leave. “We are not monsters,” he replied. “We just want people to understand that they can’t come to our homes and kill us. We will do the same to them.” Then he added: “I want you to forgive us.” Kene asked where Amber was from. “France,” she replied. He said they were only interested in Kenyans and Americans. Kene let Amber and her two children leave. He also allowed the injured boy to be wheeled out in a shopping trolley and another wounded girl to follow behind. As they passed the snacks section, Amber’s son told Kene he was “a bad man” and should have let everyone go free. Kene gave him and his sister two Mars bars each and ushered them out of the store. Upstairs on the first floor of Nakumatt, Fred, the electrical technician, had shepherded more than 70 people into the storeroom in the minutes after the gunfire started. Elsewhere on the upper floor, customers and shop workers hid beneath furniture or barricaded themselves into glass-walled sport and footwear concessions. Fred pushed boxes up against the double-swing door linking the shop to the storeroom, leaving just enough space so that he could peer through the small glass window. He crossed the large room, filled with shelves loaded with boxes and goods, and pulled down the sliding shutter door that led to Nakumatt’s service corridors, office, and kitchen. He slipped the padlock in place and then returned to the swing door to stand guard. On the ground floor, the four gunmen were roaming about looking for targets. Sisters Annie Gichanga, 31, and Sharon Nderitu, 33, were hiding with dozens of others among the aisles at the back of Nakumatt. Every few minutes there were more gunshots. With each bang, Annie, who was four months pregnant, repeated Psalm 27: “The Lord is my light and salvation, whom shall I fear?” Crouching beside her, Sharon swore: “Fuck, fuck!” As they hid, the power went out, cutting the lights and music. It would flicker on again sporadically, but in between all they could hear was silence, footsteps, and gunshots. The footsteps came close, slow and deliberate. Through the gloom, Sharon could see part of a torso, an arm, and a gun. A voice spoke softly in Swahili: “They’ve gone. It’s OK, you can come out.” There was shuffling a few yards away in the next aisle across, a volley of gunfire, and silence. 1:15 p.m. Westgate is not the kind of place a Kenyan career police officer hangs out. Cpl. Nura Ali of the Nairobi Flying Squad was following his usual routine: cruising the streets with his crew, waiting for trouble to call. After 25 years in the police force, Nura was relaxed and confident as he sat in the front passenger seat with his walky-talky in his hand, a Ceska 9mm pistol in his lap, and an AK-47 assault rifle beside him. The rifle held a 30-round clip, the pistol a 15-shot magazine, and he carried a spare in the pocket of his loose-fitting slacks. His nondescript saloon car wasn’t in great condition, so, with no emergency calls coming in, he had his driver take them to a roadside mechanic to fix a loose wheel. Nura and his two colleagues were having an early lunch of beef stew with chapati while the mechanic worked nearby when a call came through on the radio. “All units: Shooting going on at Westgate. Robbers inside.” Nura spoke on the phone to his commanding officer, who told him to get to the mall “and do whatever is necessary to handle it.” Nura left his plate of food on the table and jumped into the car. He was excited, eager even. As the unmarked squad car sped up the road, Nura hung out the window, waving his radio and shouting at drivers to move out of the way. News of the assault was beginning to spread via frantic phones calls, texts, and WhatsApp messages. Westgate is in the heart of a Kenyan-Indian part of the city, and the close-knit community there knew better than to rely on the authorities to send help. Instead, the call went out to the community’s own licensed gun holders, who were organized into self-appointed armed neighborhood watch units.

Harish Patel, a member of an outfit calling itself the Krisna Squad, was returning home from a morning spent volunteering at the nearby Hindu crematorium when he received a distress call: There was a robbery at the Nakumatt store in Westgate, with shooting going on. A couple of minutes later, the 43-year-old was within sight of the mall. He patted the pistol he wore on his hip and grabbed the spare magazine he kept in his car. On the western side of town, Abdul Haji was in a business meeting at the Yaya Centre, another Nairobi shopping mall. The 38-year-old bitumen trader was sipping an Americano when his white iPhone chirruped. It was a text message from his brother: “Trapped in Westgate. Terrorist attack. Pray for me.” Abdul abandoned the business meeting and rushed to his silver SUV in the basement. As he sped toward Westgate, swerving around cars and over sidewalks to cut through the traffic, he ran through a mental checklist: He had his gun, as always, a Ceska 9mm, but no spare magazine and no body armor. He reached Westgate minutes after Nura and Harish. As Nura approached the mall, he saw cars stopped on the road at wonky angles, some with their engines running, some with bullet holes in the windows, and some with bloodied bodies hanging out of doors or slumped against seats. Another body was splayed out across the stairs at the mall’s entrance. Not far away, a group of armed police stood, “like a flock of sheep, doing nothing,” Nura thought. He dashed and crouched, ducking behind vehicles, reaching the main mall entrance at the same time as Amber emerged from within, her two children and two others in tow.

Abdul and Harish got off to a bad start. It was quickly clear to those outside the mall that this was a terrorist attack and there was little doubt that al-Shabab was responsible: The group had threatened Kenya’s capital and carried out a series of small-scale attacks in different parts of the country, and Nairobi residents knew the city’s malls with their wealth and crowds were obvious targets. When Abdul, an ethnic-Somali Kenyan who is Muslim, arrived carrying a pistol, Harish got in his face, shouting. Abdul pulled out his gun license ID and calmed Harish down. Nura was the first to go up the ramp toward the rooftop car park, spurred on by shame at the cowardice of his police colleagues rather than the desire to be a hero. The carnage in the car park was horrifying. There was a mess of bodies in the corner, more scattered beneath the open-sided marquees, and still others poked out from beneath and between cars. Nura thought he was spearheading a rescue mission, but all he could see were bodies and blood. It looked like a slaughterhouse. Nura noticed some movement and stopped, suddenly realizing how he must appear: an ethic-Somali man in civilian clothes, clutching an AK-47. “I am the police,” he shouted in English. “I’m the good guy!” The first Kenya Red Cross medics had followed Nura up the ramp. They began doing triage, finding the wounded among the dead and providing emergency first aid. Simon was pulled out from under the car and put in an ambulance with Amanda, who was unhurt. Hundreds of people were escaping through the mall’s downstairs emergency exit, and Elaine and Sandeep, both of whom had been at the cookery competition, joined the exodus from the rooftop through a stairwell at the corner of the building. Out on the street, journalists had begun to gather. Both Elaine and Sandeep were photographed, staggering and bloodied, from the mall. The crowd outside Westgate was growing, but with no sign of any official or organized security response. Instead, an ad hoc volunteer rescue mission had begun to take shape, comprising a motley crew of uniformed, plainclothes, and off-duty police and licensed civilian gun holders. From the rooftop car park, they could hear shooting inside and could tell it was not coming from the mall’s upper levels. Nura led the way with Abdul and Harish and two plainclothes armed officers: two Muslims, a Hindu, and two Christians. All Kenyans. They moved cautiously around the upper floor, checking for gunmen. It was slow, nerve-wracking work. Abdul, Harish, and Nura found groups of people hiding in every shop and behind every shut and locked door. They ushered them out to the car park, where an evacuation effort was taking shape. Dozens of people at a time were being led down the ramp, distraught and running, escorted by police to the ambulances that had begun to arrive. Realizing that the shooting was coming from downstairs, the five men formed a vanguard and took the stairs to the first floor. Progress was slow as they moved cautiously, unsure of where the gunmen were, checking shops and banks and lavatories for hiding people. They found dozens everywhere they looked and encouraged them to hurry upstairs to the roof and out.

3:00 p.m. By the time they reached the ground level, it was mid-afternoon and they came under direct fire for the first time. Nura was hit. A bullet entered his back an inch from his spine, then ricocheted off the pistol tucked in his waistband and tore back through his intestines. Hiding behind a pillar, Nura slumped to the ground, clutching his stomach and watching his blood pour out. He blacked out momentarily and awoke to rainfall. As his confusion lifted, Nura realized that the raindrops were bullets glancing off the floor all around him. He tried to stand and was hit twice more in his upper thigh, the bullets tearing a fist-sized hole in his right leg. Nura dragged himself out of the line of fire and into the Artcaffe restaurant. As he prayed to Allah in preparation for death, Nura felt hands helping him up and carrying him out of the restaurant into the daylight outside. Abdul was crouched behind an ice-cream kiosk, trying to work out where the shots were coming from. He reckoned he had found a blind spot along a wall adjacent to the Nakumatt entrance, and during a lull in the shooting, he dashed toward it. With his back to the wall, he saw Katherine crouched beneath the flimsy cardboard stand, directly in the crossfire. Since the moment the attack began, Katherine had been huddled beneath the promotional table with her three daughters and three other women. Portia, 4, lay flat and still with her hands over her ears, while Gigi, 2, balled up with her head tucked in like a tortoise retreating into its shell. Thirteen-month-old Petra dozed, sucked on her pacifier, or sipped from a 4-ounce milk bottle Katherine had with her. The mall’s music system kept on playing throughout, interspersed with the shooting. “Where’s the SWAT team?” Katherine kept wondering as the hours ticked by. “Why isn’t somebody coming in here? They should be storming the place and getting us out.” When somebody did come at last, it was one man with a handgun.

Abdul rushed back to tell Harish and the others to stop firing in case they hit her and to get some tear gas canisters to force the terrorists back from their firing position, just inside Nakumatt, while they attempt a rescue. As he turned back, Abdul saw one of the gunmen for the first time. Slim and young with a black scarf covering his face, the man lowered his rifle and gestured with an outstretched left arm. “Kuja, kuja,” he said in Kenyan Swahili. (“Come, come.”) The terrorist was taunting Abdul. That pissed him off: There were dead people everywhere, and other lives, including his own, were at risk, and here was this young killer acting like it was all a joke. But before Abdul could shoot, the terrorist disappeared from view.

Determined to get Katherine out of the crossfire, Abdul sprinted from the pillar to a pharmacy close to Nakumatt and barged in through the glass door. As in every other shop, there was a huddle of frightened people at the back. From the door to the pharmacy, Abdul and Katherine were just a few quick strides apart. He mouthed to her his plan: He would toss a tear gas canister toward the Nakumatt entrance, and then she must run to him. “I can’t. I’ve got three babies with me,” she said. There was a burst of gunfire, an explosion of tear gas, and everyone bolted. First came one of the women hiding with Katherine, clutching 13-month-old Petra. Then it was 4-year-old Portia’s turn. The image of the little girl running toward Abdul was captured by Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic, who had entered the mall. Katherine, with 2-year-old Gigi, was the last to go. Once safely inside the pharmacy, mother and daughters were ushered along the wall to the ATM machines, where there was an emergency exit. It was just before 4:00 p.m., and they were out. Later, they were reunited with Blaise and Ian, who had escaped through the Nakumatt service exit. Abdul circled back around the atrium toward the front of the building. He was on edge. Thirsty and exhausted, his eyes were stinging from the tear gas. Thinking he might find some water to drink and to wash his face, Abdul stepped inside the Urban Burgers restaurant. It was like the rooftop all over again: blood and bodies everywhere. Abdul saw a glass of water on the counter and drained it. Then he splashed water from the sink on his face. He gazed in disbelief at the charnel house the restaurant had become and then noticed someone looking back at him. Niall, the British development economist, was badly wounded but alive. His wife, Moon Hee, had bled to death beside him in the hours after Sudani sprayed the restaurant with bullets. Outside the mall, Red Cross workers and uniformed officers were too afraid to enter, so Abdul walked out and beckoned them in. Once they started lifting out the wounded, more appeared. Hearing Swahili voices and no gunfire, Faith Muiva, who had hidden next to her dead friend Anne, and Arnold, playing dead on the terrace, both got up and staggered forward. In the rear of Nakumatt, on the store’s second level, Fred worked with other colleagues to safely evacuate the scores of shoppers sheltering in the storeroom. They, too, fled around the side of the mall from the service entrance. Nancy, the shoe-shop sales assistant, had climbed into the crawl space above Little Soles. She lay there for hours waiting to be rescued, listening to the labored breathing of her wounded colleague and customers below. She wanted to help, but was too scared to move. After an hour or so, the breathing grew fainter and then stopped. It wasn’t until around 4:00 p.m. that Nancy found the courage to leave the shop, climbing down from the roof and trying not to look as she stepped over the bodies and dashed for the exit.

25,25,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Thirsty Lima Uses Robust Planning to Address Its Future Water Needs - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/05/thirsty-lima-uses-robust-planning-to-address-its-future-water-needs,"When residents tell tourists that it never rains in Lima, they are a mere .3 inches from the truth. One third of an inch of rain (about 6 mm), or a drop in the bucket, is the annual rainfall. Drought and El Niño conditions have long been a backdrop to everyday life in this city of nearly 10 million where the Andes meets desert and the land spills into the Pacific Ocean.

More than 1.5 million residents are underserved: They live without running water and with chronic shortages, often waiting for delivery trucks. Villa El Salvador, for example, began as a shantytown on the outskirts of Lima in 1970, and has been growing in colorful tenements up the eroded foothills ever since. But water there is still a luxury.

“Climate change is hitting hard and the future of water for Lima is in doubt,” said Carter Brandon, lead economist with the World Bank. “We don’t actually know what the climate impact is going to be. Or the city’s future growth either.”

Andean topology is so extreme that climate models can’t predict what will happen to rainfall. Lima’s future water security is of great concern to government officials, regulators, the water utility company SEDAPAL, and the people who live and work in this arid port city.

The World Bank has been investigating the need for robust decision making in Lima, and recently completed a comprehensive study of SEDAPAL’s $2.7 billion master plan for water resources to 2040. The Bank draws upon state-of-the art methods for Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMU).

“We have to make decisions even when we don’t know the future,” said Laura Bonzanigo, World Bank economist specializing in DMU. “Through the DMU methodology, we can look at the range of possibilities and come up with minimum requirements to meet every possibility—robust decisions with no regrets.”

In spite of SEDAPAL’s Master Plan, key questions remained. Could the proposed investments ensure reliability in the face of deep uncertainties? Are they all required? What if there are delays? What is the best sequence so that investments ensure both “no regrets” and maximum future adaptability?

The study helped SEDAPAL revise its Master Plan of 14 large-scale investments by identifying projects that it can embark upon now, while preparing future actions adaptively as conditions evolve. When the World Bank team analyzed the 14 projects, they found that investments representing 75 percent of the proposed cost of the Master Plan ($2.0 billion) met water reliability targets just as much as the full $2.7 billion plan. More capital investment did not improve reliability. The study saved the city over $600 million.

Historically, utility companies are used to construction--pumping stations, dams, water treatment plans and tunnels through mountains. “But it turns out some of the most valuable things they can do are ‘soft.’ They can encourage water conservation and recycling. They can make ecological investments in the upper watersheds, working with farmers and ranchers. And they can do better water-quality monitoring with mining companies to protect water quality,” Brandon added.

For the first time, the utility is reaching out to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to protect watersheds and groundwater aquifers. It is also beginning to work with consumers to use less water per household, and exploring with the municipality ways to use recycled water for parks. The analysis has earned the confidence of regulatory and budget agencies. SEDAPAL has also requested further World Bank support, mostly in these areas that supplement more traditional “bricks and mortar” investments.

Engaging Peruvian NGOs is significant because they work closely with communities in upper watershed management (“green” infrastructure) and environmental monitoring. And the universities are important due to SEDAPAL’s interest in training others so the method can be widely applied in other cities under water stress across Peru and other Andean countries.

Decision-Making under Deep Uncertainty is an increasingly important tool for virtually any sector involving long-term planning and investments. Drawing from the Lima study, final workshop participants Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil have already approached the World Bank country offices to request support in the water sector. But other types of investment planning equally suited to this type of analysis are transportation, energy, flood management, and urban development.

A recently published report titled ""Robust Decision-Making in the Water Sector: a Strategy for Implementing Lima’s Long-Term Water Resources Master Plan"" includes more information on the Lima water study. The Bank has also released a new methodological book that helps program managers demonstrate the robustness of their projects, “Confronting Climate Uncertainty in Water Resource Planning and Project Design: The Decision Tree Framework.”","Mon, 05 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['work', 'water', 'planning', 'address', 'bank', 'world', 'investments', 'uses', 'master', 'thirsty', 'plan', 'study', 'robust', 'lima', 'future', 'needs']", 
26,26,DR-2015-000134-SOM,World Bank Forecasts Global Poverty to Fall Below 10% for First Time; Major Hurdles Remain in Goal to End Poverty by 2030 - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/04/world-bank-forecasts-global-poverty-to-fall-below-10-for-first-time-major-hurdles-remain-in-goal-to-end-poverty-by-2030,"WASHINGTON, October 4, 2015 – The number of people living in extreme poverty around the world is likely to fall to under 10 percent of the global population in 2015, according to World Bank projections released today, giving fresh evidence that a quarter-century-long sustained reduction in poverty is moving the world closer to the historic goal of ending poverty by 2030.

The Bank uses an updated international poverty line of US $1.90 a day, which incorporates new information on differences in the cost of living across countries (the PPP exchange rates). The new line preserves the real purchasing power of the previous line (of $1.25 a day in 2005 prices) in the world’s poorest countries. Using this new line (as well as new country-level data on living standards), the World Bank projects that global poverty will have fallen from 902 million people or 12.8 per cent of the global population in 2012 to 702 million people, or 9.6 per cent of the global population, this year.

Actual poverty data from low income countries come with a considerable lag but the organization, which released the information on the eve of its Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, based its current projections on the latest available data.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank Group President, said that the continued major reductions in poverty were due to strong growth rates in developing countries in recent years, investments in people’s education, health, and social safety nets that helped keep people from falling back into poverty. He cautioned, however, that with slowing global economic growth, and with many of the world’s remaining poor people living in fragile and conflict-affected states, and the considerable depth and breadth of remaining poverty, the goal to end extreme poverty remained a highly ambitious target.

“This is the best story in the world today -- these projections show us that we are the first generation in human history that can end extreme poverty,’’ Kim said. “This new forecast of poverty falling into the single digits should give us new momentum and help us focus even more clearly on the most effective strategies to end extreme poverty. It will be extraordinarily hard, especially in a period of slower global growth, volatile financial markets, conflicts, high youth unemployment, and the growing impact of climate change. But it remains within our grasp, as long as our high aspirations are matched by country-led plans that help the still millions of people living in extreme poverty.”

In April 2013, nine months after Kim became president of the World Bank Group, its Board of Governors endorsed two goals: to end extreme poverty by 2030, and to boost shared prosperity by raising the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of populations.

Kim said that further reductions in poverty rates would come from evidence-based approaches, including: broad-based growth that generates sufficient income-earning opportunities; investing in people’s development prospects through improving the coverage and quality of education, health, sanitation, and protecting the poor and vulnerable against sudden risks of unemployment, hunger, illness, drought and other calamities. These measures, he said, would also greatly boost shared prosperity, improving the welfare of the least well-off in every country.

“With these strategies in place, the world stands a vastly better chance of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and raising the life prospects of low-income families,” said Kim.

Poverty remains concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia

For the last several decades, three regions, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, have accounted for some 95 percent of global poverty. Yet, the composition of poverty across these three regions has shifted dramatically. In 1990, East Asia accounted for half of the global poor, whereas some 15 percent lived in in Sub-Saharan Africa; by 2015 forecasts, this is almost exactly reversed: Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for half of the global poor, with some 12 percent living in East Asia. Poverty is declining in all regions but it is becoming deeper and more entrenched in countries that are either conflict ridden or overly dependent on commodity exports.

The growing concentration of global poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa is of great concern. While some African countries have seen significant successes in reducing poverty, the region as a whole lags the rest of the world in the pace of lessening poverty. Sub-Saharan poverty fell from an estimated 56 percent in 1990 to a projected 35 percent in 2015. Rapid population growth remains a key factor blunting progress in many countries—as this year’s Global Monitoring Report to be launched on October 8 shows.

In its regional forecasts for 2015, the Bank said that poverty in East Asia and the Pacific would fall to 4.1 per cent of its population, down from 7.2 per cent in 2012; Latin America and the Caribbean would fall to 5.6 per cent from 6.2 in 2012; South Asia would fall to 13.5 per cent in 2015, compared to 18.8 per cent in 2012; Sub-Saharan Africa declines to 35.2 per cent in 2015, compared to 42.6 per cent in 2012. Reliable current poverty data is not available for the Middle East and North Africa because of conflict and fragility in key countries in the region. *For more detail on the regional forecasts, see page 6 of attached Policy Research Note.

“Development has been robust over the last two decades but the protracted global slowdown since the financial crisis of 2008, is beginning to cast its shadow on emerging economies,” said World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu, a former Chief Economic Adviser to the Indian Government. “There is some turbulence ahead. The economic growth outlook is less impressive for emerging economies in the near future, which will create new challenges in the fight to end poverty and attend to the needs of the vulnerable, especially those living at the bottom 40 percent of their societies.”

Measuring Poverty Globally and Nationally

The updated global poverty line and rate are based on newly-available price data from across the world- impacting not only where the global poverty line is drawn, but the cost of the basic food, clothing, and shelter needs of the poorest around the world. However, this global measure is only one of many important measures to track in order to better reach the poor and vulnerable.

“When global organizations set global goals, we have to be able to compare progress across countries using a common measure, treating the absolute poor in one country the same as in another, “ said Ana Revenga, Senior Director of the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice. “But just as important are the national poverty lines set by each country, reflecting their own standard of living. These are crucial for governments and policy makers when they are planning the programs that will improve lives, or the policies that will help bring the poorest in their country out of destitution.”

Revenga said the World Bank Group would continue to work with its country clients and partners to improve how it measures and tracks poverty, to build country statistical capacity and fill persistent data gaps, and to integrate solid data and analysis into its development work to better reach people and their families who live in entrenched poverty.

Why did you get into science in the first place—you know, back in your early days? Was it the promise of a big-time salary? Probably not. Science careers have never been touted as a sure-fire way to earn big-time compensation, and salary rarely comes up as a top selection factor for students deciding their future careers. Was it the prestige of an academic appointment at a distinguished university? I doubt it. Perhaps you reflected upon your academic adviser’s cool job as a professor. That, however, probably wasn’t at the root of your interest in science; you discovered it later on, as you were being mentored in the lab. I suspect that neither salary nor prestige were likely to have been a driving force behind your initial motivation to be a scientist.

It’s my guess that, as a young person, you imagined yourself using your abilities in math or science to solve a problem—perhaps to cure a disease or advance the state of knowledge in an area that interested you. And it was this interest—this passion—that drove you into science and kept you motivated through the many years it took to advance your education and career to where they are today.

When asked to talk about your science, show the real you.

It’s easy to dismiss the element of passion when you think about all the things that an employer is looking for. After all, read the job ad and you’ll see six to eight “must have” skills and qualities that the employer considers essential, but passion won’t be listed. Even so, it’s the one factor you won’t get very far without.

Passion at the heart of career success

Our executive and scientific search practice operates with two parallel business tracks: pharmaceutical sciences and agricultural sciences. You can imagine just by the nature of the work in these two fields how difficult it is to cross boundaries: People with advanced pharma careers don’t easily move over to the agriculture business, and vice versa. But despite these two tracks being completely separate, two recent rounds of interviews for clients on either side of this divide helped me recognize what a successful Indian plant breeder has in common with an equally first-rate American cell biologist: The passion they have for what they do still drives their career success a decade after leaving the academic lab.

When I asked Rajesh, the plant breeder, the “what got you into this field” question, he told me about the role agriculture played in his childhood. “I was raised on a very small farm, by parents who dedicated their lives to each harvest, one that barely put us at a level above subsistence,” he said. “We were growing pearl millet. It was tough, especially as the ground was difficult, the weather unpredictable, and the crops suffered disease regularly due to drought or insects. The big seed companies had no interest in these poor man’s crops, but I knew that science could have an impact on our lives by solving these plant problems through breeding and biotechnology.” I could tell that every one of Rajesh’s career decisions had been a result of his passion to make lives better at home. And as Chris, our human resources contact at this agricultural research client, says, “The better candidates all have this passion; it is what lies at the heart of 99% of our successful hires.”

After my meeting with Rajesh, who impressed me and is now in line to do the same with my client, I met Susan, a cell biologist whose career in science has been driven just as surely by passion as Rajesh’s was. “I was always fascinated by science,” she said when I asked her why she went into biology. “I was an avid science fiction reader, and did rather well in early science and math classes. But it wasn’t until my favorite aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer that I got the bug to make science my life and passion. I knew that someday someone would find a cure, and I wanted so much to be that person. My career goals originate entirely from the way I felt about my aunt.”

Of course, not everyone’s interest in science is due to an intensely personal reason, but a successful response to an interviewer’s question about motivation simply needs to recall the emotions, and the reasoning, behind your decision. What I particularly respect when I ask this question is candor and the interviewee’s ability to express emotion. No made-up interviewing BS, please!

Tapping into your passion

If I ask an acquaintance how they became a salesperson or a taxi driver, they’re likely to tell me how it is that they “fell” into their career. But in 30 years of interviewing scientists, no one has ever told me that they “fell” into science. There’s always a story, something that brings a sparkle to their eyes.

You might not be aware of your own story, though. It could be buried in your subconscious, guiding your science trajectory with an invisible hand. That’s why, at the beginning of this column, I asked you to think about how it is that you found yourself in science. The answer you come up with will be worth talking about when you interview for jobs.

You won’t be asked about this in the early discussions; those questions tend to be primarily about the fit, your experience with the techniques you’d use in that job, or your attitudes about working with others in a team. But as the conversation continues and you become one of the finalists, the hiring manager will want to know more about what makes you tick. A key part of that will be your story of how and why you decided to get into science. That’s where your work to review the emotion and reasoning behind those early decisions will lend real value to your job search.

Working past burnout

Unfortunately, some people start out with a passion much like Rajesh or Susan and end up, after years of training, feeling like the passion they used to have has been beaten out of them by the process of pursuing a career in science. That’s understandable, and it happens to more than it should.

If that describes you, you’re going to need a re-injection of passion, because interviewers can spot burnout from a mile away. I would recommend two approaches. First, reconnect with your strengths. Second, get excited about the potential of learning something new.

My own personal experience has taught me that, when my passion for work runs low, I must go back to my areas of strength. Every job consists of a number of skill areas, and some of these are going to be your “sweet spots.” In my case, there are certain elements of my job that I’m just really good at, and sometimes I need to remind myself of those and focus on them for a while. You can try this too: Reconnect with those techniques and skills in which you really shine. Feel good about them so that, when you discuss your science, you’ll be able to show some passion as you talk about what you are good at.

The other element to be excited about, besides your present strengths, lies in the opportunity to learn something new, which you will certainly be doing if you move outside of academia. Carefully read all you can about the company you will be interviewing with. In that research, you’ll uncover interesting nuggets about the completely new and tantalizing work you could end up doing. Yes, companies will only hire you if you bring something to the party as well, but every hiring manager loves a person who just seems to be crackling with excitement to dig into something new.

Interviews are filled with moments of opportunity—and missed opportunities as well. When asked to talk about your science, show the real you. Drop the canned responses, and reveal the passion that got you into your career in the first place.","Wed, 14 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/CC_WedMillet_1280x720.jpg?itok=3L-yu3zQ,"['early', 'passion', 'secret', 'job', 'youll', 'career', 'search', 'asked', 'science', 'wont', 'success', 'work', 'interest', 'weapon']",

Sure, you enjoy seeing your friend’s photo of her breakfast, and you double tapped that mate-of-a-mate’s baby pic because, well, it would be rude not to. And following Blake Lively is just a given because y’know: it’s Blake Lively.

But do you ever wish you could inject some excitement into your Instagram feed? Some culture, some controversy, some photos of people that weren’t taken with a front-facing camera?

Us too. Which is why we dedicated two and a half hours this afternoon to hunting out the best eight female photographers currently displaying their work on the social media site. From war reporting to awkward nudity, they’re turning their Instagram feeds into miniature art galleries. And we can’t get enough of them.

BARBARA DAVIDSON – @PHOTOSPICE

Why should you follow her? Er, she’s won a goddamn Pulitzer prize, for Christssake.



Her feed is likely to show… ‘The Horn of Africa Drought. Hawa Barre Osman looks for a sign of life from Abdi Noor Ibrahim, her severely malnourished 1-year-old, inside the Doctors Without Borders therapeutic feeding center at the Dadaab complex. She walked for a month with her five children from Somalia to reach the camp.’

DAFI HAGAI – @DAFYS

Why should you follow her? She’s based in Israel and New York City, and her photos are uncomfortable, raw images of femininty across the two cultures. You’ll wince. And then you’ll double tap.

Her feed is likely to show… ‘Beach time abstracts’

PETRA COLLINS – @PETRAFCOLLINS

Why should you follow her? She went to school with Tavi Gevinson. Which might not have anything to do with her photographic talents, but certainly explains the cool factor.

Her feed is likely to show…‘Nagymama’



AMANDA JASNOWSKI – @HOKAYTOKAY

Why should you follow her? If GIRLS had a character who was a photographer, she’d probably be based on Amanda Jas.

Her feed is likely to show… ‘Flowers for friends’

GILLIAN LAUB – @GIGILAUB

Why should you follow her? With a feed made up of incredible images of day-to-day life, Gillian’s instagram will inspire you to ditch the filters, and work on your angles.

Her feed is likely to show… ‘Best breakfast nails of life. Lee Marrone is 88 years old and has more energy than anyone I know. Drinking a gin and cranberry. She says drink of choice is negroni, but my mom doesn’t have it.’

SARA NAOMI LEWKOWICZ – @SARANAOMIPHOTO

Why should you follow her? She’s a multi-award winning American photographer, who hit headlines back in 2013 for her series of portraits documenting Domestic Violence. And her instagram account is just as gripping.

Her feed is likely to show… ‘George Sallie, 87, was on the original march across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1965. “I fought for my country in Korea for someone else’s freedom, and then came home and realized I didn’t have freedom of my own,” he said. He says is marching today because of the attacks on the Voting Rights Act, asking me “What’s the use of having legislation to protect our right to vote if it ends up being gutted?” George bears a scar on his forehead, a gift from the billy club of a member of the Citizen Posse.’

KRISTIE MULLER – @KRISTIEMULLER

Why should you follow her? Because she’s just like you. Photographing her friends, her family and the things she spots during the day to day, Kristie’s photos aren’t staged. But they are beautiful.

Her feed is likely to show… Plastic bags. And reflections.

SARAH RHODES – @ARROWANDAPPLE

Why should you follow her? She’s full time photographer for A Beautiful Mess. So it’s no surprise that her blog is beautiful (even if not remotely a mess).

Her feed is likely to show…‘Baby stuffs. What else??

33,33,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Beware the Green Revolution - African Arguments,https://africanarguments.org/2015/10/beware-the-green-revolution/,"Many government and agencies see India’s 1960s Green Revolution as a great success that Africa should emulate. The soaring suicide rate amongst India’s farmers tells a different story.

The development community has been crowing of late about the obvious need to revamp African agricultural practices. Not since colonial times has it been so easy to blame small peasant farmers for the continent’s development woes. The standard agricultural development formula to address this, developed in other world regions, is to adopt new technologies and commercialise the farming sector. But African leaders ought to look twice before blindly encouraging their farmers to adopt this capital intensive approach.

The results have been nothing less than deadly in central India.

After four consecutive years of low rainfall, the Marathwada region of Maharashtra State has emerged as India’s farmer suicide capital. Located in central India, this region is about the size of Sierra Leone and has a population similar to that of Mali or Burkina Faso. Not unlike the savannah regions of West Africa, farmers in this relatively poor area used to mainly grow drought tolerant sorghum and millet, as well as other food crops. However, the Green Revolution of the 1960s – an international effort to boost crop productivity with the use of hybrid seeds, fertilisers and pesticides – encouraged farmers in this area to move away from growing a variety of food crops towards the production of cash crops, mainly cotton and soybeans.

The underlying problem driving the majority of farmer suicides in this region has been indebtedness. Farmers borrow money to put a crop in the ground and then low global prices, insect infestations, or poor rains lead to low returns. Increasingly, indebted farmers then turn to more informal sources (often village money lenders) for further loans at even higher rates. Sadly, this vicious cycle often leads to the male head of household committing suicide to avoid the humiliation of total destitution, typically leaving behind an even more impoverished wife and children.

So far this year, 660 farmers in the Marathwada region have committed suicide. This is up from 422 suicides for the same area during all of last year. Not counting this most recent year, nearly 300,000 farmers committed suicide in India between 1995 and 2014. Unlike other regions of the world where urbanites take their own lives at higher rates than rural folk, the suicide rate for farmers in India is nearly 50% higher than that of the general population. Suicides are also most concentrated amongst those farmers who grow cash crops (as opposed to those who grow food crops for their own consumption).

One bright spot is that crop failures in India rarely lead to hunger because of the state’s extensive public distribution system which guarantees access to basic food stuffs at affordable prices for the poor.

But that said, the farmer suicide situation is alarming and there is a collective clamour for the authorities to do something. The prevailing view, often expressed in the local Indian media, is that the system of chemical intensive, cash crop based agriculture is fundamentally sound and that marginal changes will make it function properly. These adjustments include more robust crop insurance, access to credit at reasonable rates, water at affordable prices, and inexpensive seed and chemical inputs.

But is the Green Revolution approach to agriculture really viable in this part of India and what can Africans learn from the current crisis?

While this year is admittedly worse than usual, with the monsoon rains only 50% of normal, many Indian farmers struggle in even the best of times. Several decades of cotton farming in Marathwada has led to soil degradation, declining crop yields and the need to use even more chemical fertilisers. Furthermore, the idea of promoting more irrigation is not really practical as many cities in the region are already forced to ration water in drier years. Funnelling more water towards agriculture would likely further deplete groundwater resources.

A green alternative?

There are new voices in India now calling for an alternative approach to agriculture. Some NGOs are working through farmer field schools to introduce new agroecological techniques. These include plant associations in diverse cropping systems to maintain soil fertility and manage pest problems, the use of earthworms to produce rich compost, the planting of less thirsty crops, and new water-harvesting techniques and conservation methods. The saving grace of this alternative approach to agriculture is that it does not rely on costly external inputs, and therefore farmers do not take on the risky debt that has been driving the suicide problem. It is also more sustainable over the long run because it is less demanding of the soil and water resources.

Given the shortcomings of the Green Revolution approach to agriculture in India’s Maharashtra state, it is not only the Indian government that must begin to rethink its approach to agriculture. We must question how Asia’s Green Revolution experience is being touted in Africa as the way forward.

Organisations such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Gates Foundation, and the US Agency of International Development (USAID), argue that the first Green Revolution largely bypassed the African continent. The result, they suggest, has been a huge untapped agricultural potential and a persistent hunger problem on the African continent. Proponents of a New Green Revolution for Africa argue that the increasing use of improved seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, along with a more commercialised farming sector that involves agroprocessing, will increase farmer incomes and eliminate hunger.

But aid agencies and African authorities should carefully study the experiences of India with the first Green Revolution before uncritically adopting this approach. While it may be appropriate for the region’s wealthier farmers, this more capital intensive strategy is often too risky and environmentally problematic for poorer cultivators. They must also understand that India’s laws insuring affordable access to food have done more to combat hunger than unsustainable farming technologies.

Patna: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today used Narendra Modi's 'Na khauanga na khane doonga' remark to hit out at him over spiraling price of pulses and also attacked him for ""not being bothered"" about drought situation in the country.

Taking pot shots at Modi for his rallies in Bihar, he said, it seems Patna has become capital of the country as well as BJP headquarters these days.

""With price of pulses touching Rs 200 a kg, a joke is doing round quoting the PM's comment 'Na khauanga na khane doonga' (neither will I eat nor allow anybody to eat),"" Kumar told an election meeting at Punpun in Patna district in support of minister Shyam Rajak.

Kumar, a star campaigner of the grand secular alliance, said while 300 districts were under the grip of drought-like situation in the country, the PM and his ministers were ""not bothered"" and roaming around in Bihar for ensuring BJP victory in the poll.

""BJP President has booked a floor of a posh hotel in Patna and monitoring party activities. It seems BJP headquarters has shifted to Patna,"" he said, adding ""but their plan will not succeed.""

Kumar, who has been projected as the face of grand secular alliance in the Bihar elections, said due to shortage of leaders in BJP, they are fighting elections in the name of PM.

""Days are not far when BJP will even contest panchayat elections in the name of Prime Minister,"" he said mocking at BJP.

Kumar counted virtues of unity and mutual trust among partners of grand secular alliance by highlighting joint declaration of name of candidates and joint agenda.

""On the other hand the rival grouping has no unity and each party is taking a shot at others and announcing name of candidate in phases,"" he said.","Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/politicsnational/IndiaTv67f207_Nitish-Kumar-final.jpg,"['nitish', 'elections', 'minister', 'pulses', 'bjp', 'price', 'grand', 'bihar', 'patna', 'kumar', 'alliance', 'rising', 'attacks', 'secular']",

Freedom at last. The desert tortoise, tagged with a transmitter and stamped with the bureaucratic name of ""2-4,"" was the last of a cohort of 35 desert tortoises released into the wild by the Marine Corps.

The Sept. 30 release was nine years in the making.

""It's pretty significant,"" Harp told the crowd of two-dozen officials, local representatives and journalists gathered for the event.

The tortoise was among 475 housed in a fenced, secured ""head start"" facility the Marine Corps built in 2006 in a concerted effort to recover the threatened species that's seen adult mortality rates of 90 percent in recent decades. Starting in mid-September, biologists released the tortoises leading up to the first public release at Sand Hill, a restricted training area at the 1,100-square-mile desert warfare training base.

Some may wonder why there's so much fuss over a tortoise, but the species shares its home with members of the military. Survival is a battle for the desert tortoise. Military training, along with suburban sprawl, commercial activities, expanding solar and wind farms, cattle farms, and off-road recreation across its Mojave Desert home have all decimated the population.

The military services have agreed to conservation programs like this one to mitigate impacts of expanded ranges and training, as well as to study and help the species. That includes ""head start"" programs to safeguard young tortoises and programs to move the reptiles from military training areas. The Army's ""head start"" facility at Fort Irwin, California, closed shop a few years ago after many of the hundreds of tortoises released and relocated didn't survive the first few months. A similar effort at Edwards Air Force Base, California, also saw disappointing results.

The Marine Corps and the base's Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs division collaborated with tortoise experts and federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on ways to give hatchlings and juveniles a fighting chance to grow big enough to ward off predators and survive on their own.

""We are trying to do things a little bit differently,"" Brian Henen, the base biologist said.

The six-acre Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, or TRACRS ( pronounced like the word ""tracers""), is the only one of its kind in the military and one of only two head-start efforts in the U.S. Hatchlings raised at TRACRS have as much as a 96 percent survival rate, double or triple what they would encounter in the wild, Henen said.

""That actually helps support our mission, the mission of training here at [Twentynine Palms] ,"" he said. ""Those go hand-in-hand, they mesh quite closely together with that objective of protecting tortoises but also protecting and sustaining the mission.""

The desert tortoise isn't exactly Marine Corps material. It's slow and laid back. It's not predatory, preferring a vegetarian diet of leaves and flowers. When threatened, it slinks into its hardened shell for protection from predators like hawks, ravens and coyotes. If scared, it might urinate, emptying its bladder of its lifesaving supply of stored water.

Young tortoises, with their softer, thinner shells, are vulnerable to predators like hawks and coyotes looking for a snack . Many of the tortoises released by the Army and Air Force were later found pecked or crushed to death , biologists said. That led to the question: Would more survive if they were a little older?

Col. James Harp, Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center's chief of staff, releases a 9-year-old desert tortoise in the Sand Hill area. It was the last of 35 released from the Corps' Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, a unique ""head start"" facility at the desert combat training center at Twentynine Palms, Calif., created to help recover the endangered species.

At 9 years old, tortoise ""2-4"" is like a teenager ready to tackle the big world on his own. (He might be a she. Biologists don't know yet if it's a male or female.)

The tortoise grew from a clutch of eggs brought to TRACRS in the program's first year . About 50 juvenile tortoises have grown large enough — bigger than the size of a softball — to be eligible for release, Henen said.

Officials wanted to do the first release in 2014, but California's ongoing drought shriveled up vegetation, said Ken Nagy, a University of California at Los Angeles professor emeritus working with the Marine Corps since TRACRS' inception . Recent rains have helped.

""Our tortoises out here are hydrated. They love to drink rainwater,"" Nagy said, who also worked with Fort Irwin's program. Officials hope to do another release next year.

MCAGCC's most famous tortoise, and desert tortoise ambassador ""Thelma."" Thelma and Louise reside at TRACRS and are often brought to educational events at the training base.

The 198-square-mile expansion here added a separate effort to save the desert tortoise. The Marine Corps will move as many as 1,200 tortoises to safer remote areas starting next year, officials said. Henen said 110 contracted biologists are helping survey and assess sites and find tortoises in a 200-square-kilometer area.

""We have to go out and find all the tortoises and move them from the high-impact areas,"" Lt. Col. Tim Pochop, the environmental officer here, said.","Sun, 04 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/_R01LfGld3xP0hTTWMUdAkTuqbE=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UTV6WKARMNBAJMZ4IFEIVAVPLI.jpg,"['corps', 'tortoise', 'combat', 'base', 'tortoises', 'desert', 'released', 'twentynine', 'california', 'palms', 'releases', 'training', 'marine']", 
40,40,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The many layers of Caitlin Stasey: 'A lot of people think I'm a really angry person' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/24/the-many-layers-of-caitlin-stasey-a-lot-of-people-think-im-a-really-angry-person,"Earlier this year, a photo shoot for Fairfax Media’s Good Weekend magazine was cancelled because its intended subject, the actor and activist Caitlin Stasey, declined to be photographed in lingerie. Stasey felt the concept was inappropriately leery for a story about the empowerment of women.

The interview – commissioned in January when Stasey was making headlines around the world with the launch of her new website, Herself.com – was postponed indefinitely. Stasey concluded the magazine had lost interest because she had refused to pose semi-nude.

Her vengeance was swift. She took to Twitter, calling out the magazine and slamming its editor, Ben Naparstek. She published some of her correspondence with Good Weekend, pointing to inconsistencies in Naparstek’s recollection of events, and wrote an essay recounting the events for Jezebel. The piece was illustrated with a topless picture Stasey had supplied herself – a Polaroid captioned with a message to Naparstek in her own handwriting: “FUCK YOU”.

Good Weekend magazine suddenly doesn't have the space to run a piece on me because I wouldn't do a shoot in my underwear @theage @smh — caitlin stasey (@caitlinstasey) July 15, 2015

They wanted to team an interview about my upset over the constant objectification of women with a sexualized photo shoot. I declined.@theage — caitlin stasey (@caitlinstasey) July 15, 2015

When a magazine only wants you if you're nude. Good stuff from @caitlinstasey on @Jezebel http://t.co/q6nvz1ODJT — Gabrielle Jackson (@gabriellecj) July 21, 2015

Good Weekend was widely walloped in the hailstorm of ensuing coverage, both in Australia and abroad. “These kinds of acts perpetuated by men in positions of power against women so often go unanswered,” Stasey said of the episode recently. “My intention was nothing more than to shed light on an issue that I know young women have faced.”

I don't feel what I do is important … we all sit around patting ourselves on the back, and for what? Caitlin Stasey

Her restless social conscience and level of engagement is less remarkable for her age than for her profession. In an industry more associated with ego, vapidity and self-investment, the 25-year-old former Neighbours actor, who broke out at the age of 20 with the Tomorrow, When the War Began movie, increasingly views her career as a distant sideline to her commitment to activism and raising awareness.

“I’ve done some incredible projects I’m really proud of that I really love. But I don’t feel what I do, what we do, is important,” Stasey told me. “The Oscars, the Golden Globes, even the IF awards … I think it’s really self-aggrandising. We all sit around patting ourselves on the back, and for what? Spending millions of dollars while people are dying. It sounds incredibly hypocritical for me to continue to be an actor and to have this feeling but I see it an opportunity to talk about things that I care about. I think that’s the important thing.”

The Good Weekend episode highlighted everything that made Stasey an attractive magazine subject in the first place: her social media celebrity, the fierceness of her feminist crusade, her tussles with the media and her general badassery. It’s also a fitting appetiser for a version of the original interview, published now for the first time.

‘People don’t rally in the streets for happiness’

In the clamorous Twittersphere, where the more moderate voices get drowned out, Stasey’s online presence is regularly pitched at the rabble-rousing volume of revolution. Her style is mutinous and militant; you can sense the pugilistic percussion of her thumbs on her smartphone screen as she bashes out her rallying cries to her nearly 100,000 followers.

For a long time after joining Twitter in 2009, Stasey used the social media platform in the same way most of us do: to post selfies, cat pictures and YouTube clips. These days, Stasey treats Twitter as part-philosophical salon, part-soapbox from which to rail against the evils of the world – climate change, homophobia, child abuse, animal abuse, gluten, religion, racism and (she says) Nickelback.

“A lot of people think that I’m a really angry person,” Stasey said, sipping Glenfiddich in a hotel restaurant in downtown Toronto. “‘Do you enjoy anything? Do you like anything? Are you happy about anything?’ Yes, I am! But I don’t tweet about it. People don’t rally in the streets to engage in happiness. People talk about things they’re unsatisfied with.”



In person, Stasey’s tone more closely resembles that of mellow hippy than furious firebrand. It takes a while to register the profound bleakness of her worldview. Even her most apocalyptic pronouncements – she calls the human race a “cancer on the Earth” – are delivered in polite tones not dissimilar to the received pronunciation English she speaks in the Tudor-era US soapie Reign.

While a local musician performs a yearning rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow at the other end of the room, Stasey laments the corrupt handling of the drought in northern California, the targeting of low-income women to sell their breast milk, the impeding of cancer research by human gene patenting, and the devastation of the natural habit of mountain gorillas, all before our drinks have arrived. Perusing the menu, she admits that she draws the line at the rights of vegetables.

“People always get on me, ‘Well, what about carrots? Carrots have feelings,’” she says. “I’m not about to start eating an animal that has been caged since birth, has been milked until it’s no longer useful, because someone thinks asparagus might be sentient. Because I don’t think that it is.”

She orders the baby kale and quinoa salad, the only item on the menu with no animal products. Something tells me not to order the foie gras. Her disregard for the plight of asparagus notwithstanding, Stasey seems not only well informed about injustice, but also personally affected by it. She speaks earnestly and openly, and doesn’t do do small talk. “This is how I engage,” she says. “I’m acutely aware of my mortality, and the only way I know how to combat it is to try to connect with as many human beings as possible.”

The curse of caring intensely about so much, Stasey herself is burdened by feelings of failure and impotence. During the interview she chides herself for unconsciously using “ablest” words like “crazy”, “lame” and “insane”. She’s not entirely sure if the recently purchased top she’s wearing wasn’t made in a sweatshop. She owns leather products and a Canada Goose jacket – items “heavily endowed with sadness” – from before she went completely vegan in 2014. Even her veganism is a source of guilt, since it means not supporting the cruelty-free meat industry.

I’m acutely aware of my mortality, and the only way I know how to combat it is to try to connect Caitlin Stasey

Her devoted young female following is drawn to the strong female characters she plays as well as the strong female character she is. Stasey’s sense of responsibility to her legion of female fans has, in turn, inspired her feminism. Stasey applies her fieriest energies to speaking out against the fundamental inequality of the sexes: sexism, sex negativity, misogyny, victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.

On Twitter, Stasey’s feminism sometimes takes the form of deadpan misandry along the lines of, “My resolution for 2015 – kill all the men.” But Stasey’s actually against a society that favours men, not men themselves. “Feminism is as simple as a woman choosing for herself and being able to do what she believes in. Feminism is nothing more than freedom.”

‘You are a superstar in my eyes’

Last year, Stasey and Toronto-based photographer Jennifer Toole put out a call for women of all body types, nationalities, ethnicities and orientations to participate in a new project to promote female solidarity. Herself.com is the result; a place for women to share their thoughts and ideas on sex, sexuality, gender, feminism, monogamy, masturbation, and much more besides, accompanied by artful nude photographs.



Stasey conceived Herself.com as an alternative to the finitude and fleetingness of typical internet outrage. “I noticed that every time a woman had an opinion about something, she was just shouted down by everyone around her,” says Stasey.

“I wanted to create this one-way flow of information from woman to world about the things they ordinarily aren’t asked. I wanted to ask women what they thought about how the world saw them, because I was witnessing injustice and discrimination and I wondered if other women saw it too. I felt the world should hear that this woman was sexually assaulted, or that she was raped, or that she had an eating disorder.”

Her shrewdly simple act of female solidarity resonated with readers in a way even she didn’t imagine. Stasey’s social media accounts, sites of gushing fan worship any other day, have been overwhelmed with glowing responses to Herself.com. A sample: “Love the idea of @herself.com and have read every single interview twice. Thank you for being open and candid about issues that so often are pushed to the side. You are superstar in my eyes. Thank you @caitlinjstasey and fuck the haters.”

Or: “You are amazing and I truly appreciate all you do to raise awareness of our rights as women!”

One might be forgiven for wondering if a collection of generic template interviews constitutes genuine societal change or, instead, simply offers a reassuring simulacrum of change – even, as Malcolm Gladwell has suggested of online activism, a substitute for it. But Stasey’s own decision to take up feminism was the result of conversations she had tuned into online. Before then, she says, she had been blissfully insulated in the liberal, like-minded company of actors and artists.

‘I’ve always felt like I was gay’

As a child Stasey was a tomboyish child, permanently trudging around in Blundstone boots. She distinctly remembers, as an 11-year-old, the realisation that her friend was wearing a slinky black dress while she was in a T-shirt that had been bought in the gift shop of a zoo. She was also a dark-haired, dark-skinned girl surrounded by girls who, as she tells it, were all blond-haired and blue-eyed. With a British mother, an Australian father and two white names, her peers, even the parents of friends, jokingly called her “blackie”. She absorbed it, rather than correcting them.

Stasey was also confused about her own sexuality. “I’ve always felt like I was gay,” she says. “But when I was 13 I felt like it was sitting on my chest and I couldn’t move and there was nothing I could do about it. I was scared of being gay but I was also scared of approaching women. I couldn’t think of anything more frightening than asking a woman out or kissing a woman or taking a woman home.

“I knew I was different and I knew the world that I was growing up in wasn’t interested in nurturing that.”

She sought out female nude imagery in art history books (“I loved impressionism because it was actual depictions of naked bodies. I couldn’t get into Picasso. I thought, ‘Boobs don’t look like that’”). To the amusement of her family, she doodled her own nude pictures. She was confused to not be able to find her feelings reflected anywhere in her community, in the books she was reading or the television she was watching. And, though she was raised in a secular household, she attended an all girls’ Catholic high school that, though supposedly committed to inspiring its young women, only filled her with Christian shame for her bodily desires.

Stasey began self-harming at the age of 13. She had completed six months filming her first television role in ABC TV’s The Sleepover Club, during which – always gregarious with adult strangers growing up and encouraged by her drama teacher mother – she had become used to the attention of those much older than her. Unmoored from the sense of importance that she had enjoyed her on set, the return to school, and schoolwork, depressed her.

Not long after her 14th birthday, her parents found the razor blades she was using to slice her forearms. Suddenly, she felt silly. “I stopped equating self-harm with self-help,” she says. “It began feeling self-indulgent. Rather than fall deeper into a hole of self-despair, I guess I saw that I had to find a way out to survive.”



She began paying attention to what was happening around her, tuning in to nightly news forecasts and developing what Stasey’s younger sister Victoria refers to as a “precocious interest” in current affairs. “To be honest, she always annoyed us a little bit,” Victoria told me recently. “She was so socially minded and very aware. We’d be watching the news and she’d be commenting on it and trying to get us involved … we’d always just kind of roll our eyes a bit.”

“My dad always said I was really naive and that I wasn’t living in the real world,” Stasey says. “My response to that was I just have an unfailing commitment to a world that I wish we were living in. Because if you live by the parameters of what you exist in, then you might never see change.”

‘It’s important to seem steely’

The turbulence of her adolescence behind her, the Stasey of today is staunchly sex positive. She has railed against the double standards in the censorship of women’s breasts on Facebook and Instagram, spoken out in support of sex work, and raved about the joys of everything from masturbation to casual sex. (For the premiere episode of Reign, she acted out a stairwell masturbation scene that, much to her disappointment, was cut considerably for broadcast.)

For a long time, Stasey’s all-purpose profile picture was a topless photograph of herself, which she used for both Twitter and the dating app Tinder. (Her entire Tinder bio: “Cum at me ladies.”) She now identifies as lesbian despite having almost exclusively dated men. She is currently in a self-described “somewhat open” relationship with Lucas Neff, an American actor. They see other women, together and separately.

She’s also an avid sexter, as her own mother recently learned when she picked up Stasey’s iPad by mistake.

Stasey’s sexual candor occasionally feeds right into the vulturous appetites of the tabloids and their blogging brethren. The Daily Mail, News.com and TMZ – the same outlets that pick apart Stasey’s “social media outbursts” and “bizarre Twitter rants” – frequently tsk and tut in tones of puritan outrage even as they gleefully publish Stasey’s words and pixelate her private parts.

When Stasey criticised celebrity blogger Perez Hilton for publishing leaked photos during the celebrity phone hacking scandal, he responded with “Great tits!” But Stasey refuses to censor herself.

“I think it’s important to seem steely, right? If you appear hurt, then they’ve won. If someone trolls me and makes me feel like shit, if somebody writes an article about me that makes me cry … I’m never going to be silenced by bigots and I’m never going to be silenced by trolls. I don’t want other women, who might be looking to me as a source of comfort, to feel like anything that’s thrown at me has any weight to it. You just have to be fucking boss.”

Women are so often asked to take on roles to portray their entire gender Caitlin Stasey

In movies and television, Stasey has done her best to take screen roles that agree with her politics. Her character on ABC’s Please Like Me pursues a sustainable forestry project all the way to Europe; on Reign, she played the King’s sexually forthright mistress Kenna, whose bohemian tendencies are strongly implied by her beaded headpieces and wristlets. (One of Kenna’s defining moments has been immortalised in a fan-made gif: “You have no idea what it’s like to be a girl in this world,” she says. “Owning nothing, having no power except the effect you have on men.”) Stasey calls Kenna “the clitoris” of the show.

In an industry notorious for retrograde gender politics, Stasey knows her views get in the way of her career longevity. Right now, however, she regularly finds herself going head-to-head with agents and casting directors. “In those scenarios you feel like you have to make yourself as attractive as possible. But I have so little interest in that now.”

“Women are so often asked to take on roles to portray their entire gender,” Stasey says, “much like any member of the LGBTQI community is asked to take on roles portraying their entire community, because they’re standing as a figurehead. Whereas men get to be nuanced, fluid, interesting people who can do shit things and people still love them.”

Even on set, Stasey fights the “well meaning sexism” of crew members calling her “sweetheart” or “darling”, retaliating by referring to them by their eye colour. “I’ll say, ‘Hey, Chocolate Eyes …’ They’re quite taken aback,” she says.

More fundamentally, making the sort of statements that would make any agent squirm, Stasey says she’s no longer really that invested in acting – except insofar as it provides her the platform and free time to be involved with issues closer to her heart. The boundless energy that propelled Stasey to her career in the first place has found a new outlet.

Asked what she sees herself doing in five, 10 years, Stasey responds with fully formed schemes for several lofty humanitarian and ethical projects. None of them involve her being in front of a camera.

Recently, she’s been in talks with photographers in Ethiopia, Somalia and Istanbul about broadening the reach and diversity of Herself.com and highlighting the stories of women in more far-flung locations.

Beyond those plans, she hopes to set up a refuge for women and children leaving abusive relationships; launch an organic restaurant; devise a more inclusive and less transphobic sex education curriculum; care for animals; and run an ethical, trans- and queer-inclusive strip club showcasing more diverse bodies.

If everyone cared a lot about just one thing, it would alleviate the burden from others Caitlin Stasey

She has also considered politics, but isn’t convinced she’d stand a chance at being elected. “I’d be like, ‘Decriminalise all drugs! Decriminalise all sex work! Let’s get more abortion clinics!’”

In her personal life, she wants to “adopt as many children in need as possible” while also regretting how “Angelina Jolie” that sounds.

Stasey has reined in her Twitter activism in the months since Herself.com launched. Every now and then, though, something sets her off.

“The world is fuuuuucked,” she says, her garden party elocution briefly freefalling into something more recognisably Australian. “The world is entirely darkness. But there are moments of light that permeate it: great acts of empathy, of compassion, of charity, ingenuity, creativeness, art and engagement.”

Ultimately, she’s optimistic about the possibility of widespread change.

“People get so overwhelmed by this sense of despair. They just shut it out, like, ‘Fuck it, I want to eat McDonald’s and I want to waste water and I want to leave all the lights on in my house because I’ve only got one life to live. I’m only one person.’ But you can effect real change. I implore people to care as much as they can about something. If everyone cared a lot about just one thing, it would alleviate the burden from others. And from the planet.”

Stasey turns to applaud the musician, who has just performed Paul McCartney’s Blackbird, singing of broken wings learning to fly.

“But yeah, I sound like a drug addled maniac: ‘We should just love each other and live in the mud together!’ But that’s what I’d really like.”","Wed, 23 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c96d4b9212f121204725ed7a70fef97ff8cd10/29_0_4021_2412/master/4021.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db30abcf639c8dcde193fe88037dfe1a,"['stasey', 'staseys', 'lot', 'woman', 'person', 'twitter', 'world', 'dont', 'layers', 'angry', 'women', 'sex', 'think', 'caitlin', 'really', 'im', 'way']",

42,42,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The World Bank's projections on extreme poverty say progress in Sub-Saharan Africa has been uneven - Ventures Africa,https://venturesafrica.com/the-world-banks-projections-on-extreme-poverty-say-progress-sub-saharan-africa-has-been-uneven/,"According to World Bank projections, this year, extreme poverty will fall below 10 percent of the global population. This projection has estimated that over 700 million people – predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia will live below the poverty line this year. Although this is an improvement from the 902 million people that were recorded last year, the report shows that sub- Saharan African and Asia has to take a decisive and effective steps to end poverty or be ready to suffer for many more years.

Extreme poverty is defined by the World Bank as average daily consumption of $1.25 or less. It is also a condition in which a person in deprived of basic human needs which include food, clean drinking water, and access to health, shelter, education and information. In trying to measure the level of poverty across the globe, the World Bank started the ‘dollar a day’ international poverty line in 1990. By 2005, the international poverty line has been increased to $1.25. However, due to inflation across the globe, World Bank has now set a new international poverty line using the Purchasing Power Parities (PPP). PPP is a standard measure of the real value of different currencies in relation to each other based on local prices of the goods and services consumed in each country. According to report from the 2014 PPP survey, anyone who lives on $1.90 or less is extremely poor.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, over 200 million people live in extreme poverty and of the 40 poorest countries in the world, about 33 are Sub-Saharan African countries. In a bid to address the problem of poverty across the globe, world leaders converged at the UN summit and pledged to end extreme poverty by 2030. To this effect, the UN has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals and which will cost over $3 trillion per year.

These are a few of the reasons economic growth in Africa has been uneven:

Prolonged conflict and violence

In places like DR Congo, Burundi and Central African Republic, unrest, war and inter religious conflicts have become the order of the day. These conflicts increase the number of Internally Displaced Persons in the country thereby increasing poverty. For example, in the 2015 United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) report, the Democratic Republic of Congo has over 2 million IDPs due to the ongoing religious crisis. The report estimates that the country needs over $ 200 million in order to provide food, shelter, water and education for its people.

Poor governance

According to the list released by Transparency International, Somalia ranks first on the list of most corrupt countries in the world and also has 73 percent poverty rate, which is one highest in the Africa. About 800,000 Somalians require life-saving assistance, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). When African leaders abuse their offices by engaging in dishonest and fraudulent dealings or diverting public funds for personal gains, it increases the level of poverty. Citizens robbed of public services, such as good health care system, standard and affordable education, constant power supply, subsidized housing among many others. Also, poor governance allows for income inequality.

Gender discrimination

The Human Development Report placed Niger Republic as the country with the highest gender inequality index in the world. Only 31 percent women are actively involved in labour force as opposed the 91 percent male representation. In most African countries, girls and women continue to experience discrimination in social practices and legal rights. Research has shown that only about 18 percent of women have land titles in countries like Nigeria and Zambia. Also in over 40 countries, discrimination is practiced, making women susceptible to unpaid labour and sexual harassment. This increases the risk of extreme poverty for households, especially the ones supported by women

Climate change

This is particularly common in the Northeastern parts of Africa which accounts for about 30 percent of the total African population. The region is not favorable for farming or fishing due to poor climate and the adverse geographical conditions. Poverty can thrive in these countries also due to their vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, the drought that hit East Africa in 2011-2012 reduced the GDP of the countries affected by at least 30 percent and caused over 9 million people to be homeless and hungry.

The clerics signed the online statement with a clear sectarian and anti-Christian rhetoric which reflects mounting anger among many Saudis over Russian and Iranian involvement in Syria's civil war. Last week Russia began air strikes against Syrian opposition targets which it describes as aimed at weakening the jihadist Islamic State group, a move the government in Riyadh has denounced.

In the clerics' statement, they compared it to the Soviet Union's 1980 invasion of Afghanistan, which prompted an international jihad, or holy war. The statement said: ""The holy warriors of Syria are defending the whole Islamic nation. ""Trust them and support them because if they are defeated, God forbid, it will be the turn of one Sunni country after another.""

The Saudi government, along with Turkey and other Gulf states, is a main supporter of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, but it is also worried about the rise of jihadist groups such as Islamic State among the opposition. Saudi jets have joined air strikes against Islamic State in Syria, while the government has decreed long prison terms for anyone who supports the group, whose sympathisers have killed dozens in attacks in the kingdom this year.

Sectarian anger has been spreading across the Middle East due to the bloodshed in Syria which is part of a wider struggle for regional supremacy between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran. Both sides have attracted religiously motivated foreign fighters.

Riyadh's state-affiliated clergy have already termed the war a jihad for Syrians, but they have also denounced Islamic State as well as al Qaeda, and said Saudi citizens must not go abroad to fight or give the rebels money except via government channels. The 53 signatories, including prominent Islamists with a history of opposing the government, were careful not to contradict that message by directly calling on Saudis to join the jihad, but they also did not speak out against travel for jihad. Their letter, which used sectarian terms for both Iran and Assad's Alawite sect, a Shi'ite offshoot, also portrayed Russian involvement as part of an Orthodox Christian crusade, and attacked the West for denying the rebels anti-aircraft weapons. The statement said: ""The Western-Russian coalition with the Safavids (Iran) and the Nusairis (Alawites) are making a real war against the Sunni people and their countries.""","Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/ISIS-610417.jpg,"['syria', 'jihad', 'war', 'iran', 'muslim', 'islamist', 'state', 'saudi', 'russia', 'countries', 'saudis', 'islamic', 'statement', 'sunni', 'clerics']", 
44,44,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Ethiopia: It Is Becoming Ubiquitous – A Boon or Bane? - Geeska Afrika,https://www.geeskaafrika.com/ethiopia-it-is-becoming-ubiquitous-a-boon-or-bane/,"Nairobi (HAN) October 19, 2015 – Public Diplomacy and Regional Investment Initiative News. By Asmamaw Getaneh. The merit and demerit of Khat must be well identified Long back, in Ethiopia, especially in the majority of small towns and in rural parts, chewing Khat was quite strange, and even it was considered as a deviation from normal behavior, culture, norm and social cohesion. Today, the prevailing attitude for the majority turns out to be quite the contrary.

Chewing Khat is spreading fast in almost all urban areas and in some rural localities. The demand for those hypnotic leaves is ever on the rise; it can better be characterized as inelastic—prices of Khat do show insignificant variation in response to the market supply. Consequently, more and more farmers are taking on growing Khat as a basic source of income as the market for it is so lucrative that several farmers are replacing their vegetable gardens with Khat production.

Surprisingly, a quarter of a century ago, chewing Khat used to be taken a perilous addiction, and the market for Khat was limited mostly to certain parts of the country especially in urban areas. Addicts were construed to be more eccentric and irrecoverably possessed by their risky habits of using stimulant substances such as smoking tobacco and chewing of Khat. With a steadily rising demand, the production of Khat can have considerable potentialities to configure the traditional vegetable and fruit cultivation in rural areas wherever this cash crop can grow.

As one of the major cash crops, the contribution of Khat towards national revenue, especially if it is produced on a large scale, is quite promising. From the point of view of production, Khat provides certain better opportunities to growers. In relative terms, the production of Khat requires less water.

Khat grows well in hot climatic regions, and has superb drought resisting capabilities. It also requires less labor and other inputs compared to the production of say vegetables or fruits. Moreover, depending on suitability of soil and climatic conditions, producers can have three or more harvests in one year. This gives Khat growers good opportunities to supplement their incomes, particularly to producers in rural areas where there is lack of irrigation opportunities and thus harvests are limited to once a year.

Again, Khat sells at far better prices than most vegetable products. Khat also gives better yields per unit of farmland. Due to these and other benefits it renders, the production of Khat is slowly but surely exhibiting increasing trends. Provided that current demand is sustained in the long run, the market for qhat will grow more and more lucrative and production is likely to rise.

Nevertheless, there is an existing dilemma towards the burgeoning consumption of Khat and the profitable market thereon. Chewing Khat is a waxing whirlpool which takes a disquieting proportion of the youth in the urban areas the vortex of addiction. Khat often when the rising use of Khat is a topic on the plate, there is a tendency to associate it towards the unemployed youth as a perturbing social dilemma.

The latent assumption is that these groups of youth resort to chewing Khat as an option to pass time and fend off the depressive effects of boredom. Nonetheless, the consumption of Khat is quite widespread within other cross-sections of the society. Foremost among these are university students, teachers, merchants, night shift workers in pubs and nightclubs, and high school students who prepare for exams. With the community of students, consumption of khat exhibits significant seasonal variation, the peak times being exam periods. Chewing khat cannot be as such taken as an option by the unemployed simply because they could not have the money to afford for it. Through time, chewing khat is spreading into wider sections of our society.

The fact that significant numbers of university students and teachers are resorting to increasing consumption of khat has strong implications for other parts of the society, mainly for students in secondary schools. Undeniably, the university community is accorded a higher place by the society as a source of scientific knowledge and of highly educated citizens. Consequently, behaviors of students taken on by university students do have exemplary influences on prospective university entrants and students in secondary schools. When teachers come into the scene, the dilemma towards chewing chat steps up into sizeable magnitudes. Why should chewing qhat be considered as a potential problem while a growing number of the educated are allured into it?

A much more concern would be the amount of time frittered away in chewing khat. While time is such a scarce resource, it is quite disheartening to hear people claim that they chew qhat, and drink alcohol just to ‘pass’ their time. This trend is indeed dangerous especially when it is deemed so by the youth.

Those who chew khat waste away a great deal of time sitting idle. A growing body of the youth is wasting away precious time, as much as 4 or 5 hours a day, especially in the afternoons. Chewing khat induces users to drinking, consumption of other related drugs, promotes unproductive use of time, and has the potential to increase the likelihood of violence and crime.

While the market for khat is so lucrative, khat houses are also providing other drugs, both mild and strong for users. Hence the khat market has considerable potentials to pave the way for the market for other drugs. No doubt that the extensive use and unchecked regulation of qhat and other drugs would be dogged by devastating consequences as has been witnessed in other parts of the world such as Mexico.

More important however is the dilemma as to whether or not khat is considered as one of the drugs. On the one hand, khat is a cash crop, and contributes substantially to the national revenue. If so, discouraging and banning would be self-defeating. Allowing it, or even legalizing it might be better, but the trend is very hazardous in the long-run. To follow an indifferent approach with no clear strategy as to the issue of drugs would not evidently be a viable choice.

There would be no option to deal with problems when they arise. Hence there has to be clear legal provisions as to the use and circulation of khat and similar other substances. With the trends of current demand continuing, the price of khat will definitely rise which makes it downright expensive for the poor. Addiction is unlikely to be broken within the short-run, hence an upward trend for the use of khat and other related stimulant substances. The only thing that has toned down the problem of khat consumption insignificant in our country is the fact that it is not illegal.

In conclusion then, what would be our approach towards the rising consumption of khat in our country? Do we have a clear and comprehensive strategy to deal with the booming qhat market, and the swelling demand for those miraculous leaves? Or should we continue indifferent to the existing dilemma?

In my opinion, it is high time that we develop clear strategies towards the emerging khat market and the mounting demand for it. There has to be a consensus as to the use of khat and the disparate yet expanding market for it. The ambivalent perception towards the existing consumption of khat should not be allowed to continue into the future until it may soon or later pose insurmountable challenges to legislation.

We have to work out clear answers whether chewing khat should be legalized or outlawed. If the consumption of khat is prohibited by law, so too should be the domestic market for it. If legal prohibition of khat would open the Pandora’s Box, we have to formulate a clear strategy supported by the necessary legislation.","Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.geeskaafrika.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/khat-ethiopia-1.jpg,"['ubiquitous', 'demand', 'students', 'university', 'khat', 'production', 'consumption', 'chewing', 'clear', 'market', 'drugs', 'ethiopia']", 
45,45,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Famine Has Always Had A Hold Of Africa's Horn | JimmaTimes.com - Jimma Times,https://www.jimmatimes.com/famine-has-always-had-a-hold-of-africas-horn/,"In many parts of northeastern Africa, the spring rains have not arrived for three years — triggering massive crop failures and threatening almost 16 million people with starvation. Thousands have already died; about 400 people are now dying each month in Gode alone. Wars in the region are preventing the delivery of food; in some places, men with Kalashnikov rifles, patrolling what remains of watering holes, turn away people dying of thirst. Nomads, many little more than wandering skeletons, walk for days in search of relief workers with food. Others sit, exhausted, and wait for death to find them.

Children are the first to die. At a makeshift shelter in the town of Denan, 110 km southeast from Gode, mothers holding their malnourished children stare blankly into space. The children are often too sick to eat. When one mother tries to force-feed her baby daughter, the formula drips down the little girl’s chest. The baby’s eyelids flicker, and nearing death she drops her head — just as an aid worker directs another woman to a mat where a child had just succumbed.

United Nations officials first warned of the impending famine last year, when the rains did not arrive for the second time. Since then, food aid has been slow in coming — an eerie parallel with the famine of 15 years ago that killed nearly one million people in Ethiopia. Aid organizations have accused donors of dragging their feet, just as they did in 1984 when relief efforts did not kick into full gear until television broadcast the tragedy and musicians tugged at the world’s conscience with the poignant songs Do They Know It’s Christmas? and We Are the World.

As it was 15 years ago, violence is also complicating aid efforts. Ethiopia has been fighting a 23-month-long border war with neighbouring Eritrea. The fighting has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and cost Ethiopia an estimated $1 billion. Even with widespread starvation looming, the government last year tripled its defence budget to $700 million. “They shouldn’t be fighting a war over a small patch of land when their own people are starving,” says John O’Shea, the head of Goal, an Irish aid group in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “It’s a savage war and it’s taking a lot of resources away from the aid effort.”

Donors, particularly some European nations, have been reluctant to make good on their pledges of aid, partly for fear of it being diverted to the battlefront. But as images of children reduced to skeletons reach Western television screens, donors are also aware they run the risk of appearing callous by withholding aid. Most are now stressing that the military and humanitarian situations are separate — and are loosening their purse strings while exhorting Ethiopia to end the hostilities. But the Ethiopian government makes no apologies for continuing the war. “We do not believe that protecting one’s sovereignty,” says Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia’s prime minister, “is a luxury for the rich alone.”

Canada, which recently committed $16 million to the Ethiopian aid effort, intends to ensure that the 24,000 tonnes of food and medicine it supplies reach those who need it. Maria Minna, minister for international co-operation, said that when the aid arrives, it will be turned over to the United Nations and leading relief organizations like Oxfam for distribution. To ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands, Minna said Ottawa will go one step further. “We plan to hire monitors to make sure the food is delivered to those it should go to,” said Minna, who spoke to Maclean’s from Senegal where she was attending an education conference last week. “So we will follow the grain to the people.”

Aid agencies say they need about one million tonnes of food to deal with the current crisis. International pledges currently stand at 800,000 tonnes, a very significant increase from a month ago when they stood at only 400,000 tonnes. And Minna is hopeful that enough food will get through to slow the growing humanitarian disaster. “We are ahead of the curve,” she said, “and this is why we are shipping now.”

Delivery, though, is bogged down in a logistical nightmare. Landlocked Ethiopia has dismissed an Eritrean offer to use Assab, Eritrea’s main port, to receive shipments. Aid will have to be taken through a port in the neighbouring country of Djibouti, which is capable of handling only 150,000 tonnes per month — much less than Assab. Canada will spend $250,000 as part of an international effort to upgrade the port in Djibouti, but roads into Ethiopia are in terrible shape and it could still take months to get food to the people in greatest need.

Violence is also slowing food delivery in other areas of east Africa. In Somalia, where 1.5 million people are at risk of starvation, fighting between rival militias has resulted in the suspension of emergency food supplies. In Sudan, 1.7 million people are facing starvation, but because of the country’s protraWected civil war, relief is not getting through to some areas. Ethiopia, meanwhile, is fighting the Oromo Liberation Front in the country’s southern region. And there are now fears that the drought will get worse, with weather forecasts indicating that this year the rains will fail to arrive once again. And that will surely lead to more death by starvation across the region.","Sat, 10 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.jimmatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/africashorn-300x273.jpg,"['hold', 'million', 'aid', 'war', 'minna', 'famine', 'tonnes', 'food', 'starvation', 'relief', 'africas', 'fighting', 'horn', 'ethiopia']", 
46,46,DR-2015-000134-SOM,A Journey To Harar | JimmaTimes.com - Jimma Times,https://www.jimmatimes.com/a-journey-to-harar/,"I had come to Harar with a small group from Addis Ababa, which lies about 250 miles to the east, about a twelve-hour journey by road in good conditions. We chose to take the more widely preferred route, a flight into Dire Dawa, Ethiopia’s second-largest city. Located 35 miles west of Harar, Dire Dawa was established as Addis Harar (New Harar) in 1902 as the main rail station between Addis and Djibouti. (There are currently plans to refurbish the royal railcars used by Haile Selassie for an Orient Express–style excursion train on the line.)

On the mountain road from the airport, we passed several villages, workmen chipping stone by the roadside, and herds of cattle being driven to new pastures and markets. In the village of Aw Wadai, we paused to join the people congregated for market. The main commodities offered were fruits, vegetables, and the leaves of a mildly addictive though stimulating plant called chat (qat). Muslims are not allowed alcoholic drinks, but some spend their spare time hazily chewing chat.

Before entering Harar, we took a side road to a point overlooking the city. Its impressive walls and gates are intact, although Harar has clearly outgrown itself. New buildings, shops, and most of the non- Muslim population are located outside the old walls. Circling back to enter the city we passed Badr Beri, one of the original sixteenth- century gates. The area is relatively peaceful, with a few people walking in and out. The gate is now always open, but a look inside reveals that it was a double gate. If any invaders managed to get past the first gate, they would probably have received a rude greeting at the second one.

Harar is Ethiopia’s only walled city, its streets so narrow that they must be negotiated on foot. Historically it was a center of Muslim learning and today houses the world’s largest concentration of mosques, around ninety in all. The majority of those living within the walls are Muslim, and those walls have long been considered a symbol of the sanctuary Harar offered Muslims from Christian and animist attacks. That sense of protectiveness today extends toward tourism. Though the city wants to encourage visitors, holy Muslim sites are not made available, and it is not considered appropriate for outsiders to visit mosques.

Ethiopia has been Christian since the fourth century and has strong connections to the Egyptian Coptic Church. Ethiopians even claim that their emperors, up to and including Haile Selassie, were descended from Menelik I, the son the queen of Sheba bore to King Solomon. What I had not realized was that Ethiopia is also strongly Muslim. About 45 percent of the population is Christian, but an equal number are Muslim. (The remaining 10 percent are animist.) Ethiopia also boasts a direct link to the Prophet Muhammad. When the prophet was being persecuted for his faith in Allah, the One God, he sent some of his family to Axum, at that time the capital in northern Ethiopia. He called the Ethiopians “godly people” and knew his relatives would be safe there.

Even after the prophet’s death in 632, relations with Axum remained cordial. By 732, the Islamic empire had spread through Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain. The Kingdom of Axum was exempt from the jihad, or holy war of conversion. The Arabs considered Axum to be on a par with their own Islamic state, Byzantium, and China one of the world’s great kingdoms. Gradually Muslim traders established outposts along the coast of East Africa, from present-day Djibouti and Somalia south, further isolating the Axumite Kingdom.

During this time, the trading village of Harar was established, with emirs ruling from the tenth century. Over seventy of them are recorded, the most notable being Ahmed Gragn. From 1520 until 1560, Gragn and his nephew (Nur Ibn al-Wazir) launched a series of raids that nearly caused the collapse of the Christian empire. It was at that time that the walls of Harar were constructed to keep out the Oromo tribe, which had occupied much of southern Ethiopia due to a Muslim-Christian conflict.

Harar was an important center of Muslim trade and learning into the nineteenth century. The emirs even sent Islamic missionaries educated here to many parts of the world. But because only Muslims were allowed to enter Harar, many rumors grew up concerning it. The first European to penetrate its seclusion was the noteworthy British explorer Richard Burton (disguised as a Turkish trader) in 1854. He spent an uneasy ten days within Harar’s walls, at considerable personal risk. A more widely known foreign visitor was the French poet (and gunrunner) Arthur Rimbaud, who resided in Harar for a tumultuous ten years. The house associated with his time there is now promoted as a tourist attraction.

A world within itself

Harar’s independence ended in 1875. The city was captured by Egyptian forces, and its ruling emir was killed. Egyptian occupation collapsed in 1884, but in 1887 Harar was captured by the future emperor, Menelik II. He headed off religious warfare by naming several members of the emir’s family to his new administration, under a Christian governor named Ras Makonnen. He would be the father of Ras Tafari, the future Emperor Haile Selassie.

Despite Harar’s often turbulent past, most of its original wall remains. The wall can be observed from the road that follows the city’s perimeter. Some sections were rebuilt by the Egyptians and, more recently, the Italians. The parts that look newer are often in fact the older ones, with fresh paint or plaster added. We toured the city by entering through the Argo Gate, wandering about until we emerged at the Duke Beri Gate. We then made a quick trip to the Asedin (or Lion Faith) Gate. This portal, built by Emir Nur, is over four hundred years old; Bab al Nasr (Gate of Victory) is written on it in Arabic. Close by is the brand-new Belayneh Hotel, which opened in 1995. The gate marks the location of the chief outdoor market in the area. Bustling with men in mostly western clothing and women in black skirts or long, colorful dresses and head scarves, the market appears to have almost no physical structures or stalls, just piles of produce for sale. The area is permeated by the smell of animals waiting to be sold for ritual slaughter. But anything from vegetables to a laptop computer is available here, if you know to ask the right person.

Although visitors are not encouraged to explore Harar’s extraordinary number of active mosques, the city does offer several other places of interest. One is the former emir’s palace, which is now a museum. We also had the opportunity to share a meal in a “typical” Harar Muslim family home. The main room featured a raised platform where meals were taken, and family hierarchy was indicated by seating arrangements. On the walls were hung huge oval pots and bowls used for transporting food to other homes for festivals, weddings, major family occasions, or just visits. The pots were made of metal, clay, or reeds. The reed pots and their cone-shaped lids were woven in geometric patterns of orange, black, and dark earth colors.

Another attraction is the restored Rimbaud House. The house is inside a courtyard next to a whitewashed wall. A few blocks away is a small museum, kept in a school administrative building. There are spears and guns from Harar’s past and some paintings rescued from Haile Selassie’s reign, including a sign that once hung over the newest (Duke Beri) gate. But such relics really do not capture the city’s heart. “When you thought of Ethiopia, what images came to mind?” I asked myself. In modern times, it has been the nation where hundreds of thousands died of famine in the mid-1980s, due to drought and the deliberate mismanagement of food supplies by the Marxist government. More recently, of course, there has been the civil war with Eritrea. But in Harar, I encountered a world within itself, steeped in a culture uniquely protected within its own walls.

“Harar is a city with a rich history and high civilization,” Mohammed Garad, a native of Harar and now counselor-in-chief of trade and investment at the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington, D.C., comments to me. “I grew up near the Lion Gate and attended Islamic schools here before going to university in Addis Ababa. My class graduated in 1973, and we were the last to receive our degrees directly from Haile Selassie before he was overthrown. But I am most proud of the fact that my home city, because of its legacy of Qur’anic schools and the many teachers it sent into the world, is considered one of the four holy cities of Islam (with Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem). This city holds a special place within Islamic culture and heritage.”","Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.jimmatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ajourney-300x210.jpg,"['gate', 'muslim', 'harar', 'city', 'christian', 'haile', 'walls', 'islamic', 'ethiopia', 'family', 'journey']",

I am privileged to be given this opportunity to present the Second H.R. Khanna Memorial Lecture.

I remember the days of Emergency when we, the public, were very unaware of what was happening as there was total censorship of newspapers.

During the height of emergency, the people of the country were wholly unaware of what was happening in regard to the challenges which would have an impact upon the future of the country. During these times, I myself had appeared in various political detention matters in the Karnataka High Court and in matters such as the dismissal of the Karunanidhi Government on 31st January, 1976 just before the General Elections were to be held in Tamil Nadu State, really with intention of eliminating the political rival in the State. If any attempt was made by newspaper to publish any of the news relating to challenges to the Central Government, the censure would straightway cut it out and there would be a white blank triangle, square or rectangle where the news would appear. Where the newspaper enclosed a blank square in a black border depicting important news, the censure would have even the black border removed.

It was in this atmosphere of fear that one person stood out in defence of the Constitution and for the liberty of the individual. It was Justice H.R. Khanna who was prepared to declare in his dissent that notwithstanding the suspension of the Right to Life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution or the Right to Equality in Article 14 of the Constitution or the various freedoms contained in Article 19 of the Constitution, nevertheless no person could be detained without authority of law or contrary to law.

When this judgment was delivered, Justice H.R. Khanna had no doubt, whatsoever, that though he was the senior-most Judge, he would stand superseded, but, nevertheless he went ahead and delivered his dissent. As expected, he was superseded, and he straightway submitted his resignation as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

I was in Madras at the time when my friends at the Bar in Delhi informed me about this great Judge who had upheld, during the time of Emergency, the human values which permeate the Justice delivery system. The New York Times, in its issue of 30th April 1976 declared:

If India ever finds its way back to the freedom and democracy that were proud hallmarks of its first eighteen years as an independent nation, someone will surely erect a monument to Justice H.R. Khanna of the Supreme Court.

No statue was put up in the Supreme Court, but in Court No.2, a life size portrait of his was put up so that even now, the new generation of advocates would notice it and ask who it is. They would then be told the entire history of his battle to uphold the basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution even though the fundamental rights to life and to equality had been suspended during the Emergency.

Almost a quarter of a century later, it is but fitting that we remember Justice Khanna’s legacy through this commemorative lecture of the Indian Institute of Public Administration on “The Rule of Law and Human Rights in India”. Both “Rule of Law” and “Human Rights” are familiar phrases, which all of us have often heard, but when we delve into the subject, we find that different thinkers and jurists have understood them in a variety of different ways. Justice H.R. Khanna himself, in his autobiography titled “Neither Roses nor Thorns” - a clear reference to another great Judge, late Justice M.C. Chagla, the title of whose autobiography was “Roses in December” - mentioned that:

If there are three prime requisites for the rule of law, they are a strong Bar, an independent judiciary and an enlightened public opinion. There can, indeed be no greater indication of decay in the rule of law than a docile Bar, a subservient judiciary and a society with a choked or coarsened conscience.

The Indian Parliament has also defined Human Rights, in The Protection of Human Rights Act 1993, to mean:

The rights relating to life and liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by Courts in India.

The International covenants which would be relevant for the purpose would be the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which, as proclaimed by the United Nations in 1948, in Article 1, itself sums up the basic doctrine on which Human Rights are founded, namely: all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”

The Declaration includes various civil and political rights, which we find enshrined in Part-III of our Constitution which was adopted the year after the Universal Declaration (the Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949). However, in addition to these basic civil and political rights, it has also incorporated in Part-IV of the Constitution what are generally viewed as ‘socio-economic rights’. For instance, it is expressly stated in Article 23 of the Declaration that “everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment; everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work; everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.” Again, Article 25 of the Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age.” Under Article 26, “Everyone has the right to education which shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages”. And finally, Article 8 of the Declaration speaks of “Access to justice for enforcement of these fundamental rights”.

Many of these socio-economic rights found in the Universal Declaration like, the right to work, to education, to live, to nutrition, standard of living and all adequate means of livelihood are all found in our Constitution in the Directive Principles of State Policy which, in terms of Article 37 of the Constitution, as stated - “are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws”.

However, if one were to dispassionately consider the ground reality, one would find a very different and stark picture. Even though 60 years have elapsed since the adoption of the Constitution, we are faced with the grim reality of over 30% of the population of this country being subjected to dire poverty. India is crippled, in my view, by staggering poverty, which results in grave hunger, malnutrition and disease. While the rule of law may have come to be accepted as part of the basic structure of our constitutional system, to my mind, it is difficult to argue that the rule of law is a core value so long as millions of Indians are not free from want. Poverty in India constitutes, at the most fundamental level, a denial of the rule of law. The reality is that the Constitution’s promise of equality rings hollow for an unconscionably large section of Indian society even today.

It is true that we are fed, on an almost daily basis, with the idea of an India that is fast emerging as an economic powerhouse. No less a person than the President of the United States, on his recent visit to India, had remarked, in his address to the India Parliament that “India is not simply emerging. India,” he said, “has already emerged.” This statement was greeted with enthusiasm and self-congratulation in wide sections of the media and by the public. One may not have to look very far to see what inspired the U.S. President to say these words: a clutch of high-profile, high-value acquisitions of foreign firms by Indian companies, with just the top ten high value acquisitions so far being worth around USD 21.5 billion which is more than double the amount involved in the acquisitions of Indian companies by American companies; foreign direct investment in India, till November 2010, totaling to USD 140 billion; and an average quarterly GDP growth rate of 8.4% for the period 2004 – 2010, reaching a high of 10.10% in September 2006. India’s economy, as one article put it, has had its head in the clouds (As India’s clout grows it will reshape the world around it, The Economist, 29 September 2008).

This headline-grabbing growth unfortunately masks a quite different reality. A few kilometres beyond the plush five-star luxury and swanky board-rooms that the U.S. President visited in Bombay, is a rusty sprawl of shanties where grinding poverty prevails. With the incessant hype about India’s triumphant arrival on the global stage, it is perhaps easy to lose sight of the fact that India, according to latest UN statistics, is home to 410 million people living below the UN estimated poverty line of $1.25 a day, an increase of a 100 million from the year 2004. What this means in real terms is that no less than 410 million Indians (or about 37.2 per cent. of India's population) cannot afford two square meals a day that meet minimal nutritional needs.

According to a new 'multi-dimensional' poverty index developed by the United Nations Development Programme, acute poverty in eight Indian States (400 million, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) together account for more poor people than in the 26 poorest African nations combined (410 million, including war-ravaged Somalia and Sierra Leone). The new measure takes into account not only per capita income but also access to resources, education and medical care.

There was a view in the 1950s and 1960s, dominant amongst Western sceptics that India was too vast, too poor and too diverse to succeed as a nation. Born against a background of privation and civil war, divided along lines of caste, class, language and religion, independent India has defied numerous prophets of doom who believed that its poverty and heterogeneity would force it to break up or come under autocratic rule. Today, India can be justifiably proud of its vibrant democracy, its strongly secular tradition and its fiercely independent judiciary which has breathed life into the promises of the Constitution.

At the same time, in the face of daunting statistics on poverty, hunger, malnourishment, starvation deaths, illiteracy and lack of medical care, one cannot help but wonder: of what use is the lofty rhetoric on the right to life to a starving child in rural Chattisgarh or a homeless person on the streets of Delhi? Do India’s constitutional guarantees truly have meaning for those who suffer great deprivation of basic needs?

I must say, therefore, that while the discourse on human rights has usually focussed on civil and political rights, and their deprivation, such as violations of personal liberty without authority of law, rights of undertrial prisoners and so on, to my mind, the failure of the State, over the period of the last six decades, to eradicate the abject poverty which more than a third of the population of this country has to suffer, and to ensure that all its citizens are extended the minimum benefits of nutritious food and basic healthcare, is the single most important violation of human rights of our citizens. To repeat, one would ask oneself the question as to what purpose the rights such as freedom of speech, equality and access to justice would serve when a person has to suffer debilitating hunger and end his day without a meal, be unable to access the basic health services, and be compelled to sleep on pavements at the height of winter with only a sheet to cover himself - in other words, suffer what can only be termed as a mere animal existence.

It is not as if the three organs of the State have not made any effort to address the problems of poverty, hunger and disease, and the consequent denial of human rights. Each has been attempting to take steps to remedy the rather appalling situation that India finds itself in. For instance, The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 was enacted by Parliament to meet the national as well as international demand for the constitution of the National Human Rights Commission, State Human Rights Commissions in the States and Human Rights Courts for a holistic protection of human rights. In addition, innumerable laws have been enacted to implement some of the Directive Principles of State enshrined in Part IV of our Constitution and these laws strive and aim at protecting and promoting human rights. Some noteworthy instances are the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2006, which guarantees a minimum employment of 100 days each year to eligible adults, and the Right to Education Act, 2009, which guarantees the right to education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14. The task of implementing the policies incorporated in the various laws made by Parliament, and the State Legislatures, falls on the shoulders of the executive wing of the State.

However, it is really the judiciary in India, especially the higher judiciary, which really stands out as the institution which has exhibited the most concern, understanding, as well as positive action in the field of human rights. The Supreme Court of India has, through its various pronouncements, enhanced the coverage of the various rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It was Justice P.N. Bhagwati, who, in Francis’s Coralie’s case, declared that the “right to life is not a mere right to life under Article 21 and cannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It means much more than just physical survival and that further that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in adverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and mingling with fellow human beings…. there is implicit in Article 21 the right to protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

The Court has forged remedies and brought about dramatic and

far-reaching changes. For instance, in Hussainara Khatoon (III) v. State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 108, the Court stated:

2…The Government in a social welfare State must set up rescue and welfare homes for the purpose of taking care of women and children who have nowhere else to go and who are otherwise uncared for by the society. It is the duty of government to protect women and children who are homeless or destitute… We direct that all women and children who are in the jails in the State of Bihar under ‘protective custody’ or who are in jail because their presence is required for giving evidence or who are victims of offence should be released and taken forthwith to welfare homes or rescue homes and should be kept there and properly looked after.

8…We, therefore, direct the Government of Bihar to inquire into these cases and where it is found that the investigation has been going on for a period of more than six months without satisfying the Magistrate that for special reasons and in the interest of justice the continuation of the investigation beyond the period of six months is necessary, the Government of Bihar will release the undertrial prisoners, unless the necessary orders of the Magistrate are obtained within a period of one month from today.

Shantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal Totame, (1990) 1 SCC 520



Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted to be three — food, clothing and shelter. The right to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right to decent environment and a reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect — physical, mental and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller development of every child. That would be possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable house but a reasonable home particularly for people in India can even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-built fire-proof accommodation.



Mohini Jain (Miss) v. State of Karnataka, (1992) 3 SCC 666



Right to life” is the compendious expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens. The “right to education”, therefore, is concomitant to the fundamental rights enshrined under Part III of the Constitution. The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens. The educational institutions must function to the best advantage of the citizens. Opportunity to acquire education cannot be confined to the richer section of the society.



People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, (1982) 3 SCC 235

6… But apart altogether from the requirement of Convention 59, we have Article 24 of the Constitution which provides that no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. This is a constitutional prohibition which, even if not followed up by appropriate legislation, must operate proprio vigore and construction work being plainly and indubitably a hazardous employment, it is clear that by reason of this constitutional prohibition, no child below the age of 14 years can be allowed to be engaged in construction work . There can therefore be no doubt that notwithstanding the absence of specification of construction industry in the Schedule to the Employment of Children Act, 1938, no child below the age of 14 years can be employed in construction work and the Union of India as also every State Government must ensure that this constitutional mandate is not violated in any part of the country.

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, (1984) 3 SCC 161



Moreover, when a complaint is made on behalf of workmen that they are held in bondage and are working and living in miserable conditions without any proper or adequate shelter over their heads, without any protection against sun and rain, without two square meals per day and with only dirty water from a nullah to drink, it is difficult to appreciate how such a complaint can be thrown out on the ground that it is not violative of the fundamental right of the workmen. It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country, assured under the interpretation given to Article 21 by this Court in Francis Mullin case1to live with human dignity, free from exploitation. This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Articles 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State — neither the Central Government nor any State Government — has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials.



There is no area of human endeavour with regard to which the Supreme Court has not sought to bring its judicial activism to bear to bring relief to those whose human rights have been infringed.

A very significant step, undertaken by the Supreme Court, in my view, is the exercise to extend to the poverty stricken population the ‘right to food’. In April 2001, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL, Rajasthan) filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking legal enforcement of the right to food, a basic human rights issue.

The legal basis of the right to food has also been underscored by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In the course of a hearing held on 17 January 2003, it has declared:

Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The expression ‘life’ in this Article has been judicially interpreted to mean a life with human dignity and not mere survival or animal existence. In the light of this, the State is obliged to provide for all those minimum requirements which must be satisfied in order to enable a person to live with human dignity, such as education, health care, just and humane conditions of work, protection against exploitation, etc. In the view of the Commission, the right to food is inherent to a life with dignity, and Article 21 should be read with Articles 39(a) and 47 to understand the nature of the obligation of the State in order to ensure the effective realization of this right(Article 39(a) of the Constitution enunciated as one of the Directive Principles, fundamental in the governance of the country, requires the State to direct its policy towards securing that citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood. Article 47 spells out the duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people as a primary responsibility).

The reading of Article 21 together with Articles 39(a) and 47 places the issue of food security in the correct perspective, thus making the right to food a guaranteed fundamental right which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under Article 32 of the Constitution.

The NHRC went on to state that “there is a fundamental right to be free from hunger”. PUCL’s petition was filed at a time when the country’s food stocks reached unprecedentedly high levels while hunger in drought-affected areas intensified. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the Food Corporation of India, and six state governments in the context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to the larger issues of chronic hunger and under-nutrition and all the state governments were added to the list of respondents.

Despite the interventions of an activist Supreme Court, almost every national social-security programme, theoretically serving as cradle-to-grave buffers against destitution, has been racked by failure. For instance, most tribals who are officially poor have no access to five major national schemes (subsidised food, child health care, mid-day meals, jobs for work and old-age pensions) on which India is slated to spend Rs 118,000 crores in 2010-11. This is illustrative of a deepening gulf between legal entitlements and ground realities.

A grim reminder of the depth of deprivation in the country recently emerged from a village, Ganne, in its most populous state, Uttar Pradesh (UP). The front page of a national newspaper recently reported that malnourished children in Ganne have been eating moist lumps of mud laced with silica - a raw material for glass sheets and soap - because they are not officially classified as poor and are therefore ineligible for subsidised food and other state programmes. The state governments came forward with a cruel and unbelievable defence - that the children were eating mud out of habit, and not hunger.

In Ganne, which is incidentally part of the former constituency of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, the effects of a faltering system are evident. 33% of the villagers are tribal, another 30% schedule castes, driven out of the jungle when forests were cleared for “development”. Many of the BPL cards in Ganne have been issued to rich or influential families. Two anganwadis (child health centres) serve the area. They are too distant for the villagers. It is a twelve-kilometre walk from the nearest road. With most land being unfit for cultivation, villagers have little choice but to work in the silica mines for exploitative contractors under conditions close to bonded labour.

They are not covered by any labour laws or medical benefits. Nine of ten mud-eating children are in the last stage of malnutrition. Eight of ten people are deprived of every national social-security net and starvation and hunger are their constant companions. The average life span of the people here is 40 years(Hunger stares you in the face, Samar Halarnkar, Hindustan Times, 28 May 2010).

A Supreme Court inquiry team that visited the area following the newspaper report had this to say:

A grim, catastrophic picture emerges from enquiry of commission (sic)…there is a total collapse of food-security related schemes,” said the report, recommending several “emergency measures” in up to 46 villages. “Protruding stomach, dry, whitish hair, ashen skin, skinny children — hunger stares you in the face.

The day after the Supreme Court’s enquiry team’s report was made public, the state government, as already pointed out, refuted this assessment, saying ""habit, not hunger"" made children eat mud. The report attributes the crisis to “apathy, insensitivity, nexus between vested interests and elected representatives with active approval of administration and state”. Written by Arundhati Dhuru, an advisor to the Supreme Court, and noted economist Jean Drèze, the report is the latest indicator of the frailty of India’s vast but inefficient and corruption-ridden social-security systems.

The Supreme Court, in some of its landmark pronouncements, has taken the view that the Government is under a constitutional obligation to provide healthcare facilities to For instance, in Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India, (1987) 2 SCC 165, the Court observed:

A healthy body is the very foundation for all human activities. That is why the adage “Sariramadyam Khaludharma Sadhanam”. In a welfare State, therefore, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health.

Again, in State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla, (1997) 2 SCC 83, the Court stated that:

It is now settled law that right to health is integral to the right to life. Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities.

The problem is, for all its talk of pro-poor policies, the Indian government’s overall expenditure on health until the fiscal year 2000-01 did not even amount to 1% of total GDP. Public expenditure on health for the current fiscal year (2009-10) is expected to be a measly 1.45%, according to figures published by the Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

According to a study published by the World Health Organisation, aggregate government expenditure on health by all central government departments (health, defence, labour, etc.), state departments, local bodies and public enterprises amounts to 1.3% of India’s GDP for each of the years from 1999 to 2002. On the other hand, public spending on health in the year 2002 even by relatively poorer African governments, for instance, in Rwanda and Senegal exceeded India’s, amounting, respectively, to 3.1% and 2.3% of each country’s GDP.

Faced with the collapsing and/or woefully inadequate medical infrastructure in some of the poorest parts of India, one might well question the priorities of the leaders in Delhi and each of the state capitals. Surely the measure of the civilization of a nation lies, at least to some extent, in the way it cares for its sick and needy? There can be no greater irony than a country which loses no opportunity to advertise its world-class pharmaceutical and technological advancement to medical tourism but which does not have the wherewithal to care for its own most vulnerable citizens, thus grossly violating their human rights.

As the statistics quoted above will show, the goal of securing health for the poor is riddled with challenges at multiple levels: a lack of prioritization of the health sector vis-à-vis other sectors which receive (and have historically received) a greater share of public expenditure, a consequent paucity of resources, and finally, challenges stemming from faulty implementation, including leakages and other inefficiencies. These are ultimately largely policy questions within the domain of the legislature and the executive. At the same time, over the course of the last few years, orders of the Supreme Court in the “right to food” case have had some bearing on the right to health in the context of the government’s social security programmes.

Conclusion

India’s Constitution is celebrated the world over as an expression of progressive, liberal ideals symbolizing the hopes and aspirations of its founding fathers for a pluralistic society founded on values of democracy, secularism, equality and liberty. The Supreme Court has, in great measure, fulfilled its role as a vanguard of the Constitution, not only preserving and protecting the rights of individuals against arbitrary state action, but also asserting the rights of the vulnerable and weak in the face of glaring state inaction.

The Central Government cannot close its eyes to large-scale fraud in the public distribution system by taking the narrow constitutional position that implementation is each state’s responsibility. A shocking 58% of India’s subsidized food grain does not reach BPL families. After all, there are limits to what the court can achieve without decisive, collective action from every level of the administration if we are to make any

dent in the lives of the 410 million Indians who go to bed without a square meal a day. For so long as there are Indians who live in poverty and in want, the Constitution’s promise of rule of law is bereft of meaning, and human right of a vast population is reduced non-existent.

Long years ago, one of India’s greatest statesmen, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, remarked in his now legendary Tryst with Destiny speech, that the service of India means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. I will conclude with his words, to remind us, as he said, whither we will go and what shall be our endeavour:

There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.

It is a great tragedy that his vision and hope for India remain unfulfilled even after six decades of the working of the Constitution.

In may 2012, the Late Ethiopian dictator, Meles Zenawi, declared that Ethiopia would pump up gas out of the Ogaden in one year's time. That didn't happen. According to Wikipedia entry, the first exploration in the basin was undertaken by Standard Oil in 1920[2] More recent exploration by Tenneco resulted in the discovery of an estimated 68 million cubic metres (2.4 billion cubic feet) of gas in 1974.[2] China proposed to establish its own military base in O'bock , Djibouti near Bab al-Mandab straight, the strategic southern entrance to the Red Sea and the gateway to the Suez Canal. China understands the void of the Horn's old client ,Russia, and the importance of the Horn in terms of penetrating the Continent throughout Somalia's territorial waters, however, China is pursuing the same approach that led the failure of the Soviet Union instead of establishing itself a permanent position on the Indian and the Red Sea. China failed in Libya and South Sudan and will likely fail if it does not put all its efforts with Somalia and Somali speaking populations in the Horn amid to participate in the recourse of a strong central Somali government in Mogadishu. China will then have the upper hand and have a chance to avail its health and strong relationship with Somalis in the Horn, in doing so, it will get abundant natural resources including the country's untapped oil and gas reserves if she needs to be a superpower. Saudi Arabia and Israel met to discuss a number of international issues and they revealed that they had been in secret discussions for a year. In the discussion, they stated their interest in regard of the Ogaden oil and gas in Eastern parts of Occupied-Ogaden. Anwar Eshki, a retired major general in the Saudi armed forces, said in his speech about the Middle East and the Horn of Africa on June 4, 2015 that the Ogaden basin will unite the Horn of Africa under the Ethiopia"" (TPLF leadership). The source further said that Saudi Ben Laden Group could build a bridge across the Red Sea linking Yemen to Djibouti.Israel and Saudi would then be able to exploit the natural reserves in Ogaden."" Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have failed to learn the hostilities between the Somali ethnic population in Occupied-Ogaden and Ethiopian highlanders from Tigray and Amhara, an historical enmity that goes back the years of the Somali Adal Empire and Abyssinia's Aksumite Empire (14th Century-16th century). The book of ""Futuh Al-Habasha: The Conquest of Abyssinia"" would open their eyes if they wanted to learn the history of the Horn of Africa and the Ogaden region crisis.



Human rights abuses in the Ogaden region The massacres in the Ogaden have been described as ""genocide"" by the Genocide Watch. Rights Groups the likes, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accuse Ethiopia of heinous crimes and human rights violations in its military operation in the Horn of Africa's Ogaden region. The government denied the allegations yet unwilling to collaborate with a fact-finding Mission from the UN Human Rights body on its research for the human rights abuses allegedly committed by its soldiers stationed in Ogaden region. Over the last seven years, the Ethiopian government has initiated a genocidal campaign against the Ogadeni civilian population. The Ethiopian Defense Forces are using a systematic policy of intimidation, rape, assault and detention and deportation against Ogadeni civilians. Ten of thousands of people have fled to refugee camps in Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Yemen. According to the Genocide watch, The Ethiopian Army's counter-insurgency campaign in Ogaden has included numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Ethiopian government's policy in Ogaden is to suppress all demands for autonomy from Ogadenis. It has included gradual stationary of the population in IDP Camps-a policy Genocide Watch calls Genocide by attrition. The army has imposed an economic blockade on many towns and villages in the Ogaden. The government has restricted access of water, food and other necessities. Food is being used as a weapon of war. Massacres, torture, rape and disappearances are prevalent in the Ogaden region. Women and children are the most vulnerable groups to suffer abuses and violence. They are accused of being relatives of ONLF members. Thousands of people have been arrested without any charges and held in the notorious prisons in Ethiopia and Jail Ogaden particularly.

The TPLF-led regime imposed a ban on all international media and most of the aid workers including International Red Cross and doctors without borders had expelled the region.

The regime arrested and detained dozens of people that their relatives are outside of Ogaden. The Security forces ordered their return or they will remain in custody. Ethiopia executed catholic priests , subjugated Sidamas, Gambellas, Afars, Benishanguls and more than 40 million Oromos. Despite all these, it is silenced and never discussed the war and human rights violations in Ogaden and other places publicly. Mass refugees movements and UNHCR's involvement to support them

Hundreds of thousands fled from Ogaden region for the result of the forgotten war in Ogaden region. Dhabaab, Kenya alone hosts 100, 000 Ogadenis that fled from the war-torn region of Ogaden. Among of them are protracted refugees that UNHCR has been feeding since the 80s. While hundreds of them live in a number of other refugee camps in East Africa including Djibouti's Ali-Addeh, Eritrea's Emkulu Camp, among others. It is six decades conflict that the United Nations has failed to solve and even its humanitarian arm, UNHCR Yemen is wondering how to help several hundred Ogadeni political refugees currently caught up in the Yemen conflict to get a safer place.



According to the Director of the Royal African Society, Richard Dowden, in 1991 and 1992, The UN Refugee Agency did nothing for the Ogadeni refugees that found themselves in Ethiopia after they had escaped from their camps in Somalia-where they sought refuge during the Somalia -Ethiopia war over the control of the Ogaden in 1977-78. The UN allowed Ogadeni refugees mostly women and children to die in its camps inside Ethiopia's Ogaden region after the Derg regime rejected to accept them as ""classified returnees"" because of their Somali ethnicity -making among the highest ever recorded death rate. That incident did at least result in a change of the UNHCR mandate. The scenario is the same, UNHCR's protection counselling office in Sana'a sees considerable security threats for the lives of Ogadenis and others amid at Saudi-led bombardment and economic sanctions. Moreover, the office wanted to provide cash assistance to those lost their jobs since last March despite under-funding and to expedite dozens of families that referred to U.S, EU, Canada and Australia. Sweden and France were able to take in several families since last March. Even though, the UN office managed to contribute one time food-aid to some of the urban refugees in Sana'a last month since March , the humanitarian Agency needs to open its doors and build trust in terms of giving solace or receiving applications from those in dire straits that wanted to talk to UNHCR for the purpose of : Following up on their cases, reporting a protection problem, seeking material and medical assistance or to those willing to be considered their cases for resettlement since they could not return to their homelands due to well-founded fear of persecution and their hosted nation of Yemen is on war.

Both UNHCR Senior Officials based in Geneva and Aden aware of those hundred Ogadeni families in Kharez Camp-registered with the UN as refugees from Somalia-but have a different status. Among of them are survivors from the little known Banbalaayo massacres of 1991 and 1992. As a source from Rebecca Hinchey's research titled, ""Ogaden- A state of Decay"" reads: ""Banbalaayo, roughly translated means 'desert of hell'- thousands of Ogaden refugees-mostly women and children died in Hiiraan Province, South of Somalia when their camp came under attack, the Ogadenis showered with thousands of bullets. Many fell to the ground, died or dying, Those that did not try to run but their only option was to cross the river behind them. Only a few were able to swim. Some men survived, but almost all the women and children drowned."" The resumption of that past experience is one of their main concerns now. Dozens of families displaced in Sana'a and other parts of Yemen while others are wandering throughout Yemen.

The Liyuu or Special Police captured Dharwanaaje town at the outset of the war, prompting APLF leader Suldan Abubakar Elmi Waber to flee to Awdal State, a proposed autonomous state that borders, Djibouti, the Ogaden region and the Gulf of Aden.

The Somali regional President Abdi Iley and the commander in Chief of the notorious Liyuu (Special) Police is allegedly promised to award $3,000,000 (Three million US Dollars) for the extradition or the killing of Suldan Wabar, the leader of the APLF by the breakaway Somaliland administration.

Awdal state, which compromises the Awdal and Selel Provinces are drought-hit regions, and about 240,000 people are reportedly facing food insecurity and risk of famine due to the shortfall of the Gu' season i.e April and June rains between 2014 and 2015.

Mr. Wabar told Waagacusub Media that he knew the plot of the Somali regional President Abdi Iley and Siilaanyo Administration when he rejected an invitation from the Jigjiga administration before they raid his position.

Another source says that the Ethiopian Federal Armies intervened and forced the Liyuu Police to stop chasing the Awdal People's Liberation Front (APLF) since they are not threat to the Ethiopian interest.





Somaliland forces have been committing human rights abuses against the population in Awdal and Selel areas over the last 10 years. A football player was killed in Borama in Sunday last week 11 October 2015.

The RRU , Special forces of Somaliland Ina Ahmed Tiir ordered the killing of the innocent People from Gadabuursi Clan in Awdal State of Somalia.

52,52,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Somalia:The Biography of the current Minister for Information - Waagacusub Media,http://waagacusub.net/articles/980/SomaliaThe-Biography-of-the-current-Minister-for-Information,"Wagacusub Media will present for the biography of Minister Maareeye starting from the government of Premier Ali Mohamed Gedi when he was the Minister for reconciliation and he initially came from Burco town in the breakaway of Somaliland.

We shall also be focusing on his life time in the regions of the lower Jubba, Lower Shabelle and Banadir

When did he become tycoon and when did he become corrupted?

Minister Mareeye is Issaq tribe and his sub clan Habarjeclo and for the first time in his life he became financially stable during the reconciliation conference which was held at Xero Gadiid in the year 2007.

In that conference $500 was used to be given to the delegates on every Thursday, and the registration of the delegates was done none other than him.

He has registered a very big number of participants including harlots whom he used share the money with them.

Mareeye used to live in a villa house just opposite of the residential of Premier Gedi and there was a mother and her daughter from the marginalized clans who used to work in his house. During that time there was a man, who is now a deputy Minister who used to take heavy alcohols who used to live with him in the house, but Mareeye himself never used any sort of drugs whatsoever, but he used to have good time with young damsels

In the year 2007 he gave Visa to his wife his children and two other people who he sold to them and they have safely reached Germany.

His children handed themselves over to the government of Germany and among them was a sick boy whose name was Abdi Rabbi, his wife immediately went back to Kenya and from there went to Baidoa, and reliable sources told Wagacusub that time the wife was in absolute mood of jealousy, and it is still mysterious how she managed to go back without having valid travel documents.

However his wife in mental jealously condition and his son have once again handed themselves over to the Swedish government where they are till today.

Minister Mareeye is socially good person and grew up Jammame and Kuntuwareey locations, and he is tribal minded and corrupt person.

He has been for a longtime fighting for the position for being a Member of Parliament.

He become the Minister for Information, tourism and culture in the current cabinet of Ministers and there was a big challenge between him and another MP by the name Jamac Oday who is Habarjeclo. The Minister is not the kind of men who can abstain from corruption, he hasn’t paid the workers in his Ministry and instead he purchased a very expensive luxury car .

In 1974 a Marxist-Leninist military junta called the Derg seized power in Ethiopia, disposing Dictator Haile Selassie. A one-party communist state was established named the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The new regime suffered several coups and uprisings, while battling a major drought and a refugee crisis. A brief war with Somalia was won with the aid of the USSR and its allies. The resulting Red Terror was a government retribution campaign of forced deportations, torture, and starvation which claimed nearly half a million lives. In the 1980’s a series of famines which claimed another one million lives led to uprisings against the communist regime. When anti-communist revolutions swept Eastern Europe and communism began to collapse, aid from the USSR ceased. The regime was toppled in 1991, and in 2006 its leader Mengistu Haile Mariam was convicted of in Ethiopian courts of genocide.

Albania

Prior to World War II Albania was invaded and occupied by fascist Italy. When the Axis Powers were defeated, the anti-fascism movement inside Albania had taken on a socialist banner and would fight to establish The People’s Socialist Republic of Albania. After breaking with Yugoslavia in 1948, Albania became dependent on the Soviet Union for aid. The Soviet super-state subsidized economically failing nations like Albania by extracting from other territories. Like most Soviet states, Albania suffered poverty and hardship under socialist rule. Little Albania then became a political pawn in a game between the Chinese and the Soviets, resulting in a distanced relationship with the Soviet Union as Albania became part of China’s sphere of influence. Albania’s socialist government collapsed in 1990, leading to an untenable situation of social strife and desperate conditions. Massive emigration followed, as the strife led to armed conflict in 1997. Despite a rocky road and scandal that marred their first attempt at a democratic government, Albania established another democratic government in 1998 and have slowly been making their way out of the dark ages that socialism left them in.

Somalia

In 1969 the assassination of Somali President Abdi Rashid Ali Shermarke set up a military coup. The new government under Major General Mohamed Siad Barre aligned itself with the Soviet Union. In 1976 the regime created the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party under guidance from the USSR. Soon after they backed a group of Ethiopian revolutionaries, which led to war with Ethiopia. The war was over quickly, Somalia was defeated, and much of its army was destroyed. Having backed a rebellion against an Soviet ally in Ethiopia, Barre was isolated. Struggling with poverty, Barre signed a deal with the International Monetary Fund for aid in the 1980’s which required the privatization of some industries and the end of government monopolies on others. However, as the Cold War drew to an end, the importance of Somalia was diminished to major world players. Barre became increasingly more despotic as the nation grew more isolated. In 1991 civil war broke out leading to Barre’s exile. Under Soviet rule, Somalia became one of the poorest places on the planet, with malnutrition and starvation plaguing the country. To this day it has been unable to recover.

Venezuela

If there is one modern state which best exemplifies the damaging effects of socialism, it’s Venezuela. Modeling after Latin American revolutionary icon Simon Bolivar’s brand of Marxist-Leninism, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez fashioned what is now known as Chavismo, a socialist ideology combined with traditional Latin American Machismo, namely strong, paternal, masculine leadership. Corruption plagued the Chavez regime, as he used intimidation and violence to silence his opponents, held dubious elections, and made alliances with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba. Despite being the largest exporter of oil in the world, Venezuela faces unfathomable poverty. Chavez was obsessed with the failed communist experiment that is Cuba, subsidizing the impoverished island with oil revenues. Chavez oversaw a nationalized oil operation worth untold billions of dollars while the people of Venezuela starved from food shortages. It was common to have millions of dollars unaccounted for, fueling corruption charges. Chavez and the communists of Venezuela maintained they were for the people, most specifically the poor. However, their economic controls have caused misery, famine, disease, and death. Though Chavez died in March of 2013, his successor Nicholas Maduro continued the Chavismo legacy of suffering and despair. Revolutionary movements are growing in resistance, as the government fails to provide its people with basic needs such as food and toilet paper. Recently, the government began finger printing shoppers as a way to combat the black market sale of food. Until the communist are overthrown, they will continue to spend billions from oil revenues to prop up the Venezuelan and Cuban militaries while people starve in the streets.

Cambodia

The Khmer Rouge is infamous for carrying out one of the most vicious genocides of modern history. They did so in the pursuit of a socialist utopia. The bombing of Cambodia as part of the Vietnam War effort by the United States helped contribute to the destabilization of the Cambodian government, which would eventually fall to the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. Seeking to establish an agrarian socialist society of working class Cambodians, the new regime quickly set upon purging the population. Those with money, foreigners, and those with too much education like doctors and teachers were executed in Pot’s killing fields. The Khmer Rouge had declared it to be Year Zero, society needed to start over, in the fields, and all knowledge of the outside world needed to be purged as well. Even people wearing glasses were killed, as they were seen as intellectuals. Nearly one third of their population was culled in the Cambodian genocide, around 300,000 individuals.

Afghanistan

It is strange to consider that prior to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan the country was budding with Western fashion, nice cars, vacationing Europeans, and commerce. Secularism ruled as boys and girls interacted freely and went to Western style universities to pursue higher knowledge. That all changed when the Soviet Union invaded, causing a 10 year war Afghanistan would never recover from. The war radicalized Muslim leaders inside the nation, who were then armed and trained by the US to counter the Soviet occupation. When the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the radical Sunni Muslim fighters were seen as heroes. The country has never been the same, embracing radical Islam over Western culture, which ultimately led to war with the US following the attacks of September 11th, 2001. Clerics, tribal leaders, and drug lords now run roughshod over Afghanistan. Many blame the US for the troubles now plaguing the nation, however, it was the Soviet war machine that came to Afghanistan for its resources which caused the radicalization that has retrogressed the society to the place we see it today.

54,54,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Race against time to save Kariba Dam - Nehanda Radio,https://nehandaradio.com/2015/10/10/race-against-time-to-save-kariba-dam/,"A catastrophic failure of the Kariba Dam on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia would put three and a half million lives at risk and knock out forty per cent of southern Africa’s hydroelectricity supply, according to a recent report.

The report by the Institute of Risk Management of South Africa entitled “Impact of the Failure of the Kariba Dam” warned that 181 billion cubic metres of water could be released if the dam wall failed. Eight hours later this wall of water would hit and destroy the Cahora Bassa dam in central Mozambique.

The report states that the lake behind the Kariba Dam is the largest man-made reservoir in the world. The dam was commissioned in 1960 and is central to the power requirements of Zimbabwe and Zambia. It has a maximum output of 1,839 megawatts. Further down the Zambezi River, Cahora Bassa has a maximum output of 2,075 megawatts.

However, the water gushing out of the Kariba Dam’s sluices has been eroding the rock at the bottom of the dam. Originally the water was only ten metres deep at the foot of the dam, but erosion of this plunge pool has increased the depth to ninety metres and has been wearing away rock near the dam’s foundations.

Plans have been drawn up to remedy this by increasing the size of the plunge pool, which will involve blasting up to 300,000 cubic metres of rock. In addition, work will be carried out on the dam’s floodgates and the concrete will be inspected to analyse the extent of damage to the structure’s concrete caused by chemical reactions. This work is expected to take ten years to complete as only one floodgate can be repaired at a time.

The report references an article in the South African paper “Business Day”, from 17 February which stated that “the consensus of engineers from around the world is that Kariba has a life span of three years if extensive repairs are not undertaken immediately”.

In an interview with AIM, the report’s author, Kay Darbourn, warned that the likelihood of dam failure increases the longer it takes to get started on the repairs. She pointed out that if the current drought continues there is less of a danger, but questioned whether the dam will be able to cope with a drastic increase in water during the rainy season.

This view was shared by Dr Richard Beilfuss who, writing about climate change in a report for the non-governmental organisation International Rivers, stated that “more frequent extreme floods threaten the stability and safe operation of large dams. If dams are “under-designed” for larger floods, the result could be serious safety risks to millions of people living in the basin”.

Although Darbourn is not an engineering expert, she is hugely experienced in risk management, which involves the identification, evaluation and treatment of risks and opportunities.

Some of her suggestions would be easy to implement and could save many hundreds of thousands of lives. Thus SMS text messages and social media such as Twitter and Facebook could be used to give advanced warning of any threatened or occurring danger. There are already international SMS services that warn people of the danger of Tsunami’s in the Pacific Ocean.

The technical director of Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), the company that operates the Cahora Bassa dam, Moises Machaba, told AIM that HCB has been aware of the risk to Kariba for some time.

“The dam operators on the Zambezi have an association, and there are memorandums of understanding signed by the companies and by the governments, which concern exchange of information on the management of the river”, he said.

There were thus regular meetings between HCB and the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), which operates Kariba, and in these meetings questions of safety, including the danger to the Kariba dam had been discussed.

According to Machava, the latest information is that the risk exists, but is not imminent. “It won’t happen tomorrow, or next year”, he said. “But if nothing is done, then it will happen, but not for another couple of years at least”.

The Zimbabwean and Zambian governments signed agreements on 18 September with the European Union, World Bank, African Development Bank and the Swedish government to finance the repairs, to the tune of 294 million US dollars.

“It was considered an emergency and the EU decided to mobilise funds as it was important to start the rehabilitation as soon as possible,” Philipe Van Damme, the EU ambassador to Zimbabwe, told reporters.

The repairs could take up to a decade. Charity Mwansa, chairperson of the Zimbabwe River Authority (ZRA), which operates the dam, said the “reshaping of the plunge pool will take three years, while the rehabilitation of the spillway gates will take six years with minimal disruptions to normal operations.”

Machava said HCB does not know when these repairs will begin, but given the urgency of the situation, he expected that date to be later this year or in early 2016. HCB expects to be briefed on this at the next meeting of the dam operators in early December.

The drought affecting the upper Zambezi means that the structural condition of the dam is not getting much worse at the moment. The condition of the plunge pool worsens when the floodgates are open, and currently none of the Kariba floodgates are open.

Machava said the Kariba reservoir is currently 20 per cent lower than normal. ZRA had told HCB that it is keeping the floodgates closed, and does not intend opening them, even if it begins to rain.

55,55,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Edward Said Remembered - Dissident Voice,https://dissidentvoice.org/2015/09/edward-said-remembered/,"September 25 was the 12th anniversary of his death

Edward Said was an amazing individual and an incredible speaker, writer and academic. He is gone, but the power of his ideas lives on. I was fortunate to meet Edward Said on a few occasions.

There is a bit of a story about how I first met Edward Said. After Canadian’s Concerned for the Middle East (CCME) was refused ratification by the University of Western Ontario Student Council in December 1982 a number of academics at UWO sought to bring a few speakers to campus to broaden the access to ideas on the Palestinian issue and in support of academic freedom and free speech.

I was the graduate student representative to the University Community Centre Directorate (UCCD) from 1985-1987. Habeeb Al-Aidroos, the director of the UCCD, and I helped raise money to bring Professor Edward Said to campus and the next year Professor Noam Chomsky. However, the main credit goes to the Dean of Arts, Tom Lennon, who controlled the money for a prestigious lecture series at UWO.

Before that occurred Edward Said was invited to give a series of lectures to some graduate English students by Professor Balachandra Rajan, who was a world recognized authority on English Comparative Literature on India. He was the author of Under Western Eyes: India from Milton to Macaulay (Duke University Press, 1999). Professor Rajan was a personal friend of Edward Said.

Nobody noticed that Edward Said was coming to Western University. The title of his talk was extremely academic and obscure. The day before Edward Said was scheduled to speak one of the posters caught my eye. I quickly contacted the local Arab community and students interested in the Middle East. The Vice-President Academic for the University of Western Ontario, Tom Collins, somehow heard about what I was doing and came to the talk and sat beside me during the talk wondering what the heck I was up to. We knew each other because I had served on the UWO Senate and had been the University Student Council Vice President Education several years earlier.

When the talk was set to start many students and members of the local Arab community poured into the lecture Hall. I had also contacted the local media who expressed no interest in Edward Said and the obscure topic of the lecture. That was the case until I told them that Edward Said was a member of the Palestinian National Council. Unfortunately that was the day after the Achille Lauro hijacking which occurred on October 5, 1985. A bit of a media circus resulted from my telephone calls. It also generated a great deal of media coverage. There was a magnificent picture of the extremely handsome Edward Said published in the London Free Press.

Edward Said graciously agreed to meet with the local Palestinian and Arab community and us students after his talk. So myself and the many extra visitors patiently sat through the academic lecture and Edward Said returned and met with the community. It was a wonderful meeting and exchange. Professor Rajan and I later became good friends after my uninvited intervention.

A few months later in 1986 I attended the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) Conference in Boston. One of the main events was a debate on American Middle East policy on Israel and Palestine between Edward Said and journalist Christopher Hitchens (who I also had a memorable meeting with but that is another story) and renown Middle East historian Bernard Lewis and Leon Wieseltier who was the Literary Editor of the New Republic.

There were over 5,000 professors and graduate students, all highly informed on Middle East issues, in this massive hall. I thought that the breakdown would be 50-50 as to who would support Israel and who would support the Palestinians. I was surprised that based on applause the support in the room was about 95% pro-Palestinian and 5% pro-Israel. Edward Said was excellent as was Hitchens. They clearly won the debate. The transcript of the debate was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies.

When I was at the MESA Conference I had a chance meeting with Edward Said. He said to me, “What the hell are you doing here?” I explained I was a graduate student in Political Science specializing in Middle East studies and attending the conference. He remembered me from the stunt I pulled at the University of Western Ontario. Apparently I made some impression on Edward Said from my actions at UWO.

The next year Edward Said came back to the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario and gave a series of lectures on the latest book he was writing and also gave a political talk on Palestine. Hanny Hassan, a prominent member of the London Arab community, hosted a reception for Edward Said at his house for members of the community and student activists like myself. Again an excellent opportunity to socialize with Edward Said and members of the community.

The next year, in the fall of 1987, Professor Noam Chomsky came to the University of Western Ontario and gave three lectures on linguistics and also a lecture on politics of the Middle East. Again the Dean of Arts and the UCCD, with Habeeb’s and my support, provided the funding.

At the time I had started first year law at the University of Windsor and returned to UWO to attend the Chomsky lectures. As always with Chomsky the lectures were excellent. Chomsky also met with a very small group of academics and university officials over dinner to which I was also invited. It was an intimate three hour conversation with Noam Chomsky and truly one of the highlights of my life. To this day when I ask for assistance for some political fight Chomsky always helps.

A number of years later the University of Windsor hosted an academic conference on Edward Said and his works. I attended the conference. Edward Said was there and his health was clearly failing but the mind was still as strong as ever. Edward Said died not long after, but his writings are still widely read and his ideas and impact are as powerful as ever.

In many respects the attempt to ban CCME and the Palestinian viewpoint at the University of Western Ontario opened many doors and exposed over a thousand people to the radical idea that Palestinians’ deserved human rights. It brought Edward Said and Noam Chomsky to the usually conservative quiet University of Western Ontario.

On the CCME issue in the end we won the support of many Jewish academics and rabbis, many organizations including the American Anti-Arab Discrimination Committee (ADC) and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. The Globe and Mail (a national newspaper in Canada) also wrote a supportive editorial. And finally with the support of the Ontario Human Rights Commission CCME won the right to present speakers as an officially ratified student club with full access to the universities facilities and to present opinions supportive of the Palestinians at UWO.

I wrote an article which covers much, but not all of this issue, which can be found on my web site or any library that carries American Arab Quarterly now known as Middle East Affairs.

We must remember the important contribution Edward Said has made to the academic world and the Palestinian cause and work hard to make the dream of an independent Palestinian State come true.","Sun, 27 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/1735821357.01._MZZZZZZZ_.jpg,"['edward', 'support', 'east', 'university', 'remembered', 'community', 'chomsky', 'academic', 'ontario', 'western', 'middle']",
