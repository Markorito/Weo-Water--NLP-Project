The Weather Is Winning

In early March, people who live along Mozambique's long coastline began to hear rumors about a cyclone.

The storm was forming in the Indian Ocean, in the narrow band of warm water between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Overnight on March 14, 2019, the storm struck Mozambique head-on, barreling over the port city of Beira and flooding an enormous swath of land as it moved inland toward Zimbabwe.

In low-lying, rural Buzi district, the wind arrived like an explosion. It tore the roofs off homes and schools and churches. It ripped trees out by their roots. When the floodwaters came the next day, there were perilously few high spots left where people could escape.

Those in some of the worst-hit areas were cut off for weeks. Neighbors rescued each other and did their best to help each other survive. At least 600 people died in Cyclone Idai, according to the United Nations.

Mozambique's long coastline, sprawling river delta and changing weather patterns make it susceptible to multiple hazards as the climate changes. Flooding, heat waves, cyclones and drought are all getting more frequent and severe as the Earth gets hotter.

Five weeks later, a second cyclone — this one dubbed Kenneth — hit a less populated area on the border between Mozambique and Tanzania. It was the strongest cyclone to ever make landfall in Africa.

In all, the back-to-back storms seriously affected about 2 million people.

""The example of Mozambique must be an alert for all,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said when he visited Beira over the summer.

The disasters put Mozambique's government and citizens in the unenviable position of responding to an onslaught of climate-driven disasters while also doing their best to prepare for an even more dangerous future. They also have made clear that, absent international climate action, there's only so much that vulnerable countries can do to adapt to extreme weather.

The Front Lines

Long before the cyclones of 2019, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had realized that flooding was a serious problem in the country. In 2000 and again in 2013, rivers overflowed and hundreds were displaced by water.

But far fewer people died as a result of the 2013 floods. In the intervening years, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had studied where and how people were vulnerable to floods and other disasters, then asked community leaders to volunteer to serve on Disaster Risk Reduction Committees for their towns and neighborhoods.

Such a decentralized approach to disaster preparedness is something that the Red Cross and others argue for around the world. The idea is that local leaders learn how to prepare for disasters and help their neighbors stay safe during extreme weather events.

Such programs are not a replacement for national and international climate action, but they are nonetheless an important part of building climate resilience in many places.

By 2017, more than 14,000 people were serving on more than 1,000 local committees around Mozambique, according to the World Bank.

""I'm responsible for making sure everyone knows where the high ground is,"" explains Luis Josine, who has lived in the farming community of Mondiane since 1961 and became the leader of his local disaster committee when it was founded five years ago.

The tools and training he received were relatively basic: a handheld radio for weather warnings, an orange vest, a whistle and three flags of different colors.

Mondiane is near a river that's prone to flooding. In 2000, dozens of people who lived in this area drowned, Josine says.

Today when there is a flood warning, Josine goes through town blowing a whistle and waving a flag. If the flag is blue, it means a flood is likely in two or three days, he explains. If it's yellow, it means one day. If the flag is red, it's an emergency, and people should evacuate immediately.

""It is good,"" he says. ""People listen. They know to leave and go up the road."" That makes him feel proud, especially since he has noticed that the flood risk in the town of Mondiane is increasing.

""We've been noticing the climate changing here since around the year 2000,"" he explains. ""The floods are getting bigger and more severe. The droughts are getting longer.""

Climate scientists say that's in keeping with trends in the whole region and that extreme weather is expected to get more common as the Earth continues to heat up.

'We Are Really Suffering'

More extreme weather can also lead to less resilience.

""Disasters put people back into poverty,"" says Michel Matera, a senior analyst at the World Bank in the capital of Mozambique, Maputo. Without efforts to decrease the damage from floods and other disasters, he says, people will be ""continuously trapped into poverty.""

It's particularly challenging to avoid that vicious cycle when climate change drives more than one disaster in a short period of time

In the months after the cyclones drew international attention to Mozambique, another disaster was unfolding more quietly: a drought.

toggle caption NicholeSobecki/VII for NPR

The rain from the cyclones had come all at once, in a torrent, but the more moderate, continuous rain that farmers rely on didn't fall in much of the country. Disaster Risk Reduction Committees worked to lessen the drought's blow.

""We collect the water, we do our farming very carefully,"" explains Juliet Fernando Chaque, a member of the local committee in the town of Xidwaxine.

She says the community has done a lot in recent years to cope with extreme weather, including drought. For example, the town now has a communal silo to store food, and farmers plant crops that are tolerant of drought, like sweet potatoes.

toggle caption NicholeSobecki/VII for NPR

But this ongoing drought has been so extreme, it has overwhelmed their efforts. It began in 2018, and at this point, any food that residents managed to store is long gone. The soil is dry and cracked. Planting season came in September and still there was no rain. So there's almost no planting.

Women from Xidwaxine have started walking three hours to a lake where water lilies grow to harvest the plants and eat the bitter tubers at the base of the roots.

""We are really suffering,"" Chaque says.

Adapting to drought here will likely require comparatively big, expensive infrastructure projects to bring water out to the fields. Putting the brakes on climate change in general will require a global shift away from fossil fuels that has been slow at best.

That's a difficult reality for local leaders like Chaque, who have proudly, persistently pushed their communities to become more resilient to global changes that they cannot control.","Fri, 27 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/12/19/no_fish4sex-x-36_wide-27be2647535a8e737d1ad1af7e57e693ab52e76b.jpg?s=1400,"['local', 'mozambique', 'change', 'adapt', 'climate', 'disaster', 'nicholesobeckivii', 'extreme', 'drought', 'racing', 'weather', 'international', 'winning', 'caption']",

By Alex Russell on April 22, 2019 in Food and Agriculture

During the months that Jonathan Malacarne spent traveling from village to village in rural Mozambique, the weather could be dry and dusty or soaking wet from heavy rain. Either way, people from the community would walk and ride bikes from miles away to meet under the shade of a tree or in a classroom to learn about insured maize seeds.

Malacarne, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Davis, is part of a team of agricultural economists testing whether these insured seeds can increase food security for farmers who regularly risk losing crops to extreme weather. In Mozambique, this includes flooding from a rare but catastrophic cyclone like Idai in 2019 but is more likely to be extreme drought that can strike in any year.

“Drought is definitely among the most frequently cited and most severe concerns that households have,” Malacarne said. “Heavy reliance on a rain-fed staple crop in a drought-prone region with limited access to financial services all translate into high levels of food insecurity pretty quickly.”

The lasting impacts of drought

Small-scale farmers in Mozambique may plant a handful of crops but maize, or corn, is their main staple. Most often maize is ground into meal and cooked into xima, a stiff porridge. For many farmers, maize is their only source of income.

Increasing how much maize farmers can grow, even despite drought, would go a long way toward making households more food secure. According to the World Bank, about 30 percent of the population in Mozambique is undernourished.

One of the challenges is that farmers in Mozambique mostly plant local seeds saved from last year’s crop. The seeds cost nothing but require regular rain until the cobs mature. Farmers who instead spend money on improved, drought-tolerant seeds will get much bigger harvests, especially if there is a moderate drought. But, if the rains never come at all, the farmer who paid for better seeds will lose more.

“If you spend all your money on seeds that are expensive to buy and then they fail anyway, there’s nothing left to get your family through to the next season,” Malacarne said. Malacarne first learned about these kinds of constraints as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nicaragua before he joined the Ph.D. program in agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis.

For small-scale farmers, a severe drought can lead to impacts that last well beyond a single season. Families might sell some of what they own, like livestock or tools, making it harder to start over the next season. Another option is to skip meals, which can compromise adults’ ability to work or stunt the growth and development of their children.

“These circumstances can quickly push families to a tipping point after which they will always be poor, with no chance to build back the assets they need to escape poverty,” said Michael Carter, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis and director of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access.

Carter has been studying these dynamics for decades. He believes one way to disrupt them is for farmers to increase their assets. In Mozambique, where there is little opportunity to earn outside of agriculture, this means growing more maize. However, this requires risking cash that would sustain the family in a severe drought.

“Reducing this risk is one way of shifting the tipping point, which reduces the intervention needed to help households escape chronic poverty and possibly even develop some resilience to the next shock that comes along,” Carter said.

Adding insurance to seeds to increase overall drought protection

Since as early as 2014, Carter and Travis Lybbert, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, have wanted to test whether bundling drought-tolerant seeds with insurance could overcome the limitations of the seeds alone.

“Seeds that enhance the resilience of farmers facing drought has been probably the most popular public and private crop investment in the past 20 years,” Lybbert said. “Adding insurance expands this resilience to include even the worst possible outcomes.”

In 2015, with support from USAID, Carter, Lybbert and Stephen Boucher, also a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, launched a study to test how bundling seeds and insurance would actually work in Tanzania and Mozambique.

The UC Davis team partnered with CIMMYT, a nonprofit research center based in Mexico that has spent decades selectively breeding maize seeds that can withstand some drought. They also developed an index insurance that would replace the seeds in the event of a severe enough drought.

Index insurance is a type of insurance that avoids the cost of verifying losses by basing payouts on an easy-to-measure index of factors, such as weather or average yields. In Mozambique, seed replacements would trigger when satellite data showed a lack of rain early in the season or when full-season rainfall and vegetation growth estimated that crops had failed.

“In the extreme case, families can lose everything, even seed for next year,” Malacarne said. “Being able to start over with improved seed is a big deal, and they’re also learning about how insurance works.”

Taking a new kind of drought protection from village to village

In Mozambique, Malacarne would watch as members of the survey team gave their presentation on the drought-tolerant seeds and insurance either in Portuguese, the national language in Mozambique, or in one of the local languages like Shona or Ndao.

Toward the end of the presentations, when it came time to make sure everyone understood the index insurance that would guarantee the seeds, each attendee held two cards, one red, one green. Everyone in the village has a good harvest? Green card, no replacement. Had a bad harvest but most neighbors had a good one? Green card, no replacement. Almost everyone had a bad harvest? Red card, replacement.

No one in these parts of Mozambique, about six hours from the nearest major city, had any experience with insurance. But everyone understood drought. They also understood community. When the research team designed the contract zones, they were careful to keep communities together.

“In these areas the community is the unit of organization generally,” Malacarne said. “That everybody in the community would get the same payment made sense.”

In the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he and his team, along with seed company representatives and local agricultural extension workers, visited 69 communities. In addition to the presentations, the team gathered three rounds of hourlong, one-on-one surveys with about 1,500 farmers to measure the bundle’s impact.

For all the time Malacarne spent in Mozambique, he mostly knows the farmers there through the data collected in those surveys. It’s a different experience than he had in Nicaragua, where he worked with individual farmers over a long period of time and could see firsthand the challenges they face.

“We are trying to learn things that are going to guide policy in a way that impacts a lot of people but not necessarily these specific people,” Malacarne said.

Though the research team has just completed its final round of surveys, early analysis shows that the project worked exactly as it was designed. In 2017, when a severe drought struck in Tanzania, the insurance triggered the replacement of 1,220 packets of seed. In Mozambique, higher yields were driven by only moderate periods of drought but good seasons overall.

Across both countries, over 2,000 households bought drought-tolerant seeds and nearly 1,000 bought the seeds bundled with insurance. Farmers who bought the improved seeds, with or without insurance, had higher yields by about 380 kg per hectare. That’s about 50 percent more maize than farmers without the improved seeds could grow.

This success could lead to farmers continuing purchasing the improved seeds, and also insurance if the project’s partners in both countries continue to make it available. “In order to help people to solve the problems they face in a way that makes sense for them, you have to understand what those decisions look like through their eyes,” Malacarne said. “That’s what research does.”

2,2,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Climate Change Leaves 1.6 Million in Mozambique in Need of Urgent Assistance - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/climate-change-leaves-16-million-mozambique-need-urgent-assistance,"MAPUTO (November 12, 2019) - At least 1.6 million people in the central and southern parts of Mozambique are presently in need of assistance due to the devastating effects of the ongoing drought and increasingly severe weather events. Mozambique is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to natural disasters and climate change.

The severe food shortage is taking a heavy toll, especially on children under the age of five years, with some 67,500 children facing acute malnutrition. Crops are failing; communities do not have enough food to eat, and cannot produce enough to sell. There is a high risk of negative coping mechanisms. The country is still reeling from the devastating effects of two major cyclones, Cyclone Idai in the central-eastern parts, and Cyclone Kenneth in the northern parts of the country, which hit the country earlier this year.

In response, CARE is planning to distribute drought-resistant seeds and tools, as well as deliver basic training in improved agricultural practices to combat the effects of the climate crisis, in several districts of Sofala and Inhambane provinces.

3,3,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique prays for rain as water shortages hit country’s poor - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/22/mozambique-prays-for-rain-water-shortages-hit-poor-maputo-southern-africa-drought,"In the township of Chamanculo, in Maputo, Mozambique, a network of household taps made the community water pump obsolete years ago, freeing residents from the daily burden of lugging massive jerrycans of water long distances.

But a water crisis, partly caused by an ongoing drought affecting much of southern Africa, is already reversing progress in this coastal city. An emergency “orange alert”, declared last February by the country’s disaster management council after failed rains, has triggered such strict water rationing across the capital city that the taps are turned off every other day and irrigation is banned.

Unable to afford the private wells, boreholes and extra tanks used by the rich to buffer themselves from the restrictions, Chamanculo’s residents once again find themselves gathering at a single tap. At 9am, a steady stream of mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs, line up at Pragosa, a Portuguese construction firm, which is providing free water from a private borehole to the community during the emergency for an hour every day. They fill up 25-litre canisters and carefully balance them on their heads, often making repeat trips home and back again.

Helena Metela, 20, a mother of a three-month-old boy, Ali, says it is a struggle but she has no choice. “The construction company is a little bit far from my home,” she says. “It takes time. Maybe an hour.”

With no end to the current water shortage in sight, the municipality is considering bringing back community pumps to deal with the dwindling supply.

Unlike Cape Town, in neighbouring South Africa where the water supply is at breaking point, Maputo has not got to the stage where officials have predicted a “day zero”, when taps are forecast to run dry. But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages. Worse still, future projections are for the city to double in size, from 1.7 million people to 3.5million by 2035, sending demand for already scant water resources soaring further.

So pressing is the issue that late last month government departments, water utilities, regulators and NGOs gathered in downtown Maputo for a crisis meeting to discuss possible solutions. At the meeting, held jointly by the Mozambique government and WaterAid, official after official warned that the situation was “critical”.

Nobody present was in any doubt of the role climate change is playing in the water shortages. Meteorologists who talked to the Observer reported shifting rainfall patterns, high temperatures and more extreme weather events in recent years. Predictions are that in Maputo and other coastal cities increased pressure on fresh water supply is set to increase.

Jonathan Farr, a senior policy analyst at Wateraid, said climate change was “eating up the world’s water”, while also making it harder to find a solution. “Things that have worked in the past are no longer enough. Climate change makes everything considerably more serious. Cape Town was something you wouldn’t expect to happen. We are now seeing it potentially in Maputo.”

An hour’s drive west from Maputo is the vast Pequenos Libombos dam, which feeds into the Umbeluzi river, the main source of water supply to Greater Maputo. Completed in 1987, the dam has a capacity of 400 million square metres. But in the last two years, the water level has dropped dramatically. Standing on the bridge above the reservoir, Jaime Timba, the dam’s director, points to a series of yellow guages on the dam’s wall, well above the current water level.

“The water level is too low for the scale,” Timba said “We need to build a new one.” It is only the second time in a decade that the water level has been so depleted. The last time was in 2016, when it fell to 13%. Some water restrictions were enacted then, but they were not sufficient. Meanwhile, everyone prayed for more rain.

In the last four years the Umbeluzi river basin has recorded below average rainfall for the whole basin, while evaporation rates have risen, according to Wateraid. Swathes of land across the region, from South Africa to Zambia, have been hit by high temperatures and low rainfall. Though rainfall in Mozambique has been reasonably good elsewhere, Swaziland in the south-west, whose rivers feed into the Pequenos Libombos dam, has suffered.

Jacinto Laureiro, the mayor of Boane, a town in Greater Maputo, said: “We need to change from thinking about the next 10 years or even 20 years, to thinking long term.”

The current situation, he said, had developed over time, due to population growth, a lack of investment in infrastructure measures to capture water, and because of climate change.

Asked if the situation could deteriorate, he said: “Only God knows.”

Antonieta Ruben, 53, a widow, was sceptical that she would see improvements any time soon.

“I don’t have hope,” said Ruben, who has two sons at university in Maputo and sells chickens to support her family. “This is a normal crisis. They can have promises of getting water but nothing is done.”","Sat, 21 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdde7e47f9721ab4126ddbe5b46ca259248282bc/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=08c2a3cafc57683e0f78fe907e8e308d,"['mozambique', 'change', 'hit', 'climate', 'maputo', 'taps', 'supply', 'town', 'prays', 'poor', 'wateraid', 'city', 'countrys', 'rainfall', 'shortages', 'rain', 'water']",

Overview of the crisis

Mozambique is facing significant pockets of severe food insecurity, mainly due to poor rainfall and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion, which have contributed to reduced crop production, particularly of maize. The drought is also causing increased levels of malnutrition, water scarcity and school drop-outs, as well as heightening the risk of communicable diseases and of exacerbating HIV rates.

Mozambique experiences natural hazards every year, particularly given its geographical location (the country is located downstream of nine international river basins and has a long Indian Ocean coastline with active cyclone activity) and the social and economic vulnerability of the population. Drought occurs primarily in the southern region, with a frequency of seven droughts every 10 years. The recurrence of these climatic shocks in shorter cycles has negated efforts to reduce vulnerability across many communities.

The 2017-2018 rainy season was characterised by a late start, extended mid-season dry spell (DecemberJanuary) and heavy rains. Although the 2017-2018 rainy season performed better than the 2015-16 El Niño episode, the dry spell resulted in moisture stress and wilting of early planted crops in many areas. This has caused below average agricultural yield, particularly in southern and some central parts of Mozambique. Although the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security affirms that there is enough food availability at the aggregate level, the country is facing significant pockets of food insecurity, mainly due to the poor rainfall performance and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion that contributed to reduced crop production, particularly of maize. According to the FAW early warning system (FAMEWS), the infestation level in Mozambique is estimated to be between 21 to 40 per cent and the high likelihood of an El Niño event could contribute to the multiplication of the pest, given its high reproductivity in dry conditions.

Climatic predictions for the 2018-2019 rainfall season indicate normal to below normal rainfall for the southern and central regions, and normal to above normal rainfall for the northern region, according to the National Institute for Meteorology (INAM). As of 3 December, the likelihood of an El Niño had been revised to at least 80 per cent during the period between November 2018 to March 2019, according to the official El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecast. This poses a high risk for the Mozambique 2018-2019 cropping season, especially in already drought-affected southern and parts of central regions. Households in these areas will likely be forced to plant multiple times after repeated attempts, resulting in crop failures, as well as depletion of household seed stocks.

An estimated 814,700 people in five provinces are facing the most severe levels of food insecurity (IPC 3 and above) and need life-saving assistance during the lean season. The most affected provinces are Cabo Delgado, Inhambane, Gaza, Sofala, and Tete. Gaza province, for example, has nearly 22 percent of its population – more than 318,000 people - affected by the crisis. Tete, Inhambane, Sofala and Cabo Delgado reported together almost 500,000 people in IPC phase 3. This population is a prioritised subset of the overall number of severely food insecure people in 11 provinces, which is estimated at 1.78 million people (IPC phase 3 and above) for the period of September to December 2018, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018.

The impact of rising food insecurity is compounded by high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Almost half of the population (46.3 per cent) continues to be poor in monetary and non-monetary terms; with 84.9 per cent living in rural areas. Recent poverty analysis conducted in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food consumption and that affected households also cut back on expenditures in basic non-food items.

Agricultural production is likely to diminish, particularly in areas where there is a risk of low rainfall and likelihood of increased incidence of pests and diseases. The rain-dependent agricultural sector, which accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of the labour force, is highly vulnerable to drought and other natural hazards, with an estimated loss of US$20 million per year, according to the World Bank. Nearly 94 per cent of the poor are primarily engaged in agriculture for their subsistence. Based on the initial analysis from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), the crop water needs index is reportedly low in seven provinces, including in Inhambane and Gaza areas in the southern region. In the first quarter of 2019, significant improvement is expected in the northern and central regions, with the exception of Tete province (reporting low index), while the southern region is expected to show between low and very low index, particularly in Inhambane and Gaza. There are already some indications in Gaza province of families reliant on small livestock moving to forest areas in search of green pasture and water, increasing the risk of conflict with wild animals. For December 2018 to April 2019, the Technical Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security (SETSAN) has prioritised 815,000 people in five provinces for immediate humanitarian assistance. For January to March 2019, it is projected that the population in need will slightly reduce to 737,000 people, assuming that the crop water index will be adequate and a green harvest will take place in February 2019.

An estimated 19,500 children in nine districts are expected to suffer from Acute Malnutrition during the next six-month period, according to the IPC Acute Malnutrition analysis conducted in April 2018 by SETSAN. Five districts will be in IPC Acute Malnutrition (AMN) phase 2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is expected to increase from acceptable to alert/serious levels (IPC phase 2 and 3) with GAM rates between 6 to 10.9 per cent, particularly in Balama, Cabo Delgado, Marara in Tete province, Milange in Zambezia province and Macossa in Manica province, largely due to: low quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access to safe water sources. Results from the SETSAN analysis have shown a critical food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence: Quissanga, Macomia, Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade and Palma.

Families are expected to adopt negative stress coping strategies in almost all of the affected provinces, heightening protection risks, particularly for women and children, according to preliminary indications in the October 2018 SETSAN report. The most severe cases are in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala, where families are already adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency strategies (13 per cent) respectively, including: selling of productive assets and animals; and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water, and begging. In the past – including during the 2015-2017 El Nino - rising food insecurity has heightened the risk of child labour, child trafficking and forced marriage. Past anecdotal evidence suggests that the age of sexual debut lowered to 11- or 12-years during drought, with older men engaging with girls aged 11 to 13 as they went about water collection activities.

Drought continues to negatively impact children’s well-being and their access to education, often leading to student absenteeism, poor concentration in class due to hunger and thirst, and ultimately contributing to a decrease in children’s learning outcomes. Shortage of water leads to migration of the most vulnerable rural families and consequently their children drop out of school.

Access to safe water is also a challenge, including due to drought.Only half of Mozambicans have access to improved water supply and only one in five use improved sanitation facilities. There is a large disparity between urban (80 per cent) and rural water supply coverage (35 per cent), and only an estimated 40 per cent of rural schools have water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities for learners and teachers. Unimproved sanitation has been linked to poor maternal health, with 90 per cent of underweight mothers having access to only unimproved sanitation. Diminished rainfall has heightened challenges to accessing safe water. The storage level of the Pequenos Libombos dam, located in Maputo province, was only 22.6 per cent as of 29 November 2018. Pequenos Libombos dam supplies the cities of Maputo, Matola and Boane and has not been above 50 per cent since the severe drought in 2016. However, water resources authorities expect that by March 2019 the storage level of the dam may increase and reach 50 per cent of its capacity, based on available forecasts. At the peak of the lean season in drought-affected areas it is expected that around 296,000 people will need some form of WASH intervention, as localised water stress levels will impact the waiting time at water points as well as longer return distances for water trucking.","Wed, 23 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1230424-Mozambique%20Humanitarian%20Response%20Plan_210119_FINAL.png?itok=R3uibrFz,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'ipc', 'province', 'humanitarian', 'cent', 'particularly', '2019', 'food', '2018', 'low', 'poor', '20182019', 'season', 'rainfall', 'water']",

Normal November weather in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is pleasant and warm with a chance of epic thunderstorms. The sun will be shining in the morning, and then boom the sky opens up and a stiff wind begins to blow and it's probably best if you're inside.

At 10 a.m. on an 85-degree Thursday this November, Mozambique's lead weather forecaster, Acacio Tembe, was stooped at a computer at the National Institute of Meteorology, trying to figure out whether a storm was in the cards that afternoon. He toggled between tabs with global weather maps put out by the U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. On every map, clouds and bands of rain moved in a lazy loop across Mozambique and neighboring South Africa.

Tembe's phone rang. The man on the other end was in charge of drainage and water resources for the city of Maputo, and he wanted to know: Is there going to be a storm? Because just an inch and a half of rain can cause flooding in city streets.

""We don't know,"" Tembe told him. ""We are still analyzing the information.""

Tembe promised to let him know if they decided to issue a weather warning and then hung up and leaned forward in his swivel office chair. He stared silently at the clouds moving across his screen, as if putting his face closer to the monitor might somehow give him what he really needed: a map with better resolution.

The forecast for forecasting: cloudy

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

Mozambique is one of many countries around the world where weather forecasting is lagging behind even as climate change drives more extreme and variable weather. In Bangladesh, tropical storm warnings are not adequately reliable. In Peru, the national government is trying to get weather and climate information to residents who are experiencing more extreme weather. The World Meteorological Organization is working on upgrading flash flood warning systems in more than 50 countries around the world, including Mozambique.

Mozambique's meteorologists currently rely heavily on weather data and models collected and created by, and primary tailored to, the needs of other countries.

""Right now, we're using global models,"" Tembe explains. They're helpful for understanding the large-scale weather forecast for the country — for example, figuring out if it's going to rain later in the week or if a cyclone is brewing off the coast.

But Tembe says the information from these models isn't specific enough to consistently predict local and short-term weather. That is an increasingly serious problem, because weather in Mozambique is getting more extreme.

""Nowadays, we have more intense phenomena,"" he explains. ""More cases of strong rains, the heat is stronger, the winds are stronger. It's different from the past."" Mozambique is already suffering longer droughts and more frequent and severe storms than it was earlier this century, because the climate is changing.

Dangerous fallout

That extreme weather can be deadly. Much of the country is currently suffering from a drought that is straining food supplies. And this spring two powerful cyclones hit Mozambique in quick succession, killing hundreds of people and destroying thousands of buildings. The first, Cyclone Idai, hit near Mozambique's third largest city, Beira, ripping apart homes and flooding much of the city.

""The exposure of disaster risk for Mozambique will increase as a consequence of climate change,"" says Antonio Queface, an atmospheric scientist in the physics department of Maputo's Eduardo Mondlane University. ""[If] we look specifically for the tropical cyclones, from 1979 up to recent years, even including Idai in 2019, you can see there's a change in patterns. The cyclones become more severe, with strong winds and rain, and more frequent.""

Everyday weather is also becoming more extreme and harder to predict. As is true in much of the world as the Earth gets hotter, climate change is also making extreme rain more likely. That means that a larger share of the precipitation that falls on the country is forecast to come in big dumps as opposed to more moderate rainstorms.

It all adds up to more and more risk for people across Mozambique. In coastal communities on the country's long Indian Ocean coast, sea level rise and more intense tropical storms are making life both more dangerous and uncertain. For the more than 3 million families that farm in Mozambique, longer dry stretches can mean fewer crops and dead livestock.

In order to adapt, residents need more accurate information, both about the local weather on any given day and about how weather patterns are changing. Both will require better weather and climate forecasting capability.

What's missing

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

Queface says there are two missing pieces right now: weather forecasting models with higher resolution, so meteorologists can zoom in and give residents more specific information, and more weather data to make those models accurate.

Over the last two decades, the international weather maps available to Mozambique through the United Nations World Meteorological Organization, the European Union and national governments including the United States have all become more detailed, as weather satellite technology has advanced. But not all of that data is available to forecasters in other countries in real time, in part because many countries do not have the computing power or the Internet speeds necessary to get and use the data for short-turnaround forecasts.

""I think it's a challenging issue on the models,"" Queface says. ""How do you give inputs to the model? What data do you have? Africa as a continent, maybe excluding South Africa, there's a scarcity of meteorological data"" available for local and national weather forecasting.

It's not just satellite data. Mozambique has just a handful of weather stations taking measurements across the country, according to the National Institute of Meteorology.

Without accurate, continuous, local information about wind, humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation and other basic weather measurements, a higher-resolution, Mozambique-specific weather model would still be inaccurate, Queface says. ""[It's] garbage in, garbage out on the model. So the model itself doesn't solve anything.""

Radar enters the picture

In the early 2000s, Mozambique's government partnered with the World Bank to install two weather radar stations. The goal was to collect the kind of data meteorologists need to make accurate forecasts and also to help scientists track changes in the country's climate.

One radar installation was in the coastal city of Beira, and the second was a few hours north of the capital, in the city of Xai-Xai. When the Xai-Xai location opened in 2004, then-President Joaquim Chissano attended the so-called baptizing of the installation and gave it a name: ""Life Radar.""

""It was something that made the people here very proud,"" says Salamao Mausse, the longtime janitor for the local meteorology office in charge of the radar. ""That the radar was providing good, accurate weather information to the whole country.""

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

The radar also changed how local residents thought about weather forecasts, he says. In the past, many people hadn't put a lot of stock in local forecasts because they were often wrong. But in 2008, when the radar had been up and running for a few years, there was a storm in the region. The local meteorologists could see from the radar data that the storm was parked over the neighboring province. They put out a forecast warning people there that flooding was likely for the next two days, so they should make sure their cattle were safe and avoid low-lying places.

Indeed, the storm did exactly as they predicted.

""And everyone was really impressed,"" Mausse remembers and laughs. ""They were, like, 'Are you talking to God with that thing?' ""

But shortly after that, according to the National Institute of Meteorology, the radar started to malfunction. It was difficult to keep calibrated and hard to fix because the company that made it, Gematronik, was in Germany. And local technicians in Mozambique didn't have experience with radar.

The radar in Xai-Xai stopped providing data in 2013. Mausse has continued to walk up the hill every few days to clean and dust the radar control rooms, and cut the grass around the outside, with the hope that it will someday be fixed. Mozambique's second radar installation has also stopped working, Tembe says.

At the 2015 American Meteorological Society meeting, researchers presented a study from neighboring South Africa that found that 16 radar systems made by the same company were ""plagued by technical problems."" The study noted that both Mozambique and Botswana have had similar problems. The authors suggest that older radar systems might be more useful in the region in the long run, since they would be easier to maintain with local parts and expertise. Another option could be decentralized data collected by weather sensors in vehicles and mobile phones.

Queface points out that, no matter where weather data comes from, Mozambique will need faster, more reliable Internet, more advanced computing and more training for its meteorologists.

In search of money

Many countries hope funding for such upgrades will come out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which is being discussed by leaders from around the world this week in Madrid. Under the agreement, major industrialized countries that have contributed the most to total global greenhouse gas emissions agreed to pay into a global fund that would help cover the costs of managing and adapting to climate change.

Just last week, the fund gave $10 million to the Philippines for upgrading its weather forecasting in some parts of the country.

But the amount of money available for such upgrades lags far behind the amount of money promised. The United States has contributed about a third of the $3 billion that it pledged in 2014 under the Obama administration.

Queface says outside money is crucial if Mozambique wants to build a better weather forecasting system. ""Countries like ours, they have a lot of priorities,"" he says. ""You need schools, you need health centers, you need so many things. And sometimes, a disaster comes and you need relief operations.""","Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/12/06/weather-11_wide-1b92c1780cd655a915fd95c2fbac1d67b09886ff.jpg?s=1400,"['local', 'mozambique', 'change', 'sobeckivii', 'climate', 'world', 'meteorologists', 'weather', 'data', 'radar', 'cant', 'nichole', 'caption']",

In early February, FEWS NET released an Alert on the poor progress of Southern Africa’s October 2018 to March 2019 rainy season. Through the remainder of the season, western and central areas received only light to moderate rainfall. End-of-season rainfall totals were less than 55 percent of normal across most of the region and drought conditions persisted in several areas. In addition, Tropical Cyclone Idai hit the eastern coast of Mozambique in mid-March, resulting in widespread flooding and high-speed winds across central Mozambique, eastern Zimbabwe, and southern Malawi. This resulted in over 850 known deaths, significant displacement, loss of livestock, and destruction of infrastructure and croplands. The ongoing drought coupled with the negative impacts of Cyclone Idai have driven atypically high assistance needs that are expected to persist through at least early 2020, and humanitarian actors and national governments should plan for higher than normal food assistance and livelihood support needs throughout this time.

Rainfall during Southern Africa’s 2018/19 rainy season started nearly a month late, was characterized by extended dry spells between January and March, and concluded with historically low rainfall totals in many central and western parts of the region (Figure 1). Areas of Botswana, northern Zimbabwe, eastern Namibia, southern Angola, and surplus-producing areas of northern South Africa and southern Zambia registered a D3 (Extreme) or D4 (Exceptional) drought according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Drought Monitor scale.

Conversely, rainfall totals in Malawi and much of Mozambique were already above average prior to Cyclone Idai, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm in central Mozambique on March 14. The cyclone transitioned into a tropical depression as it traveled across central Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe, driving further heavy rainfall through March 21 across these areas and Malawi. Central Mozambique was the hardest hit, receiving more than 300 millimeters of rainfall in a 24-hour period in Beira City with sustained wind speeds over 170 km/hour. Nearly 1.5 million people were impacted, 161,000 people were displaced, and almost 600 people were killed in Mozambique, though many areas remain inaccessible and the full extent of the damage is still unknown. Although Beira port was cutoff for roughly six days, access has resumed. In Zimbabwe, Chimanimani and Chipinge districts were significantly impacted and remain mostly inaccessible following infrastructure damage. An estimated 250,000 people in Zimbabwe were affected, 4,500 of whom were displaced. In Southern Malawi, roughly 860,000 people were affected and close to 87,000 people were displaced.

The widespread drought and flooding following Cyclone Idai have together driven extensive crop losses in many areas of the region and below-average production is likely in most countries, including in South Africa and Zambia, which are key contributors to regional maize supply. Recent field visits conducted by the USDA in collaboration with FEWS NET and partners corroborate drought-related crop losses in southern Zambia and northern Zimbabwe. As a result of flooding and high-speed winds following Cyclone Idai, over 700,000 hectares (ha) of crops were lost in central Mozambique and about 30,000 ha in southern Malawi at the start of the harvest period. In eastern Zimbabwe, most areas remain inaccessible but initial estimates indicate roughly 24,000 ha of crops have been destroyed.

Despite expected below-average 2019 maize production, FEWS NET expects that regional maize supply during the 2019/20 marketing year will still be average due largely to carryover stocks from last year’s bumper harvest in South Africa. Currently, maize grain prices are trending near or slightly above the five-year average across the region and this trend is expected to continue in most areas, and prices are not anticipated to reach the high levels observed in 2016. However, maize prices are expected to be well above average in drought-affected areas with localized supply deficits, flood-affected areas of Mozambique, and in Zimbabwe where both drought and macroeconomic issues are of concern. Should Tanzania and Zambia restrict grain exports to structurally-deficit neighboring countries in an effort to protect their domestic supplies, maize grain availability will be lower than normal in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) Haut Katanga province, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.

Livestock conditions and agricultural labor opportunities have also been negatively affected by the poor 2018/19 seasonal performance. Pasture conditions and water availability for livestock are below average in many areas, including parts of Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, and Botswana, where drought-related livestock diseases and deaths have already been reported. Livestock body conditions are unlikely to improve in drought-affected areas until the start of the 2019/20 rainy season, driving lower livestock prices through much of 2019, and atypically high livestock deaths are possible. In central Mozambique, it is reported that many impacted households lost their livestock in the floods and no longer have access to this source of income. Overall, poor households are expected to have below-average income through at least late 2019 when agricultural labor for the 2019/20 season will be available and the next rainy season drives livestock improvements.

As a result, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are anticipated across the region, with the highest concern in Zimbabwe, central and southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, and parts of Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Angola. Additionally, FEWS NET anticipates the 2019/20 lean season will start atypically early in August and needs will be highest at the peak of the lean season in early 2020. Humanitarian actors and national governments should plan for higher than normal food assistance and livelihood support needs through at least early 2020.","Sat, 06 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1272143-Southern%20Africa%20Alert_April%202019_0.png?itok=7ezyTlza,"['security', 'mozambique', 'africa', 'southern', 'cyclone', 'zambia', 'livestock', 'central', 'drought', 'season', '2019', 'food', 'zimbabwe', 'alert', 'areas']",

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought continues to affect 1.5 million people in Mozambique and it is expected that this number will be in need of food assistance until March 2017 and could possibly increase up to 2.3 million. According to IOM’s displacement tracking matrix (DTM), of the nine assessed IDP camps (8 in Manica and 1 in Sofala), a total of 15,128 people are currently displaced due on-going military conflict and drought consequences. Specifically, about 90% of the IDPs interviewed have identified security and conflict as the main reason preventing them from returning to their place of origin. The number of IDPs is expected to increase due to floods, cyclones and as military confrontations continue. The National Contingency Plan predicts under its Scenario I about 714,000 people to be affected by strong winds, floods, and cyclones among which, 190,000 will be displaced and in need of temporary accommodation centers.

From October to December 2016, the amount of rainfall has been consistent with the forecasts of the National Meteorological Institute for Mozambique, which predicted normal to above normal rainfall for the period in the south and central provinces (Figure 1), and normal to above normal for the period January to March 2017 in Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia (Figure 2). The northern parts of Nampula and Gaza expect below normal rainfall between January and March 2017. Although in general the forecast for the agriculture season is good, we expect there will be pockets of populations that remain food insecure and facing nutrition crisis due to a combination of factors including unavailability of seed during the planting seasons, poor agriculture harvest due to excess rainfall and localized floods, and inability of population, particularly in conflict zones, to access their land due to insecurity amid on-going military confrontations and damage to crops as a result of intense cyclone activity.","Fri, 30 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/692734-UNICEF%20Mozambique%20Humanitarian%20SitRep%20-%20December%202016.png?itok=ppT8gpN3,"['mozambique', 'idp', 'humanitarian', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'report', 'unicef', 'normal', 'military', 'situation', 'floods', '2016', 'idps', 'wash', 'manica', 'water']",

In March and April 2019, Mozambique was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones that left a trail of death, damage and destruction in their paths. In March, the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. On 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Cabo Delgado province, flattening entire villages. Overall, it is estimated that close to 2.2 million need urgent assistance following the cyclones and floods (374,000 people from Cyclone Kenneth and 1.85 million people from Cyclone Idai), on top of 815,000 people already in need as a result of the drought.

The Tropical Cyclone Kenneth and Idai weather systems brought destruction and damage to Cabo Delgado, Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces, killing at least 648 people (45 deaths due to Cyclone Kenneth and at least 603 deaths due to Cyclone Idai), injuring nearly 1,700 and leaving an estimated 2.2 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Although the death tolls are yet to be disaggregated, women are more likely to die in natural disasters than men. The Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete in early March, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings and leaving death and destruction in its wake; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow, and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. Then, on 24 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado, flattening entire communities in its path.

This is the first time in recorded history that two strong tropical cyclones (above Category 2) have made landfall in Mozambique in the same season, and the first time that a cyclone has made landfall as far north as Kenneth. The cyclones devastated two distinct swathes of the country.

Cyclone Idai hit the central region of Mozambique, leaving an estimated 3,000km2 of land submerged and damaging more than 240,000 houses. Subsequently, Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern region, destroying more than 45,300 houses. This came on top of drought in other areas of country, as well as violence in parts of Cabo Delgado.

The cyclones have compounded an already serious food insecurity situation in Mozambique. From September to December 2018, an estimated 1.78 million people (IPC phase 3 and above) were severely food insecure in the country, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018. Of these, an estimated 814,700 severely food insecure people in five provinces – Cabo Delgado, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala and Tete - were prioritized as being in most urgent need of assistance, with the most affected provinces being Tete (more than 359,300 people) and Gaza (more than 318,200 people). Following Cyclone Idai’s landfall, more than 715,000 hectares of crops were destroyed, while Cyclone Kenneth affected nearly 55,500 hectares of crops and caused loss of livelihoods, including fishing. Both of the cyclones made landfall during the critical harvest period, effectively wiping out the food the Cyclones. of thousands of families, prolonging an already difficult lean season and leaving many without the prospect of another full harvest until March 2020. All communities in Manica and 80 per cent in Sofala have reported harvesting less than half of their maize due to Cyclone Idai.

Both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth caused significant displacement and protection concerns. Many children, elderly and people with disabilities were unable to flee to safety and more than half of the affected people are children.

The cyclones significantly exacerbated protection risks, including sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Already, in October 2018, families in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala were adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency strategies (13 per cent) due to drought, including selling productive assets and animals and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water. After the cyclones, many families lost everything – their homes, their livelihoods and family members – heightening the risks of their resorting to negative coping strategies – including child labour, child trafficking and forced marriage - to survive in the months ahead. Some children have lost their parents, while others were separated from their families as they sought to reach safety.

Access to safe water was compromised by both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth, particularly for displaced people living in collective centres, as well as people in areas where water supply was cut. Even prior to the crisis, only half of Mozambicans had access to improved water supply and only one in five use improved sanitation facilities. Most households impacted by flooding during Cyclone Idai lost access to safe sanitation, with latrines overflowing and homes destroyed. People who sought refuge in collective centres – usually schools and churches – were living in overcrowded and congested conditions with limited access to safe water.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people living in Cyclone Kenneth-affected areas lost access to water, including due to power cuts in key urban centres, such as Macomia, Mucojo and Quissanga towns. Each of these factors significantly heightened the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera and malaria. Meanwhile, women and girls have been forced to walk longer distances to access clean water and firewood, exposing them to heightened risk of gender-based violence.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai caused major damage to health facilities, with at least 62 health centres damaged or destroyed. The emergency room of the Beira Central Hospital was extensively damaged during Cyclone Idai’s landfall, rendering it non-functional in the aftermath of the storm.

At the same time, community health centres lost access to supply chains for drugs, with damaged medicine being lost and were unable to open due to flooding. It is estimated that 67,000 women impacted by Cyclone Idai are reportedly pregnant, of whom 60 per cent (19,000) were expected to give birth in the three months following landfall. Meanwhile, over 7,000 pregnant women are estimated to be at risk of unsafe childbirth in areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth. The majority of these women were attending pre-natal clinics in health centres which have been destroyed or damaged. HIV prevalence in Mozambique is among the highest globally, and this disaster is expected to increase the risk of transmission as well as to jeopardise access to care for people living with HIV. In Sofala province, which bore the brunt of Cyclone Idai, at least one in six adults are HIV positive. In Buzi, several women and girls who reported having sex for money noted that more money is typically offered if they do not use condoms, exposing them to heightened risk of sexually transmitted disease.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai and the preceding drought are occurring in a context of chronic undernutrition.

Prior to Cyclone Idai, five districts were expected to face IPC Acute Malnutrition phase 2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season: Balama in Cabo Delgado; Marara in Tete province; Milange in Zambezia province and Macossa in Manica province. Each of the causes of acute malnutrition in these districts - including low quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access to safe water sources – have been exacerbated by the drought and floods. Results from the annual food security and nutrition analysis (SETSAN) prior to Cyclone Kenneth already showed a concerning food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence: Macomia,

Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade, Palma and Quissanga. This includes two of the districts – Macomia and Quissanga – hardest-hit by Cyclone Kenneth.

Both drought and floods have negatively impacted children’s well-being and their access to education. The government reports that Cyclone Kenneth damaged at least 480 classrooms, affecting close to 42,000 children. Meanwhile,

Cyclone Idai damaged more than 2,800 classrooms. In addition, many children have been displaced away from their homes and schools, and many schools were initially used as collective centres for the displaced, rendering them non-functional for educational purposes. Although school has resumed in most of the affected areas, many classrooms are still damaged and in need of immediate repair and rehabilitation. In the drought-affected areas, poor concentration in class due to hunger and thirst was reported and shortage of water led to migration of the most vulnerable rural families, causing their children to drop out of school.

There are also reports of significant psychosocial support needs amongst children following the cyclones.

Extensive damage to key roads and bridges, has compromised people’s access to services and basic supplies.

The impact of cyclones Kenneth and Idai resulted in many people being unable to move freely due to the persistence of flood waters and damaged road networks. Key roads in each of the affected areas were cut for significant periods.

After Cyclone Idai, for example, the N6 was cut, leaving Beira City cut-off and disabling a key supply route in the country. In Nhamatanda, people were isolated between the Zimbabwean border and the flood-affected areas. Food prices reportedly rose by more than 100 per cent in some affected areas and transport costs in the limited accessible areas have either doubled or tripled. Poor families, who lost everything in the floods, were unable to purchase basic items. After Cyclone Kenneth, the roads to Metuge town, Mucojo Sede in Macomia, and other areas were inaccessible. The isolation of communites increases the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, as boys, girls and families become desperate for livesaving resources such as food, shelter and water. It is critical that the response reduces the risk of exploitation.

The humanitarian situation is compounded by high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Both Cyclones Kenneth and Idai are expected to exacerbate this situation, as recent poverty analysis conducted in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food consumption and that affected households also cut back on expenditures in basic non-food items. The rain-dependent agricultural sector -which accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of the labour force- has been hard-hit by Cyclone Idai.

This revised Humanitarian Response Plan will enable response to the most immediate and life-saving needs arising from Cyclone Idai over a three month period, along with sustained response to the pre-existing needs in drought-affected areas. It will also allow partners to immediately kick-start crucial recovery actions to begin restoring livelihoods and self-reliance, which will continue beyond the three-month horizon. Over the coming three months, the humanitarian community will review the situation, with the Government, to determine next steps, while simultaneously engaging with development partners to urge rapid action to tackle the longer-term issues resulting from the storm, including reconstruction and recovery","Sat, 25 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/UN0306052.jpg?itok=CgAdk5Vi,"['mozambique', 'revised', 'response', 'plan', 'idai', 'humanitarian', 'cyclone', 'following', 'including', 'kenneth', 'cyclones', 'access', '2019', 'food', 'landfall', 'areas', 'water']",

Mozambique’s vulnerability to climate change is a function of its location and geography: large areas of the country are exposed to tropical cyclones, droughts (every three to four years) and river/coastal storm surge flooding. This vulnerability is heightened by the country’s 2,470 km of coastline and socioeconomic fragility. More than 60 percent of the population lives in low-lying coastal areas, where intense storms from the Indian Ocean and sea level rise put infrastructure, coastal agriculture, key ecosystems and fisheries at risk. Although migration to urban areas is rising, two-thirds of the population still resides in rural areas with limited access to electricity, improved drinking water and sanitation. Forty-five percent of the population lives below the poverty line and 70 percent depends on climate-sensitive agricultural production for their food and livelihoods. Increased frequency and severity of intense storms, droughts and floods are likely to exacerbate these development challenges. For example, El Niño conditions in 2015–2016 caused the worst drought in 35 years, reducing food availability by 15 percent. Food insecurity caused by the drought worsened in 2017 with Cyclone Dineo, which damaged crops and destroyed infrastructure.

Failed rains across eastern Africa, southern Africa, and the Horn of Africa are seeing another dire season for farmers, increasing food prices and driving up the aid needs of tens of millions of already vulnerable people across the three regions.

All told, more than 45 million people will struggle to find enough food across 14 countries in 2019, many feeling the compounded effects of years of drought.

It’s the second time in three years that an El Niño event has disrupted weather patterns. In 2017 – a year in which the UN labelled the crisis the worst in decades – some 38 million people were in need.

Drought again in 2018 was followed by significantly below-average rains at the beginning of this year – down by 50 percent in parts of southern Africa.

In the Horn and eastern Africa, delayed rains finally arrived in May, allowing some regrowth of pasture for grazing. But it has not been enough to offset the damage to people’s livelihoods and overall food security.

“We need to move to a system where we act much earlier on the warning signs of drought and hunger so that we can cut response times and costs, and reduce deaths and human suffering,” the UN’s Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, said in reference to the drought in the Horn.

The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has released $45 million to encourage major donors to do more to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

With an El Niño forecast more than six months ago, World Food Programme climatologist Jesse Mason argues there should have been time for governments and aid agencies to put in place risk-reduction measures: drought-resistant seeds, irrigation systems, and cash transfers to cushion the impact on farmers.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt.”

It can no longer be business as usual, Mason told The New Humanitarian. Southern and eastern Africa are on the front lines of climate change, and mitigation measures must now be much more data-driven, comprehensive, and innovative.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt,” said Mason, project manager at WFP’s forecast-based financing initiative. “The pieces need to come together, from the global forecasting to the way we interact with farmers on the ground based on that information.”

The following is a snapshot of needs across southern, eastern, and the Horn of Africa.

The term “food crisis” The term “food crisis” means households that are just about able to meet their basic food needs, but only by selling some essential assets like livestock. There may also be cases of malnutrition. A “food emergency” refers to very high levels of malnutrition and some deaths. All assets are liquidated, making recovery so much harder.

Angola

In need: 2.3 million

The government declared an emergency in the three southern provinces of Cunene, Huila, and Namibe in January. Angola has been pursuing a humanitarian self-reliance policy but the response has been inadequate and the situation is deteriorating.

Ethiopia

In need: 8.3 million

The most vulnerable communities have suffered consecutive years of drought. This season’s Gu long rains (March to May) were poor or delayed. Although a late burst of rainfall has helped replenish pasture in the south and southeast, it came too late for some crop-producing areas and the food security situation is expected to deteriorate. Numbers in need are exacerbated by mass internal displacement as a result of inter-communal violence – affecting some 2.6 million. Concerns are also rising over potential food aid pipeline breaks that could interrupt life-saving operations. It’s $1.3 billion aid appeal is only 15 percent funded.

Kenya

In need: 2.5 million

The long rains were similarly poor – less than half the expected amount fell by April. By July the number of severely food insecure is projected to more than double from the current 1.1 million to 2.5 million. Below-average terms of trade and reduced household incomes during the July to September dry season could push parts of eastern Kenya into crisis by August.

Lesotho

In need: 640,000

Four districts are at crisis or emergency levels – Mohale’s Hoek, Maseru, Quthing, and Qacha’s Nek. A total of 640,000 people are projected to be food insecure over the next 12 months. Lesotho has a population of 2.2 million.

Madagascar

In need: 1.3 million

By March, 1.3 million people were severely food insecure. Although the vulnerable southern region received fair rainfall this season, the harvest is forecast to be well below average. The south is yet to recover from the effects of the 2015/16 El Niño and the 2017/18 drought, and the number of children who are acutely malnourished is expected to rise in 2019.

Malawi

In need: 3.3 million

Some 2.8 million people are projected to be in crisis and 450,000 at emergency levels of food needs during the October to March lean season in the country’s southern and central districts.

Mozambique

In need: 1.85 million

More than 1.7 million people were identified as in crisis between September and December 2018 across 11 provinces. As a result of Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth in April, an estimated 1.85 million are now in need of aid.

Namibia

In need: 550,000

At the beginning of May the government declared a drought-induced state of emergency – the third time in six years. All regions of the country are affected, with 24 percent of the 2.3 million population facing food shortfalls.

Somalia

In need: 5.4 million

After two consecutive poor rainy seasons Somalia is facing yet another drought. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) have failed, on top of a poor 2018 Deyr season (October to December), contributing to widespread crop failure and lower livestock productivity. Pastoral communities in the worst-affected areas – in the north and centre of the country – are facing acute food insecurity. Drought-related displacement is underway and malnutrition rates are rising. Food aid levels have “significantly declined” compared with last year. A $700 million drought response plan has been launched.

South Sudan

In need: 7.1 million

Conflict and drought has created a disastrous situation. Some 6.9 million people – close to 60 percent of the population – are currently facing severe food insecurity with an estimated 50,000 in “famine-like” conditions. In many areas, malnutrition levels remain critical, with some 860,000 children under the age of five estimated to be severely malnourished. Out of the overall 7.1 million people in need, only 5.7 million are targeted for aid. The aid appeal stands at $1.5 billion, but so far only $346 million has been received.

Sudan

In need: 5.6 million

Around one million people are facing emergency conditions – concentrated in the states of Khartoum and South Darfur. The Darfur region accounts for 45 percent of all Sudanese in need (crisis and emergency levels). Sudan’s crisis is less weather-related and more a consequence of food price rises. Overall, prices of grains were at record or near-record levels in March despite an above-average 2018 harvest. The depreciation of the local currency, fuel shortages and input costs combined to push up the cost of living - one of the triggers for the protests that led to the toppling of former president Omar al-Bashir in April.

Uganda

In need: Unknown

The arid Karamoja region – bordering Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia – has been hit by a second failed rainy season. Numbers in need are not yet known, but staple food prices are expected to remain high through to September, well above the five-year average.

Zambia

In need: 1.3 million

Maize producing areas in the south experienced their worst drought since 1981. Maize production is estimated to have dropped to two million tonnes from approximately 2.4 million tonnes last season and exports have been banned – which will impact prices in the region. The projected number of households needing food aid from July to February 2020 is 220,000 – a 38 percent increase from last season.

Zimbabwe

In need: 5.3 million

Total cereal production this season was estimated at 852,000 tonnes, against a national requirement of 1.8 million tonnes for human consumption and 450,000 tonnes for livestock. Compared to the 2017/18 season, the provinces of Manicaland, Matabeleland South, and Matabeleland North all saw their maize production drop by more than 70 percent. Climate shocks have compounded severe economic difficulties. By September, most of the country is expected to be in “crisis”.

Moreover, WFP said that the hunger period will peak at the height of the lean season, from January through March 2020, when 59 per cent of rural households, or over 5.5 million people, will be food insecure.

“Given the scale and scope of the food insecurity in Zimbabwe”, Mr. Verhoosel said “WFP is planning to scale up to assist over two million people” by the peak of the lean season during early next year.

Until then, teams will continue providing food assistance to the most vulnerable populations, while also helping communities to build resilience to climate change and future shock impacts.

Over the next nine months, he said that WFP urgently requires $173 million to meet these needs.

The Committee is a consortium of government, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and other international organizations, and the Rural Livelihood Assessment provides key information for government and development partners on rural livelihood programming in southern African nation. WFP plays a key role in contributing financially and technically to the assessment.

Cyclones, drought push Mozambicans deep into food insecurity

And apart from the deadly cyclones that hit both Mozambique and Zimbabwe earlier in the year, Mozambique’s population has also suffered a rise in food insecurity, fueled by other extreme weather events, Mr. Verhoosel said.

In January, tropical storm Desmond flooded the central provinces of Sofala, Tete and Zambézia. And in March, Cyclone Idai destroyed unharvested crops.

Six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth slammed the province of Cabo Delgado in the north. Since that time the area has been suffering through irregular rainfall patterns and cereal crops have been hit by pest infestations.

Assistance aims to reach 1.2 million people – 900,000 of whom live in areas affected by Idai, 100,000 in areas affected by Kenneth and 250,000 people in areas affected by the drought.

Mr. Verhoosel referenced a WFP report pointing out that “1.6 million people already face acute food crisis” in 63 districts. The most recent revision of the Integrated Classification of Food Security Phase, highlights the ""difficult situation"" the country of more than 29 million inhabitants faces, until its next harvest.

While WFP had initially planned from July to October to help some 560,000 people each month in areas affected by cyclones and droughts, the rising need has sparked the agency to scale that number to 1.25 million beneficiaries per month.

Based on current needs, including the response to drought and Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, WFP requires $102 million over the next six months to implement its recovery plan.

To provide adequate and timely assistance, “resources must now be mobilized"" in response to increased needs”, warned Mr. Verhoosel.","Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2019/04/MOZ_20190321_WFP-Deborah_Nguyen_10_c7c4.JPG/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['droughts', 'agency', 'mr', 'affected', 'insecure', 'verhoosel', 'zimbabwe', 'food', 'assistance', 'wfp', 'rural', 'million', 'scale', 'millions', 'areas', 'scales', 'leave']",

Multiple and consecutive shocks, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people* -almost 10 per cent of the country’s population- in need of life-saving and resilience-building assistance in Mozambique

Poor performance of the January-March 2019 rainy season in southern provinces (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane) caused substantial agricultural losses, with lingering effects expected to last until the next main harvest in 2020. Then, for the first time in recorded history, two strong tropical cyclones hit the country during the same season in 2019, leaving a trail of death, damage and destruction whose impacts will be felt well into 2020. Cyclone Idai made landfall in March 2019 near Beira City in Sofala Province, bringing strong winds and torrential rains to Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces. Six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Combined, the two cyclones killed at least 648 people (45 deaths due to Cyclone Kenneth and at least 603 due to Cyclone Idai); injured nearly 1,700 people; damaged or destroyed more than 277,700 homes; and fully or partially destroyed more than 4,200 classrooms. In Cabo Delgado, it is estimated that approximately 60,000 people have been affected and/ or displaced by insecurity since October 2017, including over 200 attacks on villages by armed groups and clashes between security forces and armed groups. For people in villages previously impacted by violence, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth’s landfall represented a crisis on top of a crisis.

More than 1.6 million people are severely food insecure, and this number is expected to increase to 2 million people during the lean season (October 2019-March 2020), according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the Food Security and Nutrition Assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in June 2019. Entrenched gender inequalities in Mozambique render women and children more food insecure and susceptible to malnutrition than men. In areas impacted by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, over 80 per cent of the population is dependent on farming/agriculture as primary source of income, and 76 per cent of households headed by women are reliant on subsistence farming. These smallholders have sustained significant crop loss, damaged land, and lost access to savings groups and most have inadequate seed supplies to prepare for the September/ November planting season. Farming families who had already been affected by drought lost all or large portions of their seed stores and the cyclones wiped out the lower-than-usual harvests. Following Cyclone Idai’s landfall, more than 715,000 hectares of staple crops were destroyed together with plant nurseries and irrigation systems, while Cyclone Kenneth affected nearly 55,500 hectares, uprooted over 100,000 cashew and coconut trees, and caused loss of livelihoods, including fishing and aquaculture. Farmers in Manica and Sofala – the two provinces hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai and the subsequent catastrophic flooding - produce approximately 25 per cent of the national cereal output. In Cabo Delgado, violence-related displacement has distanced people from their livelihoods and farming in rural areas may be impacted in the months ahead as communities fear going to the fields in case of attack by armed groups. In the central zone, there are indications that part of the agricultural losses may be offset by the production of the second season, prospects of reconstruction and good agricultural production of the next 2019/2020 campaign. Yet, drought-affected areas in the south of the country are struggling to recover and will likely face an early onset to the lean season. Humanitarian assistance provided in the hardest-hit areas has prevented a more severe deterioration. However, people facing severe food insecurity require urgent assistance through integrated interventions -food assistance, agriculture, livestock and fishery inputs, rehabilitation of infrastructures– to mitigate the lack of food and restore their livelihoods and assets ahead of, and during, the next lean season.

Malnutrition is expected to rise during the 2019/2020 lean season and, for the first time since 2001, cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Mozambique.

To date over 250 cases have been confirmed and the Ministry of Health is preparing for up to 3600 cases in the coming months. An estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for Severe Acute Malnutrition and 61,000 for Moderate Acute Malnutrition, according to the SETSAN nutrition survey which covered 31 districts as well as nutrition data in Cabo Delgado collected prior to Tropical Cyclone Kenneth. In districts affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, figures do not yet reflect the impact of the cyclones on acute malnutrition, as surveys were carried out before or immediately after the cyclones. Two districts in Cabo Delgado - Ibo and Mecufi – are facing a Serious nutrition situation (Phase 3 of the IPC Acute Malnutrition classification) from July to September and this is expected to increase to four districts – Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa (Zambezia), Balama (Cabo Delgado) and Doa (Tete) – from October 2019 to February 2020.

The cyclones significantly exacerbated pre-existing protection risks, including child protection concerns, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Before the cyclones, families affected by drought in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala were adopting negative crisis strategies and emergency strategies, including selling productive assets and animals, and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water. After the cyclones in March and April of 2019, many families lost everything –their homes, their livelihoods and productive family members– and this has heightened the risks of adopting negative coping strategies, including pushing women and children into child labour, child trafficking, child early forced marriage and survival sex, to survive in the months ahead.

Concurrently, the cyclones drastically weakened the response capacities of the social welfare and justice sectors, causing large numbers of pre-existing and emergency-related protection cases to go unaddressed. In areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth (Cabo Delgado and Nampula) it is estimated that approximately 60,000 people have been affected and/ or displaced by insecurity, including over 200 attacks or raids on villages since October 2017 by unidentified armed groups and clashes between security forces and armed groups.

Furthermore, displaced populations, particularly women, often do not have clear tenure arrangements and limited access to land ownership, which aggravates their insecurity and vulnerability to exploitation. Legal support to secure tenure, especially for women, will be critical to set the most basic preconditions for recovery.

Three months after the cyclones hit, and just four months before the next rainy season, more than half a million people (100,000 households) are reportedly still living in destroyed or structurally damaged homes or makeshift shelters.

Another 60,000 people (over 12,000 households) remain in resettlement sites and an estimated 60,000 people have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado.

Many of the shelters that people are residing in are unsafe, inadequately prepared, and lack access to fundamental basic goods and services –such as water and sanitation, shelter and non-food items (NFIs), health, education and protection services and safe spaces– which are their guaranteed minimum rights laid out in international human rights law and inter-agency guidance. Already before the cyclones, quality of housing both in rural and in urban areas was largely poor, mostly due to families’ lack of financial capacity to invest in quality materials, lack of knowledge of safe construction techniques (in urban areas) and traditional building techniques not being adapted to the increased impact of the climate related hazards. The high level of damage caused by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth was exacerbated by this prevailing poor quality of the existing housing stock. At the same time, pre-existing high poverty rates, compounded by high levels of food insecurity, have meant that many families have been unable to rebuild their homes to a minimum level of resilience. Reportedly, vulnerable families have been selling received shelter materials to buy food. At the same time, the precarious living conditions faced by people in destroyed or damaged shelters and resettlement sites have heightened exposure to protection risks, especially for women and children. In some sites, children must walk 3 to 7 kilometres to reach primary schools, while secondary schools are further than 7 kilometres away. Meanwhile, lighting in many sites is scant, numbers of latrines are insufficient, and women and adolescent girls are forced to walk long distances to access water and firewood – all contributing to increased cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (GBV).

People’s access to health was severely affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, with at least 94 health centres damaged, according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment of May 2019. Equipment, furniture, essential medicines and medical supplies were also destroyed, and staff working in the health sector were themselves impacted by the disasters. People impacted by drought, cyclones/floods and insecurity remain exposed to disease outbreaks (cholera, malaria, dengue etc.), while there is limited access to essential health care services at resettlement sites. While emergency health assistance has helped contain outbreaks and provide life-saving care, challenges related to re-establishment of health services and ongoing provision of medical equipment and medicines remain. Hospitals and clinics in areas experiencing severe water crisis may not able to maintain basic services due to shortages of water, leading to potential closure of inpatient/ admission facilities, inability to conduct institutional childbirth deliveries and impact on those with chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS. In Beira City, which was among those hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai, one in six adults live with HIV, and access to anti-retroviral drugs was compromised by the cyclone. Of the total population affected by Cyclone Idai and Kenneth, UNFPA estimated that there were 149,000 are pregnant women, 17,572 women at risk of life-threatening, pregnancy-related emergencies. With a pre-cyclone maternal death of 452 deaths per 100,000 live birth maternal mortality continues to be a challenge in Mozambique. Destruction of birthing health facilities, equipment, medicines and loss of health records predisposes women and girls of child bearing age to limited access to SRHR services including antenatal care, family planning services and skilled attendance at birth, and could lead to an increase in preventable maternal and neonatal deaths and unplanned pregnancies.

The consecutive crises have negatively impacted education for both boys and girls. Some 1,300 schools and more than 4,200 classrooms were damaged or destroyed. Many school buildings still do not have roofs, some school toilets and water supply are dysfunctional or lacking, and damaged asbestos sheets in school compounds posing health hazards to children and teachers. There are still 50 resettlement sites in 4 provinces, with some 30,000 children 1 to 17 years.

About 90 per cent of them have access to a functional school but 24 per cent have to walk for more than one hour to get to school and only 14 per cent have a school in less than 15 minutes’ walking distance. In the resettlement sites, children learn in Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS); with no desks or benches for teachers or pupils and poor ventilation due to overcrowding and hot tarpaulin tents. Authorities continue to request support for the reconstruction and repair of classrooms and tents and to set-up new temporary classrooms. The quality of teaching and learning are also affected as many teachers and students remain traumatised, exhibiting symptoms of fear, nervousness and distress, resulting in lack of concentration. Female teachers, in particular, have concerns due to damage to their homes and for the safety of their children while at school. Psychosocial support and development of psychosocial support skills is therefore critical for teachers, parents and communities to enable them to assist school children. Contact time between teachers and pupils has reduced as the cyclones caused a loss of days of classes ranging from one to two weeks.

Schools in resettlement sites run shifts to accommodate more children. In some cases, pupils in higher primary or secondary levels do not study because there are no corresponding levels of education offered in their camps. There is apprehension that there may be an increase in school dropouts and early marriages as negative coping strategies for vulnerable families who have lost their livelihoods. There are already reports that boys are absconding from school to earn money for their families and of girls being forced to stay home when funds are limited, as families prioritise boys’ education.

Teachers need teaching materials and children need essential educational materials.

Reduced access to safe water and sub optimal sanitation and hygiene practices could increase the risks of water borne ad vector diseases. Safe water supply coverage in Mozambique stood at 49 per cent prior to the two cyclones, with a large disparity between urban coverage (80 per cent) and rural coverage (35 per cent) even prior to the climate events. Sanitation coverage across the country was 21 per cent, with only 11 per cent coverage in rural areas, and 40 per cent of people still practicing open defecation. Increased use of unprotected water sources increases the risk of outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, eye infections and intestinal parasites, and jeopardizes menstrual hygiene.","Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1361938-ROSEA_20190911_Mozambique_Response_Plan.png?itok=IWpEwtOU,"['mozambique', 'plan', '20182020', 'affected', 'health', 'cent', 'kenneth', '2018', 'women', 'cyclone', 'cyclones', '2020', 'revised', 'humanitarian', '2019', 'children', 'response', 'school', 'water']",

A recent Food and Nutrition report estimates 1.4 million people are currently food insecure and this number could increase to 2.3 million by March 2017.

In 2016, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health trained mobile brigades have screened more than 118,000 children for severe acute malnutrition and treated more than 8,100 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

UNICEF is conducting assessments on nutrition to determine the need for increased interventions in Maputo, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia and some districts in Sofala province.

In 2016, UNICEF has reached over 23,900 people with safe water through water trucking and point-of-use water treatment in Magude district.

There have been no outbreaks of cholera reported in the country since August 2016. However, UNICEF continues to support the Government with disease surveillance and preparedness, particularly in high risk districts.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought continues to affect 1.4 million people in Mozambique according to the most recent SETSAN (Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition) report released in September 2016. Although there is a slight decrease in the overall number of food insecure people from 1.5 million reported in July to 1.4 million reported in September, the report projects that the number of people experiencing food insecurity and nutrition crisis could reach 2.3 million between October 2016 and March 2017. The assessment was used to guide revisions of the Strategic Response Plan (SRP) and to develop scenarios under the Government’s national contingency plan for the 2016-2017 rainy and cyclone season.

Results from the SETSAN assessment contributed to the government’s decision to extend the Red Alert for the time being. UNICEF is conducting complementary assessments on nutrition in the IPC 2-3 level provinces to determine the need for increased interventions in Maputo, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia and some districts in Sofala province.

The forecasts of the National Meteorological Institute for Mozambique indicate normal to above normal rainfall for the period October to December 2016 in the south and central provinces (Figure 1), and normal to above normal for the period January to March 2017 in Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia (Figure 2). However, the northern parts of Nampula and Gaza expect below normal rainfall between January and March 2017. The implications for drought impact and risks to children are the beginning of a long recovery from food and water shortages, complicated by moderate to high risks of flooding and displacement between January and March 2017 in some parts of northern provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, central provinces of Zambezia, Manica and Sofala, and southern provinces of Inhambane and Maputo.","Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/662686-UNICEF%20Mozambique%20Humanitarian%20SitRep%20-%20October%202016.png?itok=aKQWi9mI,"['mozambique', 'children', 'humanitarian', 'drought', 'report', 'unicef', 'food', 'provinces', 'normal', 'situation', 'million', 'nutrition', 'zambezia', '2016', 'water']", 
15,15,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,"First cyclone, then slavery: risks abound for Mozambique children - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mozambique-floods-trafficking-idUSKCN1R81EF,"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of children who survived a cyclone in southeast Africa face fresh risks in its aftermath - being sold into slavery by human traffickers or forced into early marriage by families struggling to survive, aid workers say.

Traffickers often prey on lone children caught up in chaotic scenes such as Cyclone Idai, they said, while parents might marry off their young girls as they struggle to eke out a life.

At least 678 people have died and nearly 3 million have been affected after Cyclone Idai hammered Mozambique’s port city of Beira on March 14 before moving inland to neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe, the United Nations said.

Idai’s winds ripped apart homes, schools and medical centers and torrential rains triggered floods that inundated vast swathes of farmland in one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere.

With the U.N. estimating up to a million children affected in Mozambique alone, aid workers are particularly concerned about orphaned children and those separated from their families who are fending for themselves almost two weeks on.

“In crises like these big, natural disasters, children and parents can easily lose one another,” Rik Goverde from Save the Children charity told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Chimoio, 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Beira.

“Children are out there on their own - without the supervision or care of a trustworthy adult. They can easily fall victim to sexual violence or human trafficking. We are aware and very concerned about it.”

Goverde said that one mother he met had lost three children, swept away in flood waters, while other colleagues had come across children who had seen their parents die.

The charity’s helpline had received about 10 calls from families reporting missing children, he said, though this was likely “just the tip of the iceberg” as some telecommunications and power lines were still down.

Reports of missing children and unaccompanied children are being registered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on their website, he said, with the priority being to reunite families as quickly as possible.

About 350 people registered on the website - either looking for missing relatives or marking themselves as safe. About 24 children are registered as missing, with teams on the ground collecting more names of the lost and missing.

ALREADY STRESSED

Mozambique is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, destination country for men, women and children who are trafficked into forced labor and sexual slavery, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons report.

Children are often forced to work in sectors such as farming and mining. Women and girls are often lured to cities in Mozambique or South Africa with promises of employment, only to be sold into domestic or sexual servitude, it added.

Experts say post-disaster trafficking has become common in developing nations as an increase in extreme events caused by global warming leaves the already poor even more vulnerable.

The breakdown of social institutions makes it hard to find food and humanitarian supplies, leaving women and children at risk of kidnapping, sexual exploitation and trafficking.

Aid workers say young girls could also be forced to wed as parents who have lost homes and crops are pushed to the brink and seek ways to ease the burden on the rest of the family.

“Mozambique is already among the top 10 countries in the world with the highest rates of child marriage - around 48 percent of girls are married before 18,” said Anne Hoff, Plan International’s Country Director in Mozambique.

“We do know that when there is a drought and there is a lack of food, we tend to see an increase in early marriages. There is a high risk it could happen as the crops have been destroyed and it will be very difficult for people to recover.”","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['mozambique', 'children', 'parents', 'cyclone', 'slavery', 'missing', 'girls', 'sexual', 'forced', 'workers', 'trafficking', 'women', 'risks', 'abound', 'families']",

This study looks at the gendered impact of the 2016 drought in southern Mozambique, specifically the ways in which it affected women and girls. The report is beneficial for those wishing to better inform their policy and programmes targeting women and girls in southern Mozambique, as well as other similar drought-affected areas.

Methodology

The study followed a combination of qualitative research techniques that characterize Rapid Assessment Procedures. This approach has been applied to study attitudes, behaviours and the motivation of individuals and collective actors within their social and cultural cosmology.

Several data collection methods were used: focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and structured direct observations. The study was a rapid assessment and it sheds light and gives key indications on the impact of the drought on women and girls. A desk review was conducted to gather relevant information to design the research instruments and protocol.

Key findings

Increased workloads and responsibilities

Additional activities for women: while prior to the drought they relied on an agrarian economy, they now have to embrace traditional masculine activities, such as harvesting wood. Women now spend 10 to 12 hours collecting water, and girls have to join them. Men continue to migrate towards urban areas, particularly South Africa, and women and children are now also migrating. There is an increased burden on women and grandmothers to provide for the household.

Gender-based violence (GBV)

Child marriage may potentially be a mechanism for coping with the drought. There is evidence of young women and girls moving to areas of richer cattle herders and rhino hunters. There is increased marital conflict due to scarcity of resources.

Sexual and reproductive health

Transactional sex is a means to access food and financial resources. There are reports of young women migrating to male worker compounds and regions with wealthier men. Women’s hygiene has been compromised.

Conclusion

Young women have become increasingly exposed to early and unwanted pregnancies, child marriage, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Despite a shift in the division of labour between the sexes, there is an asymmetrical gendered power dynamic that leads to increased exposure to conflict and GBV, including domestic violence and perpetrator authority at home.

Exposure to HIV and STIs is on the rise, along with unwanted and early pregnancy and maternal death, due to compromised personal hygiene and the prevalence of transactional sex. Water collecting activities have compromised the education of girls.

Women are increasingly exposed to abandonment and widowhood due to the migration of men.","Wed, 01 Nov 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/977609-KB%20-%20Women%20and%20Drought%20in%20Southern%20Mozambique.png?itok=MKp8noyU,"['mozambique', 'responsibilities', 'southern', 'vulnerabilities', 'brief', 'men', 'young', 'power', 'drought', 'water', 'violence', 'girls', 'increased', 'women', 'study', 'activities', 'evidence']",

This climate change profile is designed to help integrate climate actions into development activities. It complements the publication ‘Climate-smart = Future-Proof! – Guidelines for Integrating climate-smart actions into development policies and activities’ and provides answers to some of the questions that are raised in the step-by-step approach in these guidelines.

The current and expected effects of climate change differ locally, nationally and regionally. The impacts of climate change effects on livelihoods, food and water security, ecosystems, infrastructure etc. differ per country and region as well as community and individual, with gender a particularly important vulnerability factor. This profile aims to give insight in the climate change effects and impacts in Mozambique, with particular attention for food security and water. It also sheds light on the policies, priorities and commitments of the government in responding to climate change and important climate-relevant activities that are being implemented, including activities being internationally financed.

Summary

Mozambique is one of Africa’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Poverty, weak institutional development and frequent extreme weather events make Mozambique especially vulnerable. Climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods and cyclones are occurring with increasing frequency, which is having a cumulative and devastating impact on a population that is insufficiently prepared.

Central Mozambique is projected to experience recurrent agricultural losses as a result of droughts, floods, and uncontrolled bush fires. The densely populated coastal lowlands will be increasingly affected by severe erosion, saltwater intrusion, loss of vital infrastructure and the spread of diseases such as malaria, cholera, and influenza.

Changing rainfall patterns will lead to a decrease of soil water recharge, impacting ground water resources and the water table in wells. Reduction of Mozambique’s trans-boundary river flows will decrease the availability of surface water.","Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1241774-Mozambique.png?itok=6Rl9sBF-,"['security', 'mozambique', 'change', 'climate', 'development', 'effects', 'profile', 'vulnerable', 'activities', 'water']", 
18,18,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,6 months after cyclone Idai: farmers are fainting in fields because of hunger - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/6-months-after-cyclone-idai-farmers-are-fainting-fields-because-hunger,"Six months on from the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Idai in which more than 1,000 people were killed in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, hunger is escalating as the United Nation’s humanitarian response in Mozambique is less than half funded, warned Oxfam. Only 45% of Mozambique’s humanitarian appeal has been funded, while the number of people in need of food aid has risen by 25% since April 2019 – up from 1.6 million to 2 million as the impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth has been compounded by drought in the South and unrest in the North.

Farmers are fainting in the fields along the southern shore of the Buzi river because they have nothing to eat but tomato soup, one of the few fast-growing crops people could plant after the extensive flooding damaged their lands, wiped away their harvests and destroyed their seed stocks.

In dozens of resettled communities, relocated to mitigate the risk of future floods, people are not getting enough food and with the lean season approaching, there will not be a harvest until next year.

Rotafina Donco, Oxfam Country Director in Mozambique, said: “Things are taking an ominous turn, regardless of our efforts to provide resettled communities with essential aid: women are skipping meals so that the little food there is can be given to children. Families are foraging for wild plants as there’s not enough or very little to eat. Hunger risks becoming the silent killer of those who survived Idai.”

10 per cent of Mozambique’s population is now in need of food assistance and levels of food insecurity are rising to crisis threshold in hard to reach areas in Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete provinces, affected by Idai, as well as Cabo Delgado where Kenneth struck.

“Today, the emergency phase ought to be over but those who survived Idai are on the brink of a food insecurity crisis” says Donco. “Despite sustained aid efforts, the demand is outstripping supply: entire communities in Buzi district are facing shortages of food, clean water, shelter and access to livelihoods.”

Food insecurity is hitting women hardest, as even before the cyclone, poverty rates in the areas affected by Idai were higher than the national average, and the lack of recovery risks pushing them even deeper into deprivation. Aid donors and the government must prioritise the needs of women and girls.

José Mucote, Director of AJOAGO, said: “We were still grappling with a biting drought in the South, when Cyclone Idai and the floods struck central Mozambique. Each disaster is making people poorer by the day and more vulnerable to whatever may come next. Every day we’re supporting people who were already living in extreme poverty and had coped with a more and more crises over the past two decades.”

The Sofala region in central Mozambique was heavily hit by the Cyclone and flooding which, partially or totally, destroyed lands and crops of over 433,056 families. In dozens of displaced peoples’ sites where entire communities were relocated to mitigate the risk of future floods, thousands of people are relying on aid to survive. The lean season is now approaching, and the next harvest will only be ready by March/April 2020: until then, almost 2 million people will remain at risk of food insecurity.

As the intensity and frequency of natural hazards has increased because of the climate crisis, the people of Mozambique are left wondering whether the next rainy season will bring more flooding or another drought and how they can ensure the safety of their families and protect their livelihoods.

Notes to editors

In response to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, COSACA humanitarian consortium consisting of Oxfam in Mozambique, Save the Children International and Care International have to date reached over 600,000 people in Sofala, Manica, Tete, Zambezia, and Cabo Delgado provinces. COSACA response teams are ensuring the needs of women and girls are prioritised in the areas of nutrition and livelihoods, health, shelter, water and sanitation, child protection and education.

According to the revised UN Humanitarian Response Plan, which was released this week [12 September] 2.6m people still need humanitarian assistance in Mozambique and in particular 2m people are food insecure after Cyclones Idai and Kenneth. The figures are an increase from the previous Plan, released in March, which reported 1.6m facing food insecurity. In addition to the cyclones and floods, the analysis takes into account drought in the south and growing insecurity in the north of the country.

About 1.3 million people in Maputo and its surroundings are affected by the restrictions, raising fears of disease outbreaks.

""Diarrhoeal diseases including cholera are likely to occur in some neighbourhoods where populations will resort to unsafe sources; there,"" said Abreu.

Low rainfall over the past three years has left a dam that supplies the city with most of its water to just 19% of capacity.

Meteorologists forecast that the region will receive below-normal rains during the first three months of this year.

Mozambique is experiencing its most severe drought in more than 30 years. The drought is affecting approximately 1.5 million people in seven provinces in the Southern and Central regions of the country. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Government extended the institutional red alert for the most drought-affected provinces of Tete, Sofala, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Zambezia and Maputo.

The revised strategic response plan is targeting about 1.2 million people affected by drought with food security and other interventions in the seven provinces affected until the end of March 2017. The plan also includes a contingency for 190,000 persons that may be affected by floods and cyclones during the same period.

The HCT developed the SRP in April 2016 to support the Government in responding the current drought. The plan was reviewed in November 2016 and has three strategic objectives, namely:

Provide immediate life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable members of the populations affected by droughts in the form of food assistance and agricultural inputs, the availability of clean water and nutrition supplements.

Support the restoration of livelihoods of the drought-affected population through Early Recovery and resilience-building activities

To promote continued access to education services and ensure coordination and mainstreaming of protection initiatives in drought response interventions.

In terms of funding, the total cost to implement the current plan is estimated at US$ 211 million. The drought emergency response is valued at US$ 179 million. A contingency amount of US$ 32 million has been budgeted for the possible floods/cyclones emergency response. The total funding available for the drought response is 121 million US$, leaving a gap of approximately US$ 58 million. The emergency response will ensure that the most vulnerable members of those affected by drought and other extreme weather phenomena are prioritized in the delivery of assistance.

Efforts will be made to ensure that farmers are provided with seeds and other agricultural inputs, to ensure that they are able to plant their crops when the rains arrive and reap an abundant harvest in March of 2017. Furthermore, food assistance is planned to be provided to the most affected population in the seven provinces.

The protection cluster will provide advisory support to governement and humanitarian actors so that the response is gender-sensitive. They will also advocate for an appropriate response for targeting the most vulnerable and excluded.

The nutrition cluster will engage in active screening and case management of malnourished cases (both children and pregnant and lactating women) at the community level, and support infant and young child feeding in emergencies.

The education cluster will provide support to school feeding in prioritised areas, temporary learning spaces and teaching and learning materials for children and teachers affected by drought, flood, cyclones and/or military conflict. The cluster will further coordinate preparedness interventions and assess the current response capacity to respond to possible emergencies.

The WASH cluster will work to improve the access of potable water of households affected by drought through (i) water trucking where there were no other response options, (ii) drilling new boreholes where waters tables have dropped significantly, (iii) distribution of chlorine water treatment product (certeza) and (iv) rehabilitation/upgrading of existing community water points.","Sat, 31 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/695679-Reviewed%20SRP%20Drought%20Response%20Plan%20HCT_Moz_final%20version.png?itok=mmBEFqUN,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'affected', 'support', 'drought', 'ensure', 'million', 'strategic', 'cluster', '2016', 'vulnerable', 'water']",

Cyclones, floods, drought, and disease outbreaks continue to affect millions of people in the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region. Tropical cyclone Idai battered Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi in March 2019, leaving more than 3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. It was followed shortly after by tropical cyclone Kenneth, which hit Mozambique and Comoros. A drought in the region is already putting further strains on food availability. Early warning systems and early action can reduce the impact of natural disasters. EU assistance helps to strengthen the capacity of communities and disaster management authorities to deal with recurrent natural disasters.

What are the needs?

Extreme weather events are a regular occurrence in the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region. They are becoming all the more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. The food and nutrition situation in the region has deteriorated as households are grappling with the impact of recurrent disasters that have severely damaged their harvests and access to food. In March 2019, tropical cyclone Idai made landfall in central Mozambique, bringing devastating rains and floods that left 3 million people in need of emergency assistance in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. More than 650 people died while countless others lost their homes and livelihoods. Swathes of cultivated land were damaged by the floods. Just 6 weeks later, another cyclone struck northern Mozambique and Comoros, creating additional humanitarian needs.

In Mozambique, the cyclones came just before the annual harvest season and exacerbated food availability, as some cyclone-hit areas were already in the grip of drought, crop pests, and low agricultural yields.

In Zimbabwe, the floods that resulted from cyclone Idai put further pressures on food availability, already strained by a spell of drought and a volatile economic situation, affecting almost 3 million people.

In Southern Africa, the 2018/19 rainy season in the central and western countries of the region has been recorded as the driest since 1981. In August 2019, Zimbabwe declared the drought a state of national disaster.

How are we helping?

Since 2014, the EU has provided over €145 million in humanitarian aid for the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region, where EU funding goes towards disaster preparedness, emergency relief response, and food assistance. In 2019, the EU is supporting humanitarian action in the region with €45 million in funding.

EU humanitarian aid plays a pivotal role in promoting systems that can quickly provide vulnerable people affected by sudden disasters with emergency cash grants. This enables people to avoid having to sell their possessions when food runs out, only to find themselves even less able to cope with the next disaster.

Preparedness and prompt action can reduce the impact of natural disasters and help avert loss of life, livelihoods and property. The EU supports actions that step up communities’, and local and national disaster management authorities’ capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters. Several EU-funded projects use technology and innovative approaches, such as drones – used in the Idai response in Mozambique and Malawi - to map high-risk areas, or mobile text messages to warn communities of impending dangers. Increasing attention is given to disaster preparedness in schools through the promotion of safe learning facilities, training of teachers in early warning, and informing children on how to stay safe.

Following cyclones Idai and Kenneth, more than €17 million in EU funding helped provide people in need in Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Comoros with food, shelter, healthcare, access to clean water (WASH), as well as logistics support to reach isolated and cut-off areas. In the wake of cyclone Idai, civil protection teams from several EU countries were deployed to Mozambique through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Their emergency response included search and rescue operations, the setting up of emergency field hospitals, water purification systems and telecommunications support for humanitarian workers. The European Commission’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated to provide regular reference maps, showing the extent of the damage and inaccessible areas.

Beyond the immediate response, the EU also allocated an additional €10 million for Mozambique to address increasing food insecurity, health needs and emergency prepositioning to ensure preparedness for similar natural disasters. In Zimbabwe, the EU mobilised an additional €10 million in funding to address humanitarian needs in the country, arising from a combination of weather-related disasters (cyclone Idai and drought) and the deteriorating economic situation.

On 1 June 2019, the EU pledged an additional €200 million at the International Donors Pledging Conference in Mozambique to help the country in its recovery efforts and in strengthening its resilience. Of this amount, €100 million will come from the European Development Fund, while the remaining €100 million will be available in loans through the European Investment Bank.","Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1379238-southern_africa_and_indian_ocean_2019-10-10.png?itok=qWVKwU5Z,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'indian', 'echo', 'southern', 'idai', 'humanitarian', 'factsheet', 'cyclone', 'ocean', '2019', 'food', 'emergency', 'million', 'eu', 'disasters', 'region']", 
26,26,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Southern Africa drought threatens estimated 45 million people - Africanews English,https://www.africanews.com/2019/11/08/southern-africa-drought-threatens-estimated-45-million-people/,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.

Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.

“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.

“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”

Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.

Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.

Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.

“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”

Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.

The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - A record 45 million people across southern Africa face severe food shortages in the next six months, with around a quarter of them currently enduring drought-induced “crisis” food insecurity, three United Nations agencies warned on Thursday.

The 16-member Southern African Development Community is in the grips of a severe drought, as climate change wreaks havoc in impoverished countries struggling to cope with extreme natural disasters, such as Cyclone Idai which devastated Mozambique earlier this year.

“We’ve had the worst drought in 35 years in central and western areas during the growing season,” said Margaret Malu, acting regional director for southern Africa at the World Food Programme (WFP).

“We must meet the pressing emergency food and nutrition needs of millions of people, but also invest in building the resilience of those threatened by ever more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms,” Malu said in a statement.

WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) appealed jointly for urgent funding to help mitigate the effects of climate change in Africa.

Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and the region includes six of the nine African countries set to be hardest-hit by adverse weather in coming years - DR Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

“With the region so prone to shocks and afflicted by high rates of chronic hunger, inequality and structural poverty, climate change is an existential emergency which must be tackled with the utmost urgency,” said Robson Mutandi, IFAD Director for the Southern Africa hub said.","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191031&t=2&i=1446975902&r=LYNXMPEF9U1EE&w=800,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'change', 'southern', 'climate', 'crisis', 'malu', 'region', 'food', 'record', 'agencies', 'million', 'international', '45', 'severe', 'facing']",

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought emergency underscored the humanitarian crisis in Mozambique. Following two consecutive years of failed rains, particularly in the southern provinces of the country, the food security and nutritional situation in the country went from 1.5 million food insecure people in March 2016 to 2.1 million in November 2016, according to the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition’s (SETSAN) assessments. Of the 2.1 million people facing food insecurity and nutrition crisis, SETSAN estimated that about 1.2 million required humanitarian assistance up to March 2017, as this figure was the basis for the revision of the Humanitarian Country Team’s (HCT) strategic response plan (SRP).

Following the May 2017 assessment, this figure has been revised downwards to 350,000. In addition, the revised SRP included a contingency for 190,000 persons likely to be affected by floods and cyclone.

The Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) published the latest food security and nutrition assessment conducted in March and April 2017 (SMART surveys in three districts and Rapid Assessments using MUAC in 17 districts). Integrated Phase Classification for Acute Malnutrition (IPC-AM) was conducted in 20 districts in May 2017.

The results of the IPC-AM analysis classified two districts (Chiure and Namuno) in a critical situation (Phase 4); three districts (Mutarara, Ancuabe and Macossa) are in alert/serious (Phase 2/3); one district (Morrumbala) as alert (Phase 2); with the southern districts as acceptable (Phase 1). (Figure 1). While assessed, no statistically significant variation in malnutrition cases was found between girls and boys.

The IPC-AN analysis projection for the period from May to September 2017 considers that the situation is likely to improve with some districts, improving from critical to alert/serious situation to acceptable. There may be no phase changes in Ancuabe, Namuno and Mutarara (figure 2) as the underlying causes are less well understood.

The projected improvement of the nutrition situation, based on the IPC analysis is likely due to an improvement of food availability and access (including self-sufficient production), decrease in food prices (cereals) and decrease of childhood illness (diarrhoea, malaria). In contrast, the forecast for the lean season (October – February) the situation may deteriorate in two additional districts (Cahora Bassa, Mopeia). These trends are consistent with the number of children with acute malnutrition detected during outreach sessions.

In February 2017, Cyclone Dineo struck Inhambane and affected 600,000 people which increased the urgency and need for critical Food Security, Nutrition, WASH, Education,

Health and Protection interventions. The humanitarian landscape for the 2016/2017 emergency season in Mozambique was both complex in its diversity of events (drought, floods, cyclone, cholera, IDPs, conflict) and in terms of humanitarian needs. The humanitarian situation resulted in changes in the humanitarian architecture to provide increased coordination among partners and efficiency in the implementation and delivery of humanitarian action. The role of UNICEF as cluster lead has been prominent both in chairing the inter-agency cluster coordination group (ICCG) and as a member of the HCT core group. In this capacity, UNICEF has been a voice for stronger coordination and pro-active engagement of all partners’ contributions and views.","Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/925324-UNICEF%20Mozambique%20Mid-Year%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20-%20June%20-%20July%202017.png?itok=67FXnNhP,"['security', 'mozambique', 'children', 'humanitarian', 'districts', 'unicef', 'report', 'food', 'situation', 'nutrition', 'phase', '2017']",

UN-ASG / Director-General African Risk Capacity, Mohamed Beavogui and HE Adriano Afonso Maleiane, Mozambique’s Minister of Economy and Finance during one of the discussions leading to the signing of the MoU

Maputo, May 15, 2019 – The African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency and the Government of Mozambique have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide mid to long-term solutions against the recurrent episodes of drought, floods, and tropical cyclones in the country.

The MoU serves as “a framework to facilitate cooperation and collaboration between the ARC Agency and the Government, and to define the terms and conditions under which the Government and the ARC Agency will work together to address the impact of Extreme Climate Events on Mozambique, including through support provided by the ARC Agency for Mozambique, training of Government officials and other efforts in support of Mozambique objectives.”

Mozambique, which is emerging from two tropical cyclones, is vulnerable to climate change because of its location and geography which expose large areas of the country to tropical cyclones, droughts (every three to four years) and river/coastal storm surge flooding. This vulnerability is heightened by the country’s 2,470 km of coastline and socioeconomic fragility which puts infrastructure, coastal agriculture, key ecosystems and fisheries at risk.

Speaking about the signing of the MoU, the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and Director-General of ARC, Mohamed Beavogui indicated that the aim is to work with the Government of Mozambique to understand its own risk profile vis-à-vis the various perils facing the country and develop customised response plans. “ARC is a Development Insurance Mechanism which links risk profiling, contingency planning and a payout. “Although insurance will never cover all the risks associated with a peril in each country, the ARC approach allows for the risks to be managed in a way that multiplies the benefits from limited resources available to Government. Therefore, helping to save more lives and livelihoods at the early stage of a disaster…before the arrival of humanitarian assistance…,” ASG Beavogui stated. “The Government of the Mozambique appreciates the onset of formal collaboration with the African Risk Capacity” said HE Adriano Afonso Maleiane, Mozambique’s Minister of Economy and Finance. “We expect that the MoU will initial a well-coordinated take-off of activities towards strengthening the capacities of our climate management authority officials as well as other personnel to better understand our risk profile and provide quicker responses in the event of natural disasters,” he concluded.

Under the MoU, the Government of Mozambique and the ARC Agency will work together through the Program to prepare for the potential participation of the Government as an ARC Ltd member. At the end of the Program, the Government will decide whether to participate in ARC Ltd and its level of participation.

Government involvement in the Program does not commit it to participate in ARC Ltd but rather support an informed decision-making process on climate risk insurance.

ARC is working with other development partners including the African Development Bank as well as the World Bank towards a premium financing support to Mozambique when it decides to take the sovereign disaster risk insurance coverage.","Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1295258-ARC_MOZAMBIQUE_Mo%C3%A7ambique%20Assina%20um%20Memorando%20de%20Entendimento%20com%20a%20Capacidade%20Africana%20de%20Risco.png?itok=IC-Otz8t,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'agency', 'climate', 'support', 'drought', 'risks', 'insurance', 'enpt', 'floods', 'mou', 'arc', 'risk', 'country', 'signs', 'recurrent', 'episodes']",

CARE study finds evidence of harmful coping strategies in Mozambique / girls as young as 11 have to engage in survival sex for food

Maputo, 15th November 2016. Women and girls in Mozambique are struggling more than ever to cope with the current drought, the worst in 35 years, aggravated by a particularly powerful El Niño phenomenon, according to a new CARE study. Researchers have talked to 75 people in the region of Inhambane to get first-hand impressions of what the situation is like in areas affected by drought and hunger.

Up to 80 percent of the families are forced to reduce their meals to only one or two daily rations. Tens of thousands of children are expected to be acutely malnourished. The situation is particularly hard for teenage girls who lack the experience and knowledge to come up with strategies to protect themselves and their children from hunger.

According to CARE’s assessment, younger girls and adolescents are pulled out of school to help their parents fetch water.

”We are the second year into this drought in the South of the country and the situation of women and girls is becoming more and more destitute”, says Marc Nosbach, Country Director of CARE in Mozambique. “They are now spending up to six hours per day in search of water, three times as much as prior to the drought.”

The sheer desperation to provide for their families causes some women to resort to survival sex or other forms of exploitative behavior in return for money and food. CARE’s research also suggests an increase in child marriage, with families aiming to reduce the number of dependents in the family or cover expenses through the payment of a bride price. Ever since food has become painfully scarce in Mozambique, many girls are increasingly exposed to sexual and gender-based violence. “During our research we found that girls as young as 11 or 12 years have been lured away from water collection points by older men in exchange for food stocks or money. Some of the girls discovered later that they are pregnant and are consequently stigmatized by the community and family,” says Nosbach.

The CARE study also shows that those communities who participated in programs introducing new cultivation practices, better seeds and alternative income activities were far better prepared to manage lean months than those without knowledge. “We know that adaptation to climate change and droughts is our most effective tool to combat the severe effects. CARE urges the international community and decision-makers at the UN Climate Change Conference currently happening in Morocco to ensure sufficient funding for adaption and resilience programs. Otherwise, hard-won developmental gains will continue to unravel and recovery will be costly and take decades,” says Nosbach.

Other important findings:

• There is a new trend for women to migrate, leaving behind children in the care of grandparents. Furthermore, many men who traditionally migrate in search of seasonal work on farms and mines in South Africa were unable to return or send remittances to cover household expenses due to the fact that Southern Africa also feels the severe impact of drought. 70% of men and women have stated that their migration is due to lack of food, drought conditions or lack of water.

• Existing and new strategies to cope with the drought have high environmental and social costs. Families are increasingly taking up the production and sale of local beers to generate income. Some add locally brewed beer to the diet of their children to minimize hunger symptoms for their younger children. Prior to the drought families’ coping strategies included seasonal migration, harvesting of wood and production of charcoal.

• Women and girls have reduced access to water for consumption and personal hygiene. Access to sanitary supplies for menstrual hygiene has become a challenge, as traditionally used absorbent plant material is now scarcer. Women and girls are not able to purchase sanitary pads due to lack of resources so many have now resorted to using harsher plant matter or packed sand to keep clean during their period.

CARE International in Mozambique: CARE has been working in Mozambique since 1984. CARE’s teams on the ground are working intensely to reach as many families with humanitarian assistance possible. As part of a consortium CARE aims to reach 500,000 people in the areas worst affected by the drought, with the empowerment of women and girls being a major focus of our work. CARE assists people with cash vouchers for food, repairs broken water systems and establishes new ones, and identification and referral of malnourished children. CARE is also working with families in drought affected areas to increase the productivity and profitability of crops, and works with farmers on using modern farming techniques. CARE additionally supports village saving groups to help people set up alternative sources of income, and become more resilient to climate change and reoccurring natural disasters.","Tue, 15 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/666676-El_Nino_Mozambique_Report_final.png?itok=SgcjZmYR,"['mozambique', 'change', 'children', 'climate', 'coping', 'strategies', 'care', 'dries', 'drought', 'food', 'girls', 'hope', 'women', 'families', 'water']", 
32,32,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,USAID Mozambique Factsheet: Disaster Response (July 2019) - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/usaid-mozambique-factsheet-disaster-response-july-2019,"BACKGROUND

Mozambique is the third most vulnerable country in Africa to disaster risks (according to the UN’s Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction). Frequent natural disasters disrupt livelihoods and food production of the most vulnerable people, undermining the fight against extreme poverty. During the last 35 years there were 75 declared disasters in Mozambique consisting of 13 drought events, 25 floods, 14 tropical cyclones and 23 epidemics (Instituto Nacional de Gestao de Calamidades, 2016). The regional El Niño-induced drought emergency of 2015-2016 was the worst in 35 years.

According to the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition’s (SETSAN) November 2016 report, an estimated 2.1 million Mozambicans had limited or uncertain access to food, and needed assistance prior to the March-April 2017 harvest. This figure represents an increase of 700,000 persons over 2016 and illustrates the vulnerability of the Mozambican people. The depletion of family assets (food stocks, seed stock, livestock and family savings) as a result of the 2016 drought left many households destitute and dependent on food and other assistance provided by the Government of Mozambique (GRM) and assistance provided by development partners such as USAID.

Approximately 80 percent of the Mozambican population relies on rain-fed agriculture for their subsistence, which is sensitive to extreme climatic events as well as pests. The recent introduction of new pests such as the fall armyworm is now creating additional food security concerns through the country. The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), FAW, is an insect pest that feeds on more than 100 crop species, causing damage to economically important cultivated crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, various legumes as well as vegetable crops, pasture grasses and cotton. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with the adult moth able to move over 100 km per night.

Highly prolific, it can produce up to 12 generations per year. It lays its eggs on plants, from which larvae hatch and begin feeding. High infestations can lead to severe and significant crop damage and yield loss.

KEY CHALLENGES

The GRM lacks sufficient funding within its own budget or from donors to effectively mitigate or effectively respond to natural disasters and insect pest infestations. Often there are delays in issuing a disaster declaration, and poor coordination between the GRM and humanitarian partners further delays response efforts. The inability of the GRM to systematically collect sound data regarding numbers of victims, their locations and nutrition status before, during and after a natural disaster makes it difficult to develop an appropriate response that targets the right people.

Due to the fact that the FAW is new to the sub-saharan Africa, little information exists on FAW biology, behavior and impact in Africa There is a lack of experience within the Mozambican agriculture sector in recognizing and treating FAW infestations. Additionally, the availability of FAW pesticides commercially sold on the local market requires that they be registered, which is a slow and incremental process.

DROUGHT RESPONSE

The United States Government (USG) made a significant contribution to the 2016/2014 donor funded drought response effort in Mozambique. USAID Food for Peace (FFP) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), as well as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) contributed a total of $45,866,814 to this cause.

FFP contributed $28,441,295 in mostly in-kind commodities,

OFDA contributed $10,996,221 and

PEPFAR contributed an additional $6,429,298 To mitigate the effects of the 2016 drought, USAID distributed food (beans and sorghum) and provided livelihood, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) support to hundreds of thousands of people in the most heavily affected areas. In addition to the provision of emergency assistance during droughts or other natural disasters, USAID has been implementing a Feed the Future program for the past several years. The goal of the Feed the Future program is to improve and diversify the livelihoods of Mozambicans with an emphasis on smallholder farmers, leading to better food security and socioeconomic stability. In terms of increasing disaster resilient agricultural productivity, USAID activities focus on developing improved seeds and a functioning seed market, farmer to market linkages, and the expansion of orange fleshed sweet potato cultivation and consumption. To improve the enabling environment for agriculture as a livelihood, USAID supports value chain development and agricultural and agribusiness policy reform. Drought tolerant crop varieties and climate smart management practices are currently included in USAID programs.

MITIGATING THE FALL ARMYWORM EFFECT

FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 (Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria, Benin and Togo) and spread to an additional 18 countries, including Mozambique, by early 2017. FAW’s presence in Africa is expected to spread further and is irreversible. Large-scale eradication efforts are neither appropriate nor feasible.

After it was first detected in Mozambique in January 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture (MASA) has reported FAW presence in the provinces of Gaza, Maputo, Manica, Zambezia, Tete and Niassa and has proposed a three phase, $1.6 million mitigation plan. The plan includes FAW monitoring, conducting biological and ecological studies, an education campaign targeted at smallholder farmers and production of educational materials, and purchase and distribution of chemical pesticides.

USAID is currently working cooperatively with scientists from Southern African countries and Brazil to devise a FAW mitigation plan that can be applied throughout the region.

Operational Updates

• In September, as part of the recovery phase of the emergency response,

WFP provided food assistance to 625,575 people in Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth-affected provinces, working closely with local authorities and humanitarian partners. WFP provided vulnerable households with inkind food assistance and vouchers to purchase commodities. During the relief phase of the emergency response from March to August, WFP supported 2.3 million people with life-saving food assistance in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, Tete, Cabo Delgado and Nampula.

• In September, WFP and the National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) finalized data collection activities using drones in the Licungo Basin to produce an Atlas for Natural Disaster Preparedness and Response. The team mapped 158,427 Km2 and started a data analysis on 1 October 1.

• WFP is supporting the preparation of the SETSAN (Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition) post-harvest and lean season Food Security and Nutrition assessment that will take place between October and November 2019.

• The report of the Crop and Food Security Assessment mission (CFSAM), jointly conducted by WFP and FAO, was released in September. According to CFSAM findings, the 2019 cereal production is estimated at 2.8 million metric tons, about 16 percent lower than 2018, due to the cyclone-induced crop losses. Considering the extensive crop losses and damage to agricultural livelihoods, it is expected that a substantial proportion of households will continue to depend on food assistance and rely on negative coping strategies in the absence of assistance until the 2020 harvest season.

Post-Cyclone Recovery

• WFP’s recovery and reconstruction activities began in August 2019. From August to October 2019, WFP aims to assist 400,000 beneficiaries in Sofala, 100,000 in Manica and 67,000 in Cabo Delgado through Food Assistance for Assets (FFA) activities. The most vulnerable groups, however, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the north, will continue to receive unconditional food assistance. The main objectives of the intervention are to meet the immediate food needs of targeted populations, while supporting the creation and rehabilitation of community assets. These interventions aim to enable recovery of affected communities while reducing household vulnerability to shocks, which in turn will contribute to future resiliencestrengthening efforts.

• WFP will deliver value vouchers, commodity vouchers and in-kind assistance during the recovery phase. From November, the scale of recovery interventions will be increased and extended to cover Tete and Zambezia provinces, in order to meet immediate food needs of populations until the next harvest season in March 2020. According to the IPC findings of July 2019, 1.9 million people are at risk of food insecurity during the lean season, until March 2020. During the second phase of the recovery operation (November 2019 to March 2020), WFP plans to assist 1 million people.

Drought Response

• WFP aims to implement a drought-focused FFA programme from November to March. The programme will be implemented in the three southern provinces of Mozambique (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane) to cover the immediate food needs of drought-affected communities, while supporting the creation and rehabilitation of community assets. As part of this programme, WFP plans to assist a total of 225,000 food insecure people.","Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1387158-WFP-0000109792.png?itok=ij_sTaH2,"['mozambique', 'brief', '2019', 'wfp', 'food', 'assistance', 'provinces', 'recovery', '2020', 'million', 'country', 'phase', 'season']",

In late March 2019, Cyclone Idai made landfall on the central coast of Mozambique. Heavy winds and torrential rains brought devastation across much of central Mozambique, as well as parts of eastern Zimbabwe and southern Malawi. Around 3 million people were affected, including several hundred thousand who were internally displaced. Nearly 2 million acres of crops were destroyed. Just over a month later, in April, Cyclone Kenneth hit northern Mozambique with sustained winds of up to 140 miles per hour, affecting another 300,000 people.

This is the first time since standard weather-related record-keeping began that two major cyclones have hit Mozambique in the same season, and the only known occurrence of a cyclone striking the country’s far north. As a country with a long Indian Ocean coast, it is accustomed to tropical storms, but not to cyclones of this intensity. In Zimbabwe, Cyclone Idai’s unprecedented heavy rains destroyed crops at a time when many inhabitants already faced hunger due to persistent drought and a deteriorating economy. Climate scientists representing an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community predict that there will be an increase in the proportion of major cyclones with very high winds and rates of rainfall. Therefore, southern African countries bordering the Indian Ocean and those further inland must be prepared for similar future events.","Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1344954-Mozambique%20and%20Zimbabwe%20Report%205.0.png?itok=emlk7aBi,"['mozambique', 'unprecedented', 'cyclone', 'whats', 'southern', 'sign', 'displacement', 'cyclones', 'winds', 'rains', 'zimbabwe', 'devastation', 'ocean', 'come', 'million', 'major']",

The National Agricultural Research Institute of Mozambique (IIAM) is developing a number of improved seeds to help farmers, including the drought-tolerant Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) varieties. The WEMA project is a cooperative effort coordinated by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and involving public sector scientists in South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

Though the research is still in its early stages in Mozambique, scientists and other stakeholders are upbeat WEMA will make vast difference in the lives of farmers. “The idea is to bring technology that will improve the production and productivity of these small farmers,” [Samuel Camilo, head of the Chokwe Research Station of the National Agricultural Research Institute (IIAM) of Mozambique] explained. “What we are trying to do is to test crops or varieties that are tolerant to drought stress. Climate change is really affecting our farmers.”

Farmer [Celina Issai] Chirindza is also hopeful: “WEMA has showed good seeds that can cope with pests and the weather. This is a good transfer of technology.”

The prolonged crisis has exhausted household food stock, disrupted lives and livelihood. For Mozambican women and girls, who are primarily responsible for managing food and water for their families, the drought has also meant increased work burden and earlier marriages, leading to lost childhood, education and opportunities.

“My wish is to be able to influence other girls so that they don’t drop out of school,” shared Guelsa Chivodze, who was married off at 17 years of age. For years, she took care of the household and endured physical and financial abuse.

“My husband refused to allow me to go to night school because he thought I would meet boyfriends there... After all that I have gone through in my life, I took it upon myself to become an activist in my community and raise awareness of other girls about the need to go to school and defend themselves against child marriage and gender-based violence,” adds Chivodze.

For Chivodze, the chance for a new beginning came after her husband was convicted of criminal offences. Today, at 30 years of age, she has gone back to school. She studies at the Guiljá Secondary School in the Chinhacanine village in Gaza, a southern province of Mozambique, where UN Women has supported efforts that mobilized students, teachers and parents’ associations to end violence against women and girls. She aspires to become a nurse, and help survivors of gender-based violence.

Chivodze’s older brother, Helónio Chivoze, is her hero. He provides financial support for Chivodze and her two boys, and encourages her to complete her education and become self-reliant. “My dream is to have Guelsa become a professional, and stop looking for marriage to sustain her family,” he says. But the drought is making it difficult to meet all the expenses: “I used to farm 2015 cattle before. But since the drought, I am left with only 37 cattle and I lost 12 hectares of crop,” he says.

In a context where early and forced marriages were already prevalent, The prolonged drought and the accompanying economic hardships have led to more parents marrying off their girls early because there would be one less mouth to feed. In Mozambique, 48 per cent of girls are married before age 18 and 14 per cent are married before age 15.

Glória Mabunda’s life was similarly impacted. A survivor of violence from Chinhacainine village, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique (southern region of Mozambique), she was forced to leave school in grade seven because she was pregnant.

“In my community, men seldom let their women go to school for fear of women’s empowerment and change in the power relations,” said Mabunda, who now empowers girls and young women in her community.

“When they marry a young woman, it is a lifetime of deprivation and abject poverty [for the girl/woman] from the very onset of marriage. Physical and financial violence is the following stage,” she added.

“It is essential that we understand the relationships between the effects of climate change and the persistence of violence against women, including through harmful socio-cultural practices such as child marriage. Integrating these gender issues in our disaster and humanitarian response is about doing our job right,” stressed Ondina da Barca Vieira, UN Women Programme Specialist in Mozambique.

Mabunda and Chivodze are among the lucky few who got a second chance at education and opportunities, after early marriages.

At age 34, Mabunda finally divorced her husband because he wouldn’t allow her to complete her studies. She took over her mother’s poultry farm in 2016, after attending a UN Women-supported training delivered by the Mozambican Institute for Agrarian Research, which taught poultry farming management techniques to rural women. “I want to grow my poultry farming business, be a role model and help other young women and girls in my community empower themselves,” she says.

In 2014, with support from the Government of Belgium, UN Women implemented the project, “Expanding Women’s Role in Agricultural Production and Natural Resource Management,” to combat climate change and improve food security in Mozambique. The project empowered rural women, as well as men, but by providing training and agricultural benefits to women, it challenged the pervasive gender stereotypes that denied women equal opportunities.

As Inês Zitha, a community animal health worker based in Djavanhane, in the district of Guijá, Gaza, explains, women were not expected to work with cattle; it was perceived as a man’s job. In a region where livestock is one of the most valuable assets, it’s an important job.

“They said that women should not get into cattle stables… if a woman entered a stable during her menstrual cycle, it would reduce the livestock’s productivity. After attending the trainings and awareness sessions supported by UN Women, I realized that it was a power relations issue,” says Zitha.

With the revenue from her business, Zitha can now pay for her daughter to attend school, and has started building her own house to replace the one destroyed by a cyclone. She is among 200 rural women from the southern province of Gaza, who directly benefited from the project.

In the course of three years, the project has resulted in more women securing land tenure rights, civil registration and licenses for their businesses. As empowered, economically resilient women, they are setting better examples for girls and women in their communities and showing that early marriage is not the only way out.","Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/Mozambique_GuelsaChivodze_November2017_IMG_6300_1_675x450.jpg?itok=VZS0ctkA,"['child', 'mozambique', 'rise', 'school', 'southern', 'age', 'mozambiques', 'drought', 'rural', 'droughtaffected', 'girls', 'women', 'marriage', 'gaza', 'tackle', 'violence']",

On March 14, 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the southeast coast of Mozambique. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 1.85 million people needed assistance. 146,000 people were internally displaced, and Mozambique scrambled to house them in 155 temporary sites.1 The cyclone and subsequent flooding damaged 100,000 homes, destroyed 1 million acres of crops, and demolished $1 billion worth of infrastructure.2

John Podesta Founder and Director - The Center for American Progress

One historic storm in one place over the course of one day. While Cyclone Idai was the worst storm in Mozambique’s history, the world is looking towards a future where these “unprecedented” storms are commonplace. This global challenge has and will continue to create a multitude of critical issues that the international community must confront, including:

Large-scale human migration due to resource scarcity, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and other factors, particularly in the developing countries in the earth’s low latitudinal band

Intensifying intra- and inter-state competition for food, water, and other resources, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa

Increased frequency and severity of disease outbreaks

Increased U.S. border stress due to the severe effects of climate change in parts of Central America

All of these challenges are serious, but the scope and scale of human migration due to climate change will test the limits of national and global governance as well as international cooperation.

The migration-climate nexus is real, but more scrutiny and action are required

In 2018, the World Bank estimated that three regions (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia) will generate 143 million more climate migrants by 2050.3 In 2017, 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced, more than at any point in human history. While it is difficult to estimate, approximately one-third of these (22.5 million4 to 24 million5 people) were forced to move by “sudden onset” weather events—flooding, forest fires after droughts, and intensified storms. While the remaining two-thirds of displacements are the results of other humanitarian crises, it is becoming obvious that climate change is contributing to so-called slow onset events such as desertification, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, air pollution, rain pattern shifts and loss of biodiversity.6 This deterioration will exacerbate many humanitarian crises and may lead to more people being on the move.

Multilateral institutions, development agencies, and international law must do far more to thoroughly examine the challenges of climate change (early efforts, like the World Bank’s 2010 World Development Report on climate change,7 had little uptake at a time when few thought a climate crisis was around the corner). Moreover, neither a multilateral strategy nor a legal framework exist to account for climate change as a driver of migration. Whether in terms of limited access to clean water, food scarcity, agricultural degradation, or violent conflict,8 climate change will intensify these challenges and be a significant push factor in human migration patterns.

To date, there are only a few cases where climate change is the sole factor prompting migration. The clearest examples are in the Pacific Islands. The sea level is rising at a rate of 12 millimeters per year in the western Pacific and has already submerged eight islands. Two more are on the brink of disappearing, prompting a wave of migration to larger countries.910 By 2100, it is estimated that 48 islands overall will be lost to the rising ocean.11 In 2015, the Teitota family applied for refugee status in New Zealand, fleeing the disappearing island nation of Kiribati.12 Their case, the first request for refuge explicitly attributed climate change, made it to the High Court of New Zealand but was ultimately dismissed. Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia have drastically reduced in size, washed down to an uninhabitable state, had their fresh water contaminated by the inflow of seawater, and disappeared in the past decade.13 Despite their extreme vulnerability, the relatively small population (2.3 million people spread across 11 countries14) and remote location of the Pacific Islands means that they garner little international action, for all the attention they receive in the media.

Although there are few instances of climate change as the sole factor in migration, climate change is widely recognized as a contributing and exacerbating factor in migration and in conflict.

In South Asia, increasing temperatures, sea level rise, more frequent cyclones, flooding of river systems fed by melting glaciers, and other extreme weather events are exacerbating current internal and international migration patterns. Additionally, rapid economic growth and urbanization are accelerating and magnifying the impact and drivers of climate change—the demand for energy is expected to grow 66 percent by 2040.15 Compounding this, many of the expanding urban areas are located in low-lying coastal areas, already threatened by sea level rise.16 The confluence of these factors leads the World Bank to predict that the collective South Asian economy (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) will lose 1.8 percent of its annual GDP due to climate change by 2050.17 The New York Times reports that the living conditions of 800 million people could seriously diminish.18 Diminishing living conditions on this scale and intensity will prompt mass migration—possibly at an unprecedented level.

Northwest Africa is facing rising sea levels, drought, and desertification. These conditions will only add to the already substantial number of seasonal migrants and put added strain on the country of origin, as well as on destination countries and the routes migrants travel. The destabilizing effects of climate change should be of great concern to all those who seek security and stability in the region. Climate and security experts often cite the impacts of the extreme drought in Syria that preceded the 2011 civil war.19 The security community also highlights the connection between climate change and terrorism—for instance, the decline of agricultural and pastoral livelihoods has been linked to the effectiveness of financial recruiting strategies by al-Qaida.20

The intersection of climate change and migration requires new, nimble, and comprehensive solutions to the multidimensional challenges it creates. Accordingly, the signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change requested that the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change (WIM) develop recommendations for addressing people displaced by climate change.21 Similarly, The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (adopted by 164 countries—not including the U.S.—in Marrakech in December 2018) called on countries to make plans to prevent the need for climate-caused relocation and support those forced to relocate.22 However, these agreements are neither legally binding nor sufficiently developed to support climate migrants—particularly migrants from South Asia, Central America, Northwest Africa, and the Horn of Africa.

Time to envision legal recourse for climate refugees

As gradually worsening climate patterns and, even more so, severe weather events, prompt an increase in human mobility, people who choose to move will do so with little legal protection. The current system of international law is not equipped to protect climate migrants, as there are no legally binding agreements obliging countries to support climate migrants.

While climate migrants who flee unbearable conditions resemble refugees, the legal protections afforded to refugees do not extend to them. In the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations established a system to protect civilians who had been forced from their home countries by political violence. Today, there are almost 20.4 million officially designated refugees under the protection of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)—however, there is an additional group of 21.5 million people23 who flee their homes as a result of sudden onset weather hazards every year.24

The UNHCR has thus far refused to grant these people refugee status, instead designating them as “environmental migrants,” in large part because it lacks the resources to address their needs. But with no organized effort to supervise the migrant population, these desperate individuals go where they can, not necessarily where they should. As their numbers grow, it will become increasingly difficult for the international community to ignore this challenge. As severe climate change displaces more people, the international community may be forced to either redefine “refugees” to include climate migrants or create a new legal category and accompanying institutional framework to protect climate migrants. However, opening that debate in the current political context would be fraught with difficulty. Currently, the nationalist, anti-immigrant, and xenophobic atmosphere in Europe and the U.S. would most likely lead to limiting refugee protections rather than expanding them.

The SDGs can help, but not without an update to the US response

While there are no legally binding international regimes that protect climate migrants, there are voluntary compacts that could be used to support them. Most notably, 193 countries adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which address both migration and climate change.

Several of the 169 targets established by the SDGs lay out general goals that could be used to protect climate migrants. SDG 13 on climate action outlines several targets that address the climate crisis:

13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries

13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

To meet these goals, extensive bilateral and multilateral development assistance will be needed. The U.S. must create a strategic approach to focus development assistance and multilateral organizations on those targets—particularly to create resilient societies that can keep people in their communities.

Although the SDGs do not explicitly link climate change and migration, SDG target 10.7 calls for signatories to “facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed policies.” Again, the United States should channel multilateral development assistance to support the implementation of this target.

The scale and scope of climate change demand dynamic and comprehensive solutions. The U.S. must address climate stress on vulnerable populations specifically, rather than funneling more money into existing programs that operate on the periphery of the growing crisis.

U.S. development agencies and international development financial institutions need to redirect their development assistance to incorporate today’s unfolding climate crisis. Significantly more resources will need to be channeled to the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC), USAID, the Green Climate Fund, UNHCR, as well as to other critical international bodies, in particular those that make up the International Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations.

The Obama administration undertook myriad efforts to update the institutions that can address climate. Several of President Obama’s executive orders, particularly Executive Order 13677, which required incorporating climate resilience into decisionmaking on development assistance, took on the climate crisis. For the first time in the Department of Defense’s history, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recognized climate change as a “threat multiplier,” with the potential to exacerbate current challenges.25

While the current administration has deemphasized or opposed climate-friendly approaches, the current security implications of the migration crisis might prompt a re-examination of those policies. There should be bipartisan support, particularly in the security community, for reducing the conditions that accelerate international migration.

The case for scaling up US action to confront the climate crisis

A variety of medium-term investments (five to 10 years) could create more resilience to the effects of climate change. For example, the climate change factors that push migration in Northwest Africa could—at least in part—be addressed by supporting irrigation infrastructure, providing food supplies, fostering regional water cooperation, and supporting livelihood security.26

Dedicating greater resources to mitigate climate migration is also part of an effective solution. Research is needed to determine the best way to improve the migratory process itself—be it increasing migration monitors, providing safer modes of transport, and consolidating and expanding destination country integration resources.

This discussion is not new: In 2010, Center for American Progress staff were part of a task force that suggested a “Unified Security Budget” for the United States, to address complex crisis scenarios that transcend the traditional division of labor among defense, diplomacy, and development.27 The need for longer-term, more calculated assessment strategies and investments has only increased over the past decade. The Pentagon already supports a variety of operational missions that respond to sudden onset climate disasters. The Navy, in particular, serves at the emergency hotline for international extreme weather events and mobilized to support the Haitian people after the 2010 earthquake, the Filipino people after the 2013 typhoon, and the Nepalis after the 2015 earthquake.

Alternatively, creating a single dedicated fund (by drawing funds from Operations and Maintenance, Research and Development, and the Refugee Assistance Fund) would allow the United States to streamline and refine its support strategies, address the effects of climate change directly, and rebuild its reputation abroad. Such a dedicated fund should try to emulate and partner with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), Germany’s Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), and Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA). American seed funding in this area could lead to major investments of allies and partners—and in cooperation with the development agencies of these countries can mobilize massive resources at the scale required to confront the global climate crisis.

The strategies to address climate migrants presented here are far reaching, but this crisis will only intensify, and our response to it will define international relations in the 21st century.","Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/global_brazil_drought.jpg,"['refugees', 'change', 'climate', 'crisis', 'support', 'development', 'address', 'countries', 'international', 'million', 'migration', 'migrants']",

Overview

Multiple and consecutive shocks have caused the current acute food insecurity situation in Mozambique. While drought and pests affected much of the country, the central area was severely hit by cyclones Desmond and Idai, and the northern area by Cyclone Kenneth as well as conflict and insecurity.

As a result, major agricultural losses, destruction of infrastructure, assets and livelihoods, internal displacement and other damages were observed. It is estimated that 1,648,646 people currently (April – September 2019) face difficulties in accessing food to meet acceptable food needs.

Across Mozambique 2.5 million people are in urgent need of assistance following multiple and consecutive shocks—including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity. Within this context, the revised Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets the priority life-saving and life-sustaining needs of the 2 million hardest-hit people.

Humanitarian partners have massively scaled-up operations in Mozambique in 2019, thanks to nearly US$300 million generously contributed by donors. At least 1.9 million people have received food assistance, more than 704,000 children have been screened for acute malnutrition and 406,000 people have received critical emergency livelihoods support. More than 765,000 households have received kits that support their access to clean water and sanitation, including dignity kits for women and girls, and 115,000 households have received shelter assistance. More than 464,000 children impacted by the disasters have been reached with education services, and 386,000 women and girls have been reached with programmes aimed at reducing gender-based violence and supporting survivors.

Critical gaps remain, however, and additional funding is urgently required as the country approaches the peak of the lean season and the annual cyclone period. Funding is needed to enable partners to rapidly scale up in hard-to-reach, at-risk and insecure areas, most notably in Sofala, Manica and Cabo Delgado provinces. The road to recovery and reconstruction has been long, and more than half a million people are still living in destroyed or damaged homes or makeshift shelters nine months after Cyclone Idai and eight months after Kenneth. Another nearly 92,500 people remain displaced across 71 resettlement sites in the central and northern regions of the country, in dire need of food, water, education, shelter/NFIs, WASH, health and protection services. From January to March (the peak of the lean season), severely food insecure people will face their greatest needs since the cyclones, while at least 65,000 people are estimated to have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado. For the first time in many years, pellagra (a vitamin B-3 deficiency) has been reported in the country, with over 3,500 cases identified to date.

Mozambique, on average, is hit by 1.5 cyclones each year, and the 2019/2020 season is expected to bring at least one major storm. Humanitarians were able to respond to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019 in large part due to strategically pre-positioned stocks. However, emergency stocks in Mozambique have been exhausted due to the exceptional scale of the humanitarian response in 2019. Just over $597,100 is required immediately to replenish these supplies.

Mozambique is currently experiencing the worst drought for the last 35 years, which is affecting over 2 million people, including woman and girls affected by food insecurity, water shortages and loss of income. In the past few months, school officials have noted to CARE field teams that children are dropping-out of school due to the drought, as families moving to seek alternative livelihood incomes). Increasing food prices leave households with fewer resources, often leaving no money for school-related expenses, thus jeopardising their children’s access to education. Drop-out rates are high among lower income groups, as there is competition between children’s time for study and their need to engage in food and income generating activities. In Mozambique, school drop-outs in vulnerable provinces were reported to exceed 10 per cent during the first quarter of 2016.

Many girls are now missing out on continuing their education because they are forced to walk long distances to fetch water and look for food (wild leaves and fruits) as result of severe drought that affects Mozambique. “The situations is particularly hard for younger girls because are pulled out of school to help their parents fetch water and they spent hours to walk to and back home from the water source and wait in long queues”, says Marc Nosbach, CARE Mozambique Country Director Education is associated with the prevalence of child marriage and particularly with the El niño. On average, one out of two girls are married before their 18th birthday and 14 percent are already married by the age of 15. Child marriages deprive girls of an education and put them at greater risk of domestic and sexual violence. Many mothers told CARE field teams that with the current drought they cannot provide food for the entire family anymore.

“It is a significant problem in Mozambique. In Inhambane province, one of the most affected areas, I met a mother who told me that her children cannot go to school anymore because they are fainting of hunger. She is thinking of marrying her 12-year old daughter off as she does not know how to provide food for her anymore”, says Marc Nosbach.

The struggle for survival force many girls to choose whether they continue studying with an empty stomach or they leave the notebooks to help the mothers to look for the means of livelihood. CARE provides hygienic material for 600 vulnerable woman and girls who became mothers, in order to improve their hygiene and sanitation.","Tue, 13 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['school', 'mozambique', 'drop', 'education', 'income', 'deeply', 'care', 'concerned', 'drought', 'food', 'girls', 'mozambican', 'mothers', 'water']",

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets.

Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019)

Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. (OCHA, 22 Jan 2019)

FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time.

An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. (SADC, 11 Jul 2019)

The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique.

More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country’s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. (IPC, 30 Mar 2020)

According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho’s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).

Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia’s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. IPC, 01 Dec 2020)

By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. OCHA, 19 Jan 2021)

According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods.

He delivered firsthand knowledge of this “powerful threat to our planet and to humanity” by recalling the aftermath of the “two extremely severe tropical cyclones” that devastated vast regions of the country earlier this year.

Cyclones Idai and Kenneth not only took 689 lives, but also destroyed “the economic and social fabric in the Central and Northern regions of our country”, he said, adding that the South continues to suffer from the effects of drought and last year’s Cyclone Dindo.

The Foreign Minister reiterated Mozambique’s gratitude to the UN for its multifaceted support and expressed solidarity with the victims of Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas just weeks ago.

Noting that natural climate-driven disasters have become recurrent phenomena, Mr. Pacheco affirmed Mozambique’s commitment to strengthening adaptation and resilience measures under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Other actions Mozambique has undertaken include strengthening early warning systems and mapping vulnerable areas to prevent natural disasters and mitigate their effects.

With respect to rural development, biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources, the Foreign Minister said Mozambique created conservation areas covering approximately 25 per cent of its national territory.

“These actions are reinforced by the continued increase of the use of cleaner and renewable energy, based on natural gas, wind, solar, and hydropower, to provide ‘Energy for All’ to our citizens by 2030”, he maintained.

Complex development challenges

According to Foreign Minister Pacheco, “low income; reduced access to education, health, food, water and sanitation; and inadequate socio-economic infrastructures” are all obstacles hindering the development of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Moreover, the prevalence of actions linked to fundamentalism, violent extremism, arms proliferation “are causes of added concern”, he said.

The Foreign Minister noted that to “drive our eagerly desired sustainable development”, his country has incorporated the 2030 Agenda into its national governance programme, giving priority to agribusiness, economic and social infrastructure networks, expanded electric grid coverage and ecotourism.

Moreover, Mozambique is focusing on “protecting and respecting human rights, promoting gender equality and equity, as well as capacity development women, youth and other vulnerable social groups”, according Mr. Pacheco.

Turning to teh country's peace agenda, the Foreign Minister lauded the successes of Mozambique’s internal dialogues, but cautioned that they were “shaded by bad actors” in the North who continue to raise concerns as they “spread death and destruction of the socio-economic fabric, and create instability in areas of that region”.

“The Government has vigorously carried out our constitutional duties to protect our citizens and their property, as well as economic and social infrastructures”, said Mr. Pacheco, adding that the fiscal and monetary reforms underway “have led to an effective recovery of our macroeconomic stability”.

He concluded by reaffirming Mozambique’s trust in the UN as “a privileged platform for multilateral coordination in the search for solutions to the common challenges facing humanity”.","Sat, 28 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/28-09-2019_NICA-826424_GAMoz.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['warmings', 'mozambique', 'mozambiques', 'foreign', 'global', 'nefarious', 'cyclones', 'minister', 'natural', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'development', 'country', 'vulnerable', 'social', 'warns', 'address', 'pacheco', 'recovering']",

The Southern African food crisis is especially acute in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia, which account for 75% of the people needing food assistance.

The ongoing food crisis in the four countries is compounded by a number of factors including drought, the effects of cyclone Idai and its related flooding, conflict and economic downturn.

INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRLS LACK FOOD SECURITY

“Plan International is extremely concerned at the increasing number of adolescent girls caught up in food insecurity, especially where they are being traded off by family members in an effort to earn the next meal,” says Stuart Katwikirize, Plan International Regional Head of Disaster Risk Management.

The organisation is calling on the international community to make assistance available to millions in desperate need, particularly children and adolescent girls who are at highest risk.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN MOZAMBIQUE?

In Mozambique multiple and consecutive incidents, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people - almost 10 per cent of the country’s population - in need of lifesaving and resilience-building assistance. In addition, an estimated 67,500 children under the age of five are in need of treatment for acute malnutrition (6,500 children for severe acute malnutrition and 61,000 for moderate acute malnutrition).

Poor performance of the January-March 2019 rainy season in southern provinces (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane caused substantial agricultural losses, with lingering effects expected to last until the next main harvest in February 2020.

“Drought affects men, women, girls and boys in different ways because their roles and responsibilities are different. Adolescent girls and women are typically more affected by drought because it is usually their job to find water and food for the family, therefore they are more likely to drop out of school to care for their younger siblings as their parents travel long distances looking for food.” Says Anne Hoff, Country Director, Plan International Mozambique.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE?

Zimbabwe is facing a multi-layered crisis as a result of the El Nino induced poor seasonal rainfall, the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai and a challenging political and macroeconomic environment characterised by hyper-inflation and very low incomes affecting 5.5 million people living in both rural and urban areas.

“Children are increasingly dropping out of school because of hunger issues which remains a serious concern,” said Angela Muriithi, Country Director, Plan International Zimbabwe. “An estimated 2.2 million people in urban areas are facing food and economic insecurity, with 53% of households in Harare reporting inability to pay school fees.”

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN ZAMBIA?

In Zambia, about 2.3 million people during the lean season, between October 2019 and March 2020, are estimated will suffer from severe food insecurity following the devastating effects of erratic rains, drought, water logging and the late start to the 2018/2019 rainy season which had affected agriculture production.

“Overall purchasing power is fast deteriorating for most vulnerable households exacerbating burdens for women and girls. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken to assist communities in desperate need, the situation will get much worse,” said Ramin Shahzamani, Country Director, Plan International Zambia.

HOW ARE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN MALAWI?

In Malawi, 1.06 million people (7% of population) are expected to be severely food insecure between October 2019 and March 2020. The affected population is in 27 out of 28 districts. The main drivers of food insecurity in Malawi this season include floods, drought, infestations of the fall armyworm, and high prices for staple foods compared to last year and the 5-year average.

Plan International’s key priority is to support children, with a particular focus on vulnerable adolescent girls and young women who are now adopting negative and irreversible coping strategies in response to food insecurity, increasing their protection risks.

HOW ARE ADOLESCENT GIRLS AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA?

Limited access to basic sanitation services including menstrual and hygiene management as well as safe drinking water also remain a major obstacle to achieving improvements in the health and development of children and women in all four countries. It underpins a host of problems, contributing to childhood illness, malnutrition, and elevated school drop-out rates for adolescent girls, amongst other issues.

“Adolescent girls from highly food-insecure areas in rural areas are considerably more likely to migrate from rural to urban locations than boys of the same age, because of weaker bargaining power and access to opportunities within the household. In doing so, many girls face heightened risks of coerced and transactional sex and exploitative labour, as well as social isolation,” said Phoebe Kasoga, Country Director, Plan International Malawi.

The risk of exposure to domestic violence and intimate partner violence is also expected to increase as a consequence of heightened family tensions.

The region has been hit by extreme cyclones, flooding and drought in recent months and scientists say it is warming much faster than other parts of the world.

Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique in March, killing more than 1,300 people. Villages were washed away and cities inundated, while farmers saw their crops and livestock destroyed. The cyclone one of the biggest on record is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion worth of damage across the region.

A month later, Mozambique was hit by another storm, Cyclone Kenneth, killing dozens more people. ""Never before has this country been hit by two cyclones in the same season,"" says Gabriella Waaijman, the global humanitarian director of Save the Children.

Waaijman says 2019 will be remembered as the year that the climate crisis devastated parts of eastern and southern Africa adding that at least 33 million people in the region face emergency levels of food insecurity, with about 16 million of them children.

""The link to climate change is actually the compounding effect of emergency after emergency after emergency,"" Waaijman says, adding, ""So the ability for people to recover from a shock, like a drought or a flood at the moment even, is getting less and less and less. And therefore their livelihoods are slowly but surely being eroded and literally washed away.""

A 2015 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows temperatures rising in southern Africa at twice the global rate. Save the Children says leaders of industrialized nations must commit to bigger cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and greater support for those most affected by climate change.

The crisis in Southern Africa is just one of several emergencies across the continent. Countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan have been hit by the double disaster of drought and flooding. In South Sudan, about 5.5 million people – nearly half of the population – are forecast to be facing hunger and the risk of famine in early 2020 as a result of flooding and drought, UN agencies say.

Southern Africa is going through some of the worst climate shocks on the continent. Severe drought, the second in three years, is hitting much of the region. The drought, combined with hyperinflation and economic mismanagement, has pushed Zimbabwe toward the risk of “man-made starvation,” a UN investigator has warned. Water levels in the Kariba Dam have sunk to such dangerously low levels that Zambia has been forced to impose power cuts. Cattle herds – along with elephants and other wild animals – have been dying in huge numbers in Namibia.

“This year’s drought is unprecedented, causing food shortages on a scale we have never seen here before,” said a statement by Michael Charles, head of the International Red Cross Federation in Southern Africa.

“We are seeing people going two to three days without food, entire herds of livestock wiped out by drought and small-scale farmers with no means to earn money to tide them over a lean season.”

As the drought expands, the link to climate change has become increasingly clear. Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, the UN says, and the region includes many of the African countries that are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate change. Since 2012, the region has had only two favourable harvests. Rainfall is projected to be below-average over the next three months.

“With the region so prone to shocks and afflicted by high rates of chronic hunger, inequality and structural poverty, climate change is an existential emergency which must be tackled with utmost urgency,” said a statement by Robson Mutandi, the Southern Africa director for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a UN agency.

In Mozambique, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change, nearly two million people will need food assistance over the next several months, the government says.

Cabo Delgado, the northeastern province of Mozambique, was hit last April by Cyclone Kenneth – the strongest cyclone ever to hit the African continent, with wind gusts of up to 220 kilometres an hour.

But the province is also in the grip of a violent insurgency that has killed hundreds of people and forced about 65,000 people to flee their homes.

“People have the double impact of the armed violence and the cyclone,” said Patricia Danzi, the Africa regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They have to rebuild their lives twice.”

Mr. Eugenio is rebuilding the mud-walled buildings on his farm in Cabo Delgado, but the biggest blow was the loss of his cash crop, sesame, which he would normally sell to generate income for his family. Without any sesame crop, he survives by doing part-time labour on nearby farms, in exchange for a few kilograms of maize and beans.

But it’s not enough. On some days, he and his wife and four children have only cassava to eat, a low-protein food that has to be stretched out over the whole day.

He managed to get a small harvest from a few fields in October, but he can’t even estimate its size. “Every day we had to eat some of it,” he says.

“We haven’t recovered from the cyclone. We are still suffering today.”

MAPUTO, Mozambique — Maria Andrade knelt over and picked up the vine of a sweet potato plant growing in her favorite greenhouse in the International Potato Center’s research and development lab in Maputo, Mozambique.

“The leaves are beautiful, aren’t they?” she asked.

Andrade is principal scientist at the International Potato Center, a CGIAR research center, and a leading orange-fleshed sweet potato breeder in Africa.

“If I could see every house giving orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to their children, helping to solve vitamin deficiencies, I will die very happy, because I served my purpose.” — Maria Andrade, principal scientist, International Potato Center

The greenhouse is full of drought-resistant strains of sweet potatoes her team bred in collaboration with Mozambique’s government. They’ve sent these varieties across Africa to help farmers deal with the climate change-fueled droughts that have increased in frequency in recent years, according to Andrade.

Small signs stuck in the mud under the plants read names including Alisha, Esther, Caelan, and Erica. Andrade names her varieties after women and girls that promote the spread of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes across Africa. Only one man has made the cut.

“Other men get jealous and say I should name my breeds after them. But I tell them: ‘You are not worthy!’” she said, laughing.

You could call Andrade a sweet potato fanatic. She always wears orange — orange shawls, orange hats, orange dresses. She’s built her life around the promotion of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in Africa, earning her the nickname “Senhora Polpa Alaranjada,” or “orange flesh lady” in Portuguese.

In 2016, she was co-recipient of the World Food Prize for her contributions to global nutrition for her breeding programs. Two other members of her team, Jan Low of the U.S. and Robert Mwanga of Uganda, also won the prize.

The three were honored for “developing the single most successful example of micronutrient and vitamin biofortification — the orange-fleshed sweet potato.” Andrade and Mwanga have bred orange-fleshed sweet potatoes rich in beta carotene and Low developed nutrition studies and programs to encourage people across the African continent to produce and consume this biofortified crop.

Q&A: The future of food is biofortified, says plant breeding pioneer Speaking to Devex ahead of his retirement as HarvestPlus CEO last month, Howarth Bouis explained why biofortification is such a promising nutrition intervention and the challenges that remain to achieve scale.

The breeding of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes has been particularly successful because there are a lot of varieties of the crop that can be used in cross-breeding. The International Potato Center has sped up the breeding process — producing new varieties in four years rather than eight — which has made the new varieties available faster in more countries than other biofortified crops, Low explained.

The team’s enthusiasm around this crop is rooted in the conviction that a transition from the commonly consumed white-fleshed sweet potato to the orange-fleshed sweet potato could drastically reduce deficiencies in vitamin A across Africa.

A 2005 study conducted in South Africa monitored school children that consumed orange-fleshed sweet potatoes for 53 days, compared to those who ate white-fleshed sweet potatoes. Those who ate orange-fleshed sweet potatoes had significant improvements in the vitamin A levels stored in their livers over those who didn’t, increasing from 78% to 87%.

“All sweet potatoes, both white and orange, are very nutritious — they have vitamin B and vitamin C. But the orange-fleshed one has one more thing, which is beta carotene,” Andrade said. “When people consume beta carotene, the body changes it to vitamin A.”

Vitamin A deficiency can weaken immune systems, increase mortality, and limit growth. It is also the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness.

Globally, about 250 million preschool-aged children are vitamin A deficient and an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 of these children become blind every year, half of which die within a year of becoming blind. Vitamin A is especially an issue in Africa and Southeast Asia.

In addition to beta carotene, Andrade’s team is breeding varieties of sweet potatoes to increase iron levels.

Still, despite advances in breeding leading to sweet potatoes with higher levels of beta carotene, there are also the hurdles of getting the new varieties to the farmers’ fields and people’s plates.

Introduction in Mozambique

Andrade, a native of Cape Verde, was recruited in 1996 to Mozambique to work for the Southern Africa Root Crop Research Network, led by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and International Potato Center, to focus on improving the yield of cassava and sweet potatoes, as well as pest and disease resistance. At the time, farmers in the country produced only white-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Andrade had just finished a doctorate at North Carolina State University, where her research focused on orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. In attempts to decrease high levels of vitamin A deficiency in Mozambique, in 1997, her team began to import orange-fleshed varieties high in beta carotene from countries including the United States and Peru. The plant is native to the Americas. They then began to test clones of the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and released nine varieties in Mozambique.

When flooding hit Mozambique in 2000, it wiped out sweet potato crops across the southern part of the country. In response, the International Potato Center team distributed orange-fleshed sweet potato vines to 121,000 families, accompanied by a marketing campaign to encourage its consumption.

In 2005, a severe drought wiped out some varieties of sweet potatoes in Mozambique, which prompted the development of a national breeding program to focus on drought-tolerant varieties. In 2011, the first batch of 15 drought-tolerant varieties were released.

""Sweet potato is a smart agricultural crop,” said Tawanda Muzhingi, a Nairobi-based food scientist at the International Potato Center. “It doesn't need a lot of water, it doesn't need a lot of inputs, it has a short growing cycle, within three to four months you can have a harvest. In these areas that are prone to droughts, I think orange-flesh sweet potatoes can be a good security food crop.”

The work continues, with efforts to improve the levels of drought-tolerance by cross-breeding varieties of local drought-tolerant, white-fleshed sweet potatoes with imported orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Increasing iron and appealing to consumers

Through its breeding, the International Potato Center team has increased the levels of beta carotene by over 100%.

In addition to vitamin A, Andrade’s team is working to increase the iron content in sweet potatoes. Iron deficiency in children can impact their growth and development.

“Contrary to beans, sweet potatoes have very high levels of vitamin C, which can improve the iron intake. Also, the inhibitor of iron absorption, which exists in beans, does not exist in sweet potatoes,” Andrade explained.

The team bred a clone orange-fleshed sweet potato with high levels of iron. This is now part of a feeding trial in Malawi that is testing for bioavailability, which checks whether the body can actually absorb the iron. Results are expected in the next few months, Andrade said.

Some of the sweet potatoes they’ve bred are purple-fleshed, which is a source of anthocyanin, which has antioxidant effects.

But even with advances in nutritional content, breeders struggle with making sure the taste and texture meets consumption demands. The white-fleshed sweet potato, commonly consumed across the African continent, is much drier and less sweet than the orange-fleshed varieties popular in places like the U.S.

“For Africa, they want it drier because they use it as a staple, to function like bread for breakfast,” Andrade said.

As you increase levels of beta carotene, the dryness is reduced, she said. The key to breeding the orange-fleshed varieties is increasing the nutritional value, while also creating a variety that is dry enough.

Drought-tolerant breeding efforts in Mozambique are linked with a network of breeding programs across the continent. In West Africa, the focus is on breeding for desired taste and texture, and in East and Central Africa, the focus is on breeding for disease and pest tolerance.

Beyond Africa

Is it time to take 'more of a gamble' to scale nutrition interventions? While some groups focus on nutrition-specific interventions, others believe a multisectoral approach is the best way to achieve scale. Devex asks nutrition experts what the future looks like to get on track to meet SDG 2.

The Peru-based International Potato Center and its partners have developed and disseminated more than 130 orange-fleshed sweet potato varieties across Africa and Asia, reaching 5 million households. Beyond its breeding centers in Africa, a center is under construction in Bangladesh, which will coordinate the release of orange-flesh sweet potato varieties in parts of Asia, with a focus on Bangladesh and India.

Sweet potato consumption is not widespread in Bangladesh. The biggest challenges in this setting are convincing the government to prioritize sweet potato as a national crop because it is not seen as a commercial crop that could bring foreign currency from international trade. The crop is also bulky and perishable, which reduces its shelf-life, and sweet potatoes are considered a ""poor man's crop,"" Muzhingi said.

But recently things have started to change, according to Simon Heck, program leader at the International Potato Center in Kenya. In Bangladesh, there's been an overreliance on rice that has resulted in nutritional deficiencies and oversupply, making it hard to produce profitably.

Because of this, the government of Bangladesh is prioritizing diversification away from rice. The sweet potato has been selected for support, which includes government funds for research and dissemination.

Some of the main rice producing areas have also been badly impacted by an increasing salinity of soil and water due to rising sea levels.

""There is great urgency in finding alternative crops that can tolerate higher levels of salinity — and sweet potato is very well adapted to that environment,"" Heck said.

Farmers’ access

While breeding efforts have been successful, there are still challenges in ensuring the sustainability of its consumption.

The latest batch of drought-resistant seeds from Andrade’s team will be released at the end of August. Adequate funding is necessary to encourage the widespread use of these new varieties, she said.

As part of the efforts to get new varieties to farmers, the International Potato Center led a six-year “Scaling Up Sweetpotato through Agriculture and Nutrition” project in South Asia and Africa, including Mozambique, with 20 partner organizations, that ended this year.

How to better integrate gender equality and nutrition Women are disproportionately affected by malnutrition. Experts explain how to integrate a gender transformative approach when tackling malnutrition.

Through the project, 2.3 million households with children under the age of 5 were provided with planting material to produce orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. Almost a quarter of these households started producing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, according to the International Potato Center. Of these families, about 70% still produced orange-fleshed sweet potatoes a year after receiving planting materials.

The project’s ongoing work aims to reach at least 6.5 million consumers with orange-fleshed sweet potatoes over the next three years, focusing on Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.

One challenge is making sure that there are markets for orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

Farmers are faced with a dilemma when deciding what to grow, Muzhingi said. They can grow orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to improve their household’s nutrition, but then they often can’t sell their surplus because there is no market. Or they can grow a cash-crop, like sugar cane, which they can sell, he said. The key to leading farmers toward orange-fleshed sweet potatoes is creating commercial markets for farmers to sell their surplus.

In Kenya, for example, the International Potato Center worked with the supermarket chain Tuskys to develop a bread that substitutes half of the wheat flour for orange-fleshed sweet potato puree. This created a market for smallholder farmers to sell their surplus. In Mozambique, because of smaller markets and fewer processing companies, the success of these efforts have been limited.

Another challenge is the sustainability of programs working to promote the production and consumption of these crops.

One of the main programs in Mozambique, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded “Viable Sweetpotato Technologies in Africa” Mozambique project, under the U.S. “Feed the Future” initiative, was working to get orange-fleshed sweet potatoes into the hands of farmers. The program promoted the consumption of orange-fleshed sweet potato varieties in communities in Mozambique through increasing access to planting material, nutrition education, and market development, with a focus on families with children under 5 and women of reproductive age. The program reached nearly 74,000 households.

The $12.3 million program was expected to run from 2014 through 2021. But late last year, project implementers were informed the project was cut because of funding shortages. It stopped operations in June.

According to a USAID official, the decision to shut down the program was because the agency ""revisited strategic opportunities for future agricultural investments.""

This move follows significant decreases in U.S. agricultural development assistance and emergency food aid to Mozambique in recent years. In fiscal year 2014, $21 million in agricultural development funding was allocated and in fiscal year 2018, $6.8 million was allocated, which is a 68% cut, according to U.S. government budget requests and Food for Peace fact sheets.

Mozambique was also removed, along with eight other countries, from the list of Feed the Future’s “focus” countries, which meant it was no longer a target for higher U.S. investments in agricultural development and market access programs.

These USAID cuts could affect the spread of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes in Mozambique, Andrade said, stunting efforts to grow markets and develop products. Other agencies have not yet stepped up to fill in this gap, she said.

“USAID has been our greatest support over the years and all off sudden, to remove the support — we felt unprepared for such change,” she said.

Despite these challenges, in Mozambique, about 31% of all sweet potatoes grown in Mozambique are now orange-fleshed, according to Andrade, which she considers a great success.

""We've had significant success in Mozambique,” Muzhingi said. “If you go to northern Mozambique, you find orange-fleshed sweet potato sold in the market, households growing them, government programs using them, and NGOs promoting them as an effective strategy for the alleviation of vitamin A deficiency.

“It’s no longer a [International Potato Center]-only initiative. It’s embedded in the government’s national strategies towards malnutrition.”

Other countries that have been particularly successful with adopting the orange-fleshed sweet potato include Rwanda and Kenya, he added.

“This is a mission. We call it a revolution,” Andrade said. “If I could see every house giving orange-fleshed sweet potatoes to their children, helping to solve vitamin deficiencies, I will die very happy, because I served my purpose.”

“I have a feeling that one day this will happen. But we still have a lot of work to do.”

Multiple and consecutive shocks, including drought, cyclones, floods and insecurity, have left an estimated 2.5 million people—almost 10 per cent of the country’s population—in need of life-saving and life-sustaining assistance in Mozambique. The revised Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets the priority needs of 2 million people, including food insecurity and malnutrition, inadequate shelter, and lack of access to health, protection and education services. It also contributes to early recovery, in complement to the Disaster Recovery Framework, which covers the medium- and longer-term response. However, less than half of the funding required for full implementation of the HRP has been mobilized—with under US$292 million received out of more than $620 million required—and four critical sectors are less than 20 per cent funded: Protection (18 per cent); Health (15 per cent); Nutrition (2 per cent); and Education (1 per cent).

Approximately 2 million people are now severely food insecure, and this number is expected to increase during the current lean season (October 2019-March 2020). Based on the findings of the food security and nutrition assessment conducted in June 2019 by the Technical Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security (SETSAN), an estimated 67,500 children require urgent treatment for malnutrition. For the first time in many years, pellagra (a vitamin B-3 deficiency) has been reported in the country, with over 1,000 cases confirmed in Cyclone Idai-affected areas.

Eight months after Cyclone Idai hit the country, six months post Cyclone Kenneth, and with the rain/cyclone season approaching, more than half a million people (over 100,000 households) are reportedly still living in destroyed or damaged homes or makeshift shelters. Another nearly 92,500 people (over 18,000 households) remain displaced across 71 resettlement sites in the central and northern regions of the country, in dire need of food, water, education, shelter/NFIs, WASH, health and protection services. At the same time, the shocks endured by communities in 2018/2019 have significantly exacerbated pre-existing protection risks, including child protection concerns, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Displaced people, particularly women, often do not have clear tenure arrangements and limited access to land ownership which aggravates their insecurity and vulnerability to exploitation. An additional 65,000 people are estimated to have been affected and/or displaced by insecurity in Cabo Delgado to date, as a result of over 200 attacks on villages by unknown armed actors and clashes between security forces and armed groups since October 2017.

According to forecasts, the 2019/2020 rainy season is likely to be below average, with potential for late and erratic rains in the central and southern regions and normal to above average rains in the northern region. This could cause agricultural losses, further compounding needs. There is also the risk of another cyclone hitting Mozambique in the months ahead.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1428873-Mozambique%20Humanitarian%20Dashboard_December%202019_20191218.png?itok=i8dfCKMg,"['security', 'mozambique', 'cyclone', 'humanitarian', 'insecurity', 'cent', 'protection', '2019', 'food', 'dashboard', 'months', 'million', 'nutrition', 'season', '18']",

JOHANNESBURG -- An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.

Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.

""We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,"" said Nellie Nyang'wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.

""The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.""

Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.

Zambia's rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.

Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

""The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn't enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,"" said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.

""This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.""

Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.

The drought has also affected the region's wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe's National Parks.

Farmers, traders and consumers across East and Southern Africa are feeling the impact of consecutive seasons of drought that have scorched harvests and ruined livelihoods.

The El Niño-driven crisis has increased the malnutrition rates of rural children, and driven up food prices for urban residents. Livestock deaths and fire sales have slashed the asset wealth of pastoralists, and cumulative bad harvests will make recovery all the harder for small-scale farmers.

In the worst cases, where conflict has made farming impossible and reduced humanitarian access, there will be famine. That currently applies only to South Sudan, but could also include Somalia if the emergency response falters.

What makes food price spikes all the harder to bear is that there is rarely a corresponding increase in people’s wages. And when the drought is over, prices often stay stubbornly high, note researchers Paul Adams and Edward Paice.

A number of countries wrestling with the impact of El Niño have still recorded decent macro-economic growth rates, but food price inflation means those benefits are rarely felt by ordinary citizens.

There are a number of strategies governments could adopt to address the situation: from improving the tradability of food, to coordinated climate change adaptation strategies, to meeting the African Union target of allocating 15 percent of budget spending to agriculture.

“No miraculous discoveries are required,” suggest Adams and Paice. “But the start point is recognition of the unsustainability of a relentless rise in the cost of food throughout Africa; and the fact that while droughts and conflict may create price spikes, the root causes of this phenomenon lie with government.”

The following is a list of 17 countries struggling to come to terms with the impact of two consecutive years of drought, which has left more than 38 million people at risk this year.

Angola

At risk: 1.2 million

The southern regions of Cunene, Huila and Namibe have been hard hit. As granaries empty and people sell off livestock, there are concerns over their ability to bounce back this year. Food prices are high and government services are limited.

Burundi

At risk: 3 million

Poor rains last year, a one-month delay in the harvest, above average food prices, and reduced income from agricultural labour is expected to hurt poor households. But food insecurity – affecting a quarter of the population – is also driven by the country’s economic crisis as a result of ongoing political violence.

Djibouti

At risk: 227,463

Djibouti is one of the world’s most arid countries. Some 227,463 people are threatened with food insecurity in the hardest-hit areas of Ali Sabieh, Obock and Dikhil.

Eritrea

At risk: 450,000+

Eritrea strictly controls humanitarian access, so the extent of the crisis is difficult to gauge. The government denies there is a problem. But UNICEF has noted that malnutrition has increased over the past three years in four out of the country’s six regions, where rates already exceeded emergency levels. UNICEF plans to reach 450,000 children this year with nutritional support. That is likely to underestimate the extent of the problem.

Ethiopia

At risk: 5.7million

The strongest El Niño phenomenon on record led to an extreme drought in 2016, with 10.2 million in need of food aid. A new drought means 2017 could be just as dire, throwing an additional 5.7 million people into crisis. Farmers and herders found their resilience tested to the limit last year. They have very limited resources left to cope with the current crisis.

Kenya

At risk: 2.6 million

Widespread crop failure and falling terms of trade for pastoralists have affected farming and agro-pastoral communities in the northwest, northeastern and coastal strip of Kenya. The two main rainy seasons failed in 2016. There are growing reports of conflict as a result of displacement and water shortages. Four million people could be in need of aid by July if the long rains fail.

Lesotho

At risk: 159,959

Ninety percent of people in need received in-kind and cash aid. Without the ongoing assistance, Lesotho would be in a food security crisis. With good rains this season, an average harvest is forecast.

Madagascar

At risk: 978,000

Maize, cassava and rice production dropped by as much as 95 percent in the south of the country last year. Some 845,000 people are in immediate need. Of those, 330,000 are facing emergency conditions. Countrywide, rice prices were up by 25 percent and maize prices had doubled by the end of January.

Malawi

At risk: 6.7 million

Half of Malawi’s rural population – 6.7 million people – are receiving food aid after two consecutive years of drought. In 2016, food prices were up 172 percent above the five-year average. The harvest this month should ease needs, and food prices are already falling as aid reduces pressure on the markets. But cash crop farmers are expected to see a fall in income this season after reducing the area they planted.

Mozambique

At risk: 2 million+

The impact of last month’s cyclone Dineo is expected to add an additional 300,000 to those in need. Drought has exhausted household food stocks, and aid is reaching only 45 percent the vulnerable. Dineo, which hit coastal Inhambane Province, affected nearly 551,000 people and destroyed 27,000 hectares of crops. Food aid and seeds are urgently needed.

Rwanda

At risk: unknown

Rwanda did not escape last year’s drought. Media reports said that between 50,000 and 100,000 families suffered severe crop losses, especially in eastern and southern districts.

Somalia

At risk: 6.2 million

Half of all Somalis are facing acute food insecurity. Of these, nearly three million need urgent life-saving aid. The worsening drought has led to widespread water and pasture shortages for livestock. Displacement, malnutrition and drought-related diseases are all on the rise, and famine could be declared in parts of the country. Access is complicated by the al-Shabab insurgency.

Sudan

At risk: 4.6 million

Sudan experiences unpredictable rainfall and desertification. The 2015 El Niño event was particularly severe and continued to be felt in the east of the country in 2016. Food insecurity is also driven by conflict, particularly in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

Swaziland

At risk: 638,000

The 2016 drought scorched Swaziland, leaving an estimated 638,251 people in need of aid. Basic food prices remain high at the peak of the lean season. The rainfall forecast is for average to above-normal rains, but household productivity is expected to be lower than normal.

Tanzania

At risk: unknown

There have been media reports of failed harvests and livestock deaths. In response, a senior government official in the northern Manyara region released emergency food stocks onto the market. The government is resisting calls for a declaration of emergency.

Uganda

At risk: 390,000+

Food stocks are critically low in northeastern Karamoja. Between July and November last year, 390,000 people were at crisis/emergency levels. Of those, only 200,000 were receiving aid. Conditions are also bad around Arua in the northwest. Two consecutive seasons of poor rains have hit production across much of the country. Staple food prices are rising.

Zimbabwe

At risk: 4.1 million

Consecutive El Nino-related droughts has left half the rural population in need of food aid until the end of the lean season in March. The crisis is compounded by low purchasing power, reduced remittances from South Africa and high food prices. There have been good rains over the past two months but there is a national shortage of fertilizer. There has also been an outbreak of the hard-to-control Armyworm pest throughout the country.

KEY MESSAGES

• Mozambique is experiencing its worst food insecurity emergency since the 2015/16 drought with an atypically high number of households in need of emergency assistance. This is the result of multiple shocks including tropical cyclones Desmond, Idai, and Kenneth with associated torrential rainfall and severe flooding and drought in southern semiarid areas. These shocks have significantly impacted crop production across the country and livelihoods, specifically in Cyclone affected areas.

• Most of the country is facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In southern semiarid areas this is the second consecutive poor season and households have little to no food stocks, which is atypical for this time of year. Tropical Cyclone affected households lost their crops for the 2019/20 consumption year and are continuing to rebuild their livelihoods. The rest of the country is experiencing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes due to a normal harvest.

• Due to the significantly below-average harvest, the lean season is expected to begin atypically early. Household food stocks are likely to be exhausted by September, even though efforts are ongoing to maximize the second season, which typically contributes a small portion to the annual households’ food stocks, particularly for cereals. In October/November, agricultural labor opportunities are expected to seasonally increase with the start of the rainy season, but is expected to remain below average.

• In areas most affected by this year’s shocks, namely in Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala, Manica and parts of Zambézia provinces, poor households are expected to continue engaging and increasing their reliance on livelihood coping strategies to meet their minimum food needs. The poor and very poor households are expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food security outcomes in January 2020, with humanitarian food assistance needs most likely increasing until the harvest in April 2020.

NATIONAL OVERVIEW

Current Situation Current estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) indicate over a million MT of crops were lost including corn, rice, groundnuts, beans, and vegetables were destroyed nationwide as a result of the poor rainfall in the southern semiarid areas and three Tropical Cyclones, Desmond, Idai, and Kenneth. MASA estimates nearly 800,000 MT loss in national maize grain production, representing a reduction of more than 30 percent as compared to the last two years’ average. MASA also estimates, this year’s shocks caused the death of nearly 120 cattle, 1,120 small ruminates and more than 22,000 chickens. The tropical cyclone damaged fishing boats and equipment for fishing as well as infrastructure, a key livelihood for thousands of households along the coast. Based on available information on losses caused by this year’s multiple shocks, combined with the remote sensing analysis particularly of the Water Requirements Satisfaction Index (WRSI) (Figure 1), the 2018/19 crop production will be significantly below last year’s production and the 5-year average.

Current household food stocks are much lower than average in southern semiarid areas as well as areas affected by tropical cyclones. In southern areas, as a result of the second consecutive poor season households have little to no food stocks. Most of the markets are relatively well supplied thanks to the flow of food commodities from surplus areas, including some remote areas, resulting in abnormally higher retail prices. In the rest of the country markets and households have average stocks.

As many households continue relying on markets for food, particularly in shock affected areas, poor households continue to engage in self-employment activities to access incomes. However, as more and more people engage in self-employment activities, opportunities to sell are reduced and prices decrease; limiting incomes.

Second season planting and production is progressing in the flood affected areas where households have been planting following the receding flood waters. On the other hand, in the southern semiarid areas, second season production is limited due to lack of residual moisture. As of late May, in cyclone affected areas various organizations provided nearly 150,000 kilograms of maize grain seeds and 78,000 kilograms of beans seeds to about 20,000 households. FAO is also providing agricultural inputs (assorted vegetable seeds, beans seeds and agricultural tools) to slightly over 65,900 households for second season planting. The total number of beneficiaries is most likely to be around 95,000 households with other organizations’ contribution. In the flood affected areas, prospects for second season are good due to existing residual moisture and water bodies from where households can get water for irrigation. However, production from second season is for rapid consumption and does not guarantee durable food stocking.","Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1316289-MOZAMBIQUE_Food_Security_Outlook_June%202019_Final.png?itok=nNg-5yIC,"['security', 'mozambique', 'second', 'tropical', 'southern', 'outlook', 'affected', 'season', '2019', 'food', 'households', '2020', 'poor', 'production', 'areas']",

Mozambique is reeling after an unprecedented two cyclones swept ashore within six weeks, wreaking havoc and leaving hundreds dead and tens of thousands displaced.

As relief efforts continue, Birgit Holm, director of the Mozambican non-governmental development organisation ADPP, discusses the impoverished southern African country's next steps on the road to recovery following Cyclones Idai and Kenneth:

What impact did the cyclones have?

""They have had a very big impact, obviously."" Though the first storm was much bigger than the second, ""that didn't make the second one any better,"" said Holm, who has almost four decades of experience in Mozambique with ADPP.

""We have a situation in several provinces where schools have been destroyed and health clinics have been destroyed—bridges, roads too. In general these two cyclones have destroyed a lot, affecting more than two million people in all.

""It sets back Mozambique, already a country which is very poor and with many different problems, so this has just been disastrous.""

What needs to be done?

""The big need is for those with some means and some funding to go in and rehabilitate all the infrastructure that was destroyed. Because so many people also lost their homes and livelihoods, (but) it's not only a question of infrastructure,"" said Holm.

The path of Cyclone Kenneth and accumulated total precipitation forecast

""It's also about giving input to the people—a lot of it will be agricultural inputs because a great number of the population are working in agriculture. That part really needs a lot of emphasis so they can get tools and seeds.""

What does the future hold?

""In the future, this (kind of weather) is going to increase. I don't think anybody is in any doubt about that,"" said Holm.

""The fact that the two cyclones came within six weeks, it's never happened—ever. And the size of these cyclones and the fact they were so big because of the very high temperatures in the sea, that is not going to be different in the future. It's going to be worse.

""We need to look into how buildings can be reinforced and built to be more resilient. How small-scale farmers can learn to use new techniques, whether it's (to mitigate) droughts or floods.

For several years in Mozambique, ""we've had drought in the south, and people are suffering from that. Then we have floods in the centre and the north. So all these things have to be thought of in a different way from before.

Mozambique homes must be reinforced and farmers must learn how to mitigate droughts and floods, an aid expert says

""There has been years and years of work about mitigating climate change—but it just has to be even more than before... so the population can be prepared for these situations in the future.""

Will the cyclone 'spotlight' help Mozambique?

""It always helps, but you do fear it's just there in the short period of the emergency and then it goes away again,"" Holm told AFP.

""What I hope, and what I hear from some organisations who have come to the country but never had a presence here before, is that some are thinking about continuing and doing longer-term (projects).

""The government is saying this will take at least five years to rehabilitate and get back to where we were—and where we were was not that high a level. So it's really needed and I hope that the organisations and institutions that have these means will start looking at giving Mozambique the help they need. And not only loans—we don't need more loans.""

Nearly 350,000 others are at risk of becoming trapped in the coming days as remnants of tropical cyclone Idai dump rain over low-lying areas already inundated with swelling rivers and bulging dams.

Some 100,000 people may need to be rescued from the town of Buzi alone, according to a spokesman for Mozambique's Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development.

""We have a critical situation in Buzi,"" the spokesman, who asked not to be named, told ABC News via telephone Thursday. ""If the rainfall increases, then those 100,000 need to be rescued. Levels of the dam are going high.""

The heavy rain let up in Buzi and the hard-hit port city of Beira on Thursday, but showers are expected to return in the coming hours and days. Aid agencies worry additional rainfall will impede rescue missions.

The cyclone made landfall near Beira late last Thursday and slowly moved inland over the weekend, leaving a trail of destruction across central Mozambqiue, southern Malawi and eastern Zimbabwe. The storm brought torrential rain and wind gusts up to 105 mph to the region, where drought conditions allowed for widespread flooding.

An estimated 1.7 million people were in the cyclone's path in Mozambique, which bore the brunt of the storm, while another 920,000 people in Malawi and ""thousands more"" in Zimbabwe were also affected, according to World Food Program spokesperson Herve Verhoosel.

Now, ""the biggest challenge"" is reaching stranded residents and others in need, Verhoosel told reporters Tuesday, especially in areas where overflowing rivers have created ""inland oceans extending for miles and miles.""

Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi declared a national state of emergency and three days of national mourning beginning Wednesday.

The storm has been blamed for the deaths of at least 217 people in Mozambique, according to the spokesman for the country's Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development -- though Nyusi has warned that as many as 1,000 could be dead. Another 1,440 people were injured, according to Mozambique's National Disasters Management Institute.

In Zimbabwe, at least 139 people have died, 144 others were injured, 136 were marooned and 189 were reported missing as of Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the country's Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting.

At least 56 cyclone-related deaths have been reported in Malawi.

Some 400,000 people were internally displaced by the storm in Mozambique, while an estimated 82,500 were displaced in Malawi, according to the United Nations. More than 4,300 were displaced in Zimbabwe, according to the country's Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting.

The United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund announced Wednesday it has allocated $20 million to ensure aid reaches those most affected.

Jamie LeSueur, who is leading response efforts in Beira for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said while the scale of devastation is still emerging, the situation he's seen on the ground is catastrophic.

""This is the worst humanitarian crisis in Mozambique’s recent history. It is a humanitarian catastrophe for the people of central Mozambique,"" LeSueur said in a statement Tuesday. ""Large parts of Beira have been damaged, entire villages and towns have been completely flooded. Rescuers are scrambling to pull people trapped on rooftops and in trees to safety. Many, many families have lost everything.""","Thu, 21 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/mozambique-sh-ml-190321_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'rescue', 'thousands', 'cyclone', 'hundreds', 'according', 'national', 'beira', 'storm', 'spokesman', 'zimbabwe', 'ministry', 'need', 'await', 'rain', 'kills']",

Natural disasters and chronic poverty contribute to food insecurity in Mozambique, a nation of approximately 28 million people. The UN World Food Program (WFP) reports that Mozambique is highly susceptible to environmental shocks, including droughts, cyclones and floods, which undermine economic development and damage livelihoods and infrastructure.

Furthermore, approximately 46 percent of Mozambicans subsist under the national poverty line, according to the World Bank.

An El Nino-induced drought has wilted crops across Zimbabwe and left about a third of its 15 million people in need of food assistance, according to a U.N. agency.

The situation was worsened when Zimbabwe, along with Mozambique and Malawi, were last month battered by Cyclone Idai, leaving hundreds of thousands needing food, water and shelter.

An appeal document given to reporters by the ministry of information showed the government is seeking about $300 million in aid for food while the rest would fund emergency shelters, logistics and telecommunications among other needs.

Hundreds of people have died in Mozambique and Malawi and the death toll in Zimbabwe was now 344.

Meanwhile, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the cabinet had hiked the maize price paid to farmers by 86 percent to $232 a tonne and maintained a subsidy for millers in a bid to keep the price of the staple maize meal down.

In February, Zimbabwe scrapped a 1:1 peg between the U.S. dollar and the bond notes and electronic dollars it introduced to compensate for its hard currency shortage, merging the surrogate currencies into the RTGS dollar.

Mutsvangwa said farmers would be paid 726 RTGS dollars ($232), up from 390 RTGS dollars.

The RTGS dollar was trading at 3.12 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the bank market and at 4.4 on the black market.

Geneva/Beira, Mozambique, 29 May 2019 (WMO) - The devastation caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth which hit Mozambique within the space of a few weeks is a wake-up call about more high-impact tropical cyclones, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

A fact-finding mission sent to Mozambique by WMO recommends a package of disaster risk reduction priorities to strengthen the southern African nation’s early warnings systems and cut socio-economic damages from weather, climate, and water-related hazards like tropical cyclones, floods and drought.

“The two cyclones are a wake-up call that Mozambique needs to build resilience,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a message to an international pledging conference to secure support for reconstruction.

“Although the number of tropical cyclones globally is expected to reduce in the future, the number of most intense tropical cyclones (category 4 and 5), associated with more rainfall, will increase in a warming climate,” he said.

“Future sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions, raising concerns about flooding from the sea, particularly for low lying cities as Beira,” said Mr Taalas. This raises major concerns regarding Mozambique’s vulnerability to floods from both rivers and sea.

The report from the international team of meteorologists and hydrologists, headed by WMO’s Filipe Lúcio, will be presented to an international pledging conference for Mozambique scheduled for 1 June in the coastal city of Beira.

The fact-finding team said that investment of nearly US$ 27 million is needed for the meteorological and hydrological sector. This includes reconstruction, rehabilitation and modernization of infrastructure and equipment, land surveys for flood risk mapping and satellite rainfall estimation, improved database management systems, training on the latest forecasting products, improved standard operational procedures, and better communications tools.

Unprecedented back-to-back cyclones

Idai made landfall in the vicinity of Beira on 14 March at Category 4 strength, provoking one of the worst weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere. Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours.

The humanitarian consequences were huge. The cyclone and subsequent flooding caused the death of more than 600 people, injured an estimated 1600, affected more than 1.8 million and caused an estimated US$ 773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture.

“In times of floods, Mozambicans seek safety on roofs of buildings. But the ferocity of Idai’s winds blew the roofs away. The magnitude of the cyclone, the size of the storm surge and the extent of the flooding overwhelmed years of work by authorities in Sofala to increase community resilience to floods,” said Mr Lucio, who used to head Mozambique’s national meteorological service.

“It is a salutary warning about the future scale of the combined challenges from urbanization and climate change-related sea level rise and extreme weather. This will necessitate much greater emphasis on improved land use, urban and floodplain planning,” said Mr Lucio.

The fact-finding team’s visit coincided with tropical cyclone Kenneth, which made landfall on 25 April in Cabo Delgado province as the most intense tropical cyclone ever known to have hit the area.

The WMO mission focussed on Cyclone Idai, especially in terms of damages to hydro-meteorological equipment and institutional coordination and collaboration involving the meteorological, hydrological and disaster management services. However, its general conclusions are meant to inform plans and investments in strengthening the Early Warning System in a multi-hazard approach, and disaster risk management in the country, particularly during reconstruction to ensure building back better and overall strengthening of resilience.

Key findings

With Idai and Kenneth, the tropical cyclone warnings issued through WMO’s operational network – via its Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre La Reunion (Météo-France) were of good quality. Flood warnings were challenging, an area where special focus needs to be put.

“The critical problem however, was understanding the risk associated with the warnings, understanding what each person needed to do and limited response capabilities,” said the report.

The communication of messages needs to be simplified and should include indication of potential impacts. Education and awareness raising should be permanent, the mission found.

Early warning can only be effective if complemented by effective disaster management practices. There is a need for:

Effective floodplain management practices, including land use, urban planning;

Updated building codes to withstand intense tropical cyclone winds;

Multi-purpose infrastructure to serve as shelters in cases of tropical cyclones and accommodation during floods;

Consideration of structural measures for protection and management, where appropriate

The WMO team identified major weaknesses on preparedness, emergency coordination and response, including the following:

Absence of a communication system that can be used in the case of failure of normal communication means for warning and emergency operations;

Ineffective land use planning and enforcement for efficient floodplain management;

Absence of an evacuation plan for cities such as Beira, Búzi and Dondo;

Building codes not suitable to events of the magnitude of cyclone IDAI.

Limited capacities of key central and local government authorities to respond to emergencies;

Absence of an integrated approach for multi-hazard early warning systems;

Vulnerability

Mozambique is downstream of nine major river basins. It is prone to devastating impacts of floods but can also experience low-flows in rivers during drought due to water use upstream, exacerbating the impacts of droughts.

The biggest floods recorded recently were in 2000, when weeks of heavy rain exacerbated by tropical cyclone Eline caused the death of 700 people and affecting 2 million people.

With a coastline of 2700 km in the South West Indian Ocean, Mozambique is hit by a tropical storm or cyclone every two years on average – although Madagascar often acts as a buffer.

Climate change projections indicate a global decrease in numbers of tropical storms and cyclones. However it is projected that there may be increases in their maximum intensities and associated rainfall. Future sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions, assuming all other factors equal.

For the Province of Maputo, which has never suffered from direct hit of a tropical storm or tropical cyclone, and the Province of Gaza which was hit just once (cyclone Domoina in 1984) the likelihood of direct impact over these southern areas may increase over the next decades.

Notes to Editors

The World Meteorological Organization dispatched an expert mission to Mozambique to assess the requirements and capabilities of the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) and the National Directorate of Water Resources Management (DNGRH) and their coordination with the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) for an End-to-End Multi-Hazard Early Warning System in the context of disaster risk management. This report was possible through support provided by WMO, Météo-France and the UK Met Office, who supported and made available staff to integrate the mission. The mission was hosted by the National Institute of Meteorology of Mozambique. It consulted many national and international institutions, including the Ministers of Transport and Communications, Public Works and Housing and the Vice-minister of the Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development. The team also met the Governor of the Province of Sofala, the Mayor of the City of Beira and partner technical agencies in Beira.","Wed, 29 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/i-k7cBShB-XL.jpg?itok=398lrO-I,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'warning', 'national', 'cyclone', 'mission', 'wakeup', 'cyclones', 'meteorological', 'wmo', 'management']",

Southern Africa is experiencing droughts that have led to water shortages, pressing food insecurity, and the deaths of wildlife in Botswana and Zimbabwe.

In Zimbabwe, at least 2 million people are facing starvation as the drought has also affected food production, according to the World Food Programme. While in August, UNICEF released a report warning that the drought is expected to leave close to 5.5 million rural Zimbabweans in need of food and other humanitarian help by April 2020.

As a result of water shortages in South Africa, meanwhile, the country has been forced to implement several measures in a bid to save water.

South Africa's Department of Water and Sanitation released a statement on Oct. 23 encouraging people to “intensify water-saving habits as dam levels are dropping in many parts of the country due to hot weather conditions and lack of rain.""

The department also said the water storage in Mpumalanga province has been on the decline for several weeks.

South Africa has been experiencing ongoing droughts and low rainfall since 2015, with the Northern Cape now being the driest province.

The department said in another statement that rainfall in the Northern Cape has fallen from 60% to 58.9% between Oct. 14 and 22. The province had 71.4% rainfall during the same period in 2018.

But the fall in dam levels isn’t just limited to the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga.

At a media briefing on Oct. 23, the Minister of Human Settlements, Water, and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu, said dam levels across the country have fallen by between 10% and 60% compared to 2018.

“We are working hard to avoid the much-dreaded Day Zero phenomenon and instead we are announcing restrictions on water usage,” Sisulu said.

“What we’re seeing, like other parts of the globe, is the dry season is getting longer, harsher, and more intense,” she continued. “Climate change is a reality and is affecting South Africa.”

The Day Zero phenomenon referred to by Sisulu is when all water sources in municipalities are shut down and residents collect water from designated collection points.

The impact of climate change is already being felt across Africa, where extreme and unpredictable weather conditions — particularly flooding and droughts — are taking their toll on the environment, wildlife, and on people.

According to 350 Africa, an organisation that campaigns for climate action in Africa, the number of weather-related disasters has doubled over the last 25 years, “resulting in Africa having a higher mortality rate from droughts than any other region.”

“Climate change will hit Africa hardest so this fight is about climate justice,” it warns. “Many of the poorest Africans, women, and children are already facing more drought, floods, and extreme weather that threaten their livelihoods and push food prices up. The fact is, climate change is going to affect all of us.""

Recent examples of extreme weather include Cyclone Idai, which hit parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. Meanwhile, Zambia is experiencing its lowest rainfall since 1981.

In recent weeks, the effects of climate change has also led to the deaths of dozens of elephants in Botswana and Zimbabwe.

More than 100 elephants have died between September and October in Botswana's Chobe National Park, according to the country’s government. Chobe is one of Botswana’s most famous tourist destinations.

“The animals are also travelling long distances in search of food which leaves some highly emaciated, ending in death,” the Ministry of Wildlife said in a statement.

Meanwhile, in Zimbabwe’s biggest national park, Hwange, more than 55 elephants died between September and October.

The spokesperson for the country’s national parks and wildlife management authority, Tinashe Farawo, called the drought and its effects a “dire situation.”","Wed, 06 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/ca/7c/ca7c0061-a443-4557-b5cf-047607f96ac3/cape-town-drought-south-africa.jpg__1500x670_q85_crop_subsampling-2.jpg,"['africa', 'cape', 'change', 'droughts', 'southern', 'climate', 'hunger', 'drought', 'face', 'food', 'wildlife', 'weather', 'deadly', 'millions', 'rainfall', 'ravages', 'water']",

Water levels at the reservoir are dangerously low. Cahora Bassa was only 34% full as of the end of November, according to the National Water Directorate.

Pedro Couto, head of the plant, told staff in November that a lack of rain over the last two years had “resulted in an unprecedented reduction in the Cahora Bassa reservoir,” according to the Maputo-based business publication, Zitamar News.

Data from the dam’s operator, Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), show that the dam’s water level is only 17 meters (55 feet) above the minimum operating level. If next year’s rainy season does not deliver higher rainfall, the situation could get worse. Southern Africa is experiencing its worst drought in almost four decades, reducing water flows in the Zambezi river system where three major hydro dams, including the Cahora Bassa, supply electricity to the region.

Cahora Bassa’s troubles are a sign that southern Africa, one of the continent’s regions most vulnerable to climate change, may need to rethink its reliance on hydropower. Hydropower accounts for 21% of electricity in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), a common electricity market for 12 countries. Low rainfall since 2014 has strained the SAPP, causing blackouts and electricity shortages that raise the risk of social instability, according to analysts.

Zambia, which depends almost entirely on hydroelectric power from the Zambezi river, has suffered power shortages since last year. The Kariba dam, a reservoir upstream from Cahora Bassa that supplies almost all of the electricity in Zambia and Zimbabwe, fell to 12% capacity this summer. Zambia has started investing in solar plants.

Other countries may soon feel the pinch. Cahora Bassa, which has a capacity of 2,075 megawatts, sells most of its electricity to South Africa, as well as to Zimbabwe, and Mozambique’s national utility, EDM. Already, HCB has cut supplies to South Africa’s power utility Eskom by 13%.","Wed, 14 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/the-cahora-bassa-dam-in-mozambique-e1481721388383.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['africa', 'southern', 'bassa', 'africas', 'soon', 'run', 'cahora', 'power', 'reservoir', 'dams', 'electricity', 'hydropower', 'plant', 'biggest', 'water']",

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The seasonal year 2016/2017 was atypical for Mozambique. It was characterized by an El Niño-induced drought, floods in some parts of the southern and central regions of the country, a cyclone making landfall in Inhambane, conflict driven internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Manica and Sofala, and cholera outbreaks throughout the country. All of these issues required coordinated multi-sectoral interventions with strong leadership from UNICEF. Although officially the emergency season in Mozambique (October-to March), ended in March and coincided with the rainy/cyclone season, there are still clear humanitarian and recovery needs to be addressed, particularly in the context of IDPs, Education, Health and WASH.

The cholera outbreak in Maputo, Nampula and Tete provinces is practically under control. There are however reports of an increased influx of returnees from Malawi and Zimbabwe into Tete and Manica provinces. In response, UNICEF is participating jointly in an IOM-led displacement tracking matrix (DTM) exercise in Manica to monitor the implementation progress of UNICEF supported interventions to IDPs and to assess evolving needs.","Wed, 10 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/770324-30%20April%20UNHCR%20Dadaab%20bi-weekly%20Update.png?itok=2YH9t72q,"['mozambique', 'children', 'education', 'cyclone', 'humanitarian', 'affected', 'health', 'unicef', 'report', 'situation', 'interventions', 'targeted', 'idps', 'manica', '2017']",

Its path is expected to pass over the northern tip of the Comoros islands on 24 April and continue onward to northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania. It is expected to make landfall in the district of Palma in Mozambique on 25 April...The Global Disaster Alert Coordination System (GDACS) has issued an orange alert for the Cyclone, meaning a medium humanitarian impact is expected based on the storm strength and its forecasted path. According to UNOSAT, the entire population of Comoros (758,339) is within the Cyclone’s windspeed zones, with Grand Comore the primary concern. In Mozambique, more than 747,000 people are living within the Cyclone’s path, mainly in Cabo Delgado Province, including a projected 117,000 living in high wind speed zones. (OCHA, 24 Apr 2019)

The official death toll from the impact of Tropical Cyclone Kenneth in northern Mozambique has risen to 38 people, according to the Government. Nearly 35,000 houses have either been partially destroyed (32,034) or totally destroyed (2,930), according to the Government ... More than 570 mm of rain has been recorded since 25 April in Pemba, the highest in Cabo Delgado. (OCHA, 29 Apr 2019)

More than 27,000 people have been reached with food assistance since Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on 25 April 2019. International deliveries of shelter supplies began to arrive in Pemba on 1 May 2019; more flights are scheduled in the days ahead. The number of people affected by Tropical Cyclone Kenneth has risen to more than 384,800, with an estimated 185,000 people affected in Comoros and at least 199,836 affected in Mozambique. The risk of water-borne diseases is high, with many areas still without access to clean water following the cyclone. (OCHA, 2 May 2019)

From 9 to 17 September, in close coordination with Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), IOM DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) teams conducted baseline assessments at locality level (localidade), the findings were as follows:

More than 52 million people in 18 countries across southern, eastern and central Africa are facing up to crisis levels of hunger as a result of weather extremes, compounded by poverty and conflict.

Some areas are facing a second extreme drought in four years and worse than that sparked by El Nino in 1981.

In the South, parts of Zimbabwe have had their lowest rainfall since 1981 which has helped push more than 5.5m people into extreme food insecurity. Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been decimated and exports are now banned; 2.3m people there are food insecure. The situation is worsening including in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar, Namibia and Zimbabwe. There are reports of farmer suicides in South Africa.

Drought has also hit the East and Horn of Africa particularly Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. At the same time, record-breaking temperatures in the Indian Ocean have dumped ultra-heavy rainfalls into Kenya and South Sudan, causing flash-flooding especially along major river arteries. South Sudan has declared a state of emergency with more than 900,000 people hit by floods.

In Africa extreme weather events have hit many countries already suffering from ongoing conflict. Across the continent, 7.6 million people were displaced by conflict in the first six months of 2019, and another 2.6 million by extreme weather. In the Horn, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan have simultaneously faced over 750 000 people displaced by conflict and 350 000 displaced by extreme weather.

Scientists have demonstrated how climate change is increasing the frequency or severity of many extreme weather events. Over the last decade, these 18 African countries have collectively suffered average annual losses of $700m from climate-related disasters– and this is without counting the cost of these latest crises, says Oxfam. However, there has been minimal progress globally in raising funds specifically to address loss and damage from climate change. Africa contributes less than 5% of total global emissions but is suffering some of the most severe impacts of the climate crisis.

Officials will meet at the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Durban Nov 11-15 to discuss the future of Africa’s “environmental sustainability and prosperity”. Oxfam urges ministers to demand that industrial nations honour their promises to avoid escalating human and financial costs and to pay for damages.

“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently. The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering,” said Oxfam’s Southern Africa Regional Director Nellie Nyang'wa.

“In western Kenya, the crop harvest is 25% down and in parts of Somalia up to 60%. Livestock in many rural areas are emaciated and milk production is down. Cereal prices in some areas have rocketed up to five-year highs, pricing out poorer people. Nearly 7m people in the region are living just below the catastrophic hunger line,” said Oxfam’s Horn, East and Central Africa regional director Lydia Zigomo. “It is a vicious cycle where poor and marginalized communities, mostly women and girls, are more exposed to the climate crisis and less able to cope and recover from its harm.”.

Mithika Mwenda, chief executive of Oxfam’s partner PACJA, said “communities at the frontline of this climate crisis are overstretched and may be facing potential annihilation. But local people are doing everything that can to overcome the challenge. There are unprecedented levels of organization happening where governments have let local people down.”

“We’re seeing people trying to cope with shifting seasons and erratic rainfall by finding new ways to make a living off-farm. Women are coming together to pool their resources through small internal lending communities, buying food together, growing sweet potatoes instead of maize – all without outside support. Local people have the solutions but what they lack is resources, especially funding.

“Our leaders should look to support these community solutions to build up people’s resilience to climate change. For 35 years AMCEN has been a very important platform with impactful policies that have helped to create awareness of environmental sustainability. It needs to move away now from policy making to policy implementation.”

Oxfam is currently reaching more than 7 million people in ten of the hardest hit countries with food and water support, and long-term development projects to help people cope better with climate-related shocks. Oxfam plans to reach 10% of those most in need in these ten countries and is trying to raise $65m to do so.

Oxfam is calling on African ministers at the AMCEN meeting to:

• Insist rich industrialised countries decrease their CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global heating to below 1.5C, and honour their commitment to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries;

• Demand governments agree to develop a new funding mechanism for “loss and damage” from climate change at the upcoming UN climate conference (COP25);

• Invest more into universal, high-quality and gender-responsive public services and strengthen tax systems in African countries to close the gap between rich and poor;

• Improve their disaster warning and management systems, and commit to re-greening and agricultural policies that target women and men small-scale farmers;

• Invest in “social accountability” projects that ensures climate finance can reach the communities that need it most, and empowering them in their own decision-making

• Engage women and girls in the planning, design and implementation of early warning systems and climate mitigation and adaptation programs

• Protect people who are forced to move so that they are able to do so in safety, dignity and on their own terms.

The current response plan provides food assistance for approximately 1.2 million people across all seven drought-affected provinces from October 2016 through March 2017. The total funds received as of the end of November for drought response amount to US$ 121 million out of US$ 179,1 million required to ensure assistance till March 2017, leaving a funding gap of 32%. Furthermore, the revised strategic response plan (SRP) includes a flood component estimated to cost US$ 32 million to respond possible related emergency according to the contingency plan 2016/2017 scenarios.

Land preparation and planting are underway in southern and central areas where normal to above-normal rainfall is expected. Green food will become available in the South in February, followed by the harvest in March. To this end it is crucial to accelerate the seeds distribution to affected population pereferably by end of December 2016. According to the Crop and Early Warning Unit (DCAP) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), as of mid-October, land preparation in the southern region has reached 70 percent of the total planned area, while in the central and northern regions land preparation had reached 50 percent of the total planned area.

The Government of Mozambique, together with the food security cluster members, provided seeds to drought-affected households beginning of August. Additional distributions are planned to be held in December providing access to seeds, hence, good prospects for the agricultural season. The extent to which the informal seed network will meet farmer’s needs is undetermined.Moreover, FEWS NET estimates that between October and December, nearly 1.8 million people will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Needs may peak at nearly 2.3 million by the end of March 2017, including potentially flood-affected persons. Volumes of staple foods and commodities are adequately supplied in most monitored markets although the food prices are still relatively high. CHEMO is piloting electronic voucher for food assistance targeting 13,007 households in Tete and Sofala provinces with e-vouchers. To date, 10,378 households have been registered and the problems encountered with the roll-out of e-vouchers include few certified vendors, the illiteracy of the beneficiaries and the poor road network (especially during the rainy season).

The general level of acute malnutrition will likely deteriorate slightly during the lean period, and in some drought-affected areas, global acute malnutrition (GAM) prevalence may go above 10 percent through the end of February 2017. Other factors that could impact GAM prevalence include the possibility of flooding and displacement due to conflict, which could disrupt access to health services. The increased incidence of seasonal diseases, such as diarrhea and malaria, overall poor access to water and sanitation, and low nutrition rehabilitation program coverage also impact people’s vulnerability.

The negative impacts of the ongoing political-military tension are affecting efforts to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to those in need in affected areas. The government recognizes that 2,938 persons have been displaced in Manica and are being accommodated in camps. From 28.11-04.12 it was carried out a joint assessment (Government and HCT) to Manica province to understand what the needs are and the HCT is at the moment developing a response plan to assist the IDPs.

Recent rainfall has not improved either surface or groundwater availability. In all river basins, water levels remain below alert levels. The Pequenos Limbobos dam is at 15% of storage capacity. The water authorities (ARA Sul) are considering limiting the use of water for irrigation so as to ensure the domestic water supplies of Maputo, Matola and Boane municipalities.","Wed, 30 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/695684-Dashboard%20and%20maps_November%202016.png?itok=9YOoKfgg,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'humanitarian', 'seeds', 'end', '30', 'assistance', 'food', 'dashboard', 'million', 'total', '2017', '2016', 'water']", 
69,69,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,2019: Natural disasters claim more than 1200 lives across East and Southern Africa - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2019-natural-disasters-claim-more-1200-lives-across-east-and-southern-africa,"The climate crisis contributes to at least 33 million people in the region – or 10% of the population across ten countries – being at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse[1]. Over 16 million are believed to be children [2].

New analysis from Save the Children shows over 1200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[3].

Southern Africa is warming at twice the global rate [4] and many countries have been buffeted by multiple shocks, including Mozambique experiencing two strong cyclones in the same season for the first time in recorded history.

As world leaders meet this week at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25), Save the Children calls on them to commit to greater action to reduce the impact of the climate crisis on children, in East and Southern Africa and globally, who will be living with the impact of their decisions.

2019 will be remembered as the year the climate crisis devastated parts of east and southern Africa, with floods, landslides, drought and cyclones leaving at least 33 million people at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse, according to new analysis by Save the Children.

A recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows increasing evidence that climate change is contributing to higher temperatures in the region, and that these temperatures are exacerbating the impacts of drought and flooding[5]. These climate shocks decimate livelihoods, leaving households desperate for food and putting children at risk of acute malnutrition - a life threatening condition requiring urgent treatment. Children also bear close to 90 per cent of the burden of disease attributable to climate change, such as malaria and dengue fever[6].

Repeated erratic and extreme weather events in east and southern Africa has meant that in 2019:

At least 1,200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi[7]. This figure does not include the thousands of lives lost to drought, and Save the Children fears that soaring hunger levels over the past 12 months will have contributed to further loss of life as well as malnutrition, particularly amongst infants.

Ten countries across East and Southern Africa - Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya – are experiencing ongoing weather-induced crises, with an average of 10% of people living in these countries currently experiencing serious hunger [8]. With high populations of children – a total of 162 million under 18 year-olds across the ten countries - Save the Children estimates these figures include over 16 million children now at crisis or emergency levels of hunger [9].

Massive movements of people have created additional risks of children being exploited, separated from their families, or dropping out of school. By June 2019[10], over 1 million people across seven of the ten countries had been newly displaced by climate-related shocks[11]. Over half of these displacements were the result of Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in March 2019, and was followed six weeks later by Cyclone Kenneth, which was the first time in Mozambique’s recorded history of two strong tropical cyclones in the same season. The storms were also the strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent[12].

By June 2019, the number of people forced to flee their homes as a result of climate shocks in the region was already the same as for the whole of 2018[13], and does not count more recent displacements from floods which have struck Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan over the past three months. These disasters have currently displaced at least an additional 1.1 million people[14], compared to 1021600 at the end of 2018. Based on the current trajectory, this figure could double by the end of 2019.

Save the Children is urging the international community to take greater steps to tackle the climate crisis and its impact on children around the world, which is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda Pledge to Leave No One Behind and ultimately the rights of all children as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As part of this, the international community needs to work with governments in east and southern Africa and across the globe to support the development and implementation of national action plans on climate change.

Amran is a 13 year old girl whose home was flooded when the banks of the Shabelle River broke in Beledweyne, Somalia. Amran is now living in a tent with her parents and three siblings. Amran said:

_ “I was very horrified when I heard the water is coming and will be reaching our house. I did not know what would happen to me and my family. We were all very scared.”_

Save the Children’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, Ian Vale, said:

“The findings of this analysis are grim, and show that the climate crisis is further entrenching inequality, poverty and displacement across East and Southern Africa. The climate crisis is happening here, it’s killing people, it’s forcing them from their homes, and it’s ruining children’s chance of a future.

“With these overlapping, unrelenting emergencies, the humanitarian system is also being stretched to breaking point. Repeated cycles of food insecurity from climate-related shocks is resulting in significant funding shortfalls and unmet humanitarian needs. We are reaching a crisis point in this region.

“As world leaders come together for COP25, we call on them to take strong decisions to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure the lives and futures of our children is protected. We call on donors to increase and sustain funding for humanitarian assistance across East and Southern Africa, with initiatives linked to existing measures to increase children's protection, access to health and education, and livelihood support. And most importantly, children need to be actively involved in international, national and local efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.”

Save the Children is the global leader in protecting children in emergencies and natural disasters, working with communities to set up evacuation routes, pre-position emergency supplies, fight against the effects of drought, and access clean water.

Hundreds of people were killed, tens of thousands made homeless and livelihoods lost when Cyclones Idai and Kenneth hit Mozambique with devastating force in March and April. The destructive power of the two storms has wreaked havoc on the country’s infrastructure and agriculture.

Many crops that were about to be harvested and farm infrastructure were destroyed. The impact of these two disasters lingers on, threatening widespread hunger among survivors of these twin disasters.

World Food Program spokesman Herve Verhoosel says more than 1.6 million people are suffering from acute food insecurity and the worst is yet to come.

“It is expected that the upcoming lean season it will be very difficult in Mozambique with just below 2 million people projected to be in crisis situation if there is no humanitarian intervention before,"" Verhoosel said. ""The lean season is the period from October this year until the next harvest season in March 2020.”

Verhoosel says WFP is planning to assist more than 560,000 people every month through October in both cyclone and drought affected areas. He says his agency hopes to scale up its humanitarian operation when the lean season kicks in in October.

If the money is available, he says WFP will provide food rations to one-and-one quarter million people every month until March when the next harvest season begins. He says WFP will need slightly more than $100 million to implement its recovery plan over the next six months.","Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/8EBA46B8-3A26-40C8-9F66-A02CB9A30582.jpg,"['mozambique', 'nearly', 'cyclone', 'program', 'month', 'survivors', 'season', 'wfp', 'food', 'verhoosel', 'lean', 'million', 'risk', 'shortages', 'severe']",

El Niño conditions during the 2015/16 planting season caused Southern Africa’s worst drought in 35 years, representing a second consecutive failed harvest. This created severe food and water shortages and compounded existing vulnerabilities in all humanitarian sectors. While governments led the response, the scale of needs overwhelmed national capacity. Five countries declared national emergencies: Lesotho (22 December 2015), Zimbabwe (04 February 2016), Swaziland (18 February 2016) and Malawi (13 April 2016). Mozambique declared a Red Alert (12 April 2016), while Madagascar issued a message of solidarity (26 August 2016); All called for urgent international assistance.

Members of the Southern Africa Regional Inter-Agency Standing Committee (RIASCO) deployed staff to the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC)’s El Niño Logistics and Coordination Team (established in May 2016) to provide technical assistance. On 26 July 2016 SADC declared a regional emergency and launched a 13-country, US$2.4 billion appeal to assist 41 million El Niño-affected Southern Africans. In support of SADC’s appeal, RIASCO launched its Action Plan on 27 July, which was revised in December 2016. The Action Plan prioritized seven countries: Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

The Action Plan was based on three pillars: a humanitarian pillar, setting out immediate needs in the seven priority countries; a resilience pillar undertaken in parallel to humanitarian efforts; and a macro-economic pillar, which sets out policy options for governments to address the long-term impacts. The plan requested $1.3 billion to provide humanitarian assistance (pillar 1) for 13.8 million people up to April 2017, of which $900 million has been received (70 per cent).

Critical funds from international donors including USAID, DFID, ECHO, CERF and the Governments of China and Japan enabled a significant humanitarian response, especially in stabilizing regional food security. National and international NGOs, as well as the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and local Red Cross societies, played an indispensable role in the response. With the concerted efforts of governments and the humanitarian community, more than 10.6 million people were reached with food assistance at the peak of the response (January to April 2017). More than 360,000 children under age 5 with acute malnutrition were admitted for treatment, and 1.5 million people were provided with safe water. Coordination among various partners enabled the provision of emergency education programming, such as school meals and life-saving messaging on hygiene practices. Education and Protection partners collaboratively achieved significant results for 451,000 children, demonstrating the key role the sectors play in promoting resilience and disaster risk reduction (DRR). With hopes pinned on an agricultural recovery, more than 1.6 million drought-affected households were reached with programmes to boost agricultural production.

With climate change predicted to bring more frequent and intense natural disasters to the region, the RIASCO Action Plan included a range of practical options to build resilience, based on the idea that while droughts cannot be prevented from occurring, they should not result in humanitarian emergencies. These options included the development of sound national policies and strategies, expanded and strengthened social safety nets, promotion of climate smart agriculture, reinforced early warning systems and improved management of water and other natural resources. These must be combined with solid risk management and fiscal instruments at national and regional levels. A $150 million World Bank project in Botswana to protect water sources is a current example; as well as the recent availability of longer term disaster risk insurance products.","Wed, 12 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/903924-report_on_the_riasco_action_plan_2016-2017_july2017.png?itok=QxUj3QGr,"['world', 'africa', 'response', 'plan', 'southern', 'national', 'humanitarian', 'regional', 'pillar', 'action', 'drought', 'report', 'el', 'million', 'riasco', '2016', 'niñoinduced', 'water']",

In March 2019, the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving people stranded on trees and houses.

On 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Cabo Delgado province just six weeks after Idai and was the first cyclone to make landfall this far north in Mozambique. Entire villages were flattened and thousands of people were displaced, in a country already dealing with the consequences of drought and Cyclone Idai.

73,73,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,The number of people affected by hunger in southern Africa 'will stretch around the world' - Angola - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/number-people-affected-hunger-southern-africa-will-stretch-around-world,"The number of hungry children and adults living through Southern Africa’s worst drought in 35 years will soon be so vast that if put together would stretch one and a half times around the earth, warns humanitarian agency World Vision.

World Vision is concerned about the health, safety and protection of children, with UN food agencies estimating a record 45 million people living in 16 countries across the region will experience food shortages within six months. Climate change and more rapidly repeating, severe drought cycles are trapping people in a vicious cycle of poverty.

“It’s difficult to comprehend the number of people caught up in this terrible crisis. But if you took the average height of the girls, boys and adults trying to survive, then this line of the hungry people would stretch for 67,725 kilometres. That is more than one and a half times around the earth (40,075 km),” explained World Vision Southern Africa Hunger Emergency Response Director, Maxwell Sibhensana.

“This crisis is almost invisible to the public but on the ground we are witnessing the devastating effects of changing weather patterns that are creating unbearable situations for children. We know many children have been separated from families, are forced out of school and working to afford their next meal.”

Southern Africa’s drought has sparked critical food, nutrition and water insecurity. In technical terms, the number of people experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) has risen from nine to 11 million across nine countries in Southern Africa. Approximately half of those the worst impacted areas are children, who are at risk of hunger, disease, exploitation and death.

Parts of the region like Angola and Zimbabwe have experienced recurrent drought in recent years, causing failed harvests. In other areas, such as Mozambique, erratic floods and cyclones damaged 700,000 hectares of crops.

“We are having to factor climate change into our development programmes, anticipating the worst and helping farmers become more resilient to climate shocks, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts many Southern African countries will be among the most affected by climate change,” said Mr Sibhensana.

In Angola, more than 2.4 million people are affected, with an estimated 85,000 children experiencing severe or moderate acute malnutrition. World Vision screening data shows that malnutrition levels in Huila province have double compared to last year, currently at more than 20 per cent.

In Zimbabwe, 5.5 million people are facing hunger, with one in three people in major cities like Harare in need of humanitarian assistance. The cost of basic commodities has tripled as the country faces inflation and an economic crisis. The country’s staple crop, maize, is reported to run out in January.

In Zambia, more than 2.3 million people are estimated to be facing acute hunger due to devastating effects of erratic rains, dry spells, water logging, false and late starts to the 2018/2019 rain season on agriculture production.

World Vision Angola Humanitarian Emergencies Director, Robert Bulten, says the situation in Angola has been deteriorating for months and called for urgent humanitarian support.

“Children are barely eating one meal a day. Our staff, who worked in Angola just after the Civil War say they have never seen hunger and malnutrition on this scale,” said Mr Bulten.

“Even if the rains arrive soon, it would be months before worst-hit farmers can harvest,” said Mr Bulten.

World Vision is responding to the hunger emergency across seven countries –Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique. World Vision is appealing for USD 44 million to address urgent humanitarian needs including child protection, urgent treatment of malnutrition, prevention of diseases, food assistance and water and sanitation interventions.","Sun, 10 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/1_oVZAL8b_4n6hJEk2e0T-Mw.jpeg?itok=gO9cT7qS,"['world', 'africa', 'children', 'southern', 'climate', 'affected', 'humanitarian', 'angola', 'hunger', 'vision', 'food', 'number', 'stretch', 'million']",

This funding will assist people in need following cyclone Idai and the subsequent floods.

Total EU humanitarian assistance in response to this natural disaster now amounts to over €15 million.

“We continue to stand in solidarity with the people affected by cyclone Idai and the floods in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. There are still urgent humanitarian needs to be met and we are scaling up our efforts so that relief continues to be brought to the people in need,” says Christos Stylianides, Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.

From today's announcement, €7 million will benefit people in Mozambique, where up to 1.85 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. This assistance will provide shelter, water and sanitation, humanitarian food assistance, health and psychosocial support. The cyclone coincided with the annual harvest period, thereby affecting food security in the months ahead. Access to safe water is a major concern in a bid to avert the spread of disease outbreaks.

In Zimbabwe, €4 million will provide people affected by the flood with shelter, water and sanitation, as well as food assistance. The floods have exacerbated an already existing food security crisis, which was brought by drought and a volatile economic situation, and which is affecting almost 3 million people.

In Malawi, people in need will benefit from assistance worth €1 million in the form of food aid and support to recover their livelihoods. The floods in Malawi have had an impact on 860 000 people, 85 000 of whom have lost their homes and are currently living in camps or makeshift settlements.

Background

Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi are located in a region that is very much prone to weather-related crises, such as cyclones, floods or droughts. Between 2016 and 2018, the European Union has supported the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region with over €80 million in humanitarian aid, emergency relief response, and disaster preparedness funding.

Tropical cyclone Idai made landfall during the night of 14 March 2019 near Beira City, Mozambique bringing torrential rains and strong winds, moving then westwards over east Zimbabwe and also causing massive flooding in Malawi. The cyclone left loss of life and devastation in its trail.

The package of humanitarian aid announced today complements the €3.75 million in financial humanitarian assistance given in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone.

In addition to this financial humanitarian assistance, at the request of Mozambique, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (EUCPM) was activated to help those affected by the devastating impact of cyclone Idai. Offers of assistance received through the Mechanism came in from Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, coordinated by the European Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC). A European Civil Protection Team has been in Mozambique since 23 March 2019 ensuring the logistical coordination and distribution of aid provided by EU Member States. An epidemiologist from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) is supporting the coordination of emergency medical teams and other public health activities.

Around 60 000 rescue items and eight teams of civil protection specialists with equipment have been offered by EU Member States and sent to Mozambique. The assistance offered includes water purification equipment, emergency medical teams, tents and shelter equipment, hygiene kits, food and mattresses, and satellite telecommunications for humanitarian workers on the ground. The European Union financed 75% of the transport costs of these teams and equipment, amounting to nearly €4 million in total. Furthermore, a team of 11 experts from seven Member States (Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, and Slovenia) was sent to Mozambique to help with logistics and advice.

The European Union's Copernicus satellite mapping services have helped in delineating affected areas and plan disaster relief operations.

Highlights

• For implementing recovery interventions in Cyclone and drought-affected areas from October 2019 to March 2020, which corresponds to the next harvest season, WFP’s net funding requirements stand at USD 97 million.

Situation Update

• According to the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) results released in July 2019, it is estimated that 1.6 million people are currently facing difficulties in accessing food to meet acceptable food needs (April – September 2019). Of the 39 districts analyzed using IPC, it is estimated that from October 2019, at least 12 districts require a combination of urgent interventions such as food assistance, agricultural inputs, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood support. It is projected that the food insecurity and acute malnutrition situation will prevail until the end of February 2020, when the next harvest is expected to start. Humanitarian assistance already provided in the most affected areas has prevented the deterioration of the food security situation. In addition, approximately 67,500 children under five years of age need treatment for acute malnutrition.

• As of 31 July, the emergency phase of the Cyclone response was finalized. WFP is currently transitioning to the recovery and resilience phase that will support Cyclone affected populations until March-April 2020 (next harvest).

• WFP has designed a three-phase post-Cyclone recovery and resilience strategy aiming to support recovery, reconstruction and resilience- strengthening efforts among the affected communities. The first phase of implementation is a 3-month Post-Emergency Recovery programme started in August. Unconditional assistance will continue to be provided to those most in need.","Sat, 31 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1366918-WFP-0000107988.png?itok=amGapoTH,"['mozambique', 'cyclone', 'brief', 'affected', '2019', 'wfp', 'food', 'assistance', 'recovery', 'million', 'country', 'phase', 'need']",

(Dr Michael Charles heads the IFRC Southern Africa Cluster. His article was first published by the Southern Times last month, before the September Climate Action Summit in New York, and was reproduced by the IFRC on Friday. It has been edited slightly here for length and time references.)



All countries in the Southern African Development Community are currently experiencing pockets of dryness. Worryingly for the sub-region, Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared state of emergencies due to looming drought.



The Climate Action Summit in New York presented a timely opportunity for urgent global discussions that will hopefully culminate in concrete, realistic plans to address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on developing countries.



Southern Africa is one of the regions most affected by serious impacts of climate-induced natural disasters.



This year alone, a succession of cyclones and floods has already resulted in significant loss of life and assets in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and kept humanitarian organizations busy with emergency responses, as well as recovery and rebuilding efforts.

Countries are acting to decrease their response times

and improve their communities’ readiness

to mitigate impacts of natural disasters

Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth were different in that they managed to attract global attention because they caused significant devastation during a short period.



Climate change-induced natural disasters in Southern Africa are often invisible in the global media, even though they are protracted and threaten the livelihoods of millions.



Even lower-level cyclones can cause devastating floods that are quickly followed by debilitating droughts.



Many national economies in Southern Africa are agriculturally based, and as long as climate change mitigation strategies enshrined in existing global policies are not wholeheartedly implemented, a significant portion of the 340 million inhabitants of Southern Africa could be food-insecure.



Increased mass movement of people from areas affected by climate-induced natural disasters is also more likely.



The effects of food insecurity and mass movements are felt most by the vulnerable in our communities, such as the chronically ill and disabled, and women and children.



They also place immense pressure on already strained health systems in many countries in the sub-region. With the necessary funds, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement has the capability and is well placed to address some of the consequences. But urgent action is still needed on the climate change question.



Protocol



Efforts for adaptation are essential not only to decrease the negative consequences but also to increase opportunities for communities to be more resilient in the long-term.



Countries in the sub-region are acting to decrease their response times to calamities and improve their communities’ readiness to mitigate impacts of natural disasters.



Mozambique is the first country in Africa to have an early action protocol approved; it harnesses the power of forecast-based financing to ensure that humanitarian responses are more proactive. Malawi’s protocol is under review and Zambia’s is currently in development.



The need for humanitarian assistance in Southern Africa in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020 will be greater with the imminent drought.

Africa recorded 56 extreme weather events this year, as compared to 45 extreme events in 2018.

Nearly 16.6 million people were affected due to natural disasters in 29 African countries, in comparison to 5.6 million people in 2018. This means close to 11 million more people were affected by seven types of disasters — drought, wildfires, floods, landslides, extreme temperature, fog and storms.

Seventy-nine per cent of those affected were in just five African countries — Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Somalia.

The data also notes that 82 per cent more Africans died due to extreme weather events in 2019. About 1,865 people died in 2019, as compared to 1,024 deaths in 2018. With 996 deaths, Mozambique and Zimbabwe accounted for more than half of these deaths.

Drought and cyclones were the two leading disasters which affected most of the people in Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania.

About 7.6 million people were affected by drought in Zimbabwe and Kenya and 3.8 million people were affected due to cyclone and storms in Tanzania and Mozambique. In 2018-19, Zimbabwe witnessed the worst drought in 40 years.

According to the United Nations, Cyclone Idai, which affected Mozambique the most along with Malawi and Zimbabwe in March 2019, was supposedly the worst disaster to strike the southern hemisphere

In terms of death toll, Mozambique ranks first primarily due to the extra-tropical storm that killed around 600 people. South Africa, where 96 people died, was among the countries with the least number of people affected. For a country which ranks as the second-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, this is worrying.

Cost of damage up by 150 per cent

The continent lost around $2.4 billion, as compared to 0.8 billion in 2018. Africa is, and will be among the regions that are most vulnerable to climate change, warned a study conducted by the scientists of Met Office Hardley and Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds, based in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Coulmbia University in the United States has projected a very high probability of deficit rainfall during January-June 2020 in Southern African countries including Zimbabwe; and above normal rainfall during January-March 2020 in eastern equatorial Africa.

The continent should, therefore learn from the experiences of 2019 and focus on planning and actions for climate-resilience in 2020.

Nearly 195 per cent more people (as compared to 2018) were affected by extreme weather events this year.

Consecutive shocks have exhausted families’ resilience and decimated their livelihoods.

KEY MESSAGES

Communities across Southern Africa are on the frontier of the global climate crisis. The region is warming at about twice the global rate and has been buffeted by multiple and compounding shocks. Millions of families are still recovering from the devastating consequences of Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, which impacted the Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe earlier this year. At the same time, many areas are now in the grip of a destructive drought, including in Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Mozambique and Zambia. Namibia and Mozambique have both extended their national drought emergencies to March 2020, while Lesotho declared a new drought emergency in October.

Humanitarian needs are rapidly rising as the lean season deepens and some 12 million people in nine countries* across the region are experiencing severe food insecurity. At least 12 districts are projected to face ‘Emergency’ food insecurity (IPC phase 4) between October and March, including 3 in Zambia (Gwembe, Lunga and Shangómbo) and 9 in Zimbabwe (Binga, Buhera, Chivi, Gokwe North, Kariba, Mbire, Mudzi, Mwenezi and UMP). More than 60 per cent (14 out of 23) of communes assessed in three provinces (Cuando Cubango, Huila and Cunene) of southern Angola are in IPC phase 4.

Consecutive shocks have exhausted families’ resilience and decimated their livelihoods. In multiple locations, the 2018/2019 season saw total crop failure. Farmers who lost their crops have been forced to rely on markets to access food, while prices keep increasing, especially for maize—the main staple food in the region. Livestock deaths are rising due to limited pasture and water, coupled with recurrent disease outbreaks. In southern Angola alone, more than 27,700 animals have died. The continued presence of fall armyworm and cassava brown streak disease—a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia—also pose ongoing risks to crops, while seasonal jobs are few and far between, as better-off households who would ordinarily provide them have themselves been impacted by drought, floods and economic hardship. Even in the best-case scenario of good rainfall, it could take at least two to three growing seasons for small-scale farms to return to normal production.

Acute malnutrition—rarely seen in Southern Africa—is increasing and heightens the risk of death for the more than one in four children across the region who are already stunted. More than 1,000 cases of pellagra—Vitamin B3 deficiency—have been reported in the areas of Mozambique hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai. The southern dry areas of Angola, which have been hit by consecutive droughts, have reported increasing admissions of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. In Zimbabwe, eight districts now have global acute malnutrition rates above 5 per cent, signifying a deteriorating situation. In Madagascar, acute malnutrition is expected to remain high, despite improved food insecurity. Across the region, more than 29 per cent of children suffer from stunting. Children who are both stunted (chronically malnourished) and wasted (acutely malnourished) have the highest risk of death.

There are reports across the region of families adopting extreme coping mechanisms, including child labour, child trafficking, early marriage and transactional sex, with dire consequences for women and girls’ sexual and reproductive health. Rising food and nutrition insecurity are increasing the risk of displacement, school drop-outs and gender-based violence, with school-aged girls facing the biggest risk of dropping out or missing class as they search for water, food and firewood for their families. In the face of severe water shortages, women and girls are also struggling to maintain menstrual hygiene, undermining their health and dignity.

Millions of families lack access to clean drinking water, basic healthcare and adequate sanitation, compounding the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. In 2019, climatic shocks and other underlying challenges have caused outbreaks of cholera (Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia), hepatitis E (Namibia), dengue fever (Mauritius and Tanzania), measles (Angola,

Comoros, Lesotho and Madagascar) and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (Angola and Zambia). At the same time, strikes by healthcare professionals in Eswatini and Zimbabwe have compromised access to care for millions of people.

The region is at serious risk of backsliding in its fight against HIV/AIDS as a result of these shocks. In several countries, women engaging in transactional sex to help their families survive have reported that men would pay more for sex without a condom.

Food insecurity also undermines HIV treatment adherence, retention and success. Adolescent girls face the greatest risk of newly contracting HIV and for every three new HIV infections among young men (aged 15–24 years) in southern Africa, there are seven new infections among young women.

There is a strong likelihood of back-to-back droughts in multiple areas across the region, highlighting the critical importance of early action. The Indian Ocean Dipole, which is currently in its strongest ‘positive’ state since 2006 is associated with below-normal rain across Southern Africa and many countries have already experienced a late-onset to the 2019/2020 rainy season. At the same time, there is also the likelihood of strong cyclones hitting some countries, especially in the east part of Southern Africa, foreboding a potential second consecutive poor harvest.

New funding is urgently required to enable humanitarians to respond to the most life-threatening needs across the region.

Humanitarian partners are deploying staff and mobilizing supplies for the countries and areas facing the most acute life-saving needs this lean season. However, despite the generosity of key donors, humanitarian appeals in the region remain seriously underfunded.

In Zimbabwe, just 50 per cent of the required amount has been mobilized (US$236 million out of $468 million), while in Mozambique, less than 50 per cent of the appeal has been funded ($291 million out of $620 million).","Fri, 06 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1419393-20191205_ROSEA_KeyMessages_Southern%20Africa.png?itok=Sw4I9TQi,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'key', 'southern', 'humanitarian', 'angola', 'messages', '2019', 'food', 'countries', 'zimbabwe', 'million', 'risk', 'families', 'region']", 
82,82,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,The Red Cross helps with climate change preparedness - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/red-cross-helps-climate-change-preparedness,"Extreme weather phenomena and natural disasters are increasing with the rise in global temperatures. These disasters cause the most suffering to the poorest people in the world, who also have the least influence on climate change.

The Red Cross prioritises those who are most vulnerable in its climate change work as well.

The following six examples help illustrate how Red Cross volunteers are helping people and communities prepare for and survive the impacts of climate change and sudden natural disasters in different parts of the world.

1. Drought relief

Climate change is making dry periods more frequent and disrupting annual rains in many areas, thus exposing people, particularly children, to malnourishment. In response, the Finnish Red Cross is helping supply people with clean water in drought-ravaged southern Africa.

In Muzarabani, Zimbabwe, water used to be extremely difficult to come by. Before the construction of a well and water pipeline, the local health station had to administer medication and deliver children without water.

In local schools, children were fainting from dehydration and afflicted with diarrhoea and infections. Running, clean water is a small miracle that is talked about with pride in the area. Now clean water is available at the turn of a tap from two water supply points, which the Finnish Red Cross constructed with funding from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

2. Aid in the midst of a cyclone

Tropical cyclones destroy buildings and infrastructure with increasing force. According to the IFRC Climate Centre, the destructive force of Cyclone Idai, which struck Mozambique in March, was most likely increased by climate change.

Climate change has resulted in a rise in the area’s sea level, and the port city of Beira, which was caught in the middle of the cyclone, is located on low-lying ground. The majority of the destroyed homes were dwellings constructed in low-lying areas.

Intensifying heavy rains are causing increasingly severe flooding and ruining cultivated areas. Contaminated floodwater is also effective at spreading diseases.

After a disaster, people need quick access to clean water and working toilets to prevent the spread of diseases such as cholera. Flood waters also provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which spread malaria and other diseases.

Following the cyclone, the International Red Cross deployed emergency response units to Mozambique, which supply water for up to 15,000 and sanitation for up to 20,000 people per day.

With support from donors and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Finnish Red Cross sent a cholera unit and hospital supplies to Mozambique in cooperation with the Canadian Red Cross.

3. The changing climate also impacts health

Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year due to malnourishment, malaria, diarrhoea and hot weather, for example.

Improving the health of those who are most vulnerable is at the very core of the Finnish Red Cross’s development cooperation.

Drought and poverty are making life more difficult in many countries, such as Somalia. With the support of the EU, the Finnish Red Cross offered cash donations to 1,500 families with malnourished children in the country.

In addition to this, health care services were provided to 28,927 people, of whom 16,438 were children. Thanks to the support, 92 per cent of children received three meals a day and 98 per cent of acute cases of malnourishment were successfully treated.

4. Forecast-based financing under development

Developing early preparedness helps avoid human suffering when disaster strikes. In Zimbabwe, the Finnish Red Cross is piloting forecast-based financing, which the Red Cross movement is among the first to develop.

The hope is that new working methods will improve the efficiency of disaster risk management and help make related efforts more localised.

Forecast-based financing is also being developed in the Philippines, where the Finnish Red Cross has been conducting community-based disaster preparedness work in the slums of Manila and the countryside since 2013 and helped communities recover from the damage caused by storms.

5. Support for the elderly suffering from hot weather

The impacts of climate change are also being felt in Finland, where winter storms and summer heat waves are threatening the older population in particular.

Warmer summers increase the risk of premature death, especially among the elderly. According to the National Institute for Health and Welfare, the summer 2018 heat wave caused 380 “additional” deaths in Finland. During summer 2018, Red Cross volunteers supported the home care of the elderly in Sotkamo.

Winter storms are also predicted to become increasingly fierce. The Finnish Red Cross helped people and supported the authorities during blackouts caused by crown snow in Kainuu in 2018. People over the age of 75 were visited by volunteers, in addition to which the Red Cross’s logistics supplied the area with generators, water canisters and accommodation supplies.

6. Climate change can cause conflicts

Research shows that climate change can escalate or serve as one of the initial causes of conflicts and migration movements. The Red Cross’s basic work includes responding to the humanitarian consequences of both phenomena and people’s needs.

The range of impacts can be wide. When people flee from conflicts or disasters escalated by climate change, hot weather can prove fatal for the people forced out of their homes, for example. In these situations the Red Cross helps people at refugee camps.

Preparing for climate change and repairing the damage that it causes will require additional resources in the coming years.","Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['mozambique', 'change', 'children', 'climate', 'support', 'health', 'helps', 'cross', 'impacts', 'finnish', 'red', 'preparedness', 'water']",

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes persist across most of the country. In June, food assistance covered nearly 1.6 million people with many households experiencing No Acute Food Insecurity! (IPC Phase 1!) or Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) in central and northern cyclone affected areas; however, it is expected that there are still households not receiving assistance at all or are receiving very small amounts of food assistance. As a result, it is expected Crisis (IPC Phase 3) area level outcomes are present.

Humanitarian food assistance distributions are expected to be adjusted in July/August based on available funds. According to WFP, as of early July, current funding levels cover roughly 50 and 5 percent of the plan in cyclone and drought affected areas, respectively. As the lean season approaches humanitarian assistance is needed to protect livelihoods and reduce food consumption gaps.

Second season production in flood affected areas for horticulture crops is progressing well in flood affected areas. Second season vegetables are currently available for consumption and sale in local markets, improving food availability. As for cereals, particularly maize grain, the performance is poor due mostly to the infestation by fall armyworm (FAW).

Despite these events, deadlier or costlier disasters in Asia and North America often overshadow disasters in Africa. However, with a rapidly growing population and increasing impact of climate change, the disaster impact in Africa will likely increase in the coming decades. Therefore, CRED Crunch 56 will focus on disasters across the African continent in the past 20 years.

With over 50 countries across approximately 30 million square kilometers of land, the threat of natural hazards in Africa varies greatly by geography and season. Figure 1 demonstrates the type of disaster that affects the highest number of people in each African country. Regions of southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel have been most affected by drought, while much of central Africa and western Africa has been most affected by floods. Countries in south-eastern Africa (some of which are not featured on the map) face an annual cyclone season leaving them most affected by storms.

Although disasters occur across the entire continent, some countries are more affected than others. Since 2000, Kenya (60 events), Mozambique (55 events), and South Africa (54 events) experienced the highest number of disasters as they regularly face storms, droughts, and flooding. The 3 most populated subSaharan countries, Nigeria (49 events), Ethiopia (43 events), and D.R. Congo (41 events), also fall into the top 10. In terms of death tolls, as seen in Figure 2, Somalia ranks first primarily as a result of the 2010 drought, while Algeria ranks second with most deaths occurring from a single earthquake.

As seen in Figure 3, floods and droughts were the most prevalent and impactful type of disasters on the continent. From 2000-2019, floods were responsible for 64% of disaster events, followed by storms at 15%. Unlike other continents, such as Asia, earthquakes and volcanoes are not prominent types of disasters. As well, due to relatively poor health surveillance, the impacts of extreme temperatures are considered to be under reported.

So far in this century, droughts have been the deadliest disaster type, followed by floods. In fact, most of the drought deaths can be attributed to a single event, namely the one in Somalia in 2010 when approximately 20,000 people died. This drought, along with the Somali Civil War, lead to a famine declaration due to high mortality and malnutrition.

In terms of people affected, droughts make up by far the largest share of disasters in Africa. This figure may be attributed to various climatic and geographic features, as well as the reliance on rain-fed agriculture by large portion of the population in low resource rural areas. The most impactful drought events so far this century by number of people affected were the 2003 and 2004 South African drought (15 million & 12.6 million people affected respectively), 2015 Ethiopian drought (10.2 million people affected), and 2009 Niger drought (7.9 million people affected).

In recent years the share of global events, deaths, and people affected occurring in Africa has risen; as seen in figure 4.

This trend will likely continue as Africa’s share of the global population rises from approximately 13% in the year 2000 to 26% by 2050 (1). In absolute terms, the population of Africa is projected to increase from the current 1.3 billion inhabitants to 2.5 billion by 2050, thus nearly doubling the potential population affected by disasters (1). Additionally, rapid growth in population increases the likelihood of urbanization in areas exposed to natural hazards and resource shortages. In addition to population growth, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2) has stated that Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced more frequent and intense climate extremes in previous decades as a result of climate change, a trend that is likely to continue as the impacts of climate change intensifies. Regions across the continent are expected to face increased extreme temperatures, droughts, and increases in heavy rainfall (2).","Mon, 18 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1404848-CredCrunch56.png?itok=PXRzCIUz,"['world', 'africa', 'droughts', 'issue', 'affected', 'cred', 'events', 'drought', 'population', '2019', 'figure', 'crunch', 'continent', 'review', 'million', 'newsletter', '56', 'disasters']",

Parts of Lesotho, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe continued to experience Crisis—IPC 3— levels of food insecurity in January, with some areas predicted to deteriorate to Emergency—IPC 4—levels during the peak of the lean season in March, according to the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Meanwhile, food security improved in Malawi, where FEWS NET reports populations are experiencing Stressed—IPC 2—levels due to ongoing humanitarian assistance.

Heavy rain and floods in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe since early January have adversely affected crop production and may prolong the need for humanitarian assistance, according to the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO). In mid-February, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted above-average rainfall in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia through late February.

86,86,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Tropical Cyclone Idai Destroyed More Than $1B of Southern Africa Infrastructure: UN - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/03/26/521672.htm,"A cyclone that tore across southern Africa this month may have destroyed more than $1 billion of infrastructure, the United Nations said, as the death toll from the storm climbed to more than 700.

After devastating Mozambique’s port city of Beira, Tropical Cyclone Idai damaged roads, bridges and dams as it moved toward eastern Zimbabwe. More than 100,000 houses were partially or completely destroyed, according to the UN. It also ruined more than 500,000 hectares of crops, just as farmers in the region were preparing to harvest their corn after a drought.

“We probably have lost about a billion dollars in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Malawi in terms of resources,” UN Economic Commission for Africa Executive Secretary Vera Songwe said in a statement. “In particular the Beira port, the signature port of Mozambique, is essentially today almost a thing of the past because of Cyclone Idai.”

‘Inland Ocean’

The UN World Food Programme last week raised the crisis classification for Mozambique to its highest level, which it said put the disaster on a par with the humanitarian crises in war-ravaged Syria and Yemen. Satellite imagery of flooding in central Mozambique showed an “inland ocean” the size of Luxembourg, the WFP said.

Before Idai struck, Mozambique had been battered by a sovereign debt crisis, with growth slowing to 3.3 percent last year — the weakest pace since 2000, when the country suffered similar flooding that killed 800 people. The latest storm may deliver a further blow to the economy, according to NKC African Economics.

“The effects of Cyclone Idai on the Mozambican economy will be severe,” said Pieter du Preez, an analyst at Paarl, South Africa-based NKC. “We expect food-price inflation to rise sharply as Mozambican authorities import food with an already weakened currency.”

In a country where almost half the population lives in poverty, the storm has hit ordinary citizens the hardest.

Tree Refuge

Rosa João, a 41-year-old Mozambican, spent two days desperately clinging to branches up a tall tree with her neighbors as she awaited rescue from the floods in Buzi, west of Beira. Below her, floodwaters reached as high as five meters (16 feet) and as she watched bodies float by.

“The hardest moment was to see the bodies float in the murky waters of the rains,” she said after Indian naval officers saved her by boat. “The current of the waters was so strong that we thought it would pull up the the tree by its roots.”

João had nothing to eat for nearly four days while waiting for rescuers, she said in an interview in Beira. Her house in Buzi was swept away, with everything in it.

As disaster relief workers shift their focus from search and rescue, fears are growing over the potential outbreak of waterborne diseases like cholera and malaria, Jane Sweeny, a spokeswoman for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, said by phone from Beira.

Once the waters have receded, tens of thousands of people like João will need to rebuild their homes and wait for the next planting season that starts at the end of the year.

There are more than 11 million people now experiencing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) in nine Southern African countries1 due to deepening drought and climate crisis. If urgent humanitarian action is not taken, the number will likely rise in the coming months, according to the Regional Interagency Standing Committee Africa (RIASCO).

In Zimbabwe, 3.58 million people are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or Phase 4 (Emergency). In Zambia, 2.3 million people are currently estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or worse. In southern Angola, 1.6 million people are impacted by the drought with at least 562,000 in IPC Phase 3 or worse. By September 2019, 1.6 million people in Mozambique faced difficulties in accessing food as a result of agricultural losses, internal displacement and destruction of infrastructure and livelihoods stemming from two cyclones that devastated in the country in March and April 2019. In southern Madagascar, 916,201 people are facing severe acute food insecurity.

Climate shocks and climate change. Climate change is a central force driving a continued rise in global hunger, with both droughts and flooding negatively impacting food production. Evidence shows children suffer disproportionately from the impact of climate change. In fragile states and low-income communities, including in Southern Africa, the poor and marginalized will be most affected. Persons in low-income quintiles of society – and particularly children, women and the elderly who are less capable of coping with the negative effects of climate change – will be the most severely affected.

• Western and central parts of the region are experiencing poor rainfall and bad drought conditions, with some parts of Southern Africa facing the lowest rates of rainfall since 1981. Namibia received its lowest recorded rainfall in 35 years leaving 40 percent of its 2.4 million people characterised as severely food insecure.In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock. The region has had only two favourable agricultural seasons since 2012 and many areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating impact of the 2015-2016 El Niño season.

• At the same time, the eastern part of the region saw unprecedented back-to-back cyclones (Idai and Kenneth) impacting Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Comoros and southern Tanzania.

• Southern Africa is currently at the forefront of the climate crisis and facing the consequences of it first-hand. Mitigation (reduced emissions) and adaptation (increased resilience) are required to reduce the impact of climate change in the coming years. A multisectoral and joint approach between UN Agencies with a focus on immediate life-saving response, as well as longer term systems strengthening is needed to address the complexities of climate change at the country level.

Access to water. In drought-affected parts of the region, a growing number of traditional community water points have dried out or do not meet the minimum water demand, resulting in household water insecurity, lack of water in institutions (including schools and health facilities), depletion of watering points for agriculture and livestock which in turn increases unplanned migration of people and livestock.

Lake Kariba, a critical water resource for Zambia and Zimbabwe, is only 16 per cent full at present, down 7.5 meters from the same time last year. In Zimbabwe, the fragile economic situation and cuts to electricity have impacted access to water, curtailing the ability of local authorities to pump water and procure water treatment chemicals for urban areas while in rural areas only 30 per cent of rural water sources have water, are functioning and are protected.

Nutrition. While Southern Africa does not report the critical levels of acute malnutrition seen in East Africa, any incremental increase in acute malnutrition, is an additional stress on the individual child and household. It also presents a stress on health system, which are often poorly equipped to deal with increasing numbers of acutely malnourished children. In addition, considering the high burden of stunting already present across Southern Africa, children that are both stunted and wasted have the highest risk of death compared to those who are stunted or wasted alone.

• In Zimbabwe, national global acute malnutrition (GAM) has risen to 3.6 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2018, and eight districts have GAM rates above 5 per cent, which is rarely seen in Zimbabwe and signifies a deteriorating situation. Doctors in Zimbabwe have been on strike for the previous two months, which has led to an ongoing human resources crisis and may lead to additional challenges for the management of children with acute malnutrition or other resources if no urgent solutions are found.

• In Mozambique, an estimated 67,500 children require treatment for malnutrition, including 6,500 for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). More than 250 cases of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) have been reported in Sofala province, which was hardest hit by Cyclone Idai.

• In Huíla and Cunene, in the south of Angola, between 70 and 80 per cent of the population are currently affected by food insecurity with increasing numbers of children identified as acutely malnourished through screening and programme admission data.

• Acute malnutrition continues to be of concern in the most drought affected districts of southern Madagascar, with 17,800 children treated for SAM with UNICEF support in 2019 to date, compared to 8,643 during the same time in 2018, largely due to a scale up in outreach screening and referral activities. An additional threat is the likely pipeline break for commodities for treating moderately malnourished children, which will likely lead to an increase in the numbers of severely malnourished children.

• A continuing challenge across Southern Africa relates to the lack of representative quality and up to date nutrition information in the most vulnerable communities and most drought-affected areas. This limitsthe ability to highlight the severity of the situation in terms of nutrition outcomes and can mean that a deteriorating situation may not be recognized in time to protect children from becoming malnourished. Representative and quality nutrition assessments in the most affected areas are key to support evidence-based targeted and timely responses.

Agriculture and livelihoods. The aggregate regional cereal output in 2019, including a production forecast for the winter wheat crops, to be harvested from October, is estimated to be nearly seven per cent below the 2018 production. The largest yearly decreases were registered in Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Production of maize, the main staple in the region, is estimated at nearly 10 per cent below the previous five-year average. Livestock rearing and production—a key coping and resilience pathway and a contributor to national GDP in Southern Africa—is also being impacted by reduced water availability and degradation of pastures, as well as increased outbreak of transboundary animal diseases.3 In the southern region of Angola, the drought has affected 2.2 million cattle and 1.2 million sheep, leading to the death of 27,767 animals. The continued presence of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease, a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia, are presenting additional risks to crop production in the region. Macro-economic volatility, including high levels of inflation, rising unemployment and eroded household purchasing power have further compounded the high levels of food insecurity in several countries.

Health. During 2019, climate shocks have exacerbated outbreaks of measles in several countries across the Southern African region, including Angola (3,127 cases with 64 deaths, of which 73 per cent are from Lunda Sul, and 17 per cent from Moxico, with 85 laboratory confirmed as of 30 June 2019); Comoros (132 cases with no deaths, 56 confirmed by 11 August 2019) and Madagascar (a total of 202,692 cases with 966 deaths reported from 7 October 2018 to 10 Sept 2019). Namibia is facing an expansion of transmission of hepatitis E and has been experiencing an outbreak since 2017 in informal settlements with poor access to safe water and sanitation, with 6,527 cases and 55 deaths (including 1,585 confirmed cases) reported by 6 October 2019. These countries also have a significant HIV burden. Food insecurity and resulting malnutrition in people living with HIV, especially children, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

During the 2016/17 drought, a reduction in outpatient consultations and admissions in some countries of Southern Africa like Lesotho, (including for deliveries) were reported due to closure of health facilities as water was depleted, leaving communities without access to critical health services. Approximately 135/404 health districts in Angola, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and Zimbabwe reported increased caseloads resulting from upsurges of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria, which put pressure on health facilities (RIASCO 2017). Outbreaks of waterborne diseases occurred against the backdrop of severe water shortages resulting from the drought.","Thu, 14 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/Cunene%202019%20%28259%29_0%20%281%29.jpg?itok=G-3Rgaaq,"['deepening', 'africa', 'change', 'children', 'southern', 'joint', 'humanitarian', 'crisis', 'climate', 'cent', 'including', 'region', 'zimbabwe', '2019', 'impacts', 'water']", 
88,88,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Farmers are committing suicide as drought in southern Africa reaches crisis levels - New York Post,https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/farmers-are-committing-suicide-as-drought-in-southern-africa-reaches-crisis-levels/,"VOSBURG, South Africa — Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”

The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.

The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.

Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.

Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.

Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.

“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”

Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.

Northern Cape province will need over $28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’ organization Agri-SA.

So far, South Africa’s government has pledged $2 million.

The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.

Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.

For two weeks she had fed two tiny lambs a mixture of maize meal and water after their mother starved to death. When The Associated Press arrived at her home, she had just learned that one had died.

“It must have died because it has only been eating the maize meal mixture. It is not their natural diet,” Buffel said.

Small children are hungry, too.

At Vosburg’s only school, Delta Primary School, scores of children line up every morning for what becomes both breakfast and lunch: usually corn meal, vegetables and soup.

While the school food program began before the drought, teachers say it has become increasingly vital for the town’s struggling families.

“It’s very hard for the parents to actually feed their children at home,” said one teacher, Xolile Ngxathu.

In the regional center of Kimberley a few hours’ drive away, government officials spend their days trying to allocate money from the $2 million provincial disaster relief fund. It is a daunting task as some farmers in far-flung areas cannot be reached easily.

Farmers Jan Louw, 65 and Martiens Tieties, 67, are among those relying on government-sponsored animal feed but are not expecting their next rations until January.

Until then, they rely on commercial farmers sharing feed to keep their few livestock alive.

The Rev. Jaco Heymans with the Dutch Reformed Church has been offering spiritual counseling to many farmers and farm workers in Vosburg.

“The drought is having a devastating impact on the people emotionally and spiritually because financially, all is almost lost,” Heymans said.

“Many people have already canceled their insurance policies and their medical aid in order to just survive. Primary concern is to keep the animals alive, so everything that is spared goes into feeding sheep.”

The drought is even blurring the divisions left by racially-based planning under South Africa’s harsh apartheid system that ended 25 years ago — with more affluent and mainly white residents living in developed areas and black and mixed-race residents in under-resourced townships.

Vosburg is no exception. With the stress of the drought, residents realize they need each other more than ever to survive. Large commercial farms are sharing animal feed with small-scale farmers. The church now counsels everyone from well-off farm owners to farm laborers who fear losing their jobs.

The end is not yet in sight. Christien Engelbrecht, a meteorologist at the South African Weather Service, said below normal rainfall is predicted for the country and the southern African region over the next three months.

“It is clear that southern African farmers, water managers and government entities need to prepare,” Engelbrecht said.","Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/ap_19324472973804.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,"['africa', 'sheep', 'south', 'southern', 'crisis', 'farmers', 'van', 'suicide', 'feed', 'drought', 'sharing', 'food', 'levels', 'committing', 'residents', 'reaches']", 
89,89,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique embraces Sendai Framework - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-embraces-sendai-framework,"By Denis McClean

MAPUTO, 10 September, 2019 - Mozambique was congratulated today on aligning its Master Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction with the global plan for reducing disaster losses, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Mami Mizutori, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said it was encouraging to see such commitment to reducing long-term vulnerability and increasing the resilience of infrastructure to extreme events in Mozambique.

On her first visit to Mozambique, she made the remarks during a meeting with members of the country’s National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction,

“If we cannot mainstream disaster risk reduction across every sector of society then we cannot reach the aims of the Sendai Framework. All of this can only be done if a country takes ownership of its own disaster risk management and this is what I am seeing in this room. The national institute for disaster management, INGC, is a center for coordination with all your ministries and parts of government. We can only push forward levels of prevention with the backing of the country’s political leadership,” she said.

Ms. Mizutori was welcomed to Mozambique by Augusta Maita, Director-General INGC, who outlined the extent of the challenges facing Mozambique from natural hazards which have affected 20 million people over the last 40 years, notably as a result of drought, floods, cyclones and epidemics.

Following the devastation left by tropical depression Desmond in January, Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth, in April, Ms. Maita said many lessons had been learned.

She highlighted the creation of local committees for disaster risk reduction, community-based early warning systems, use of community radio, and short-range forecasts and weather warnings issued by the Meteorological Service and Water Directorate.

Nonetheless, Ms. Maita also pointed to weaknesses which had been exposed by recent disaster events including inadequacy of funding for early warning systems along river basins and room for improvement in coordination mechanisms.

She drew attention to the fact that alongside the loss of 648 lives and the 2.8 million people affected by tropical cyclones this year another 814,000 people were feeling the effects of drought.

In an overview of damage to critical infrastructure, INGC reports stated that the cyclones destroyed or damaged 300,000 homes while also leaving 4,910 classrooms destroyed, 138 health facilities affected, 93,000 hectares of crops lost, and over 1,500 electricity poles damaged.

Ms. Mizutori also met with the media and told journalists that she wanted to support Mozambique’s recovery effort and “to offer our good offices to build back better.” She said that the UN family is with the country on the “difficult and very long journey towards recovery.”","Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-social-media.png,"['maita', 'mozambique', 'warning', 'disaster', 'framework', 'affected', 'sendai', 'cyclones', 'mizutori', 'embraces', 'risk', 'reduction', 'ingc']", 
90,90,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Seeds of Climate Resilience in Mozambique – Food Tank - Food Tank,https://foodtank.com/news/2017/04/seeds-of-climate-resilience-in-mozambique/,"U.S. President Donald Trump may still deny the harsh realities of climate change, but no one in southern Mozambique has any doubts. They don’t have much food either.

The drought of the previous two years broke last October, but with a vengeance. While much of the country received more normal rains, the southern part of Mozambique got intense storms. The first, with thunder, lightning, and hail, hit in October just as farmers were bringing in the last of their irrigated winter crops and beginning to plant maize and other rainy season crops for the coming summer. The second hit in late March, taking down trees, maize, and other crops in the community of Bobole, again flooding one of the area’s more productive associations in the lowlands along the river.

They have irrigation from a rehabilitated colonial system of drainage ditches, which allows a second growing season to supplement the summer rainy season. The system wasn’t well maintained and blockages caused the floodwaters to overflow the banks of the ditches into farmers’ fields. Even their nicely cultivated raised beds, constructed to keep waters from directly covering crops, succumbed to the rush of water.

They lost a lot of maize, the native yellow variety they had purified through careful selection under the direction of Brazilian volunteers brought in by UNAC, the Mozambican national farmers union. When I was there last year, I saw the women who run these associations using yellow maize seed from their community seed bank to grow out enough seed under irrigation so farmers who lost their maize in last year’s drought would have something to plant when the rains came. Now, at least in the lowland areas, much of that maize was lost.

So too were the hardy staples that sustained farm families during the previous two years of drought—sweet potato and cassava. These root crops still produce when rains are poor, drawing water from deep in soils that farmers have improved over the years with the introduction of agro-ecological practices—raised beds, incorporating crop residues into the soil, intercropping, rotating crops, and applying composted manure instead of chemical fertilizer. In the lowlands, though, the floods drowned even the root crops. In a walk through the Saturday vegetable market we saw small cassava roots, and much of the sweet potato had come in from nearby villages across the river.

Mohammed, the Kenyan-born extension worker who has helped bring agro-ecology to Marracuene, said many farmers have land both in the lowland areas that flooded and upland areas that saw good rains. He said that food security in the area was not in a crisis stage, though the government came in February this year to distribute maize.

“Marracuene always has maize,” said Mohammed, “but not this year.”

In the fields of the Farmers Association “Popular,” we found a strapping middle-aged woman working with her son and a hired hand to hoe her raised beds into shape for winter planting. Florentina Samuel took time out to talk with us, wiping sweat from her brow. Her farm hadn’t been wiped out by the floods, though they had destroyed her cassava crop. She invited Mohammed to pull up a withered stalk. He shook off the dirt to reveal one spindly root.

She said her family certainly suffered hunger, but she was able get an early maize crop before the heat wave and to use her irrigation to grow cucumbers and okra when few other farmers did. She got good prices in the market, which allowed her to buy rice.

Mohammed told us that she is relentless in maintaining her irrigated vegetable plots, to grow cash crops. As if to prove the point, she pulled freshly harvested okra from an old plastic watering can and fetched a plastic bag of healthy cucumbers from her nearby field. My companions from Maputo readily paid the higher market price to Florentina for such fresh out-of-season produce.

She didn’t seem daunted by the wave of bad weather, and she attributed some of her optimism to the agro-ecological farming she has adopted.

“The soil is better now, softer, and good for different crops.” She reached into her newly turned soil and showed us the organic matter from last year’s crop residues. “We are still suffering, but if this next crop is good we will be okay.”

The relentless changing climate

I was struck by the string of bad luck farmers have suffered here, but then I realized that the changing climate is changing the odds against farmers like those in Bobole and Popular. Most of the luck left to these farmers is bad luck. Mohammed, who has been working with area farmers since 2010, confirmed the intense realities of the changing climate.

“There has been a big change,” he nodded, “in rainfall patterns and in temperatures.”

He detailed the recent history in his time there, pointing out the dizzying range of impacts climate change is having on vulnerable farmers. When he arrived in 2010, he said the rainy season was what people were used to, with rains arriving in September or October and lasting into the Mozambican summer, when temperatures rose into the low 90s Fahrenheit. Crops could tolerate that with enough moisture.

The first change he noticed was in 2012. The area got an unusually heavy first rain in early September, well before the rains usually came. That cost farmers some of the irrigated winter crop, which was still in the ground.

In 2014, the rains didn’t come in September or October, so crops went in late, and temperatures in the summer rose dramatically, reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Maize plants baked in the dry heat, reducing harvests. The winter season, which relies on irrigation, was affected as well, and in ways I wouldn’t have imagined. The Incomati River, which fills the irrigation system with water, fell so low in the drought that the Indian Ocean four miles downriver from Marracuene, flowed up the dried riverbed. Irrigation canals in parts of the region filled with salt water, destroying crops and land.

The next year was even worse, part of the well-documented El Niño weather pattern that parched much of Southern Africa. Mohammed said there were no rains at all in much of the area and temperatures reached 106, unheard of in the region. Drought-tolerant crops like sweet potato, cassava, peanuts, and cowpeas, fed farm families when maize harvests failed.

How many climate shocks could these poor farmers take? We are still finding out.

They regrew their yellow maize seeds successfully last winter season, under irrigation, resupplying farmers with seeds for the rainy season. Along came the floods, first in October of 2016, then again in late March. To add insult to injury, Mohammed said they saw record temperatures in January and February, searing heat over 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

“Crops actually burned,” Mohammed said, shaking his head. “The leaves of maize plants were brown and dry, and farmers had to plant their maize all over again.”

Drought and flooding are the evil twins of climate change for farmers in much of the global south. Across Southern Africa, farmers have seen rainy seasons shorten, rains fail, and extreme weather bring catastrophic flooding. Add record-breaking heat to that destructive mix, and it is a wonder that farmers still till their fields.

“Farmers now feel that storms and bad weather can happen at any time. But they never run away,” Mohammed told us with a smile. “They survive.”

In large part, these farmers survive because of the resilience borne of agro-ecology, a conscious strategy of their national farm association, and supportive NGOs like ActionAid, to help farmers adapt to climate change.

Adaptation funds lacking in new climate finance

They could certainly use more international support. In the last decade, rich countries have begun contributing to global climate funds to help developing countries mitigate climate change by reducing emissions and adapt to climate changes as they occur. According to a recent article by Saleemul Huq, farmers like those in Marracuene have been short-changed as the tens of billions of dollars in climate financing are disbursed.

“Most of the funding has gone to support mitigation actions in a few of the larger developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa,” he writes, “while only a small proportion has gone to the most vulnerable and poorest developing countries…for adaptation.”

How small a proportion? According to a recent report from the International Institute for Environment and Development, just 10 percent of climate funds have reached the most vulnerable people in developing countries.

Fortunately, the global board of the Green Climate Fund, the principal international initiative, recently agreed that 50 percent of its funds should be allocated to adaptation, and half of that should go to the poorest and most vulnerable countries. This meets the first demands of the 2014 Kathmandu Declaration on climate finance—to prioritize vulnerable countries for adaptation—but it leaves open whether the funds will find their way to the most vulnerable communities, such as the farmers in Marracuene.

Farmer seed banks to avert climate disaster

Such assistance can’t come soon enough. In response to the latest crisis in Mozambique, UNAC is responding with a national campaign to build emergency stockpiles of native seed varieties for key food crops. Marracuene’s maize seed bank saved many area farmers last year after the drought, restoring a maize variety that has proven resilient in most droughts and produces well without purchased inputs such as chemical fertilizer.

“The Marracuene farmers showed us this could work,” said Bartolomeu Antonio, UNAC’s Director of Rural Development. “We saw how effectively peasants could rescue and improve native seeds.”

UNAC and its farmers have mapped and identified key native seeds. They selected cassava, sweet potato, maize, and onion varieties from Zambezia Province, for example, and now plan to collect and grow out seeds, in collaboration with government agricultural experts, to create a national seed bank. They are also encouraging UNAC’s local members to follow Marracuene’s lead and create their own seed banks.

Only 15 percent of small-scale farmers in Mozambique purchase certified seed; the vast majority depend on seeds saved from crop to crop or exchanged with neighbors. When climate change calls, farmers can lose their seeds as they lose their crops, and they scarcely have resources to purchase replacements.

“We have to protect farmers from losing their seeds,” warns Bartolomeu, “and our seed bank can prevent climate change from becoming a climate disaster.”

Aid Chief Warns of Looming ‘Horror’ as Somalia Again Faces Famine - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/world/africa/africa-famine-united-nations-somalia.html,"The top humanitarian official at the United Nations sounded the alarm on Wednesday about the looming risk of famine in the Horn of Africa because of drought, warning that more than five million people are threatened, mostly Somalis.

The official, Mark Lowcock, under secretary general and emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, said that he had allocated $45 million from its emergency relief fund to help purchase food and other assistance for people of the region, and that many of them could face a serious food crisis by September. He called the allocation one of the biggest ever made from the fund.

Somalia and parts of neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya have suffered from repeated seasons of failed rains that have shriveled crops, depleted livestock and left people’s food and water supplies increasingly insecure.

“Communities that were already vulnerable due to past droughts are again facing severe hunger and water scarcity and are at risk from deadly communicable diseases,” Mr. Lowcock said in a statement announcing the emergency allocation.

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 11 2019 (IPS) - The United Nations has warned of drought, disease and war preventing farmers from producing enough food for millions of people across Africa and other regions, leading to the need for major aid operations.

A report called the Crop Prospects and Food Situation by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that shortages of grain and other foodstuffs have left people in 41 countries — 31 of them in Africa — in need of handouts.

“Ongoing conflicts and dry weather conditions remain the primary causes of high levels of severe food insecurity, hampering food availability and access for millions of people,” U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Tuesday.

Southern Africa has experienced both dry spells and rainfall damage from Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on Mar. 14. The storm caused “agricultural production shortfalls” and big “increases in cereal import needs,” added Haq.

Farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia have seen harvests decline this year. Some three million people faced shortages at the start of 2019, but food price spikes there will likely push that number upwards in the coming months, researchers say.

In eastern Africa, crop yields have dropped in Somalia, Kenya and Sudan due to “severe dryness”, added Haq.

According to the FAO, life for rural herders in Kassala State, in eastern Sudan, has been upended by a drought that has forced them to move livestock away from traditional grazing routes in pursuit of greener pastures.

“Life would be so hard if our livestock died. We wouldn’t have food or milk for the children,” Khalda Mohammed Ibrahim, a farmer near Aroma, in Kassala State, told FAO. “When it is dry, I am afraid the animals will starve — and then we will too.”

Droughts are getting worse, says the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). By 2025, some 1.8 billion people will experience serious water shortages, and two thirds of the world will be “water-stressed”.

In Asia, low yields of wheat and barley outputs are raising concerns in North Korea, where dry spells, heatwaves and flooding have led to what has been called the worst harvests the hermit dictatorship has seen in a decade, the report said.

More than 10 million North Koreans — or 40 percent of the country’s population — are short of food or require aid handouts, the U.N.’s Rome-based agency for agriculture said in its 42-page study.

FAO researchers also addressed the spread of a deadly pig disease in China that has disrupted the world’s biggest pork market and is one of the major risks to a well-supplied global agricultural sector.

China is grappling with African swine fever, which has spread across much of the country this past year. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, often fatal for pigs although harmless for humans.

By the middle of June, more than 1.1 million pigs had died or been culled. The bug has also been reported in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia, North Korea and Laos, affecting millions of pigs and threatening farmers’ livelihoods.

The FAO forecast a five percent fall in Chinese pork output this year, while imports were predicted to rise to almost two million tonnes from an average 1.6 million tonnes per year from 2016 to 2018.

Conflict is another worry, the FAO said. While Syria and Yemen have seen “generally conducive weather conditions for crops”, fighting between government forces, rebels and other groups in both countries has ravaged agriculture.

Violence in Yemen has triggered what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 3.3 million people displaced and 24.1 million — more than two-thirds of the population — in need of aid.

Last month, the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) announced a “partial suspension” of aid affecting 850,000 people in Yemen’s capital Sanaa, saying the Houthi rebels that run the city were diverting food from the needy.

Likewise, in Africa, simmering conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan have caused a “dire food security situation”. In South Sudan, seven million people do not have enough food.","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/6907093395_aab38426ee_z-315x472.jpg?itok=1g41N-qU,"['world', 'war', 'africa', 'hit', 'disease', 'sudan', 'uns', 'agriculture', 'drought', 'pigs', 'food', 'fao', 'million', 'seen', 'global', 'shortages', 'dry']",

The move of the southern African nation is in exchange for further reduced generation at Lake Kariba. The offer will provide huge relief for the two countries that have already whittled electricity generation.

Zimbabwe and Zambia generate power on the northern and southern banks of the Lake Kariba and share equally water from the world’s largest man-made inland lake, which is, however, receding fast following the last drought season.

The Zambezi River Authority has since rationed water consumption by Zimbabwe and Zambia’s power utilities, ZESCO and ZESA, which will see them generating at prescribed thresholds, 358 megawatts for Zimbabwe and 392MW for Zambia.

The two countries depend heavily on the Lake Kariba for power, with Zimbabwe having rated capacity of 1,050 megawatts while Zambia can churn out a maximum of 1,080 megawatts from the $5 billion giant water reservoir.

According to officials, with the new deal, Zimbabwe and Zambia may get as much as 500 MW from Mozambique, without the parties involved having to exchange any or significant amounts of money for the deal.

Worldwide flooding

Across the Atlantic, flooding in the US state of Nebraska has been so bad an entire city was walled off from the outside world. In southeast Asia, more than 80 people have been killed in flash floods brought on by torrential rain in the Papua Province of Indonesia. Some areas of the province recorded almost 200 mm (7.8 inches) of rain in 24 hours.

A hotter global climate — in which a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture — is causing stronger, more frequent rainfall. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined in their 2018 report, it's likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the global water cycle since 1960.

Heavy rainfall and floods are a natural part of the world's weather cycle, but climate change is exacerbating them.

Cyclone Idai devastates Mozambique and Zimbabwe Death toll climbing Cyclone Idai might be the deadliest storm to have ever hit Mozambique. President Filipe Nyusi said the death toll could rise to at least 1,000. At least 200 people have been confirmed dead and officials said they expect that figure to rise. ""With every hour and day that passes, our worst fears become increasingly real,"" President Emmerson Mnangagwa said.

Cyclone Idai devastates Mozambique and Zimbabwe Difficulty retrieving bodies Zimbabwean Local Government Minister July Moyo told reporters at a post-cabinet meeting that the current toll for his country was around 100. ""The total number, we were told they could be 100, some are saying there could be 300. But we cannot confirm this situation,"" he said. ""I understand there are bodies which are floating, some have floated all the way to Mozambique,"" said Moyo.

Cyclone Idai devastates Mozambique and Zimbabwe More rain expected Mozambique said it expects more heavy rain in the next few days and had issued flood warnings. Many residents nevertheless returned to their homes. The ""biggest threat we have now, even bigger than the cyclone, is floods because it's raining more and more,"" said Alberto Mondlane, governor of Mozambique's hard-hit Sofala province.

Drought, heat and fire

On the other end of the spectrum of extremes, vital water sources — like lakes, rivers and wetlands — are drying up. For places like Iraq, Australia and China, drought, heat and fire are becoming the new normal.

In China, 28,000 rivers and waterways have dried up over the past 25 years. The country's Yellow River — the second-longest in Asia — is now a mere tenth of what it once was in the 1940s. In late 2018, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao said the nation's acute water crisis was a threat to its very survival.

Parts of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the country's biggest water networks, have experienced huge drops in flows in recent years. Extended drought, prompted by intense heatwaves, in part led to the death of one million fish in the basin over a two-week period in January 2019.

In the Middle East, the Mesopotamian marshlands in southern Iraq, once the largest wetland ecosystem in Western Eurasia, are at risk of disappearing after years of drought.

While the links between some weather extremes and climate change are more complicated than others, Jascha Lehmann from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says the line drawn between floods, drought and global warming is clear.

""There is a lot of evidence pointing to the fact that climate change means we have more weather extremes globally, and this is especially true for heat extremes, for heavy rainfall events and for droughts,"" he told DW.

Pegged to gain an extra 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if emissions aren't reduced, the world's climate may yet see the worst of such extremes.

The secret is in the soil

One important impact of temperature rise is greater evaporation rates and plant transpiration, which leads to drier soils. When rainfall does occur, these dry soils absorb more of it.

This, according to Ashish Sharma, professor from the school of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New South Wales, is a crucial aspect of climate change's impact on the water cycle.

A study Sharma co-authored on the topic found that where soils were once moist before heavy rainfall and storms — allowing excess rainfall to runoff into lakes and rivers — they are now so dry they absorb most of the water.

This means, in many parts of the world, increased rainfall is contributing less to ""blue water"" that flows through lakes, rivers and dams and is extracted for human use, and more to ""green water,"" which is soaked up by the landscape.

""What's happening is the first significant chunk of the rainfall has to be used up to wet the soil before the overland flow can occur and before the big flood can form,"" Sharma told DW.

This is more so the case with ""moderate"" floods that flow into dams, the professor said, rather than extreme floods, which tend to lead to more rapid movement of the water from the atmosphere back into the oceans — preventing it from being stored and used.

""It's these moderate floods that supply water to our dams and it's the dams that basically give us water for our irrigation systems for our communities,"" Sharma said. The problem, Sharma surmised, ""is the temperature rise.""

An entire state in Australia was declared in drought for the second half of 2018

Water wars

Less water in our rivers, lakes and dams means less water for drinking, sanitation, food production, energy, and many other vital uses. It can also fuel conflict, and drive people from their homelands.

Age-old tribes like the Marsh Arabs in Iraq are being deprived of their livelihoods on the marshlands. The worst drought in Syria's history, from 2007 to 2010, has been credited as triggering political unrest and instability in the region, leading to a surge of refugees into Europe.

As Friederike Otto, associate professor at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University outlines — and as climate change is continually showing — it is the world's poorest and most marginalized that disproportionately suffer.

""It's important in these debates not to forget just who and what is in harm's way, about vulnerability and exposure, by blaming [all extreme weather events] on climate change,"" she told DW.

""We shouldn't assume that just because it's 'climate change' that we can't do anything. We can.""","Fri, 22 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19020026_6.jpg,"['struggling', 'mozambique', 'change', 'climate', 'freshwater', 'deluge', 'idai', 'devastates', 'sources', 'extreme', 'drought', 'zimbabwe', 'worst', 'weather', 'floods', 'rainfall', 'replenish', 'water']",

NASA's satellite imagery and model forecasts regularly help agricultural and aid agencies to monitor the performance of crops worldwide and prepare for food shortages.

""In the 1970's the U.S. realized that drought impacts on global agriculture were severely affecting trade and food aid decisions, while ground based information and forecasting of drought was very limited,"" said Brad Doorn, water resources program manager in the Earth Science Division at NASA Headquarters, Washington. ""Earth observations from space provide the persistent, global information needed to detect precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation conditions that give us a more complete picture of conditions that lead to drought, as well as its impacts.""

One of the areas of the planet that NASA and its partner agencies have been keeping a close eye on is southern Africa, which has experienced a year of extremes. Overly dry conditions developed across parts of the region around the start of the 2018-2019 maize crop season in October and persist until today, putting millions of people at risk of famine. Countries like Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are facing some of the worst droughts on record. To make matters worse, two tropical cyclones hit areas of Mozambique and surrounding regions in March and April, causing flooding and high levels of crop loss in the affected region.

The drought is tied to El Niño, a weather pattern tied with persistent warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, which is expected to last until the end of 2019. El Niño brings high temperatures and a dearth of rainfall to southern Africa. When the shortages in rainfall persist, they evolve into deficits in soil moisture, which can decimate rainfed crops—the most predominant type in southern Africa, where less than 10% of the arable land is irrigated.

Each of the steps leading to agricultural drought can be seen from space. As drought conditions develop, NASA computer models that use satellite measurements provide an outlook for the upcoming months.

Measuring Moisture

A team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has developed a data assimilation system that takes observations from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and ingests them into the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) crop forecasting system, which is used by the agency to monitor regional droughts and floods and forecast crop yield. SMAP, launched in 2015, measures the water content of soils and can give a first warning on crop stress.

""The FAS crop analysts use the enhanced soil moisture information we provide them to predict the impact of drought on crop growth and estimate expected end-of-season yield. Crop yield forecasts are updated monthly and are presented relative to last year's yield and last month's estimates,"" said Iliana Mladenova, a research scientist at Goddard.

The USDA FAS's soil moisture model also incorporates precipitation and temperature observations to derive soil moisture. But there are areas of the world where rain gauges are scarce or don't get properly maintained, like southern Africa. Direct satellite measurements of soil moisture in these places may be used to correct the model for precipitation errors and improve the model estimates of the soil water content at the surface and the root zone—the soil region where plants extract water from.

NASA's Applied Sciences Program has been collaborating with FAS since 2005. Back then, the soil moisture measurements came from NASA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) satellite mission. Mladenova expects to eventually be able to combine the measurements from different satellite missions into a ""soil moisture almanac"" of sorts.

Famine Early Warnings

NASA is also part of an interagency effort funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that provides early warning and analysis on instances of acute food insecurity around the world. NASA contributes to the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), by running seasonal forecasting models to predict the evolution of temperature and precipitation, as well as other hydrological variables, for up to half a year in advance.

""FEWS NET's mission is to inform the U.S. where we might need to send aid,"" said Christa Peters-Lidard a hydrologist and Deputy Director for Hydrosphere, Biosphere, and Geophysics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""If a country is in a situation where they are unable to mitigate the drought because they don't have the ability to irrigate or access to alternative food markets, that's where the U.S. and our partners across the world have to make decisions about whether to send aid.""

NASA has been involved in FEWS NET since its launch, in 1985. This longstanding collaboration has evolved from one focused primarily on remote sensing of vegetation conditions to one that takes advantage of NASA's Land Information System, a software framework that integrates satellite and ground-based observations with models.

NASA's efforts to monitor agricultural drought will only become more important in the future, with droughts expected to become more frequent and intense as the climate warms.

""There is a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for Southern Africa with respect to rainfall, but there is observational evidence that air temperatures are increasing across the region,"" said Amy McNally, a researcher at Goddard and the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. ""Higher temperatures are associated with greater aridity meaning more evaporation from reservoirs and drier soils.""

98,98,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,What Cape Town's drought can teach other cities about climate adaptation - The Conversation Africa,https://theconversation.com/what-cape-towns-drought-can-teach-other-cities-about-climate-adaptation-114379,"Extreme weather events, such as Cyclone Idai that has recently devastated Beira, Mozambique, and Hurricane Harvey that hit Houston, USA, in 2017, are the types of climate extremes that cities increasingly have to prepare for.

Cities, particularly those with extensive informal settlements in the developing world, are being hit hard by these new climatic realities. Although rapid onset disasters often have devastating effects, slow onset climate events, such as drought, can also be detrimental.

Cities need to build their capacity to adapt to this range of impacts. One of the best ways to do this is to learn from other cities’ experiences. Drawing lessons from other places that have gone through climate crises is a good way to guard against future shocks and stresses.

One very recent case that cities around the world are watching is Cape Town’s severe drought and the threat of “Day Zero” – when the city’s taps were due to run dry. Although the city came close to having to turn off the taps, they managed to avoid it. After better rains in 2018 and significant reduction in water use across the city, the dams are now reassuringly fuller than they were in 2017 and 2018, although caution is still needed ahead of the winter rains.

A lot has changed and it’s important to reflect on and share.

I conducted research to establish some key lessons to be drawn from the Cape Town drought. I found that local governments must focus on several important areas if they’re to strengthen urban water resilience and adapt better to climate risk. These include improving data collection and communication, engaging with experts and enabling flexible adaptive decision-making.

And, crucially, I found that governance must be strengthened. Although three years of low rainfall led to very low dam levels, there were breakdowns in the interaction between national, provincial and municipal governments that exacerbated the problem.

The findings

The research suggests that effective water management requires systems of mutual accountability between spheres of municipal, provincial and national government.

In South Africa, the national Department of Water and Sanitation is responsible for ensuring that sufficient bulk water is available, often in dams, that can be transferred to municipalities. The municipalities are then mandated to provide clean drinking water. This means that intergovernmental coordination across the spheres of government is vital.

As it stands, different spheres’ mandates overlap. This creates confusion and means the buck is often passed: one sphere of government will insist a particular competency isn’t its job, and hand the work on to another sphere.

For this to be resolved there has to be clarity on shared responsibilities and roles, as well as the development of mutual accountability. To achieve this, technical skills, personal and institutional relations need to be strengthened. This requires strong leadership.

Collaboration within municipal departments also needs to improve. The Cape Town drought highlighted the importance of this. Before 2017, there was limited collaboration between city departments on water issues. During the drought, however, collaboration between certain departments increased considerably as the complexity of the crisis became clear.

Not only is collaboration within government important, it needs to extend beyond government. During a crisis, all of society needs to be engaged, including citizens and the business sector. Technical expertise need to be balanced with opportunities for a broader group to share its perspectives and concerns. Partnerships can help gather the range of perspectives and support needed to respond to complex problems.

Municipalities that, during the course of their normal business activities, have developed strong relationships with their stakeholders will be better placed to respond effectively to a crisis. That’s because they will be able to harness stakeholders’ collective knowledge and contributions more easily.

In Nelson Mandela Bay, the Business Chamber has done this by strengthening relations with the municipality to help to facilitate the ease of doing business in the city. They recognise that all businesses require electricity, water, transport and logistics, for example, and so focus on improving these areas. The municipality developed task teams made up of volunteers from their member companies who have skills set in those areas.

Importantly, there is an agreement that the Metro places high-level executives to sit in the task team meetings to ensure plans are put into practice. These types of relationships can be invaluable during a crisis.

Moving forward

While my study focused on Cape Town, its findings can be applied to other cities that want to strengthen their ability to adapt to climate change. Yes, cities need to pay more attention to how climate variability impacts on their resources, particularly water. But just as important is strengthening the governance of the water system. A well-adapted city is one that understands who is responsible for what and has strong trust and partnerships between and within government.

In order to build capacity to adapt, new types of skills are needed. Local government needs to pay more attention to how to build partnerships, enable flexibility and support learning. These are the types of skills needed for a well-adapted city, but still often lacking in local governments.","Wed, 03 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/266773/original/file-20190401-177175-1m17hjo.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['towns', 'cape', 'climate', 'teach', 'needed', 'cities', 'drought', 'skills', 'needs', 'adaptation', 'city', 'types', 'need', 'water']",

SUMMARY OF THE CRISIS & RESPONSE

On 25 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in northern Mozambique, bringing a path of destruction and damage to the Cabo Delgado and Nampula districts. Tropical Cyclone Kenneth was the second cyclone to hit Mozambique in a span of just six weeks and the first to make landfall this far north in the country. Entire villages were flattened and thousands of people were displaced, in a country already dealing with the consequences of drought and Cyclone Idai.

More than 55,400 hectares of crops have been either partially or completely destroyed, and many fishing villages lost their boats and equipment during the storm. A cholera outbreak has been declared, with cases reported in Pemba, Metuge and Mecúfi.

To support the Government-led response to Cyclone Kenneth, humanitarian organizations are appealing for US$103.7 million to assist more than 373,800 people in need. UN agencies and partners are currently operating with depleted stocks and a seriously stretched to respond to both Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai, where urgent needs remain.

Additional funding is urgently required to enable the delivery of immediate life-saving assistance to people in desperate need.
