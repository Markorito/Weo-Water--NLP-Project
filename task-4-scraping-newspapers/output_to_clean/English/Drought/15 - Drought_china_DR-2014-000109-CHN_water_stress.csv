Aquifers provide us freshwater that makes up for surface water lost from drought-depleted lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. We are drawing down these hidden, mostly nonrenewable groundwater supplies at unsustainable rates in the western United States and in several dry regions globally, threatening our future.

We are at our best when we can see a threat or challenge ahead. If flood waters are rising, an enemy is rushing at us, or a highway exit appears just ahead of a traffic jam, we see the looming crisis and respond.

We are not as adept when threats—or threatened resources—are invisible. Some of us have trouble realizing why invisible carbon emissions are changing the chemistry of the atmosphere and warming the planet. Because the surface of the sea is all we see, it's difficult to understand that we already have taken most of the large fish from the ocean, diminishing a major source of food. Neither of these crises are visible—they are largely out of sight, out of mind—so it's difficult to get excited and respond. Disappearing groundwater is another out-of-sight crisis.

Groundwater comes from aquifers—spongelike gravel and sand-filled underground reservoirs—and we see this water only when it flows from springs and wells. In the United States we rely on this hidden—and shrinking—water supply to meet half our needs, and as drought shrinks surface water in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, we rely on groundwater from aquifers even more. Some shallow aquifers recharge from surface water, but deeper aquifers contain ancient water locked in the earth by changes in geology thousands or millions of years ago. These aquifers typically cannot recharge, and once this ""fossil"" water is gone, it is gone forever—potentially changing how and where we can live and grow food, among other things.

A severe drought in California—now approaching four years long—has depleted snowpacks, rivers, and lakes, and groundwater use has soared to make up the shortfall. A new report from Stanford University says that nearly 60 percent of the state's water needs are now met by groundwater, up from 40 percent in years when normal amounts of rain and snow fall.

Relying on groundwater to make up for shrinking surface water supplies comes at a rising price, and this hidden water found in California's Central Valley aquifers is the focus of what amounts to a new gold rush. Well-drillers are working overtime, and as Brian Clark Howard reported here last week, farmers and homeowners short of water now must wait in line more than a year for their new wells.

In most years, aquifers recharge as rainfall and streamflow seep into unpaved ground. But during drought the water table—the depth at which water is found below the surface—drops as water is pumped from the ground faster than it can recharge. As Howard reported, Central Valley wells that used to strike water at 500 feet deep must now be drilled down 1,000 feet or more, at a cost of more than $300,000 for a single well. And as aquifers are depleted, the land also begins to subside, or sink.

Unlike those in other western states, Californians know little about their groundwater supply because well-drilling records are kept secret from public view, and there is no statewide policy limiting groundwater use. State legislators are contemplating a measure that would regulate and limit groundwater use, but even if it passes, compliance plans wouldn't be required until 2020, and full restrictions wouldn't kick in until 2040. California property owners now can pump as much water as they want from under the ground they own.

California's Central Valley isn't the only place in the U.S. where groundwater supplies are declining. Aquifers in the Colorado River Basin and the southern Great Plains also suffer severe depletion. Studies show that about half the groundwater depletion nationwide is from irrigation. Agriculture is the leading use of water in the U.S. and around the world, and globally irrigated farming takes more than 60 percent of the available freshwater.

The Colorado River Basin, which supplies water to 40 million people in seven states, is losing water at dramatic rates, and most of the losses are groundwater. A new satellite study from the University of California, Irvine and NASA indicates that the Colorado River Basin lost 65 cubic kilometers (15.6 cubic miles) of water from 2004 to 2013. That is twice the amount stored in Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the U.S., which can hold two years' worth of Colorado River runoff. As Jay Famiglietti, a NASA scientist and study co-author wrote here, groundwater made up 75 percent of the water lost in the basin.

Farther east, the Ogallala Aquifer under the High Plains is also shrinking because of too much demand. When the Dust Bowl overtook the Great Plains in the 1930s, the Ogallala had been discovered only recently, and for the most part it wasn't tapped then to help ease the drought. But large-scale center-pivot irrigation transformed crop production on the plains after World War II, allowing water-thirsty crops like corn and alfalfa for feeding livestock.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But severe drought threatens the southern plains again, and water is being unsustainably drawn from the southern Ogallala Aquifer. The northern Ogallala, found near the surface in Nebraska, is replenished by surface runoff from rivers originating in the Rockies. But farther south in Texas and New Mexico, water lies hundreds of feet below the surface, and does not recharge. Sandra Postel wrote here last month that the Ogallala Aquifer water level in the Texas Panhandle has dropped by up to 15 feet in the past decade, with more than three-quarters of that loss having come during the drought of the past five years. A recent Kansas State University study said that if farmers in Kansas keep irrigating at present rates, 69 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer will be gone in 50 years.

This coincides with a nationwide trend of groundwater declines. A 2013 study of 40 aquifers across the United States by the U.S. Geological Survey reports that the rate of groundwater depletion has increased dramatically since 2000, with almost 25 cubic kilometers (six cubic miles) of water per year being pumped from the ground. This compares to about 9.2 cubic kilometers (1.48 cubic miles) average withdrawal per year from 1900 to 2008.

Scarce groundwater supplies also are being used for energy. A recent study from CERES, an organization that advocates sustainable business practices, indicated that competition for water by hydraulic fracturing—a water-intensive drilling process for oil and gas known as ""fracking""—already occurs in dry regions of the United States. The February report said that more than half of all fracking wells in the U.S. are being drilled in regions experiencing drought, and that more than one-third of the wells are in regions suffering groundwater depletion.

Satellites have allowed us to more accurately understand groundwater supplies and depletion rates. Until these satellites, called GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), were launched by NASA, we couldn't see or measure this developing invisible crisis. GRACE has given us an improved picture of groundwater worldwide, revealing how supplies are shrinking in several regions vulnerable to drought: northern India, the North China Plain, and the Middle East among them.

As drought worsens groundwater depletion, water supplies for people and farming shrink, and this scarcity can set the table for social unrest. Saudi Arabia, which a few decades ago began pumping deep underground aquifers to grow wheat in the desert, has since abandoned the plan, in order to conserve what groundwater supplies remain, relying instead on imported wheat to feed the people of this arid land.

Managing and conserving groundwater supplies becomes an urgent challenge as drought depletes our surface supplies. Because groundwater is a common resource—available to anyone with well—drilling equipment-cooperation and collaboration will be crucial as we try to protect this shrinking line of defense against a future of water scarcity.

8/4/2014 Update:Toledo City Government Declares Water Safe

Residents of Toledo can safely use their tap water for drinking, according to a government release lifting the “Do Not Drink” advisory.

“Effective immediately, customers of the City of Toledo Public Water system may now safely drink tap water. Consistent test results have shown Microcystin no longer exceeds the recommended drinking water warning of 1 microgram per liter standard set by the World Health Organization in testing done by the City of Toledo, the Ohio EPA and the US EPA,” the release says.

Residents who used no water for any purpose over the weekend were advised to flush their household lines. Residents who used water for toilets, showering, and other non-consumptive uses were not required to flush their lines. The city also asked all residents to conserve water “to help our water treatment plant as it returns to full operation.”

The City of Toledo has issued a “Do Not Drink” advisory for residents served by Toledo Water after chemical tests confirmed the presence of unsafe levels of the algal toxin Microcystin in the drinking water plant’s finished water. The advisory, spanning three counties in Ohio and one in Michigan, leaves more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without drinking water.

“Do not drink the water,” Melanie Amato, public information officer for the Ohio Department of Health,” told Circle of Blue. “You can shower in it, bathe in it, but do not try to ingest it. That means no washing dishes; you can brush your teeth with it as long as you don’t swallow any water, but we recommend using bottled water for that as well.”

“Do not drink the water.” –Melani Amato

Ohio Department of Health

The Toledo advisory was posted at 2:00 Saturday morning. Ohio governor John Kasich soon announced a state of emergency to mobilize more resources for the city.

Other emergency measures also became apparent across northwest Ohio:

Stores sold out of bottled water, sending residents into neighboring cities and Michigan to find supplies.

Local restaurants, universities and public libraries closed.

Several nearby municipalities that have not been affected by the toxin are offering water to Toledo residents free of charge.

The National Guard is charged with delivering 300 cases of bottled water from Akron, Ohio, as well as Meals Ready to Eat (MRE’s) for distribution to homeless shelters and other vulnerable populations who are unable to cook with their water.

Humanitarian organizations like the American Red Cross are responding, manning water distribution centers and providing water delivery assistance to homebound residents.

“[The bloom] is surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.” –Justin Chaffin

Stone Laboratory

Microcystin is a toxin produced by blooms of freshwater algae, which are a vast and growing problem in Lake Erie—Toledo’s drinking water source. Microcystin can cause nausea, vomiting, and liver damage if ingested, and it has been known to kill dogs and livestock that drink contaminated water. Skin contact with the toxin can also cause irritation and rashes, though levels in treated water are not high enough at this time to warrant a complete ban on water use, Amato said.

Microcystin appears to be a growing public health problem in the western portions of Lake Erie. Almost a year ago, in September 2013, Carroll Township near Toledo detected dangerous levels of Microcystin in its water supply, shut down its water treatment plant, and simultaneously alerted the community’s 2,000 residents not to drink the water.

Toledo is the first major city in the Great Lakes region to fall victim to Microcystin contamination, despite testing and treatment for the toxin. The city allocated $US 4 million for water treatment chemicals last year—double what it spent in 2010. The spending increase is largely due to concerns about algal toxins. City water managers were especially worried after the Carroll Township crisis, which was alleviated by the township’s ability to connect to an outside water supply while it flushed the toxin from its own system. It is unclear if Toledo has similar options available. The city’s Facebook page states:

“It is understandable that there is a huge degree of public concern, but we would advise everyone to remain calm, an alternative water supply and a distribution system will be announced as quickly as possible.”

Algal Bloom Small, But Concentrated

The culprit behind Toledo’s drinking water problems is a toxic algal bloom in Lake Erie’s Maumee Bay. The bloom is not very large compared to past blooms, and Microcystin levels, though high, are not out of the range of those previously seen on the lake.

Toledo’s Water Treatment Process In an interview with Circle of Blue last October, David Leffler, commissioner of water plant operations for Toledo Public Utilites, described the city’s water treatment process: “Initially our intake sits three miles out into the lake, and we add potassium permanganate at the intake crib,” he said. “It takes about three hours to get to shore, so it’s got 3 hours of mixing time. The water tumbles through the pipe and gets into our low service system out in Jerusalem Township where a series of pumps picks the water up and puts it under pressure into two pipes to send it to the treatment plant. Now the treatment plant is 9 miles away. Once you pick it up at low service, we add activated carbon, so now it’s got permanganate and activated carbon in it. The permanganate does a couple things. It treats for taste and odor—that’s why we do it—but it also breaks down the algae and the toxin. To [travel] that 9 miles can take anywhere between three-and-a-half to nine hours to get to the plant, so a lot of that is absorbed onto the carbon.” “Then it gets into the treatment plant and once it’s into the treatment plant, we add limes for softening, we add alum to create a flock to gather up the fine particles and make them into large particles that drop out and the water gets clear so you get rid of all the suspended solids. Then it goes through a whole series of filters—sand filters and things to purify it—then we add chlorine at the end. From there it goes into two 35 million gallon storage tanks, and from that point is where we pick it up with our high service pumps and put it out into the system. “We test all along that route to see where we’re at, what we need to do, what we need to adjust, and it’s really not just a matter of throwing a bunch of chemicals at it. I have a staff of extremely talented, highly trained certified chemists that are constantly doing bench tests, jar tests, with the various concentrations [of chemicals] that we’re using to see what it does to the actual water, because we bring in samples of that water all along the process and they can visually see, ok if we go to this many parts per million it will do this, so they are constantly doing magic to it. They’re good. They do over 4,000 tests a month on the water.”

“The bloom right now isn’t big in terms of spatial coverage, but it is pretty dense in Maumee bay and that area of western Lake Erie,” Justin Chaffin, a senior researcher at The Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, told Circle of Blue. “It is pretty much surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.”

The bloom in that area is very concentrated and thick, he added.

“I’m not sure what levels they were seeing coming in through their pipes, but we were out there sampling on Wednesday and we got Microcystin levels around 10 to 20 parts per billion.”

The acceptable level of Microcystin in drinking water is 1 part per billion, according to the World Health Organization. Typically, the city of Toledo is able to chemically treat their drinking water to bring Microcystin levels below that threshold, even if the intakes receive high levels of the toxin. Chaffin said that there was likely a mixing event—such as a storm or strong wind—that forced the toxic algae, which normally floats on top of the water, down to the bottom where the intakes are located.

The city is now hurrying to test water samples drawn from throughout the treatment and distribution system to track the Microcystin concentrations. Testing a batch of samples takes approximately three to four hours once the test is started, according to Chaffin.

“They are running water samples from hospitals, really from all over Toledo,” he said. “Everyone that does Microcystin sampling in the Toledo area is either sending their [test] kits to the Oregon [Ohio] treatment plant or the city of Toledo’s treatment plant. They are just swamped with samples and they were running out of kits.”

Toledo is also sending water samples to labs in Cincinnati to undergo a more complete analysis. There are approximately 80 different kinds of Microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, Chaffin said. Although all are toxic, their level of toxicity varies. The more extensive tests will help to determine a more accurate level of the toxin in the water.

Algal Blooms a Growing Problem

“Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs.” –Adam Rissien

Ohio Environmental Council

Commonplace in Lake Erie in the 1960s, toxic algal blooms disappeared from the lake following international, national and state efforts to reduce the phosphorus pollution that drives them. The federal Clean Water Act of 1972 was especially important for reducing phosphorus from city sewage plants and other “point” sources that discharged pollutants from a pipe. The CWA, however, did little to address phosphorus runoff from farms and lawns, known as “nonpoint” sources. Researchers have shown that a rise in phosphorus levels—particularly a form of the nutrient that is readily available to promote algae growth—has coincided with renewed blooms in Lake Erie, and international agencies have called for a reduction in phosphorus to alleviate problematic blooms in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. The largest bloom ever recorded on the lake occurred in 2011. Scientists and environmental groups say addressing agriculture is particularly important for reducing the blooms.

“I have every confidence in the water treatment plant to figure out how to make the drinking water safe,” Adam Rissien, director of agricultural and water policy at the Ohio Environmental Council, told Circle of Blue.“Unfortunately, the options available to them are costly and that means a rate increase—there’s no way around it. Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs. And that’s not fair.”

2,2,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,"Yunnan earthquake linked to dam-building, says Chinese geologist - eco-business.com",https://www.eco-business.com/news/yunnan-earthquake-linked-dam-building-says-chinese-geologist/,"Yang Yong is an independent geologist who has rafted the Yangtze and studied Yunnan’s major rivers for 30 years. He believes intensive dam building on the Upper Yangtze is partly behind the 6.5 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 600 people and displaced nearly 300,000 in August.

Other recent quakes are also linked to dam building on the Yangtze’s upper reaches, called the Jinsha, and its tributaries, he argues.

Liu Qin (LQ): What evidence is there linking the Ludian earthquake with hydropower development?



Yang Yong (YY): Currently we just need to take the basic facts seriously – the epicentre of the latest Ludian earthquake was in the Niulan River valley, and the Niulan is a tributary to the Jinsha. It was less than 7 kilometres away from Tianhuaban, the seventh dam in the Niulan cascade and just 10 kilometres from the Xiluodu Dam on the Jinsha, the westernmost tributary to the Yangtze.

The epicentre of the September 2012 Yiliang earthquake was less than 10 kilometres from the Malin Dam on the Luoze River, which was built in 2011; and less than 60 kilometres from the Xiangjiaba Dam on the Jinsha.

The Yongshan earthquake in April 2014 was less than 7 kilometres from the Xiluodu Dam on the Jinsha.

The time and location of these earthquakes link with the times the reservoirs at Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu on the Jinsha, and Tianhuaban on the Niulan, were being filled.

LQ: The Jinsha basin is in China’s most active geological zone, and one of the world’s most active. What are the risks of building huge dams and reservoirs here?



YY: Intensive hydropower here involves two types of geological risk: First, a strong earthquake near these facilities can cause major damage and spark off secondary disasters.

The Jinsha and its tributaries flow through the Sichuan-Yunnan fault zone, with some stretches of the river running parallel to or along the fault lines. The area is one of high mountain valleys, with fragmented geology and many unstable cliffs.

“ Rivers in the region follow the active fault-lines. Inevitability, this means dams will be built on the faults, and those faults cause earthquakes Yang Yong, independent geologist and director of the Hengduan Mountain Research Institute

Second, the region’s complex and active geology means reservoirs behind the dams will spark stronger and more frequent earthquakes.

Recent years have seen a period of geological activity. There would be earthquakes here even if it wasn’t for the dam reservoirs. But, the reservoirs may result in more powerful levels of stress. Scientists still don’t fully understand those processes, and we can’t understand or control them.

Construction plans for hydropower dams in the Hengduan Mountains [on the Yunnan-Sichuan border] have overlooked how rivers can become blocked in such geologically active zones.



Given the history of earthquakes on the Jinsha, and based on my own research, let’s look at what might happen if there was an earthquake of magnitude 7 or 8 on the Jinsha.

Risks include multiple landslides upstream at the Tongjia Gorge, forming two or three barrier lakes. Hillsides on the Batang-Benzilan River stretch could collapse, making many old landslide sites active again and forming a string of barrier lakes. The generators and transmission equipment of hydropower plants would be badly damaged.

The river would be blocked again at Tiger Leaping Gorge due to landslides, with transmission equipment at Ahai and Ludila badly damaged.

There may be further landslides at Wudongde downstream, with old landslide sites further downstream becoming active again. Blockages could cause river water to back up towards the dam, with generating equipment and buildings badly damaged by landslides.

There could also be a number of landslides at Xiluodu, with the dam severely tested by uncontrolled releases of water from other dams and barrier lakes.

LQ: Under what conditions does hydropower development give rise to earthquakes?



YY: It depends on the geology of the reservoir area, how those structures formed, the size of the reservoir, and how it is operated.

A global analysis of almost 2,000 reservoir earthquakes showed that the depth and capacity of reservoirs plays a clear role in the physical processes that cause earthquakes. The direct stress caused by the weight of the reservoir is nowhere near enough to affect intact rock. But if the rock is not intact and cracks form, and if the pressure of water forced into those cracks is high enough, the shearing stress and water pressure can contribute directly to earthquakes.

It’s like a balloon that remains stable, or slowly deflates, when there are no external pressures. But when there is external pressure, such as from a needle, it suddenly bursts. Reservoir earthquakes are like that needle. You can’t assume all reservoir earthquakes will be small.

There are no cases of a reservoir causing a magnitude 7 or above earthquake. But there have never been so many dams built in such a geologically stressed region.

Rivers in the region follow the active fault-lines. Inevitability, this means dams will be built on the faults, and those faults cause earthquakes.

As the rivers in the Hengduan mountains are largely seasonal, their reservoir water levels are frequently changing to absorb floodwaters or alleviate dry periods. These rapid changes can affect stability of the sides of the reservoir, and may cause stresses that trigger earthquakes.

LQ: There is no sign of hydropower development slowing in the south-west and on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Is hydropower the best way to solve China’s power shortages?



YY: At the end of 2012 China had installed 1,060 gigawatts of electric generating capacity – overtaking the US to become the world’s largest power generator. But China’s GDP is only about 30 per cent of that in the US, meaning that China consumes much more power per unit of GDP. China’s GDP energy intensity is 7.5 times that of Japan, 5.5 times Germany, 4.4 times the US, 3.5 times Australia and even 2.5 times that of Brazil.

This means that deeper reform and structural adjustments, as well as eliminating inefficient production, will allow China to develop on its existing power capacity for some time. Hydropower development on the Jinsha and in the south-west in general can slow down, to allow time for further research and planning, which in turn will mean we can avoid unnecessary risks.

3,3,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Six ways to save water in your garden - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/22/six-ways-to-save-water-in-your-garden,"

It’s important to save water in the garden for two reasons. First, to save money if you’re on a water meter – 40% of us, and rising, are. Second, because at peak demand up to 70% of our water supply can be used in gardens, which forces suppliers to use groundwater and take it from streams. This can cause environmental damage and increase water prices. Here are six ways to minimise your use of water in the garden.

1. Look after your soil

Adding organic matter to the soil improves its structure, which helps it to retain moisture.

Mulching flowerbeds, and around the base of shrubs and trees in spring, prevents moisture from evaporating during dry spells.

Mulching the surface of hanging baskets traps moisture.

Add water-retentive granules or gel to compost, or use compost with them already mixed in, to use in hanging baskets and containers.



2. Water at the right time

Many of us over-water our gardens. This is not only wasteful, it means we’re doing more work than we need to. To check if you need to water or not, look at the soil about a spade-deep down. If it’s damp, it’s fine; if it’s dry, it’s time to water. If you have clay soil, it might feel damp whether it’s irrigated or not and sandy soil can feel dry, even if it has water in it. If this is the case, watch your plants and when they start to show signs of water stress – when leaves change position or get darker – note how the soil looks and feels. This way you can get more of an idea of what your soil is like when it has too little water.

Watering the garden before a drought sets in keeps the soil’s moisture levels up and helps prevent a water deficit. You should also water plants in the evening when it’s cooler, to reduce evaporation.

3. Use the right amount of water

This depends on the soil type. Light sandy soils need watering more often than heavy soils. Clay-based soils can be watered less frequently, but need more water. The Royal Horticultural Society’s rule of thumb is that for plants to keep growing, up to 24 litres per sq metre (5.2 gallons per 10 sq ft) every seven to 10 days is sufficient. That’s about two and a half 10 litre watering cans worth per sq metre.

4. Plant flowers that need less water

Some plants need less water than others to grow; lavender, palms, mimosa and verbena, to name a few. For more ideas, see this list on the Royal Horticultural Society website. This interactive guide to drought-resistant plants for the garden is useful, too. For a more in-depth look at low-water gardens, look at this guide. It covers everything from design and plant selection to irrigation systems and rainwater collections.

5. Use the best watering techniques for your plants

Sprinklers: best used to water the lawn and soak unplanted areas, sprinklers have great coverage but you can’t target specific sections of your garden with them.

Hoses and watering cans: labour intensive but precise, use these to water around plant bases beneath the leaves, and leave the surrounding soil dry. This limits weed growth and means all the water goes where it is needed.

Seep hoses: these allow water to seep out of holes in the hose. They can be buried under soil or mulch, which avoids evaporation. They allow you to water established plants in rows, but are best used on heavy soil as water spreads further sideways, covering more than it would on lighter soils.

Automated irrigation systems: these allow water to drip or trickle into growing areas whenever you programme them to do so. They save time and effort, but they are the most expensive option. Make sure you take hot and dry weather into account when you programme your system.



6. Collect rainwater and reuse old water

Even if you live in a dry part of the UK, you could collect 24,000 litres (5,280 gallons or 150 water butts) of rainwater from your roof each year. Obviously, not many people can store that much water, but if every household in the country collected even just one water butt’s worth of water a year (160 litres), that’s four billion litres of free water that we all could be using on our gardens.

It’s simple to collect rainwater: just divert the water from your drainpipe into a water butt or a wheelie bin, using this clever bit of kit.

Reusing grey water (water from baths, showers, washing machines and washing up) is a good way to use water a second time. You can buy greywater diverters that divert the water from your bath to an irrigation system or a water butt.

Household soaps and detergents are harmless to plants, but don’t use water containing bleach, disinfectant, dishwasher salt or stronger cleaners, which can harm plants, damage soil structure and could be a health risk.

Demei's View - Wine Communication from a Chinese Winemaker

There had to be a reason for me to enter the wine world. Thinking about it, it was autumn in 1997, and I was on my way to visit a friend in north California. I lost my direction and drove into a cluster of colourful bushes sitting among the limitless hills, and I was impressed by spectacular scenery.

I didn’t realise what it was until I stopped. It was, as my fellow traveller said, a plot of vineyard that had just been harvested. That was the first time I’d stood in front of such a large area of vines, and left me with very beautiful memories. Later, when I had an opportunity to learn about winemaking, I started without hesitation.

So the accident of entering into a vineyard in north California was the catalyst that drove me into the wine industry. California is the field of dreams in the New World, and because of the particular synergy with San Francisco by Chinese people, Californian wine is getting more favour in the Chinese wine scene. Some investors even come here proactively for business opportunities. So, when I chose California as my summer holiday destination this year, I decided to revisit north California.

After leaving San Francisco and driving through the Golden Gate Bridge, I turned onto the highway in the Sonoma-Napa direction at Petaluma. This time I was very clear about my destination and had a GPS in hand, so I wouldn’t get lost again.

The grapes were at the end of veraison, and were still quite far from being harvested, so there was still an eyeful of green in the vineyard – though it looked a bit gray-ish due to a lack of water. On one hand, wine growers would practise water stress during the ripening season; on the other hand, there was less natural rainfall this year.

A friend (who is currently traveling and studying in Napa) and I successively arrived at a small winery in Atlas Peak around lunch time. The winery was nearly at the end of the road. The quietness of this place made me feel a little nervous as I had just left downtown.

Image 3: 4088 cellar © LI Demei

The winery, established in 1995, was located on a hill that was 550 metres above the sea level. Within the 6 ha area was 2 ha of vineyards, planting Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and producing 500 boxes of wines every year. The cellar was in a cave dug at the hillside, and was opposite a residence that occupied nearly 200 m2, which was my accommodation at night. (Image 1, 2, 3)

The name of the winery is 4088, because its address is 4088 Atlas Peak Road. It was bought by a group of Chinese joint-investors in 2012 and changed to this straightforward name, which is easier to be spread in the Chinese market.

‘If you were in China, you might receive a notification after a few years telling you that the number of your property has been changed…’ I joked with Julie, the owner of the estate.

Julie studied engineering at university and came to the US for a marketing course, then settled in the country. She fell in love with wine during her time here. Whilst enjoying wines by herself, she was thinking about ways of making her own wine to share with friends.

In the magic country of America, there will always be an opportunity to succeed for those people who have an idea.

She purchased this winery with some friends in 2012. Not just the building, the vineyard and the cellar, but also the 2010 and 2011 vintages of bottled wines lying in the cellar. The first vintage of this estate was 2003; although the altitude is a little too high in this area and the temperature is a bit low, with intensive cultivation the grape ripeness is quite satisfying, and the 2009 vintage even scored 95 points in Wine Spectator.

There was a pond above the winery for angling; under the tall walnut tree was the home of the voles; in the vineyard, there were some hard-working turkeys anticipating the grape harvest (Image 4) … such a paradise!

Chinese culture is affected profoundly by the agricultural civilisation, so every Chinese person would more or less embrace a dream of having his or her own farming land. However, living in China with the same fondness of wine and the same dream of making her own wine, Chen Lizhong has fought on the Gobi Desert in Xinjiang for five years to see her winery Skyline of Gobi Vineyards finally being built.

It is difficult for one to understand how hard it was without being in the situation. She didn’t just explore the best way of viticulture all by herself, but even independently invented the agricultural implements. (Image 5)

Different from her situation, Julie can work with a professional technical service team, outsource the vineyard management and winemaking to the experts, and take care of the branding and marketing as the owner.

Many successful people got into winemaking out of their love of wine, and further led people around them to join the ever-growing group of wine consumers. This is a motivation for the expansion of the Chinese wine consuming market.

5,5,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Intelligence Gap: How a Chinese National Gained Access to Arizona's Terror Center - ProPublica,https://www.propublica.org/article/lizhong-fan,"Lizhong Fan’s desk was among a crowd of cubicles at the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center in Phoenix. For five months in 2007, the Chinese national and computer programmer opened his laptop and enjoyed access to a wide range of sensitive information, including the Arizona driver’s license database, other law enforcement databases, and potentially a roster of intelligence analysts and investigators.

The facility had been set up by state and local authorities in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, and so, out of concerns about security, Fan had been assigned a team of minders to watch him nearly every moment inside the center. Fan, hired as a contract employee specializing in facial recognition technology, was even accompanied to the bathroom.

However, no one stood in Fan’s way when he packed his equipment one day in early June 2007, then returned home to Beijing.

There’s a lot that remains mysterious about Fan’s brief tenure as a computer programmer at the Arizona counterterrorism center. No one has explained why Arizona law enforcement officials gave a Chinese national access to such protected information. Nor has anyone said whether Fan copied any of the potentially sensitive materials he had access to.

But the people responsible for hiring Fan say one thing is clear: The privacy of as many as 5 million Arizona residents and other citizens has been exposed. Fan, they said, was authorized to use the state’s driver’s license database as part of his work on a facial recognition technology. He often took that material home, and they fear he took it back to China.

Under Arizona law, then-Gov. Janet Napolitano and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose agencies admitted Fan into the intelligence center, were required to disclose to the public any “unauthorized acquisition and access to unencrypted or unredacted computerized data” that includes names and other personal information.

To this day, they have not.

Terry Goddard, attorney general of Arizona in 2007, said Fan’s access and disappearance should have been reported to his office, but it was not. Arizona law puts the attorney general in charge of enforcing disclosure.

The state was supposed to have scrubbed drivers' names and addresses from the license data. State officials denied requests to discuss the extent of the data breach, including what personal information was in the files.

In fact, a review of records shows that David Hendershott, who was second-in-command at the sheriff’s office, moved aggressively to maintain silence, a silence that has now lasted some seven years. Two weeks after Fan departed, Hendershott directed others in writing not to discuss Fan and the possible breach. In an email to the outside contractor that had hired Fan, Hendershott wrote: “Keep this between us and only us.”

Even among administrators at the Phoenix center, very few learned that the Chinese programmer had left the country or that their own personal information might have traveled with him. Mikel Longman, the former criminal investigations chief at the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said he received no warning about the incident.

“That really is outrageous,” Longman said. “Every Arizona resident who had a driver’s license or state-issued ID card and all that identifying stuff is potentially compromised. That’s a huge breach.”

Napolitano, who went on to serve as President Barack Obama’s secretary of Homeland Security, did not reply to multiple interview requests.

Hendershott, Arpaio’s longtime chief deputy, hung up on a reporter when reached by telephone. The sheriff’s office fired Hendershott in 2011 over an array of alleged misconduct. And he in turn filed suit in 2012, saying his legitimate law enforcement work had been mischaracterized as abuses of power. His suit was dismissed earlier this year. Today, he sells real estate in west Phoenix.

Col. Robert Halliday, the director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety who formally oversaw the operations of the intelligence center at the time Fan worked there, also did not respond to repeated interview requests.

Current officials with a handful of agencies involved with the intelligence center offered a variety of reasons for declining to answer questions about Fan and the possible breach.

The public safety agency initially denied that any potential breach had happened, then said the matter was the subject of a confidential FBI investigation. Later still, the department argued the case was a personnel matter, and thus the agency would not comment as a matter of policy. The sheriff’s office said that during the time that Hendershott was still working for the agency, he never reported anything about Fan – his hiring, his work or his flight.

Seven years after the potential breach, then, it is still unclear how closely law enforcement looked into the incident or what steps, if any, it took as a result. The FBI opened a probe shortly after Fan’s disappearance, according to records and a former federal investigator, but the bureau has never made its findings public.

Perryn Collier, spokesman for the FBI’s Phoenix office, said the bureau won’t comment on investigations involving Fan.

Chinese espionage has made news in recent months as federal investigators have revealed successful assaults by hackers against businesses and government. Last March, homeland security officials in Washington discovered that cyber attackers later traced to China had accessed data on federal workers who’ve applied for top-secret clearance. These electronic break-ins were conducted remotely, continents away from the servers holding the data.

How the Phoenix intelligence center found itself vulnerable to a serious security breach, however, was neither much of a technological feat nor, it seems, the result of masterful espionage. Indeed, an investigation by The Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica – built on more than 50 interviews and the examination of thousands of pages of federal investigative reports, criminal and civil court filings, internal correspondence and immigration records – shows the episode at the intelligence center came off rather easily.

John Lewis arrived as the FBI’s special agent in charge of the Phoenix division in the spring of 2006. Lewis, now director of security for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the San Francisco Bay Area, had a vague recollection of a contractor or subcontractor working at the center. But he said he did not specifically recall that the person was a foreign national, nor did he have any “immediate recollection” of a security breach.

“No one ever sat in my office and asked about having a foreign national inside the fusion center. That’s nuts,” Lewis said, adding that if he had been asked, his response would have been, “Can we do a little bit better guys?”

The chance that Fan made off with a raft of sensitive material was made possible by a set of cozy relationships – among a tainted sheriff’s official, a dubious technology startup company and a woman who U.S. government officials think is a Chinese spy.

That really is outrageous. Every Arizona resident who had a driver’s license or state-issued ID card and all that identifying stuff is potentially compromised. Mikel Longman

Intelligence center employees are supposed to hold a “secret,” or midlevel, security clearance, based on a background investigation completed most often by the federal Office of Personnel Management. Aside from cursory background checks as part of his visa application, it’s unclear if Fan underwent deeper probing. The company that hired him also received little to no extra scrutiny.

Paul Haney, a former special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who was based at the Phoenix center, said discussion of the possible breach was kept to whispers. That reticence came as much from humiliation as security concerns.

“The whole thing was very embarrassing, what he had access to,” Haney said. “I’m embarrassed for everyone left with their asses hanging out.”

A New Idea to Prevent Terrorism

After the 9/11 hijackers crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, law enforcement officials decided that local police and federal intelligence agencies should improve how they shared information. The hope was that greater coordination among various levels of law enforcement would increase the chance that future attacks could be avoided.

In Arizona, Norman Beasley, a top executive at the Department of Public Safety, and his friend, Ray Churay, an FBI agent working anti-terror cases, came up with the concept of a physical space where all manner of law enforcement agencies could work side by side. The U.S. intelligence community was initially skeptical that local police had much to offer.

“We did not get a lot of support from the beltway, because we were some old country boys from out here in Arizona,” Beasley said.

But Napolitano, as governor, personally lobbied for federal dollars and FBI involvement, and in October 2004, the state opened its intelligence facility, one of the first “fusion centers” in the country.

The center won early praise for how smoothly it distributed raw intelligence across agencies. The Washington Post described Phoenix’s operation in 2006 as “one of the best-run and most effective” intelligence facilities in the U.S.

Arizona’s public safety department runs the center, but more than 20 police agencies statewide deploy some 200 personnel there. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office has been involved from the center’s inception, and Arpaio, the legendary anti-immigrant crusader, eventually sought a major role in its operations.

It was Hummingbird Defense Systems, a small Phoenix firm striving to break into the security technology market, that offered the opportunity. Hendershott, Arpaio’s chief deputy, had years before become friends with Steve Greschner, Hummingbird’s chief executive.

In fact, Hendershott first hired Hummingbird in 2003 to use its facial recognition software to watch for sex offenders at a Phoenix elementary school. The sheriff’s office installed it soon after at its outdoor jail, famously known as Tent City. The fact that the technology flopped – one report by jail officials said a day’s growth of a beard defeated its ability to accurately identify prisoners – didn’t deter Arpaio’s office, in the person of Hendershott, from encouraging Napolitano to put Hummingbird’s technology to work at the intelligence center.

A Novel Foray into National Security, With Help from China

Greschner, now 60, acknowledges he was an unlikely candidate to get involved in sensitive law enforcement workbefore he started Hummingbird. He had worked for Cisco Systems selling servers and other networking equipment to government agencies in and around Phoenix, including the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.

He was a talented salesman and became a millionaire when Cisco’s share value soared dramatically in the late 1990s, earning $1.4 million the year before he left the company. For the first six months after he quit Cisco, he tried his hand learning to be a cattle-roping cowboy, he said.

After retiring from Cisco in 2000, Greschner poured his money into new ventures. He spent more than $300,000 on a license for software developed by a government scientist for the Sandia National Laboratories and other sensitive sites. The “command-and-control” program makes disparate technologies operate in sync. And when Greschner established Hummingbird Communications in 2001, government records show, his ambitions were limited to selling telecommunications networks.

Greschner said it was the 9/11 terror attacks that stirred his patriotism, and with it a desire to enter the national security business. Technologies capable of identifying people faster and more reliably than the human brain were in great demand but in short supply.

And so he formed a second company called Hummingbird Defense Systems, though internal business records, interviews and correspondence make clear that the firm’s technical capabilities were lacking.

The company didn’t employ a single engineer; Hummingbird relied instead on outside contractors to make its products function.

Greschner himself was not a programmer. Before entering the field, Greschner said he “had no idea what a biometric was.”

“He had the razzle-dazzle and used everyone else’s technology,” said Rob Schorr, a former sales executive for another security firm who briefly partnered with Hummingbird on airport checkpoint systems.

Greschner struck deals with other technology companies that had written algorithms to recognize facial features in still images. The software that Hummingbird ultimately used came from a Canadian firm, Acsys Biometrics. Tests by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology obtained by CIR and ProPublica found that Acsys’ program ranked far behind several competitors.

Hummingbird thus struggled to get government work. One project it later won, to install security equipment at a tiny Nevada airport, ended in litigation when the system didn’t work.

The company had few prospects until late 2002, when Greschner partnered with a man named Gang Chen.

Chen had emigrated from China almost a decade earlier and had a green card. He’d owned an interior design company in Beijing and, in an interview last year, said he had financial backing from Jilin Province Trust, a state-owned investment firm in northern China, to get into the U.S. technology market.

To Greschner, Chen introduced himself as a Chinese businessman looking to sell U.S. security software in China. Chen said he was authorized to distribute technology developed at the China Institute of Atomic Energy internationally.

He proposed a partnership between his company, Detaq Science, and Hummingbird. The deal was sealed when Chen sent his business partner, a tall and strikingly beautiful woman named Xunmei Li, better known as Grace, to meet Greschner.

“Some people call that love at first sight,” Greschner said in an interview. “I’m not going to say it’s that.”

He and Li began dating immediately.

Working with Li and Chen, Hummingbird’s outlook brightened. Li, a now 44-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen raised in Shanghai, turned out to possess impressive ties to Chinese law enforcement.

Li and Chen soon secured Greschner a meeting with Chinese officials in London, and in time, according to Greschner and others with knowledge of the deal, he sold his fledgling facial recognition program to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, which installed it in Tiananmen Square.

“Suddenly the doors were opening” for Hummingbird, said David Edger, former associate deputy director for the National Clandestine Service, an arm of the CIA, and a past business partner of Greschner’s.

Greschner connected Hendershott, his benefactor at the sheriff’s office, with his newfound associates in China. In fall 2006, Hendershott took the first of several trips to Beijing with Greschner, Li and Chen.

At the time of that trip, Napolitano had just agreed to have the sheriff’s office facial recognition system deployed at the Phoenix intelligence center. Greschner said he offered to donate his technology, and the sheriff’s office – with no solicitation of other bids – agreed, offering to pay Hummingbird for maintaining the software program over the years. County finance records, obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and shared with reporters, show the sheriff’s office paid Hummingbird roughly $16,000 for fiscal year 2009.

Sheriff’s officials said Hendershott struck the terms of the deal on his own, without the involvement or approval of the office’s procurement officials.

It turned out, though, that Greschner had already ceded significant control over Hummingbird’s inner workings to Detaq, his business partner and liaison to China. In a February 2003 letter to Greschner, Chen stipulated that, going forward, he and Li would get a say in which engineers Hummingbird could hire.

Detaq was responsible for “necessary technology people,” Chen wrote. “You and Detaq will determine who the good candidates are for the installation and tuning of the system.”

Bringing the facial recognition system online at the intelligence center was the most daunting project Hummingbird had undertaken. It would require an expert programmer. Li told Greschner she knew the ideal engineer: Lizhong “Larry” Fan.

A Member of the Club

In his Chinese passport photo, Fan appears young enough to be a teenager, with a thin frame and black hair cropped short. He arrived in Phoenix in January 2007, a 32-year-old from Zhengzhou, a metropolis of more than 4 million people in central China.

Fan, who had a diploma showing he’d earned degrees in computer engineering from the elite Tsinghua University in Beijing, had done some work for Chen and Li in China, and Greschner said he accepted his lover’s idea that Fan would be a good man for getting the facial recognition program up and running at the intelligence center.

As a result, Hummingbird, without vetting Fan further, sought his work visa, Greschner said, adding that he assumed law enforcement or other government officials took a closer look at the Chinese national. Greschner said he was asked by an official with the sheriff’s department in 2006 to provide a numeric code for Fan’s name, often used in investigations to pinpoint Chinese identity, which he did. In the application, Greschner said that Fan possessed skills not readily available in the U.S.

The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office endorsed Fan as well. In a September 2006 letter to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a senior sheriff’s official wrote that Fan already “demonstrated an extensive knowledge of the esoteric science” that converts human faces into data points. Such knowledge “appears to be” scarce.

Officials at the intelligence center discussed the wisdom of hiring a Chinese national for such sensitive work, according to Beasley, the counterterrorism director for the state’s public safety department. Beasley said he opposed it without success.

“Was there a concern? Absolutely,” Beasley said, “because China is not our friend.”

Cindy Bonomolo was the sheriff’s deputy most often assigned to monitor Fan inside the intelligence center.

“I was told he did the facial recognition for Tiananmen Square,” Bonomolo said in a June interview. “They said he was the best of the best. I have to say, this man was a genius.”

Greschner said Fan looked quite at home in the center.

“It was like ‘I was a member of the club’ – you know what I mean?” Greschner said of Fan.

Bonomolo’s ability to judge Fan’s talent or oversee the integrity of his daily work in the intelligence center was not great. She’d chiefly served as a patrol or corrections officer within the sheriff’s office. In an interview, she said she has no knowledge of computer science. Bonomolo said she had no reason to distrust Fan, and the two became close over discussions about her Christian faith. Fan became a Christian while in the U.S., she said.

Much of Fan’s job involved moving terabytes of data to servers. There were driver’s license records from the state, arrest files from county jails and criminal history data that had to be uploaded. Next, Hummingbird needed Fan to edit the facial recognition software so that it could reliably search all those different databases.

Fan had access to the center’s main network, according to three sources with first-hand knowledge of Fan’s work arrangements. From there, he would have been able to see the directory of federal agents and state police working at the Arizona counterterrorism center, said Haney, the retired immigration agent.

Thus, day after day, Fan enjoyed the rarest of access to confidential personal and investigative files.

Then, on the first Tuesday of June 2007, according to a former law enforcement official, Fan paid cash for airfare to Beijing at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport ticket counter. Fan’s luggage, Greschner and Li said, carried two laptops and additional hard drives.

Greschner said he and Li were out of town and unaware of what happened until days later. Greschner made his way to Fan’s rental home and powered on the Hummingbird computers that Fan had left behind. The drives were so thoroughly erased Greschner said he had to reinstall their operating systems.

Li attempted to contact Fan, to no avail.

However, Bonomolo exchanged occasional emails with Fan until losing touch in 2010. Fan’s first email to her from China alleged that Hummingbird regularly failed to pay his salary, so he felt justified taking the firm’s source code.

“The whole event has had great impact on my family and my career, and we have been under gross pressure,” Fan wrote in a December 2007 email. The messages contain few other specifics about his work at the intelligence center. He told Bonomolo that his wife gave birth to a son and that he considered returning to the U.S.

“I do think about go (sic) back to the U.S. in a few years,” he wrote in his last message in November 2010, “and I’d like you to teach me how to shoot.”

No one has reported hearing from Fan in more than three years.

A Lack of Disclosure and Consequences

What exactly happened after Fan’s departure remains the least clear aspect of the entire episode. Some officials within the intelligence center became aware of his absence, and at least one expressed worry about its potential implications. Halliday, who ran the center at the time, called one of the center’s initial founders, Beasley.

“I’d say he was concerned and rightfully so,” Beasley said of Halliday.

For his part, Hendershott, the No. 2 man at the sheriff’s office, was concerned about keeping the potential embarrassment from becoming public, according to documents. One email exchange shows that Hendershott contemplated reaching Fan in China and paying him to stay quiet.

“Make sure that he knows that I just want your stuff and no trouble,” Hendershott wrote to Greschner, the Hummingbird executive who had hired Fan. “Just want him to go away. Can he and his wife keep their mouth shut?”

Over the years, there has been an array of breaches involving government agencies and people’s personal information. Typically, they have resulted in substantive investigations and notification of the public. Recently, for instance, The Washington Post reported that a “major U.S. contractor that conducts background checks for the Department of Homeland Security has suffered a computer breach that probably resulted in the theft of employees' personal information.” The company, U.S. Investigations Services, said in a statement that the intrusion “has all the markings of a state-sponsored attack.”

The company did an internal examination to confirm the breach. The company notified the Department of Homeland Security, and the agency initiated its own investigation. As well, Homeland Security and the company alerted the affected people and disclosed the breach to the public.

In Arizona, no one will say if anything like that kind of effort was undertaken after Fan returned to China.

CIR and ProPublica, however, have learned that both the FBI and federal immigration authorities began to investigate Fan’s two Chinese associates – Li and Chen.

Paul Haney, the former Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, said the FBI strongly suspects Li is a spy. The suspicions, according to Haney and others interviewed during the investigation, grow out of Li’s contacts with powerful people and institutions in China, and her efforts to help bring American security technology to her native country. As well, a delegation of Chinese airport officials organized by Li, which came to the U.S. to tour security facilities, included at least two people who were, in fact, not airport officials.

“If she is who we think she is,” Haney said, “she’s a professional.”

Paul Moore, a former top FBI Chinese counterintelligence analyst, said cultural differences between the West and East pose challenges for investigators trying to determine if Chinese are involved in intelligence operations.

“Was this a Chinese intelligence operation, or just something that came in over the transom?” he said. “It sounds like Chinese people acting like Chinese people. It looks foreign to us — and suspect.”

The authorities have never charged either Li or Chen with espionage, and in interviews both have denied the assertion. The authorities, however, did successfully detain and then deport Chen on immigration fraud charges, claiming he had set up a fake business in the U.S. as a way of obtaining a green card. And they are using an unusual charge in seeking to strip Li of her American citizenship and send her back to China: bigamy. The government has claimed in court documents that Li was married to more than one man at the same time during her time in the U.S. Li is contesting the charge, and she insists one of the marriages amounted to a mock ceremony meant to appease her partner’s parents.

“I’m not a spy, so I can’t tell you why they suspect me,” Li said.

Li, in fact, offers her own theory for why the government is eager to deport her: She has knowledge of the possible security breach in Arizona.

“It could be a very big embarrassment to the governor (Napolitano) and to the sheriff’s office as well,” she said.

Greschner and Li no longer live together but remain a couple.

Napolitano is now president of the University of California system. Arpaio remains an outsize and divisive figure in Arizona. As for Hummingbird, it appears to have lost several contracts with Homeland Security after Fan’s departure. But it did, for two years after the episode, continue its dealings with the sheriff’s office.

That finally ended in 2009, when the company folded.

Michelle Van Cleave, a U.S. national counterintelligence executive under President George W. Bush, said under no circumstances should a foreign national from any country, let alone from China, be allowed inside an intelligence facility. The risks of information being compromised are too great, she said.

Of the saga of Fan and the Arizona intelligence center, she said: “It’s just stunning.”","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.propublica.org/images/social/china-spy-fb-1200x630.png,"['sheriffs', 'office', 'national', 'access', 'li', 'terror', 'gap', 'hummingbird', 'arizonas', 'propublica', 'gained', 'greschner', 'center', 'fan', 'chinese', 'security', 'intelligence']", ,none
6,6,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Climate change and drought in ancient times - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140811151549.htm,"The influence of climate on agriculture is believed to be a key factor in the rise and fall of societies in the Ancient Near East. Dr. Simone Riehl of Tübingen University's Institute for Archaeological Science and the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment has headed an investigation into archaeological finds of grain in order to find out what influence climate had on agriculture in early farming societies. Her findings are published in this week's PNAS -- Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

She and her team analyzed grains of barley up to 12,000 years old from 33 locations across the Fertile Crescent to ascertain if they had had enough water while growing and ripening. Riehl found that periods of drought had had noticeable and widely differing effects on agriculture and societies in the Ancient Near East, with settlements finding a variety of ways to deal with the problem.

The 1,037 ancient samples were between 12,000 and 2,500 years old. They were compared with modern samples from 13 locations in the former Fertile Crescent. Dr. Riehl and her team measured the grains' content of two stable carbon isotopes. When barley grass gets insufficient water while growing, the proportion of heavier carbon isotopes deposited in its cells will be higher than normal. The two isotopes 12C und 13C remain stable for thousands of years and can be measured precisely -- giving Simone Riehl and her colleagues reliable information on the availability of water while the plants were growing.

They found that many settlements were affected by drought linked to major climate fluctuations. ""Geographic factors and technologies introduced by humans played a big role and influenced societies' options for development as well as their particular ways of dealing with drought,"" says Riehl. Her findings indicate that harvests in coastal regions of the northern Levant were little affected by drought; but further inland, drought lead to the need for irrigation or, in extreme cases, abandonment of the settlement.

The findings give archaeologists clues as to how early agricultural societies dealt with climate fluctuations and differing local environments. ""They can also help evaluate current conditions in regions with a high risk of crop failures,"" Riehl adds. The study is part of a German Research Foundation-backed project looking into the conditions under which Ancient Near Eastern societies rose and fell.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['change', 'isotopes', 'near', 'agriculture', 'water', 'ancient', 'drought', 'societies', 'times', 'climate', 'findings', 'riehl']", ,drought

Bellmunt del Priorat in northwest Spain, where prospects for harvest are looking good

Harvest in Europe is underway in some regions, but after a difficult summer, quality and quantity are both in question.

With vintage kicking off across Europe, growers are looking anxiously at the skies in case Mother Nature has any more nasty surprises in store.

Bad weather has affected France, Italy, Portugal and Germany during the growing season, but a recent run of warm, sunny weather has growers cautiously optimistic.

In Germany’s Rheinhessen, picking of the earlier-maturing varieties such as Solaris began on August 8, 20 days earlier than last year. Ernst Büscher of the German Wine Institute (DWI) in Mainz said the early ripening was a silver lining to a season that ""had no real summer"".

Growers were picking in Pfalz and Baden as well, with predictions of a good harvest if the sun comes out.

In Spain, the early varieties are already being picked and the forecast is for a good-quality harvest of normal proportions. Priorat’s Toni Alcover said production this year would be 10 percent higher than in 2013, with quality looking promising.

""The humidity recorded so far this summer and the contrast between day and night temperatures will result in more aromatic wines,"" he said. ""Everything depends on the expression vintners want to give their wines.""

In Penedès, growers have already started picking Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, while indigenous Cava varieties like Xarel-lo will commence next week. Jane Ventura of Bodegas Augustus was expecting a high-quality crop because of the slow maturation period.

Forecasts from Castilla-La Mancha, Valdepeñas and Cataluñya were also positive.

The Portuguese summer has also had issues, with the Douro enduring wet weather and mildew. It was an unusual year for the region, with some areas picking earlier than last year and others yet to start.

Carlos Pereira, head of viticulture at the Regional Directorate for Agriculture and Fisheries of the North (DRAPN), said the ""vineyards in the Douro this year have been a little hectic.""

Winemaker Gabriela Canossa, from Quinta Maria Izabel, said vineyards had been treated for mildew and she was now just waiting for the grapes to ripen. ""The next 15 days will dictate everything,"" she said.

However, the rain had its advantages for the dryer areas of the Douro, which won’t suffer so much water stress. According to Pereira, that may translate into a great harvest.

Vinho Verde producers are still waiting to see how the harvest will go, with late rain causing worries about disease.

Grower John Garrido said it was too early to tell what effect the rain and cooler weather would have.

""The lack of heat may delay development of the grapes, but it can be offset if now we get some hot days. Then we will be picking at the normal time and looking at a good-quality grape harvest,"" he said.

Several important regions on both sides of the Alps in Italy and France were plagued with cool and very rainy weather in July, delaying harvest and causing concerns about quality.","Thu, 21 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/43/96/Priorat-vineyards-and-village-10004396.jpg,"['lap', 'european', 'varieties', 'harvest', 'quality', 'summer', 'wine', 'picking', 'weather', 'looking', 'early', 'growers', 'gods', 'rain']", ,none
8,8,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Human hair exports big business in rural Chinese county - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/human-hair-exports-big-business-in-rural-chinese-county-1.1964078,"(TAIHE, China-AFP) - Long, black and lucrative: sacks bulging with human hair spill onto the streets of a rural county whose farmers have helped make China the world's biggest exporter of products made from the material.

As dawn broke over the morning market in Taihe, vendors bringing hairy wares from across China haggled with dozens of buyers, and tempers frayed.

""We have to bargain for hair,"" said buyer Liu Yanwen, 35, who sported a buzzcut and arrived at the market at 5:30 a.m. in search of deals.

""We have a factory where we'll turn it into products for export overseas,"" he added, clutching a head's worth of straight, thick black locks.

Gao Pu, a vendor whose head was also shaved, opened a knapsack containing dozens of bunches of hair onto the ground and declared: ""It comes from the heads of ordinary Chinese folks.""

Prices can go as high as 5,400 yuan ($880) per kilogram for cuts of 20 inches.

Taihe, in the eastern province of Anhui, is home to more than 400 companies processing human hair into an array of curly extensions, wigs and other products which end up on heads in the United States, Europe and Africa.

Fu Quanguo, 64, pioneered the trade in the 1970s and now sports a crop of white hair. ""We used to collect the human hair locally,"" he said. ""But now it comes from all kinds of countries, Myanmar, Vietnam, countries like that.

""In the past making hair products was tough, and we did it all by hand... Now we've gone from small to big and are selling internationally.""

China exported nearly 75 percent of the world's ""bird skin, feathers, artificial flowers, human hair"" products, in 2012, according to the World Trade Organization's International Trade Centre.

The humble hair markets, ramshackle workshops and factories dotting the cornfields of Taihe generated $88 million of exports in 2012, nearly half the county's total, according to the local government.

It is one of many ""industrial clusters"" -- areas specialising in a single kind of product, which have sprung up in recent decades as China's export economy has boomed.

They are especially common in the country's east, where poverty-stricken farmers have pioneered small businesses since the 1980s, and now entire areas are dedicated to creating lightbulbs, socks, cigarette lighters or bra hooks.

Hair today, gold tomorrow

Fu's heir, his 36-year-old son Fu Qianwei, has a company with the English name Anna and export sales of $8 million a year, mostly to the US.

""Each country has different demands on length, thickness and quality,"" the closely-cropped Fu said, as workers sewed and curled clumps of hair destined for Africa -- often seen as primarily a source of raw materials for China, but which also buys its finished goods.

""As Africa's economy grows, the market is growing and moving towards higher quality,"" he said, standing beside boxes filled with ""Afro Curly"" extensions, featuring illustrations of smiling black female models.

In the factory, the hair is first disinfected in two huge barrels, before workers use paddles to stir clumps of strands in vats of steaming water.

It is dyed in colours from blonde to black -- via red and purple -- before being dried in ovens, brushed and sewn into hair extensions by the mostly female staff.

""I thread parts together, in a day I can do 1,500,"" said Zhang Qing, 23, as she fed bunches of hair into a clattering sewing machine.

Zhang Hongmei's low stool was surrounded by piles of dyed red hair which she straightened with a large brush.

Like most in the factory, she used to be a labourer in the fields. ""If I wasn't here I'd be working on the farm, but this work is less tiring and earns more money,"" she said.

Hair product manufacturing is ""by far the biggest industry"" in Taihe, says the younger Fu, and now local authorities plan to create a huge industrial park devoted entirely to the sector.

Fu recalls growing up in the 1980s, ""when we would be happy if we had rice rather than corn"".

Now he employs more than 200 full-time staff and escorts foreign clients to dinners at pricey local restaurants in an imported car.

""I owe my income to the hair industry,"" he said. ""Because the value of hair is so high, people call it black gold.""","Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1964086.1408361396!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['county', 'fu', 'local', 'products', 'taihe', 'big', 'human', 'business', 'black', 'hair', 'trade', 'chinese', 'rural', 'heads', 'exports', 'market']", ,none

Chinese officials are embracing a wide range of tactics in trying to suppress surging ethnic violence in the western border region of Xinjiang. There are, for example, frequent police raids on homes of suspected Uighur insurgents and executions of those found guilty by courts of “terrorist activities.” There was also a recent proposal by President Xi Jinping to move more Uighurs to parts of China dominated by the Han, the nation’s main ethnic group, so the mostly Muslim Uighurs could be better assimilated into Chinese society.

Now there is 10-year-old Princess Fragrant, with her girlish braids, embroidered red dress and flowing silk head scarf.

She is the Han vision of a Disney princess transplanted to Xinjiang. Animators in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen are creating a 104-episode cartoon series loosely based on a historical Qing Dynasty imperial consort, the Fragrant Concubine, a Uighur woman who is shrouded in myth. Working under contract with the government of the oasis city of Kashgar, the site of occasional violent episodes, these animators have said their aim is to paint a portrait of ethnic harmony and paper over bloody conflicts in Xinjiang.



The plot of the series, which is expected to be broadcast in 15-minute-long episodes over two seasons, follows the adventures of Princess Fragrant, her brother and their ethnic Han and Kazakh friends as they travel across Xinjiang to rescue the princess’s father from the clutches of a greedy Western explorer.

“It shows that ethnic unity is the most powerful weapon in the face of adversity,” said the director, Deng Jiangwei, in a telephone interview. “The princess and her friends also encounter other ethnicities and cultures along the Silk Road, and they learn that only by helping each other can you go far in life.”

The English-language edition of Global Times, a populist state-run newspaper, ran an article on Monday on the “Princess Fragrant” series under the headline “Xinjiang fights an ideology war through cartoon production.”

The producers, Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communications Company, got a contract last year from the Kashgar government to develop a cartoon that would show Xinjiang folk customs, the report said. It cited Sheng Jun, an official at the Xinjiang Bureau of Culture, as saying that “Xinjiang authorities support the development of cartoons with the aim of maintaining social stability by boosting the solidarity of Han and Uighur people and the fusion of Han and Uighur culture.”

Mr. Deng said his company had been told by Shenzhen officials to work with Kashgar, a sister city, to “boost the creative industry in Xinjiang.” The central government has been pairing up cities in Xinjiang with wealthier ones elsewhere in China to promote Xinjiang’s economic development.

Last month, Mr. Deng uploaded a trailer of “Princess Fragrant” to Youku, a Chinese video site. It shows the princess and her companions in landscapes of snowcapped mountains, waterfalls and domed buildings.

“All the media reports on terrorism attacks in Xinjiang magnify the danger and deter tourism,” Mr. Deng said. “To boost tourism, we want to show that Xinjiang is a beautiful and peaceful place.”

The trailer also has a scene of the princess dancing for guests at a banquet, which is in line with the popular depiction of ethnic minorities by the Communist Party. Propaganda posters, publications and television shows across China often portray members of the country’s 55 ethnic minorities as smiling folk dancers in colorful native garb.

Mr. Deng said half the production team was made up of Uighurs assigned to the show by the Kashgar government. “They can make sure every aspect of the show is authentic,” he said. The creators have also “enlisted the best musicians in Xinjiang to write the music, including two famous Uighur musicians,” Mr. Deng added.

However, the series will avoid mention of Islam, which is central to Uighur life. “We try not to mention religion or politics,” Mr. Deng said.

The creative team has completed parts of the first season and plans to do a test run of a few episodes in the Uighur language in December on a Kashgar television station, Mr. Deng said. The company is in talks with China Central Television, the main state network, to broadcast the first season in late 2015 and the second season the following year.

Some foreign scholars are skeptical of whether the cartoon will win the hearts and minds of Uighurs.

“As you know, ethnic tensions in Xinjiang are at their highest levels in decades and many Uighurs feel under siege from an increasingly intrusive party-state, here perceived as both alien and Han, as it penetrates deeper into their daily lives,” said James Leibold, a senior lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne who studies China’s ethnic policies. “Like other Han productions, I suspect Xinjiang’s majority Uighur population will see right through this latest piece of ethnic unity propaganda. They have their own narratives of Iparhan, ones that stress resistance to Qing/Chinese imperial rule.”

The story of “Princess Fragrant” is based on the popular Chinese narrative of the Fragrant Concubine, named Xiangfei in Mandarin or Iparhan in the Uighur language, a historical figure from Xinjiang who in the 18th century was brought to Beijing by the Qianlong Emperor to be his consort. Contemporary Chinese propaganda campaigns have promoted her story as one that shows unity between ethnic Uighurs and the Han. (In fact, the Qianlong Emperor was ethnic Manchu, a people from the northeast forest that conquered China following the Han-ruled Ming Dynasty in the 17th century.)

A popular Uighur version of the Iparhan narrative says she resented the Manchus for invading her homeland and kept daggers hidden in her robes even after she was taken 2,700 miles to the imperial court in Beijing.

Chinese tourists in Kashgar flock to her so-called tomb at the Apak Khoja Mausoleum, a green-and-white-tiled Sufi shrine. Iparhan was said to be a descendant of Apak Khoja, a local leader from the 17th century, a time when ethnic Zunghars controlled the region. The Chinese legend goes that the consort was brought back to Kashgar for burial after her death.

But the legend appears to be just what it is, a popular tale. An essay on Islam in Xinjiang by Graham E. Fuller and Jonathan N. Lipman, published in the academic anthology “Xinjiang: China’s Muslim Borderland,” opens with an exploration of the myth of the Fragrant Concubine and says there is “undisputed evidence regarding the burial of the Qianlong emperor’s actual Muslim consort, under her palace name of Rongfei, among the Qing imperial graves near Beijing.”

Even the designation of “Uighur” as an ethnicity did not exist until the 17th and 18th centuries, the scholars say. So nationalistic Uighur authors living outside China who have praised Iparhan as a symbol of the struggle against the Manchu-Chinese invaders are also appropriating her narrative for political purposes, they say.

“Clearly, these anachronistic arguments project contemporary social conflicts backward 200 or 300 years,” they write in the essay.

The authors conclude the first section of their essay with this thought: “The superimposition of a particular reading of the myth of the Fragrant Concubine onto an Islamic shrine at once trivializes its religious significance and makes it part of a broader and discernible process, what might be termed the ‘Disneylandization’ of Islam and Uyghur culture in China.”

They continue: “That is, it has been emasculated, folklorized, prettified, Hanified, and cast into the nationwide museum of safely packaged ethnicity that serves up exoticism and charm to tourists in China but precludes any hint of opposition in the past or present.”

The creators of the “Princess Fragrant” television series plan to make a movie version for release in 2016 and a stage musical with “interactive holograms,” Mr. Deng said. He added, “We are also releasing a soundtrack album and merchandising.”

11,11,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Climate change will widen the social and health gap - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/climate-change-will-widen-social-and-health-gap/,"Climate projections suggest that, thanks to human activity, we will likely see an increase in extreme weather events, disruptions to agriculture, loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.

While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status.

Recently there’s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists, led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda.

My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices. I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health.

Inequities of man-made natural disasters

Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones. These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems.

Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage.

At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people. 6,069 people were reported dead while 4.1 million people were displaced, with 1.1 million houses damaged or destroyed. While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions.

Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild. The ?ooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities. Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport.

We see similar issues with heatwaves. Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat. This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths.

Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods.

Impacts on agriculture

“ In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

Our agricultural systems are also under threat. Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production. This will affect people’s income, stress levels and sense of hope.

In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle. But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities. Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away.

This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities. These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts.

Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity. Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33 per cent increase in the price of vegetables and a 43 per cent increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events.

Rising food prices most affect the poor — as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19 per cent. But, with 12 per cent of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face.

Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories. Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt.

Where does inequality come from?

Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities.

Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers.

Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes. The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average.

Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people. In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality. This might include: fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas.

This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment.

As the World War I centennial is celebrated, repressed thoughts of great power war once again begin to surface. With today’s highly “interconnected global economy” underwritten by a liberal order leading to the “rise of the rest,” it appears unlikely that any state would want to disrupt the current system. And yet, the constant stream of somber news reignites fears of a calamitous global catastrophe.

In times of international flux, where the worst seems possible, it is important to turn to those who can best interpret these eras. In the case of great power or “hegemonic” wars, there is hardly a greater authority than Robert Gilpin. In his seminal work on the subject, War and Change in World Politics, Gilpin argues that three preconditions must be met for a hegemonic war to occur. First, Gilpin believes that the soon-to-be warring parties must feel there is a “‘closing in’ of space and opportunities.” Second, there must be a general “perception that a fundamental historical change is taking place.” Finally, events around the world start to “escape human control.”

Notably, all three of these conditions currently exist in the world.

Closing In

Europe, where great power conflict took place for centuries, was heavily congested and contested. As powers like Britain, France, Germany and others rose, they fought for influence and geography at the expense of the others’ territory. Due to the close quarters, any desire for expansion on one country’s part would cause concern in the others.

Today, some say, the world is different. The two powers that would compete in a war — the United States and China — are separated by a vast ocean, supposedly making it hard for each to antagonize the other. This, however, is not true. The map may show an expansive world, but new technologies — leading to hyperconnectivity and shorter travel times, especially for military equipment — have made the world “claustrophobic.” To wit, when China announced an “Air Defense Identification Zone” the United States quickly deployed two B-52 bombers to challenge its claim.

And that was using old equipment. Both China and the United States are developing hypersonic missiles and vehicles. Humanity has already conquered physical space with commercial flight and fast ships. Now, it continues to shrink space even further for potentially decisive advantage. It is also hard to claim that China and the United States are far apart when they regularly bump up against each other as they have in the South China Sea.

Perception

Advertisement

Since the dawn of “Pax Americana” after World War II, belief in the United States as the undisputed global hegemon remained fairly stable. Until now. According to a recent Pew poll, Americans’ views of the United States as a global power have reached a 40-year low. Indeed, only 17 percent believe that America plays a “more important and powerful role than ten years ago.” Rightly or wrongly, this perception exists. Even though most people still find the United States preferable to China, regional powers can use the widespread belief that America is declining to make their cases for running the system. In fact they are already doing so to a degree. For example, China’s Global Times reports that 47 percent of people believe China has achieved “major power” status. Should both perceptions keep trending in the same direction — the United States is declining while China rises — then the feeling of an historic shift is almost inevitable.

Human Control

As current events prove, even the great powers cannot stop horrendous things from happening in the world. From Latin America and Africa to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, chaos and turmoil run rampant. While this is a particularly bad period for international affairs, it is naïve to think this may be an isolated epoch.

In fact, there is reason to think the world might grow more unstable in the years ahead. Over the next 11 years, the world can expect another one billion people, reaching a total of around 8 billion by 2030. As technology becomes more powerful, it will do two things. First, it will empower the individual, or a group of individuals, to do great good or great harm. Second, it will allow individuals to be more aware of how the middle class lives. People around the world will demand similar things, causing stress on governments and brewing civil unrest and instability. Thus, as people are further empowered and further angered, the probability that these non-state actors — indeed, normal, everyday people — disrupt international affairs or geopolitics is high. Governments will continue to have less and less control of the citizenry, allowing the regular citizen to do with her newfound power what she wills. In essence, we will see, in a big way, the diffusion of power.

Although the world currently satisfies Gilpin’s three preconditions, there need not be pessimism. For one, current relations between the United States and China are nowhere near the point where a potential great war between them is possible, and there is no other rivalry nearing that of Washington and Beijing.

Second, some of the trends that can cause harm, like rapid technological progress, can also be used to help stabilize the global order. To be sure, technology could be used to curb the desolation brought on by expectedly low water, food, and energy levels.

Finally, and most importantly, Gilpin’s guidance is certainly not comprehensive. There are more variables for which to account (i.e. the effect of nuclear weapons) that dictate whether or not a great power war may take place. That said, Gilpin’s framework serves as a good rubric by which to measure the current global climate. By all measures, this is certainly a dangerous time.

But Gilpin’s preconditions shouldn’t be misconstrued as predictive or fatalistic. Indeed, the United States, as the hegemon, has the capability (and responsibility) to preserve the international order and lead the world out of this mess. By keeping good relations with partners and allies, deterring adversaries, reversing the perception of its decline, and leveraging technological capabilities for global good, there is a decent chance that the U.S. can make the great-power-war-incubation period fade away. Should the United States not seize this moment, and ensure that China is a responsible partner in the current global system alongside it, then the chance of a great power war cannot be dismissed, however remote.

The massive landslide on the Sun Koshi river at Sindhupalchowk in Nepal in the first week of August was a disaster in waiting, according to a rapid investigation report released on Sunday by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) after its experts visited the disaster site.



Narendra Raj Khanal and Deo Raj Gurung from ICIMOD compared satellite images of 2011, 2012 and 2013 and of August 5, this year and said that landslides have been taking place in the same region.



Landslides in Sindhupalchowk have claimed more than 150 lives since 1990. “Satellite images from 2001,2004 and 2011 clearly shows evolving landslide scar,” they said in the report. The ICIMOD experts were accompanied by members of Disaster Preparedness Network-Nepal during the site visit.



People residing around the landslide site told the visiting team that the initial signs of landslip were apparent from 2007 onwards. Local people alerted government officials about the major landslip occurred in 2011.



“Local people became more alert and aware after the landslip scar grew wider and wider,” Khanal and Gurung said.



The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology accepted that two days prior to the landslide, there was 70 mm precipitation per day for two consecutive days.



Experts say that a blueprint to keep the landslides under check is needed to avoid similar disaster.



Recommendations



They have recommended bathymetric survey of the artificial lake that has been created because of the landslide on the Sun Koshi. The survey will help in calculating the volume of water stored in the lake.



Other major steps recommended by ICIMOD include geographical survey of the dam to ensure stability, hydrological modelling and inundation mapping to identify areas vulnerable to flood.

The flooding had damaged two hydro power plants, around two kilometre stretch of the Araniko highway that connects Nepal with China, scores of shops and also vehicles.



The ripple effect of the flood was also felt in Bihar which was threatened by flood in the Kosi river. The state government mobilised the disaster management force, Air Force and medical units. Families living inside the Kosi embankment were forcibly evacuated to avert danger.

A new paper published yesterday in Science analyzes the genetics of the Ebola virus and provides insights into how the virus is changing during the current outbreak. The analysis could help improve current diagnostic tests and, in the long term, guide researchers working on vaccines and treatments. The study also highlights the unrelenting toll the outbreak has taken on health workers on the front lines: Five of the paper's co-authors contracted Ebola themselves and died before its publication.

A gut microbe that stops food allergies

Scientists have discovered that a common gut bacteria can keep mice safe from food allergies. The finding may help explain the recent alarming increase in food allergies—these same bacteria, Clostridia, are reduced by antibiotic use in early childhood.

‘Walking’ fish give clues to evolution of life on land

A primitive, air-breathing fish walks much better when it's raised on land rather than in the water. The landlubbers even undergo skeletal changes that improve their walking skills. The discovery may provide clues to how Earth's first swimmers evolved and adapted to start living on land.

Researchers erase fearful memories in mice

By manipulating brain activity with light, a research team has neutralized “fearful” memories in mice and even colored them with more positive emotions. The technique is too invasive to use on humans, but researchers hope it will lead to treatments for post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders.

Water clouds tentatively detected just 7 light-years from Earth

This week, The New York Times reported on the production in China of an animated television series with an exotic 10-year-old heroine, Princess Fragrant. The 104-episode series is loosely based on murky historical narratives about the Fragrant Concubine, an ethnic Uighur woman who in the 18th century was brought thousands of miles east to the Chinese imperial court in Beijing of the Qianlong Emperor, an ethnic Manchu, to be one of his consorts.

The program’s creators are Han, the dominant ethnic group in China. It was commissioned last year by the government of Kashgar, an oasis trading hub in Xinjiang, the vast western borderland where violence between Uighurs and Han has been soaring. The mythical tomb of the Fragrant Concubine, who is known as Xiangfei in Mandarin and Iparhan in the Uighur language, is in an Islamic Sufi shrine in Kashgar and is often visited by tour groups from other parts of China. Most Uighurs are Sunni Muslims.

The creators, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, across the country from Xinjiang, say their goal and that of officials in Kashgar is to improve ethnic relations through the cartoon, which shows Uighur, Han and Kazakh characters going on adventures together along the Silk Road.



James Leibold, a scholar of China’s ethnic policies at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, who is teaching in a study-abroad program this semester in Beijing, shared his thoughts on the series by email. He pointed out the paradox that Princess Fragrant is drawn with a silky head scarf even while officials in Xinjiang have been imposing bans on the wearing of head scarves by women in public, which is central to the practice of Islam in many parts of the world. Mr. Leibold wrote:

It’s hard to believe the cartoon will achieve its stated goal of “boosting cultural exchanges and understanding between Han and Uighur people.” The production team (mostly Han from Shenzhen, I recall) admit knowing little about the region and its people. As you know, ethnic tensions in Xinjiang are at their highest levels in decades, and many Uighurs feel under siege from an increasingly intrusive party-state, here perceived as both alien and Han, as it penetrates deeper into their daily lives. Like other “Han productions,” I suspect Xinjiang’s majority Uighur population will see right through this latest piece of “ethnic unity propaganda.” They have their own narratives of Iparhan, ones that stress resistance to Qing/Chinese imperial rule. In fact, I find it highly ironic and revealing that Iparhan/Fragrant Princess has been drawn with a headscarf while local officials in Xinjiang are now promoting a scarf-less “standard” for traditional Uighur “beauty” (see here), banning Uighur women with the hijab from boarding buses in Karamay city and entering other public places, and even confiscating silk scarves and traditional hats from local markets in Urumqi (see here).

The series has Uighur advisers appointed by the Kashgar government, but it is unclear how much the Han creators know of the new policies on veils in Xinjiang or of the role of the veil in traditional Muslim societies.

In an interview this week, Deng Jiangwei, the director of “Princess Fragrant,” said that the program did not mention politics or Islam and that its aim was mainly to teach viewers “that ethnic unity is the most powerful weapon in the face of adversity.”

As for what the cartoon says about the role of women, Mr. Deng said: “It is also the coming-of-age story of the princess, about how she goes on adventures and learns to become a young adult with courage and virtues.”","Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/28/world/29sino-xinjiang01/29sino-xinjiang01-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg,"['princess', 'uighurs', 'uighur', 'kashgar', 'han', 'xinjiang', 'ethnic', 'women', 'messages', 'expert', 'unity', 'series', 'mixes', 'fragrant']", ,none

In fact he had two Oscars for both producing and directing 1982’s eleg ant epic biopic, Gandhi. But considering the breadth of his career not only in those capacities, but particularly as an actor, it is astounding to me that the Gandhi wins represented his only nominations in a six-decade career that memorably started with the British World War II classic In Which We Serve in 1942. As an actor, Attenborough deserved far better than he got from the Academy.

It’s almost criminal, for instance, that he was overlooked in 1964 for his creepy performance in Seance on a Wet Afternoon as Billy, the weak, complicit husband who gets involved in a kidnapping so his wife, played by the great Kim Stanley, could become famous as a psychic.

Stanley got a richly deserved Best Actress nomination that year but Attenborough, who also produced the film, did not. I think it may have been his best performance. It’s definitely a film that holds up even 50 years later. In fact, so much of his work on screen remains memorable.

That same year as Seance, Attenborough was also memorable as Sergeant Major in the underrated Guns At Batasi. He did win a BAFTA award, the organization he would later head, as Best British Actor in 1964 for those two films.

Just a year earlier he stood out in a superb ensemble as Roger Bartlett, the mastermind behind The Great Escape. His expression as he realizes he is about to be killed is still haunting more than 50 years later. It’s sad to think virtually the entire key cast of that 1963 WWII classic are now gone, with James Garner’s passing earlier this summer.

Another memorable turn in uniform came in 1966’s The Sand Pebbles, where he was enormously engaging as Frenchy, a Navy shipmate of Steve McQueen’s on a gun boat patrolling the Yangtze River in 1926 China.

Attenborough, an RAF veteran, actually did numerous films donning uniforms in the course of his career. He won the Supporting Actor Golden Globe for Sand Pebbles and even repeated the feat the next year for his larger -than-life turn in 1967’s musical Doctor Dolittle. An Oscar nod might not have realistically been in the cards for the latter film, but instead of an Attenborough nod for Sand Pebbles, that distinction went instead to his unknown co-star Mako. Attenborough was every bit as good, if not better.

The Boulting Brothers films Private’s Progress and I’m All Right Jack were vintage British comedies and allowed Attenborough to show other sides of his talent. And he was excellent in director Guy Green’s drama The Angry Silence as a factory worker, for which he got another BAFTA nomination and which was his debut as a producer.

And I will forever be grateful for his emergence as a producer, if only to bring the brilliant 1961 drama Whistle Down The Wind into the world. Hayley Mills starred in the British classic, where kids befriend a bearded man they believe to be Jesus Christ. It was later turned into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and remains one of the greatest films ever about childhood. That and other early films he produced like 1963’s The L Shaped Room proved without a doubt this was an actor who also had great taste as a filmmaker.

Considering his penchant for appearing in war movies, it was somehow appropriate that his filmmaking career would take another major turn in his directorial debut for another , albeit wildly different kind of war film, 1969’s anti-war musical adaptation, Oh! What A Lovely War. The WWI set tale was full of witty numbers and arresting images, none more poignant than a never-ending shot of white crosses in a military cemetery. It packed a powerful punch and remains, I think, Attenborough’s best work behind the camera. And yes, I am including Gandhi in that assessment.

No question that Oscar champion was a great movie of its type and gave Sir Ben Kingsley the role of a lifetime but I think the reason it won those eight Oscars was that it was also perfect Academy fodder, just the kind of epic tale Academy voters loved then, and still do to this day.

It came out at Christmas 1982 and just swept through the awards season on an inevitable march to Oscar, overrunning the film many still argue today should have won Best Picture: Steven Spielberg‘s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, which had been released in June and was in a genre not favored by most Oscar voters.

Spielberg was a good sport about it, though, and even brou ght Attenborough back in front of the cameras for another memorable big screen turn in Jurassic Park ten years after their battle for Oscar. (Read the statements about Attenborough from Kingsley and Spielberg in Deadline’s obituary here)

A new generation discovered Attenborough’s acting gift in that movie, and then a year later as Kris Kringle in the remake of Miracle On 34th Street. That role won an Oscar for Edmund Gwenn in the 1947 original but it didn’t do the same for Attenborough. Nevertheless it was nice to have him back in front of the cameras.

As for his other directorial work, it almost all was, like Gandhi, based on real people and situations, including 1992’s Chaplin, for which Robert Downey Jr. was deservedly Oscar nominated and probably should have won for his uncanny portrayal of Charlie Chaplin.

There was the powerful Steve Biko story, Cry Freedom , which brought Denzel Washington his first Oscar nod, Young Winston (1972), a rather dry biopic of the young Winston Churchill, and his final great work as a director, 1993’s Shadowlands, which starred Anthony Hopkins as writer and professor C.S. Lewis.

He tried his hand at another musical, the ill-fated movie adapation of the Broadway classic, A Chorus Line, but it flopped. A better effort outside of the biopic arena was 1978’s creepy and compelling Magic, with a superb performance from Hopkins.

Attenborough also brought all of that experience he had in WWII movies to bear in his all-star 1977 war flick, A Bridge Too Far. As combat epics go, it was a pretty decent one.

In fact as film careers go — in front of and behind the camera — Richard Attenborough’s career was more than pretty decent. He was a giant.","Sun, 24 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/seance-on-a-wet-afternoon_kim-stanleyrichard-attenborough_1964.jpg?w=301&h=202&crop=1,"['camera', 'sides', 'won', 'best', 'attenborough', 'appreciation', 'giant', 'richard', 'later', 'actor', 'career', 'film', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'oscar', 'true', 'war']", ,none

But our satellite also contains a substance that could be of even greater use to civilisation – one that could revolutionise energy production.

It's called helium 3 and has been dumped on the moon in vast quantities by solar winds.

Helium 3, scientists argue, could power clean fusion plants. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay's worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. Pictured are the stages in getting the material back to Earth

Now China is looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future, according to a report in The Times.

Professor Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, recently said, the moon is 'so rich' in helium 3, that this could 'solve humanity's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least.'

Helium 3, scientists argue, could power clean fusion plants. It is nonradioactive and a very little goes a very long way.

For instance, two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption.



Helium 3 is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron. It is abundant in the moon's soil after being dumped there by solar winds. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption

WHAT IS HELIUM 3? Helium 3 (He-3) is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron. Its presence is rare on Earth, but it is sought after for use in nuclear fusion research. It is also used in MRI scanners and in sensors to detect smuggled plutonium. Helium 3 is abundant in the moon's soil by at least 13 parts per billion (ppb) by weight. The gas, he estimates, has a potential economic value of $3 billion (£1.78 billion) a tonne, making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon. According to experts in the U.S., the total estimated cost for fusion development, rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $20 billion (£11.8 billion) over two decades. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. This would require mining an areas the size of Washington, D.C. Advertisement

This would require mining an areas the size of Washington, D.C.

The isotope is so rare on the Earth because our atmosphere and magnetic field prevent any of the solar helium 3 from arriving on the surface.

The moon doesn't have this problem as there is nothing to prevent helium 3 being absorbed by the lunar soil.

Fabrizio Bozzato, a doctoral candidate at the University of Tamkan in Taiwan, recently wrote in World Security Network that helium 3 could be extracted by heating the lunar dust to around 600°C, before bringing it back to the Earth.

The gas, he estimates, has a potential economic value of $3 billion (£1.78 billion) a tonne, making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon.

According to experts in the U.S., the total estimated cost for fusion development, rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $20 billion (£11.8 billion) over two decades.

While China has expressed an interest, it has yet to outline concrete plans about how it would mine the moon for helium.

The prospect, however, raises the controversial issue about who owns our satellite.

The United Nations Outer Space Treaty, signed by China, suggests that lunar resources are for all mankind.

China is hoping to mine helium 3 from the moon. The scenarios sounds like science fiction, and has been depicted in Hollywood through films such as the 1998 blockbuster Armageddon starring Bruce Willis

Private groups are also interested in using fuel from the moon by mining water rather than helium



However, legal experts claim the language is ambiguous enough to allow for commercial exploitation of the moon.

In a recent paper, Mr Bozzato said: 'China appears determined to make [lunar mining] a reality of tomorrow.

'China maintains its lunar mining would be for the benefit of all humanity,' he added.

'However, given the absence of willful competitors, it is also speculated that the Chinese intend to establish a helium 3 monopoly.'

Private enterprise is also interested in using fuel from the moon – although possibly by extracting water rather than helium 3.

The Shackleton Energy company envisages providing propellant for missions throughout the solar system using lunar water.

Some teams vying for the Google Lunar X-Prize also see mining as an ultimate goal of their landers. ESA has also considered using the Moon to help missions farther into the Solar System.

Arguments have also been made for mining Helium-3 from Jupiter, where it is much more abundant – it would need to be given the distances involved.","Tue, 05 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/05/1407230405213_wps_11_Moon1_jpg.jpg,"['help', 'worth', 'united', 'crisis', 'billion', 'lunar', 'helium', 'energy', 'china', 'moon', 'power', 'mining', 'space', 'solve', 'worlds']", ,none

22,22,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Effects of Watergate: The Good and the Bad - U.S. News & World Report,https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/08/effects-of-watergate-the-good-and-the-bad,"This article originally appeared in U.S. News & World Report on Aug. 26, 1974.

Now that the smoke is clearing, lasting effects of Watergate are beginning to come into view. Some are good, some are bad – and all of them largely overlooked during the ordeal of the past few months.

The impact is deep and will be enduring. It will be a long time, if ever, before politics in the United States is the same again.

A massive drive is on in statehouse to overhaul the way elections are run. Congress is moving to enact new laws. And even without prodding, many politicians are racing to open up their financial affairs.

The over-all effect of Watergate is seen as having a cleansing effect on the nation's political process.

Former Attorney General Elliot Richardson puts it this way: ""Watergate has made one significant contribution, at least to the extent that there are many officeholders who are becoming convinced that honest politics – open, candid politics – is the best politics.""

Much the same thought comes from the Senate's No. 2 Republican, Robert Griffin, of Michigan: ""I think we should have learned that we do have to have an open Presidency and that the people need to know what is going on.""

That is just the kind of Presidency that Gerald R. Ford has vowed to conduct, as he said on August 9, by following his own ""instincts of openness and candor.""

In the future. But if more candor in politics is the most immediate effect, it is far from the only one. Even more far-reaching results may lie ahead, in the view of political leaders and students of politics and government.

Here are some things they foresee:

Continuation, if not an acceleration, of the trend toward more independence of party identification among voters – and, as a consequence, a threatened breakdown of the two-party system.

A weakened Presidency – or at the very least, a Congress that is likely to prove more aggressive in dealing with the White House.

Mounting pressures on the Democrats to pick a candidate in 1976 who appears to have a morally unblemished record.

As for the Republicans, almost everyone agrees that Mr. Ford can have the nomination just for the asking.

For all the changes in prospect, the consensus is that America's political system needs no drastic overhaul. The reaction to Watergate is taking care of that. The system set in train by the Founding Fathers is proving to be enormously resilient, able to withstand and eventually overcome the effects of recent scandals.

Pressure for reforms. It's in the field of campaign reform that Watergate is having the quickest impact, and in several ways.

Since 1972, 42 States – some with scandals of their own – have passed election-reform laws.

Congress is on the verge of enacting a plan designed to clean up political practices. It is against a background of popular revulsion against ""dirty politics"" that Congress and State legislatures are moving toward election reforms.

To Andrew Lewis, Republican candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania, this revulsion is a person thing. He tells this story: ""In one town where I was introducing myself to people on the street, a guy told me, 'If you're a politician, you must be a crook.'""

Other politicians have been getting the same message, in public-opinion polls and in letters, as well as face to face. Hence the trend toward more openness and more candor in politics, along with limits on political 'spending.

Both the Senate and House have passed separate versions of an election-reform plan. Differences remain to be worked out. Yet in broad outline, this is what is shaping up:

Strict limits on amounts that White House aspirants can spend in presidential primaries.



Ceilings on what presidential candidates, once nominated, can spend in the election campaign itself.



Limits on what individuals can give to any one candidate, and all candidates together.



Curbs on what candidates for the House and Senate can collect and spend.



At least partial public financing of presidential primaries and campaigns.



Some way to enforce the rules on raising and spending political money.

Even without laws, many individual candidates and officeholders are moving on their own. They are making public their personal assets, sources of their incomes and even their tax returns—once seldom done. A few examples:



Senator Adlai Stevenson III, of Illinois, a Democrat, has disclosed a net worth of $668,250.

Houston Flournoy, Republican candidate for California's Governorship, detailed a 1973 income of $12,166 apart from his salary as controller of the State.

Representative Ella Grasso, Democratic nominee for Governor of Connecticut, revealed that she and her husband have net assets of $329,603.

Senator Howard Metzenbaum (Dem.) of Ohio, found himself involved in controversy over his taxes. He made public all of his federal tax returns for years—but that was not enough to save his seat. He lost in the primary to a former astronaut, John Glenn.

Voluntary limits. Not only is there more candor about financial affairs, but also some candidates are voluntarily putting limits on how much financial help they will accept.

Representative Pierre S. du Pont, a member of the wealthy Delaware family, is setting out to show that campaigns can be financed by small donations.

Mr. du Pont is one of a number of candidates limiting acceptable contributions to $100. He concedes: ""This procedure will not make a Congressman more honest, but it will relieve a lot of them from the pressures large donors put on them. The result will be a somewhat more honest voting record. The pressure from a milk lobby or a labor union or big business can be enormous if they contribute half of a Congressman's campaign money.""

Mr. du Pont adds: ""Small contributions will bring the man in the street back into the political process—he will be more easily heard if the big voices don't drown him out.""

In addition to smaller contributions, political candidates are relying more on volunteer workers and less on paid professionals.

In a few cases, donations that might be regarded as ""tainted"" are being returned. One donation of $5,000 was refunded by Senator Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii, a Democrat, to a friend under indictment for obstruction of justice.

Over all, nearly 30 per cent of the money donated by the three largest dairy co-operatives has been returned.

Some special political funds have been opened up for examination.

Senator Charles Percy, of Illinois, a Republican, listed details of a fund to finance an ""exploration"" of his presidential prospects. Mr. Percy now has abandoned the project.

Governor Wendell Anderson, Minnesota Democrat up for re-election, detailed the expenditures and many of the donors of his personal $249,654 political fund.

Since the first of this year, 21 States have enacted clean-election laws. While these laws differ in detail, they follow similar outlines.

A number have set up independent commissions to enforce clean government laws. Limits have been placed on campaign contributions and expenditures. Some States provide for dollar checkoffs on income taxes to help finance elections. Codes of ethics have been established. Lobbyists have been forced to air their activities. Open meetings of legislative committees have been decreed. Candidates and officeholders have been ordered to spell out their personal finances.

Two-party-system worries. Underlying these official efforts was a deep philosophical unease about the strains Watergate had imposed.

It's when they talk about the effect of Watergate on the two-party system and people's attitudes that most concern is expressed alike by political scientists and practicing politicians.

Political scientist Malcolm Moos is one who is concerned over the effects of Watergate on the two-party system. Mr. Moos, former adviser to President Eisenhower, a member of President Kennedy's Commission on Campaign Costs, recently retired from the presidency of the University of Minnesota to head the Fund for the Republic and the Center for Study of Democratic Institutions.

Mr. Moos sees Watergate as further weakening the two-party system, ""especially when you couple the trend among young people with the massive movement which has been going on for the last 20 years toward independence in voting by the population in general – that grows out of the notion that somehow an independent is morally superior to a person who is a Republican or a Democrat."" And he adds: ""This has greatly weakened our party system and our party structure.""

The dropout danger. The danger is seen that Watergate may result in a large number of political dropouts, among the young and old alike.

In some of this year's primaries and special elections, the voter turnout has been the lowest in memory.

This year, too, more members of Congress than in a long time – 37 in all – are voluntarily quitting politics, many as a direct result of Watergate.

Before President Nixon's resignation, Republican recruiters reported culty in lining up good candidates. And in some congressional districts the party is putting up no candidates at all.

Watergate-conscious Republicans are not happy with the signs they see cropping up in registration figures. For example, recent registration drives in Philadelphia enrolled nearly 43,000 new Democratic voters and fewer than 2,000 new Republicans. More than 10,000 Republicans switched to the Democratic Party, while fewer than 2,000 Democrats changed party labels.

Damage to the two-party system is reflected in the rising number of adults who call themselves ""independents,"" rather than members of either party.

A recent Gallup Poll shows that 33 percent of adults now wear the ""independent"" label. That's a sharp rise in recent years. During this same span, those who call themselves Democrats rose to 44 percent from 42 percent. Those who consider themselves Republicans dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent just two years ago – the lowest level since 1940.

""Presidency . . . damaged."" What about the Presidency as an institution?

The Senate's Democratic Leader, Mike Mansfield, of Montana, is convinced that ""the Presidency has been damaged, without doubt.""

The Senate Republican Leader, Hugh Scott, of Pennsylvania, agrees that the office has lost ground, especially in its relationship to Congress.

As examples, Mr. Scott cites newly enacted laws to limit a President's power to start war or impound funds appropriated by Congress, and to give the House and Senate a greater voice in the budget-making process.

To that list, a top Democrat adds a new law requiring Senate confirmation of the head of the Office of Management and Budget. This legislator predicts that more such laws are yet to come.

Even now, Congress is moving to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from supplying the White House with data on a person's tax return, except on written request of the President.

The point is being made, too, that the power of the President is limited, or at least prescribed, by the Supreme Court decision requiring Mr. Nixon to surrender 64 tapes involved in the alleged Watergate cover-up.

Prof. James MacGregor Burns of Williams College, looking at Watergate as a political scientist, believes that the scandals ""have raised grave questions of what has happened – or overly sensitive, overly aware – that Watergate will hang very heavily over them and the people for some time to come.""

As Prof. Richard E. Neustadt of Harvard sees it, ""Watergate is not typical of White House performance of either party."" Yet, Mr. Neustadt adds:

""It is broadly suspected that all politicians do the sort of things that happened at Watergate. People feel that all politicians are bums.""

Stress on ""practical types."" It may be a bit ironic, then, that one expected – and welcome – result of Watergate is that President Ford and future Presidents will bring to the White House staff more people with political experience, or at least political aptitudes.

Mr. Neustadt sums up a view widely shared by politicians and political scientists:

""One of the most important lessons that ought to have been learned by now is that practical types should be brought into government. It can be expected that a new Administration will be looking for Harlows instead of Haldemans.""

The reference was to H. R. Haldeman, an advertising man who became President Nixon's top staff man, and now is under indictment, and Bryce Harlow, who has wide experience in politics and government. He was temporarily brought back to the White House after the Watergate scandals broke wide open, and President Ford is consulting him on the transition of power.

What, if any, effect will Watergate have on the 1976 election? Again, Mr. Neustadt voices a widely held view: ""Potential candidates for the Presidency will have to lean over backward to show how different they are from the public conception"" of politicians.

This trend, as Mr. Neustadt sees it, is hurtful for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, of Massachusetts, ""because Watergate brings up the matter of Chappaquiddick."" But Mr. Neustadt adds: ""Kennedy would find himself in a position like Nelson Rockefeller on the money-corruption issue – too rich to steal.""

To this, a national Republican leader, asking not to be named, sizes up the Democratic possibilities:

Senator Henry M. Jackson, of Washington, ""would probably be their strongest candidate.""

Senator Kennedy, ""their most vulnerable candidate.""

Senator Hubert Humphrey, of Minnesota, the former Vice President, ""probably the most qualified candidate of either party,"" but he faces questions growing out of his fund-raising.

Can there be another Watergate?

Says Mr. Moos:

""You can't prevent dishonesty, of course. No civilization has ever been able to work out a system to prevent it. But we ought to be able to work out better institutional devices that will help detect dishonesty. Certainly, it shouldn't be rewarded.""

Reflecting the views of many others, Senator Scott replies:

""Watergate has gone into the national memory bank. I think it is most unlikely that we will ever see another.""

It was bad, and it might make things worse. The magnitude-6.0 earthquake that hit northern California in the early hours of 24 August piled stress on to the Hayward fault, which is due for a major rupture.

Centred on the Napa Valley, the quake – the largest in the area since 1989 – injured more than 200 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Seismologists with the US Geological Survey (USGS) quickly modelled its effect on other faults in the area. The results suggest that the northern part of the Hayward fault, which runs to the east of San Francisco Bay, ended up under greater stress.

The Hayward fault is overdue a major earthquake. Its last earthquake was in 1868, almost 150 years ago. The past five large earthquakes on the Hayward fault have been about 140 years apart.

Like a tyre

However, this week’s quake doesn’t mean the Hayward fault is now primed, says Ross Stein of the USGS. “We’re saying it gave it a kick. Whether or not that will be large enough to trigger something, we don’t know.”

The additional pressure on the Hayward fault is 0.5 bars, or about a fifth of the pressure in your car tyres, Stein says. That is probably not enough to trigger a large earthquake directly.

“It’s a fairly small increase in stress, but the fault is thought to be one that has a pretty high probability of rupturing in the next 30 years,” says USGS scientist Thomas Parsons.

The USGS estimates that there is a 1 in 3 chance of a magnitude-6.7 or larger quake on the Hayward fault by 2037. Such an event would be devastating to San Francisco, Berkeley and the 7 million people living in the Bay Area.

“It’s the interplay between these faults and sea level fluctuations that give us the special conditions that give us the vineyards in the Napa Valley,” Stein says. “We enjoy the fruits of the faults, we should expect the [downsides] too. This is the yin and yang of California life.”","Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dn26106-1_300.jpg,"['fault', 'piles', 'californian', 'hayward', 'stein', 'dangerous', 'trigger', 'usgs', 'stress', 'quake', 'large', 'valley', 'faults', 'earthquake']", ,none

Sweat is made mostly of water with some potassium, salt and other minerals. As it evaporates from the skin, it carries heat away and reduces your overall body temperature. Sweat is produced in sweat glands, which are activated by the hypothalamus, the area of your brain that controls certain key biological processes, including your heart rate, your blood pressure and your body temperature. The average human body has between two and five million sweat glands.

Humans aren't the only animals with sweat glands, but we are one of the few species that produces large amounts of perspiration to cool off. While sweating might lead to awkward encounters on a hot day, some scientists think that it also gave us an evolutionary advantage. Daniel Lieberman, professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, argues that our ability to sweat let us run longer distances at faster speeds than other animals. This meant humans could hunt game during the hottest parts of the day, when other predators were forced to rest. Other experts, such as anthropologist Nina Jablonski at Pennsylvania State University, say that sweating provided more efficient cooling that allowed us to evolve bigger, hotter brains.

In addition to higher primates (monkeys, apes and humans), horses are among the only other animals in the world that perspire profusely—making them one of the few that could challenge humans in a marathon.","Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/MMI3fRDWLPpyZFIY7QQtCVX6dOs=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/d7/b8/d7b8efb4-2522-45a8-b57f-46e122634739/42-35641163.jpg,"['ways', 'sweating', 'body', 'university', 'evolutionary', 'pooping', 'glands', 'panting', 'sweat', 'humans', 'temperature', 'human', 'cool', 'weird', 'animals']", ,none
25,25,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,A Toe Above The Competition: KEEN's Story - Manufacturing.net,https://www.manufacturing.net/operations/article/13057609/a-toe-above-the-competition-keens-story,"In a Portland, Oregon headquarters that feels more like a tech startup than a shoe manufacturer, you’ll find one of the most innovative outdoor and utility footwear companies in the country.

The floors and walls are made of reclaimed materials and some company meetings are held on old wooden bleachers reminiscent of an elementary school assembly. In the basement there is room for an impromptu jam session, racks to hang your bicycle after your morning commute and a shuffleboard table to release some stress. It feels like a mini-Google.

This atmosphere exemplifies the out-of-the-box thinking, and “HybridLife” mantra, that has come to define KEEN, a manufacturer that has gained a fanbase much more passionate than you’d expect of its short life. HybridLife refers to the company’s belief in splitting time between work, play and giving back. “Internally, it’s a pretty flexible environment,” says Mark Reilly, utility division director. “They encourage people to get out and use the products. It’s a fun place to work.”

The company is best known for its sandals and hiking boots, distinguishable by their rubber toe protection and colorful designs. Reilly says that this toe protection and comfort lent itself easily to the industrial market.

“We just drafted on what the outdoor division had been doing for seven years and we were able to leverage the fans that they had and let them know that we have work boots for their 40 hour work week,” Reilly says. He explains that the addition of bright colors, styled after their most popular hiking boots, also gave them a leg up on the competition. “Prior to that, it was just brown and black all leather boots, and the [store] wall was just a sea of sameness. KEEN arrived and you could pick it out from a good distance away.”

Manufacturing in Portland

KEEN was founded in 2003 by Martin Keen and Rory Fuerst in Alameda, California. In the spring of 2005, the company moved its headquarters to Portland, where it also opened a production facility just a few miles away. To furnish the facility, they sourced equipment from around the world, including China, Poland, Thailand and the United States. By September 2010, the operation was up and running, and shoes started leaving the facility in November of that year. Since that time, the facility has produced 80-100,000 pairs per year. This year, that number will jump to 300,000 pairs.

“The problem we faced is that there aren’t people in the United States, at least in this area, who know how to make shoes,” says Tom Fitzgerald, factory manager at the Portland facility.

Technical Manager John Madsen curated the equipment in the facility and had the task of bringing people on board and training them. As the company grows and production ramps up, this is an ongoing task that Madsen says can be a challenge. “It’s about finding people that fit into the system. And when they fit, they like it,” says Madsen. The Portland facility has grown from 24 to 80 employees and runs on two shifts.

Madsen says in this plant it’s all about the culture. Employees have Bagel Fridays, both in the headquarters office and production facility. And when production targets are met, there may even be a pizza in the break room to acknowledge the team’s hard work.

The Portland facility works on a month-to-month cycle. First, KEEN’s sales team places an order for several months down the road. Once all of the components arrive at the plant, the team takes twenty days to manufacture the shoes and ship them out for distribution.

Much like the equipment in the facility, the product components come from all over the world. “When we opened the facility, we couldn’t even get our components in the United States because all of the footwear manufacturers that use polyurethane in the United States went offshore,” explains Fitzgerald. KEEN worked with an American company to develop the polyurethane (PU) component for the mid-sole of their shoes. This component is what the team says makes their shoes more comfortable for longer. Unlike the material used in competitor’s heels and soles, the PU compresses less over time, retaining the cushioning base for more steps.

The leather uppers arrive already sewn and ready for inspection. They are divided by style and size and put into plastic bins for movement to the production machines. Then, once they are steamed and dried, it’s onto the loading station.

The uppers are matched with rubber outsoles, which are adhered with the heated PU component. The PU expands between the rubber outsole and the leather upper. The chemical reaction is very hot, and as it starts to cool the material cures. This PU provides the cushioning for your foot and creates a perfect seal between the upper and outsole. The direct-inject molding process allows KEEN to create products more efficiently with fewer materials and adhesives.

The PU cools very quickly and once it’s set the shoes head to the finishing team. Here, the overflow PU is cut off by hand and workers finish the remaining final touches. Fitzgerald says that most of the process is done by hand, with the roughing machine used to treat the leather as the only fully automated process.

While much of KEEN’s production is done abroad, the Portland plant is an effort to begin manufacturing some of their products in the United States. Many of the footwear lines in the utility division are even named after ubiquitous American manufacturing cities, including the Milwaukee, Louisville, Flint and Detroit lines. Shoes that are manufactured in the Portland facility are marked with KEEN’s “American Built” logo.

Kevin Kious, director of utility sales, set up the sales operation for the utility division. He was recruited from Timberland Boot Company, where he worked for a decade, before coming on board with KEEN in Portland. “The shoes that [KEEN designers] are coming out with now are so market relevant, and at retail we need more and more and more,” says Kious. “So as you ramp up, you try to start out slow, but we’re to the point where we’re just trying to keep up with production. And that’s always a good position to be in.”

Kious says that as the push for American built products continues, the Portland operation just keeps getting bigger. “We’ve got a lot of synergy going here. We’re starting to build additional styles. It’s going to be a whole different ballgame going forward, and we’re really excited.”

Aside from the popularity of buying American, Fitzgerald says there are also practical reasons for producing in Portland.

“There’s a benefit to being so close to your corporate headquarters. Now we don’t need to get on a plane,” he says. “Everything in research and innovation is here, and the quality lab is here, so we can engage faster than overseas. We’re here to stay and we really do want to make an impact.”

Focus on Quality

KEEN’s products are bought for hiking, white water rafting, construction work and plant floors, so it’s important that they can stand up in rugged environments.

Directly off of the plant floor you’ll find Connor Fuerst, quality control manager. Fuerst has been at the facility for four years and is responsible for ensuring that all of the shoes that leave the facility meet the company’s strict standards.

The facility is equipped with five testing machines that can measure things like the amount a hole in the rubber outsole will stretch over time, the strength of the steel toe on impact, and how the PU material will age. For each of these tests, the KEEN testing standards go beyond industry regulations. On the Cut Growth Flex Machine, for example, Fuerst has tested soles for up to 900,000 flexes, compared to the industry’s 30,000 flex standard. The company also tests 100 percent of their proprietary KEEN dry booties, a lining material designed to let moisture out but not in.

Fuerst also monitors the molds used to make the texture on the midsole of the shoes. Each left and right pair is very expensive, so maintaining the molds is an important, money-saving job.

“It’s more efficient for us to do it here than sending it to an independent lab,” he says. “Typically, before we start production, there’s about an eight month development phase...when production comes it’s really just a quality assurance measure.” If something does come up, however, he knows exactly which batch the shoe came from and he’s able to tell if it’s really a serious problem or just a single mistake.

Staying Ahead of the Competition

KEEN has become a nearly household name in just over a decade, especially on the West Coast and in the outdoor communities. “Every year is a new record for the company, which says a lot because the outdoor community has been pretty flat to declining the past three years or so,” says Reilly. And the utility division, while much smaller than the outdoor division, has been growing at an even faster pace.

Reilly says research and development is a collaborative effort at the company. “You’d love to have a patented idea every year, but I don’t know if that’s realistic,” he says. “But the goal at the start of every season is to develop something that differentiates you from the rest of the competition and keeps them at bay for a little while, until they can design around it and catch up.”

Right now, much of their product development is focused on making materials lighter, faster and stronger. But the trend towards lighter materials can be a challenge for the utility division, as Reilly is concerned about materials getting too flimsy so they sacrifice some of the protection that customers need. “It’s about striking that balance and pushing the envelope with new materials and new construction processes to get the weight out of the product without sacrificing the things that people count on KEEN for, which is protection and comfort.”

But even as the products expand and evolve, Reilly says one thing will probably never change.

“I don’t see us ever getting away from the toe because that’s our signature piece — you can just pick KEEN’s out on the wall, and it’s also a very functional feature that translates very well to any jobsite, whether it’s indoor or outdoor.”","Tue, 12 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.manufacturing.net/files/base/indm/all/image/2014/08/mnet_35542_boots_automation_1.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=1200,"['pu', 'reilly', 'keen', 'production', 'company', 'shoes', 'competition', 'keens', 'portland', 'facility', 'toe', 'division', 'utility']", ,none
26,26,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,"Iceland's Seabird Colonies Are Vanishing, With ""Massive"" Chick Deaths - National Geographic",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/140827-seabird-puffin-tern-iceland-ocean-climate-change-science-winged-warning,"FLATEY ISLAND, Iceland—When the days grew long, seabirds flocked to this hamlet on the edge of the Arctic to rear their chicks under the midnight sun.

""Kria,"" shrieked the terns, calling summer up from the slumbering ground. Black cliffs were transformed into snowbanks of white kittiwakes. Puffins whirred between land and sea. Murres plied the shoreline; fulmars patrolled the skies. Everywhere sounded their vibrant chorus.

These days, a few stubborn holdovers streak the sky and paddle the bay, but the legions are gone. The chicks have perished, and their bereft parents have returned to the sea.

Half of Iceland's seabirds nest on this low-lying volcanic outcropping and its neighboring islands in the deep west coast gash called Breidafjordur Bay. Flatey Island used to be covered with chicks snuggled inside rocky hillside burrows, under tall meadow grass, in nests strewn across headlands and shores.

""There were thousands! You could hear them,"" says Olina Jonsdottir, who has lived on this island with her husband, Hafsteinn Gudmundsson, nearly 50 years. She looks out her living room window, past the sheep grazing on knuckles of grass-covered lava, past the black basalt beach, to the few birds drifting over the water beyond. ""You can't do that anymore. Now there are so few.""

Iceland, circled by the food-rich currents of Atlantic, Arctic, and polar waters, is the Serengeti for fish-eating birds. Its rocky coast, hillocky fields, and jutting sea cliffs are breeding grounds for 23 species of Atlantic seabirds, hosting an indispensable share of Atlantic puffins, black murres, razorbills, great skuas, northern fulmars, and black-legged kittiwakes.

But the nests have gone empty in the past few years, and colonies throughout the North Atlantic are shrinking.

The suspected culprits are many. But the leading candidates are the array of profound changes under way in the world's oceans—their climate, their chemistry, their food webs, their loads of pollutants.

Warming oceans and earlier thaws are driving away the seabirds' prey; unleashing deadly, unseasonal storms; and knocking tight breeding schedules off-kilter. Mounting carbon dioxide absorption and melting glaciers are acidifying and diluting the aquatic balance, jeopardizing marine life and the creatures that depend on it for food.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Alarmed scientists have returned from fieldwork throughout the North Atlantic with sobering descriptions of massive chick die-offs and colonies abandoned with eggs still in the nests.

""Mass mortality of kittiwakes is evident,"" said Freydis Vigfusdottir, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Exeter in Cornwall, England. ""You can see in the late summer lots of 'chick pancakes' in the nest.""

And in the Arctic tern colonies she's studied, ""there are just dead chicks everywhere,"" she said. ""Not only do you have to provide your field assistants with food and shelter, but also some psychological help after many, many days of collecting dead chicks.""

On Flatey Island, the once-prolific terns haven't produced viable chicks in a decade. More than half of the region's black-legged kittiwake nests vanished over 15 years.

And on the Westman Islands off Iceland's south coast—home to the world's largest Atlantic puffin colony—breeding has been a ""total failure"" since 2005, according to the South Iceland Nature Center. The impacts are being felt throughout the country, where these clown-faced birds have been both a legally hunted delicacy and a national mascot. ""Puffin watch""—news on how things are going in the burrows each summer—is as avid here as ""volcano watch.""

Similar trends are reported in Scotland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, and across the circumpolar north—the principal nursery for Northern Hemisphere marine birds. Most of the biome's species, the 2013 Arctic Biodiversity Assessment finds, are in decline.

Whole populations haven't collapsed—at least not yet. These hardy seafarers are long-lived, and millions of them still sail the North Atlantic. Normally, seabirds can withstand a few bad breeding seasons. However, reproductive failures have been going on for so long now that scientists say it's just a matter of time before the adults, too, are gone.

Now researchers are struggling to comprehend the catastrophic breeding failure and its implications for an ecosystem that is fundamental to the planet's health.

These days, a few stubborn holdovers streak the sky and paddle the bay, but the legions are gone.

The seabirds' plight ""is a huge concern ... not just in the North Atlantic but also globally,"" Vigfusdottir said. The cold waters of the North Atlantic are a major driving force for the Earth's weather and among the most productive fisheries in the world, so the birds' problems could indicate trouble for the region's major industry and the global food supply.

These same problems are now being noted in wading birds like the redshank, shorebirds like the red knot, and other waterfowl in the northern United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere.

""What is happening in Iceland, we see happening in so many other areas in the North Atlantic. And the fact that we're seeing them over such a wide area points to a common factor ... and that is climate change,"" said Aevar Petersen, a retired Icelandic Institute of Natural History ornithologist.

Winds and currents funneling pollution northward from Europe, North America, and China bring more bad news for seabirds preying high on the food web. Mercury is ubiquitous—and rising fast in some areas. Brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated coatings, pesticides, plasticizers, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and more are contaminating a variety of species and locations. And masses of chemical-laced microplastics could be released by melting ice sheets.

Seabirds ""are critical for detecting changes that are happening even more rapidly than we suspected,"" said Jennifer Provencher, a doctoral student at Carleton University in Ottawa who examines colonies in Arctic Canada. ""We are getting basically a year-to-year-to-year update of the health of the oceans and the health of the environment through these seabird studies.""

It's likely all these threats are adding up, sounding a warning across the north, she said.

""They're alarm bells, in real time, of changes that are going off.""

Puffin Prophecies

Thick-coated sheep bleat as Erpur Snaer Hansen trudges across their steep pasture overlooking the sea. This is Heimaey, one of the 15 volcanic stacks lying off Iceland's south coast that make up the world's most important breeding grounds for puffins: the Westman Islands. Hansen, a biologist with the South Iceland Nature Center, is Iceland's de facto puffin prophet: Twice a summer he rounds the country to tally eggs and chicks and announce whether the birds' breeding seems headed for success or another year of failure.

Hansen stops at a small, rocky hollow surrounded by a dome of wet grass. He dons dark goggles and, looking like a welder conducting a medical exam, snakes a flexible pipe with an infrared camera into the opening. Puffins nest underground, and this ""burrow camera"" lets him see inside without disturbing the birds.

""Nothing there,"" he says after a minute, and moves on.

The burrows should be bustling now on this July day: The Westmans are one of Iceland's three ""mega-colonies."" More than a million pairs of various seabird species nest here, including around 830,000 puffin couples. Puffins are loyal to their breeding grounds, returning to the same site year after year. The majority of the world's puffins breed in Iceland, nearly half of them here in the Westmans. The area is crucial to the birds' future.

But Hansen and colleague Ingvar Sigurdsson find burrow after burrow empty. If the chicks die, or the eggs don't hatch, adults leave the colony early and go back out to sea. ""There hasn't been a proper chick production in 12 years now,"" Hansen says. And for the past nine years, hardly any have lived long enough to leave the nest.

Finally, success: A lone adult is at home. Sigurdsson pulls out a grunting bird with a parrot-like orange beak and lays it on its back. Black triangles stare up from its Kabuki-white face as Sigurdsson measures, draws blood, and plucks a few feathers before letting it scramble back into its burrow. From this, the researchers will determine the bird's health and diet, and try to learn where it's been going to feed.

Rising ocean temperatures are squeezing out the birds' main prey, pencil-shaped fish called sandeel. For hundreds of years, sandeel were abundant in these waters, providing the intense nutrition chicks need for quick growth in the short northern summer.

Warmer waters seem to stunt the sandeel's growth, Hansen says. Plus, more southerly fish, like voracious mackerels, are moving in. Puffin parents must forage farther and come back with less—or less—nourishing-fish for their young. These days, chicks starve, nests are abandoned, and increasingly, birds don't even bother to breed.

The sun is still high when the researchers call it quits that evening. Their arms are covered in mud, and on top of that, Sigurdsson wears the fishy smell of puffin guano. ""Ja, we study the poo as well,"" Hansen says. But they've found no chicks this day, and very few adults. Hansen saw similar conditions almost everywhere on his puffin tours this summer.

This cycle has occurred before, Hansen says later, at his house in the quaint, 4,000-person town of Heimaey. His analysis of historic weather and puffin hunting records has linked population dynamics to a periodic warming cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, or AMO. Repeatedly, waters around Iceland have warmed for a few decades, then cooled for a few, and seabird populations have slumped, then recovered. The current warming cycle began in the late 1990s. But this time, Hansen's research shows, things are different.

""If you look at the AMO cycle, it's trending upward,"" he says. Ocean temperatures already have climbed as much as 2 degrees Celsius—nearly 36 degrees Fahrenheit—surpassing previous cycles. And chicks are taking a far greater hit.

Even when the current warming cycle ends, around 2030, ""it's not going to be that cold at all,"" Hansen says. ""I don't want to be alarmist. But global warming is definitely felt here... It makes things happen fast, and the birds are suffering.""

He frowns as he thinks about their future.

""I'm fearing it's not going to be pretty.""

""All Dead""

The scene is virtually the same on Flatey Island, 200-some miles to the northwest.

""Another terrible year,"" says Petersen, stepping through thigh-high grass dripping with recent rain to survey an Arctic tern colony. A dozen or so of the fierce black-capped birds wheel overhead.

""Normally, there would be hundreds of birds here,"" the ornithologist says. Now, ""there may be a few chicks. But they probably won't make it."" Petersen's been coming to this island to count and band birds for 41 years. Some summers, he and his colleagues have banded 800 fat, gray Arctic tern chicks.

""This year,"" he says, ""we've done five so far.""

Reykjavik artist Ragnar Olafsson also notices the difference. When he came here as a child, the sky was thick with terns dive-bombing anything that came near their nests. They aimed for the head and frequently drew blood.

""I was terrified! I wore two or three hats."" Olafsson looks up at the scant white streaks in the gray sky, and rubs his head. Now he can go hatless.

The Arctic tern is another special bird to Icelanders, who see its arrival as a sign that the long, dark winter is over. The bird is revered for its astonishing migration—flying from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back every year, nearly 50,000 miles. ""Everybody knows it. Everybody likes it,"" says Petersen. ""People used to say that it always came on the 14th of May to the pond in the middle of Reykjavik. There used to be a colony there. But no longer.""

Petersen is here with an international group of researchers looking into what's going wrong with the seabird colonies in Breidafjordur Bay. The area is a nesting nexus for a variety of species, and breeding looks dismal again this year for kittiwakes, fulmars, puffins, and murres as well as terns.

This is the tenth year in a row that tern breeding has been poor, Petersen says, parting grass to look for the white streaks that are telltale signs of a nest. Just a month earlier he had seen around 200 terns in this same spot getting ready to nest. Now, ""there are hardly any chicks around,"" he says.

""This is what we are seeing in the whole of Flatey,"" Petersen adds, ""and further afield.""

As in the Westmans, the birds' preferred prey seems to be in short supply, and the researchers are attaching geologgers to record their foraging trips. In the evening, the group motorboats out to a small island with a lighthouse. First up for tagging is an angry northern fulmar, spitting a foul-smelling orange glob of stomach oil at British researchers Kane Brides and Lloyd Park. ""They do that,"" Park says, unfazed.

Ocean heating can alter currents, bringing relatively fast and sudden weather changes over a vast area. Warmer waters also hold fewer nutrients for marine life. Plus, some scientists think that climbing water temperatures make for faster fish. ""The warmer they are, the faster they can swim,"" the theory goes, according to Morten Frederiksen, a Danish scientist from Aarhus University in Denmark who works regularly with Petersen. ""And some birds won't be able to keep up.""

Back on Flatey, Petersen wades across another wet meadow, estimating numbers of Arctic terns. ""Counting birds is tricky,"" he says. Some are pacing overhead. Others watch vigilantly from fenceposts. Still others lounge on rocks by the water below.

""That's what they do when they don't have any parenting duties to take care of,"" Petersen explains of the basking birds. The behavior is normal for August, when the chicks are grown. But not on this day in the middle of July.

No one knows exactly how many Arctic terns there are, but Iceland is believed to hold nearly a third of the world's population, perhaps 500,000 pairs. This year, Petersen and colleagues are conducting a census of Iceland's terns for the first time in a decade. Their findings will be part of the first-ever circumpolar Arctic tern status review being coordinated by the Arctic Council's biodiversity working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna.

Dire reports are already coming in from elsewhere. Petersen's longtime colleague, Sverrir Thorstensen, gets a phone call from a friend counting terns in Iceland's largest colony, Hrisey Island. Ten years ago, there were 15,000 pairs in this colony off the north coast.

With a grim face, Thorstensen relays the news of the latest count: ""Very simple answer. All the chicks are dead.""

The retired biology teacher from Akureyri is the number two bird-bander in Iceland. He's banded 62,000 birds in the past 35 years. When he visited the colony himself earlier in the season, things looked good: lots of nests, lots of eggs.

""All dead,"" he repeats now, in a low voice. ""There are hundreds lying dead.""

Toxic Brew

Our high-carbon lifestyle is turning up the oceans' thermostat, and seabirds are feeling the heat. Some will escape by heading north—scientists say a redistribution is already under way. But there's a cap on how far north they can go. More and more species will be trying to cram into a confined space. Sea cliffs and burrow-grounds are limited, and building nests in the open leaves them vulnerable to predators, which also are moving north.

At the same time, civilization's toxic stew is swirling its way north, where it may also contribute to the seabirds' decline. Levels of mercury, which can damage nervous systems and interfere with reproduction, are rising in marine wildlife throughout the North Atlantic.

For other chemicals, the scenario varies by location and foraging behavior. For example, while the banned pesticide DDT has declined in most areas, it remains high in glaucous gulls in Arctic Norway. Brominated flame retardants are ubiquitous, and the perfluorinated coatings called PFCs are holding steady or even increasing in northern Canada's kittiwakes, fulmars, and murres. In Iceland, levels of the legacy pollutants PCBs and other contaminants are so high in murre eggs that authorities recently warned people not to eat them.

Ten years ago, there were 15,000 pairs in this colony off the north coast.

It's difficult to tell precisely where the birds are encountering these chemicals, said Canadian researcher Provencher, who has conducted exposure studies in Arctic Canada. It's also hard to tease out what the health effects are.

While pollution is a definite concern, ecotoxicologists say levels of most contaminants they're finding in northern seabirds don't appear high enough to jeopardize health on their own. But mixed together, they can make a nasty cocktail, adding to the stress caused by food shortage and habitat change. ""The combination of all these factors together could wear down the birds,"" Provencher said.

One important standout, however, is mercury, a poisonous metal spewed by coal-burning power plants. Mercury levels have grown so high in Arctic terns and many other seabirds that they are ""definitely in the range where reproduction could start to be affected,"" Provencher said.

Yet for all the perils they face, there are still millions of seabirds in the north, Petersen says, watching the birds circling Flatey Island and paddling on the bay.

""They haven't vanished yet.""

27,27,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Insect molting is 'like having your lungs ripped out' - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/insect-molting-having-your-lungs-ripped-out,"When an insect gets too big for its exoskeleton, it sheds it. This process—known as molting—might sound matter-of-fact, but it’s not. Insects stop eating, many lie still, and they become more vulnerable to predators. Now, a study of mayfly larvae has revealed another difficulty: While molting, insects can’t breathe. Alarmingly, the respiratory impairment grows more severe with higher temperatures, suggesting that climate change and other stressors could make molting an even greater challenge.

The discovery comes from the lab of David Buchwalter, a toxicologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Working with entomologist David Funk of the Stroud Water Research Center in Avondale, Pennsylvania, he studies how temperature and contaminants affect aquatic insects. Mayflies, for example, are a common indicator of the ecological health of streams. Using tiny sealed chambers, Buchwalter measures the amount of oxygen consumed by mayfly larvae (Cloeon dipterum).

Aquatic insects breathe with gills. After oxygen diffuses from the water, it passes into a branching network of ever-smaller airways, called tracheoles, which deliver the gas directly to clumps of cells. Larvae can also absorb some oxygen through their soft exoskeleton.

Molting takes their breath away. When larvae slip out of their exoskeleton, the lining of the tracheoles comes with it. “It’s like having your lungs ripped out,” says Joseph Bernardo, an ecologist at Texas A&M University, College Station, who was not involved in the research. Although it was fairly common knowledge among entomologists that the tracheal linings come out—and likely block the trachea in the process—the impact on respiration hadn’t been measured.

Buchwalter became interested after one of his experiments showed an erratic pattern of oxygen consumption. His graduate student Allison Camp noticed that the mayfly larvae in the chamber had molted. That observation was intriguing, because in their lab work, insects die most often during a molt. Could oxygen deprivation be a factor? The researchers increased the number of larvae they used in their experiments, keeping an eye out for molting. Eventually, they had 16 instances—and a pattern of wild swings in oxygen consumption, which they describe in the September issue of Freshwater Science.

Here’s what happens: In the 3 to 4 hours before molting, larvae consume 41% more oxygen than normal. Then they stop breathing for 45 minutes to an hour, while their exoskeletons slide off. Once the tracheoles are cleared, oxygen consumption spikes. “Just like if you held your breath for as long as you could, and then breathed in a huge gasp,” Buchwalter says. For about 2 hours, the insects use oxygen at a high rate. Then, apparently spent, the larvae slow their breathing for another few hours. “No one had any idea that molting so strongly affected breathing,” Buchwalter says.

Despite the drama, it’s not clear whether the oxygen deprivation actually causes damage. Buchwalter has not been able to look for any signs of tissue damage or other harm in the millimeters-long larvae. Kendra Greenlee, a developmental physiologist at North Dakota State University in Fargo who was not involved in the research, says that insects have surely evolved to deal with this stressful part of their life history, and many insects can tolerate low-oxygen.

But rising temperatures are a worry. When conditions warm by just a few degrees, insects molt more frequently. They grow faster but become smaller adults that have fewer offspring. “Really small changes in temperature can have big changes in physiology,” Greenlee says. In other experiments, Buchwalter’s team showed that the plummeting and spiking of oxygen consumption become more extreme at higher temperatures, when oxygen demands increase. “The temporary deprivation is likely more difficult to recover from at higher temperatures,” he says.

“This might be quite worrying,” says Wilco Verberk, an aquatic ecologist at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the research. “You might see climate change affect these aquatic stages more severely.” Water temperatures can also rise when trees and vegetation are removed from stream banks. Another stress is eutrophication, in which algae growth sucks oxygen out of lakes, which would make oxygen deprivation during molting even more challenging, Verberk notes.","Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-moltingH.jpg?itok=bC6uhEiH,"['larvae', 'university', 'molting', 'buchwalter', 'ripped', 'having', 'deprivation', 'research', 'consumption', 'oxygen', 'lungs', 'temperatures', 'insect', 'insects']", ,none
28,28,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,"Undocumented Children: Unwanted, Say Manassas, Virginia, Officials - National Geographic",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/140814-immigration-children-manassas-prince-william-county-hispanics-anti-immigrant,"MANASSAS, Virginia—Rebecca Apple's Latino students at Osbourn High School call her ""Miss Manzana,"" the Spanish word for ""apple."" A floating teacher last year, Apple would pile her nine English-Spanish dictionaries and other supplies into a cart and travel down halls thronged with students.

She's one of hundreds of public school teachers in Manassas, in Prince William County outside Washington, D.C., who've struggled to adjust to the arrival of scores of new Hispanic students; a fresh onslaught is expected when school opens in a few weeks' time. Last year, Apple's class size for her beginner English for Speakers of Other Languages course grew so quickly that she was receiving one or two new immigrant students every day for a month.

Matilde Rosa Jimenez taught as many as 37 kids in her eighth-grade English class at Metz Middle School, from gifted students to kids struggling with basic reading comprehension to immigrants who spoke little or no English. Some of her students had trouble reading in their native language. And in one county public elementary school, 60 different languages are spoken.

Educating immigrant children has tested the capacity of the county's schools in other ways as well. Hundreds of trailers have been turned into makeshift classrooms to handle the overflow.

With 50,000 unaccompanied children flooding into the United States this summer, many towns and cities are expecting apprehended minors to be moved to their communities, at least temporarily. The national reaction has run the gamut from cautious willingness to open hostility. In the middle-class suburbs of Washington, D.C., where waves of immigrants have long been a source of cultural tension, the potential for a new influx has sparked angry debate and calls for immediate deportations.

Manassas has a main street that is traditional Americana, with red brick buildings and hanging flower baskets. But Hispanic influence in the city is growing, and many services and businesses cater to Spanish speakers. According to predictions from the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, a think tank at the University of Virginia, the county's Hispanic population will rise nearly 50 percent, from 81,460 in 2010 to 118,748 in 2020. (At the start of 2013, its total population was estimated at 431,000.)

In Manassas, the Hispanic community has doubled within the last decade and now makes up a third of the population. The small city, with a population of around 28,000, has become a battleground just as surely as it was during the Civil War.

Coming to America

Between October 2011 and September 2012, some 13,000 minors trickled across the U.S. border illegally. By October 2014, that number is estimated to reach 90,000, and few agencies are ready for the flood.

To make it here, children as young as five hide in trains, paddle in boats, or come on foot. One girl lived on peppermint candy for eight days. Another carried her two-month-old baby over her head as she crossed the Rio Grande.

They come to find family in the U.S. and to be a part of the American Dream. They come with the belief that the Obama Administration's Deferred Action program, meant to help young undocumented immigrants who've lived in the U.S. since 2007, will also offer them a reprieve. They come to escape gangs, drug cartels, and persecution in their native countries. A recent UN High Commissioner for Refugees study found that 48 percent of these minors experienced violence or threats in their home countries, mostly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

Along their secret journey, they may be trafficked, robbed, or raped.

""They would rather risk their lives in trying to get to a better situation than stay in their current situation,"" says immigration attorney Susannah Nichols of Livesay & Myers. She adds that child immigrants don't have the right to an attorney in the U.S. as a suspect in a criminal case would.

""What kind of country are we going to be at the end of the day?"" she says. ""If you had to look at the face of a child, and you knew that the kid would be killed or harmed, would you send him or her back?""

Waiting 484 Days

When the children, often malnourished and confused, are caught at the border, federal law requires that they go through a deportation process. But the deluge has overwhelmed the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which lacks the resources to place and process the children. In Virginia, the average wait time for a court hearing is 484 days.

The long wait is a source of panic and indignation. ""All some people hear is, 'These are Latino children coming in, everyone should do whatever it takes to take care of them.' How many, at what cost, and what do we give up to do that? Is that a trade-off we're willing to make?"" asks Help Save Manassas president Greg Letiecq. Given that the organization has attracted up to 2,500 members, it's clear that many people in the community share his position.

A Shelter for Children

A 13-minute drive from Osbourn High School, behind a manicured lawn in the town of Bristow, Youth for Tomorrow takes in undocumented children caught at the U.S. border, under a contract with the federal government. An American flag, a Virginia flag, and a YFT flag billow in the wind beside each other, and plastic water bottles clutter a table by a basketball court.

Many locals wonder what happens once the children walk through the facility's doors. They ask whether the children will receive inoculations so that they can't spread disease. They don't know where the children will be sent as they wait for their court hearings or how the relocations will affect their community. They fear that the children will try to run away. Some are even skeptical that the immigrants sent there are truly minors, because without documents, they can claim to be any age.

YFT, founded by former Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs, has not answered these public concerns, arguing that the organization must give its full attention to the children. That's made some locals call their behavior secretive and suspicious, adding further fuel to the heated debate. Says electrician Dennis Durham: ""We don't know the health diseases coming across the border. There have been reports of MRSA, scabies, and now there are fears of Ebola.""

Makeup artist JoAnn Abbott says she's already wary, since three years ago a drunk undocumented immigrant hit her car; within three months, she says, her husband and son were in their own car accidents with undocumented immigrants. Now she worries that YFT's kids will flee ""and get into trouble in the local community. What is to stop the illegals, and probably gang members, from escaping once they are up here and setting up their illegal businesses? Why are my tax dollars going to help ship in and set up more gangs?""

Sources who asked not to be named say the community has little to worry about from a resource or health perspective. The YFT program for the undocumented children is funded strictly by federal dollars, and an additional program for troubled local youth operates with state and local dollars.

In addition, within 36 hours, YFT's new arrivals are inoculated and receive a medical exam. They stay about 40 days at the private institution and receive private schooling before transitioning to a sponsor home. None have run away.

Few Local Placements

What's more, less than 2 percent of YFT's children are placed locally, amounting so far to less than a dozen kids. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that 90 percent of the unaccompanied children are placed with parents, relatives, or family friends.

But city council member Andrew Harrover says the lack of information about the center has been harmful. ""A lot more transparency and a lot less evasion would help people understand the problem. The federal government shouldn't round up kids, then in the dark of night ship them off to other states. The citizens need to know and understand.""

Most juveniles also choose to attend their court hearing. About 60 percent show up on their scheduled day, 93 percent when the children have a lawyer—which means they're less likely to vanish into the surrounding community indefinitely.

The Lure of Construction Jobs

Immigrants were first drawn to Prince William County around 2000 by a booming construction industry and a cheap housing market. The Hispanic newcomers worked in drywall installation and painting, then in the sheet metal and electrical trades—and quickly got a leg up over existing service businesses by charging less per hour.

Residential overcrowding soon became a lightning rod issue. It was not uncommon for a two-bedroom town house to be filled with a dozen migrant workers—neighbors who were often unwelcome on streets lined with nuclear families. ""Manassas was ground zero for a lot of the immigration problems, and I was elected shortly after all of the fun and games started,"" says Harrover, who came into office in 2006. ""Nobody knew what the hell they were doing.""

Meetings at city hall sometimes ran until 11 p.m., with fervid residents offering three-minute diatribes. Harrover stopped going to his regular restaurant, City Tavern Grille, for lunch, since voluble townspeople would turn a simple lunch break into a referendum on immigration.

Anti-immigrant Backlash

Some locals expressed their opposition by forming a grassroots organization. ""These border crashers have contributed to rising crime rates, increasing burdens on our schools, hospitals, and public services, and the very destruction of our American culture,"" Help Save Manassas wrote in a 2007 newsletter.

When Corey Stewart was elected chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors that year, the board put into place a plan to purge the county of undocumented immigrants. The new law allowed local law enforcement to ask people their citizenship status, even if they were not suspected of wrongdoing. Prince William County was catapulted into national headlines.

A year later the county amended the law. A person would need to be arrested before state and local law enforcement officers could enforce federal immigration law. That meant deputized officers could pull people over for driving violations, interrogate and arrest them, and investigate their immigration status. Thousands of immigrants were turned over to customs officials by local authorities, and thousands more fled the possibility by choice.

Now the new battle cry in Manassas is to keep the undocumented children from settling in the county. ""We should deport illegal immigrants who are in violation of our laws, because it is the law and because that discourages other potential illegal immigrants,"" says Letiecq. ""There is a legal process for legitimate immigration, and it starts at an embassy or consulate, not with the Border Patrol tens or hundreds of miles inside the U.S.""

""An Act of War Upon Our People""

Shane Long, vice chairman of the Maryland chapter of the League of the South, takes a more radical position. Child or adult, legal or illegal—it doesn't matter, he says. He asserts that ""a large amount"" of native Virginians and Marylanders share his belief that all of the above intrude on Southerners' right to exist as a distinct people. ""Any act or nonaction by the federal government to bring about such large influxes of non-Southern peoples is genocide and is viewed as [that] by native Southerners,"" he says. ""It is, in effect, an act of war upon our people.""

""They Don't Want to See Brown-Skinned People Here""

Given the intensity of feeling, many Hispanics live in fear, says Prince William County resident Wendy Jimenez, a community organizer for Casa de Virginia. They hear the anger echo in government meetings and feel it around the corner on many streets. She says Hispanics are more likely to get into trouble than a white person for the same act; she cites a Latino friend who was recently ticketed for jaywalking when he rushed to catch his bus.

She claims locals don't differentiate between people who come here legally and those who don't—to them, all Hispanics look undocumented. ""They don't want to see brown-skinned people here,"" she says. ""That's the real problem.""

But Letiecq says he does distinguish between legal and undocumented immigrants. He adds that he believes that the latter get what they can and then go back to their own countries without contributing to the community. ""They aren't buying the American dream like an American would,"" he says. ""They're renting it.""

Still, Hispanics feel power in their growing numbers. Jimenez says more Hispanics from Prince William County and Manassas participate in the organization's rallies, demonstrations, and protests than Hispanics from the surrounding areas. ""We're gonna fight, help keep the community together, share stories, and raise our voices,"" she says. ""We are not going to stop.""

The Schools Gear Up

Handling the influx of nonnative English students is not easy, but the public schools are managing even as budgets are slashed. Manassas teachers break big classes into groups, offer test-preparation sessions, and teach evening and Saturday classes. They also make themselves available to students as much as they can. Rebecca Apple recalls that one student read The Hunger Games aloud in English to another teacher even though he didn't yet understand the words.

""Everything we think of to better improve opportunities for ESOL students is benefiting other students,"" says Matilde Rosa Jimenez. The scores of both ESOL and mainstream students have risen.

Locals argue that if public school teachers can't handle the exploding student population, it will be reflected in test scores and will ultimately diminish the community's reputation as a desirable place to live. But the better test scores reflect a more hopeful scenario.

In Prince William County's public schools, SAT scores have improved, matching or surpassing the national average in two of three areas. Black students outperformed the state and national average, and Hispanic students made enough progress in critical reading to pass the national average. Now teachers like Apple and Rosa Jimenez just want more teachers and a better screening process to address the needs of ESOL kids.

Do they know the legal status of their students? ""To me, that's not a priority,"" says Rosa Jimenez. ""They need to be educated. They are children.""

""I don't ask,"" says Apple. ""I don't want to know.""","Sat, 16 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/51a1527d-5f50-408d-9cb9-447974f1d05f/82571_16x9.jpg?w=1200,"['county', 'immigrants', 'manassas', 'public', 'students', 'william', 'children', 'officials', 'unwanted', 'virginia', 'dont', 'say', 'community', 'undocumented']", ,none

However, Greenpeace India says such clusters of thermal power plants in small, already water-parched regions may cause serious stress to farmers dependent on the dams. “Vidarbha has constantly been under severe agrarian distress, a prime reason for the high rate of farmers’ suicides here,” says a reactive issued by Greenpeace which adds, “A Maharashtra government resolution released on August 19, 2014, declares 123 blocks in the state waterscarce, with rainfall below 50%. Among them are Nagbhid, Mul, Gondpipri, Pompurna tehsils in Chandrapur district, which come within the command area of the Gosikhurd dam.”

Greenpeace points out that the newly inaugurated Mauda power plant will also primarily depend on Gosikhurd dam – demanding about 43 million cubic meter (MCM)water each year. This is sufficient to irrigate about 8600 hectares. Ironically, the Gosikhurd dam which was conceived in 1980-81 is still pending completion. Only partially operational to date, this dam has seen a cost escalation from Rs 372 crores when its construction began in the 1980s to almost Rs 13,000 crore in 2012.

This project is funded by the Central Government’s Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, the objective of which is mainly irrigation.

In the face of this unprecedented delay in construction of the vital Gosikhurd dam, and despite the water scarcity already declared this year, the government has provided 100 MCM to the NTPC power plant and more than 160 MCM to three other thermal power plants which are under consideration. Together thesenon-irrigational allocations alone constitute nearly 25% of the total capacity of the dam (1146 MCM).

Greenpeace has urged the government to review existing water allocations to thermal power plants in the state and conduct a cumulative assessment on water availability and irrigation losses in the state’s river basins, so that water conflicts between various users can be avoided and irrigation needs of farmers fulfilled.","Thu, 21 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2014/08/21/261414-greenpeace.jpg,"['claims', 'farmers', 'cause', 'mauda', 'plants', 'clusters', 'water', 'dam', 'thermal', 'greenpeace', 'gosikhurd', 'power', 'distress', 'irrigation', 'plant', 'india']", ,none
30,30,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Fish raised on land give clues to how early animals left the seas - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/fish-raised-land-give-clues-how-early-animals-left-seas,"When raised on land, a primitive, air-breathing fish walks much better than its water-raised comrades, according to a new study. The landlubbers even undergo skeletal changes that improve their locomotion. The work may provide clues to how the first swimmers adapted to terrestrial life.

The study suggests that the ability of a developing organism to adjust to new conditions—its so-called developmental plasticity—may have played a role in the transition from sea to land. “It was a very adventurous study, and it paid off,” says Richard Blob, an evolutionary biomechanist at Clemson University in South Carolina who was not involved in the work. “They are bringing in a novel perspective and got some very thought-provoking results.”

While a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, Emily Standen decided to raise fish out of water because her graduate school study of fish fins had led her to appreciate how versatile these appendages can be. She teamed up with Hans Larsson, a McGill paleontologist, to determine if a life on land led to the changes necessary to thrive there. They picked a bichir to study because this fish looks like an ancestor to land animals: It’s long, has lungs and big bony scales, and uses the large pectoral fins behind its head to haul itself around on land to go to new watering holes. Also, bichirs sit at the base of the vertebrate family tree, close to the split between the so-called ray-finned fish (which include most kinds of fish) and the group that includes lobe-finned fish (such as lungfish and coelacanths) and the land animals—the tetrapods.

Standen bought 149 2-month-old bichirs from a pet supplier and kept 111 of them in a terrarium for 8 months and the rest in an aquarium. She compared the skeletons and the swimming and walking abilities of the water-reared and land-reared adults.

The bichirs raised on land were better walkers, with changes in their bones that likely help improve terrestrial locomotion, she and her colleagues report online today in Nature. In the land-raised fish, the front fins, instead of being splayed out to the sides, extended almost straight down, lifting the animals’ heads higher off the ground so they could put more weight on the fins. Thus, when these bichirs push off with a fin to take a step, their fins don’t slip and they can take quicker steps (see video).

The bones that support the fins and attach them to the back of the head took on new shapes. Those bones make up the pectoral girdle. One bone, the equivalent of our collarbone that extends under the chest, grew longer so that it could better support the body. The connection between it and another bone that goes up the side of the fish got stronger, but that bone itself thinned to allow more room for the head to swing from side to side. Contact between another pectoral girdle bone and the skull was also reduced, allowing the head to move up and down. Most fish don’t need such flexibility in the head, because in water they can easily move the body to look or eat in a different direction. “All the changes [we saw] are changes that you see in the fossil record,” says Standen, who is now an evolutionary and comparative biomechanist at the University of Ottawa.

“The results cast light on a factor that may have had a part in the origin of tetrapods,” says Per Ahlberg, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. But because researchers don’t have a way to go back in time to see whether the tetrapod ancestors exhibited developmental plasticity, “how big a role it had in their evolution is really difficult to say.” And some biologists now think that limbs evolved in aquatic fish and are not derived from fins of primitive fish that took to the land, so plasticity on land would be moot.

Yet Armin Moczek, an evolutionary developmental biologist at Indiana University, Bloomington, who was not involved with the work, thinks the study is important. It’s very difficult to see how organisms get started on a new evolutionary trajectory, he says. “Developmental plasticity can facilitate the first couple of stages that can ultimately lead to an massive evolutionary transition.”

In Standen’s experiments, the fish showed a flexible response during development that caused them to look and act different from their parents and other bichirs. Such plasticity can influence evolution indirectly, Standen explains. If the new behavioral and skeletal traits brought about by the stress of living on land provide a survival advantage, then fish with their heads up the highest, more effective stride, and so on will be more likely to survive and pass on the genes that confer developmental plasticity. Subsequent generations will still have plastic responses, but “eventually those plastic responses can become [permanent] over many generations and over time,” she proposes. How this happens, she cautions, remains “a mystery.”

Michael Coates, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois, thinks that scenario is feasible. However, the tricky part is figuring out where plasticity came into play, as there are many fossils of different fish and fishlike animals that may have been involved in the water-to-land transition. Nonetheless, “it seems to me that one of the points the paper is making is that this ought to be studied,” says Coates, who was not involved with the work. And Standen plans to see what happens to the next generation of land-reared fish.

31,31,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Portugese egg tarts (pasteis de nata) - Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Food/Stir-It-Up/2014/0819/Portugese-egg-tarts-pasteis-de-nata,"Sort of randomly, I came across an article extolling the wonders of pastéis de nata, or Portuguese egg tarts, in a British magazine of all places!

Now I’ve not had true Portuguese egg tarts, but many a dan taht (romanized for ??, ""egg"" in Chinese, and ""tart"") – those irresistible Hong Kong-style egg tarts – has slid into my happy belly.

After a little more research, I found out that pastéis de nata were created in a monastery in Belém, Lisbon, over two centuries ago. These delicate custard-filled puff pastry tarts have signature brown-black splotches, a result of the high heat they’re baked at. The tarts traveled with Portuguese colonials to Macau, China, and eventually made their way to Hong Kong where they evolved to become a staple at dim sum restaurants and beyond.

I’m not much of a baker and I’ve never tried making egg tarts in any shape or form but the recipes I came across online made it seem so simple, especially if you use store bought pastry! Using recipes on Leitesculinaria.com and Asiandumplingtips.com as guidelines, I devised a recipe.

Reality wasn’t quite as reassuring. Buying the pastry was easy; preventing the custard from curdling – not so much. And trying to acquire the umbra of burnt patches atop the custard was close to hellish. I feared for my oven when I turned it up to 500 degrees F. (the highest it would go!), especially when it locked itself up and decided it was going into ""clean"" mode.

Following Andrea Nguyen’s cue on her blog, I decided to bake the pastries at a lower temperature and switch to broil to finish them off.

As with many things in life, I chalked it up to a learning process. And I did learn a few lessons about egg tarts, and myself!

1. I’ve come across Hong Kong-style egg tarts with shells made from both short crust and flaky, puff pastry and I’ve always wondered why there are two variations. I’m guessing that puff pastry is a legacy of the Portuguese egg tart while short crust pastry comes from the Queen. Well, not exactly, but Hong Kong used to be a British colony and traditional English custard tarts are made with short crust pastry.

2. Don’t expect Portuguese egg tarts in Macau to be the same as they are in Portugal. As with many foods, the recipe evolved to take on local characteristics – cornstarch instead of wheat flour, the nonsprinkling of powdered sugar or cinnamon, etc.

3. Egg tarts were born from happenstance. According to this article, convents and monasteries in 19th-century Portugal used large quantities of egg whites for starching clothes (e.g. nuns’ habits and monks’ cassocks) and the leftover egg yolks were turned into cakes and pastries which were often sold to raise money.

4. I want, no, need, a crème brulée torch. If I had one, I could easily create the bruléed top peculiar to Portuguese egg tarts, stress-free!

5. Sometimes, perfection is futile and even unnecessary. Hard as I tried, I couldn’t achieve the smooth glossy sheen and deep brown patches as seen here. In the end, I decided my tarts still tasted amazing so I wasn’t going to worry if my custard puckered or if their tops weren’t adequately splotched.

These tarts may not be on par with the originals from Pastéis de Belém in Portugal or the famous specimens from Macau’s Lord Stow’s Bakery but I can live with that.

Portuguese Egg Tarts (Pastéis de Nata)

The recipes I found flavored their custards with vanilla extract, cinnamon and/or lemon peel. Next time, I’ll try dropping a vanilla bean, pandan leaf, or orange blossom water into my custard. Regardless, you’ll be rewarded with a crispy, flaky shell and a soft, gooey custard filling.

Time: 1 hr 30 mins, 30 mins active

Makes: 2 dozen small tarts

5 teaspoons cornstarch

1/3 cup heavy cream

2/3 cups whole milk

1/4 cup sugar (use less if you don’t like it too sweet)

A pinch of salt

3 large egg yolks

1 (1-1/2 inch) cinnamon stick (optional)

1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

17-1/2 ounces frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package directions (you should have 2 sheets)

1. To make the custard, combine the cornstarch and cream in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Whisk until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the milk, sugar, salt, and egg yolks. Whisk until smooth, then add the cinnamon stick.

2. Cook the custard over medium-low heat, stirring frequently with a whisk or wooden spoon for about 10 minutes, until the custard thickens to the consistency of heavy cream but not as thick as lemon curd. Start stirring continuously from the 6 minute mark and scrape the cornstarch from the bottom of the pot to ensure even cooking. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

3. Pour the custard through a sieve into a small bowl and cover with a piece of plastic wrap, making sure the plastic makes contact with the custard. This prevents a skin from forming. Set aside to cool. Makes about 1 cup.

4. Roll one puff pastry sheet out into a rectangle. Starting from the long edge closest to you, roll tightly into a log about 1-inch thick. Roll a few more times to make a smooth seal and pat the sides flat. Wrap the log loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

5. Position the oven rack about 6 inches away from your broiler. In my oven, this was the second rung from the top. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a 12-cup mini-muffin pan.

6. Remove the pastry log from the refrigerator and cut it in half. Keep one half wrapped and refrigerated.

Cut the log into 6 even pieces. Take one piece, and flatten it out into a circle using your thumbs and index fingers. Press the pastry against the bottom of the cup, up its sides and gently push the dough above the rim to form a thin lip.

7. Pour the custard into each cup until 3/4 full, about 1 tablespoon.

8. Slide the muffin pan into the oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the custard has puffed up and the pastry is golden brown. There should be a smattering of little burnt spots. If not, and if you really want them, switch to broiler mode on high (mine was set to 500 degrees F.) and broil for 1 to 2 minutes, until little burnt spots appear. Monitor the tarts closely! Some charred bits on the pastry add character but totally blackened pastry isn’t tasty. And honestly, the splotches are just cosmetic. The tarts will still be yummy regardless!

9. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. Lift the tarts gently out of the muffin pan using tongs or two tablespoons. Return the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Let the muffin pan cool. Wipe clean and repeat with remaining pastry and custard.

10. Serve the tarts warm. Leftovers can be reheated in a toaster oven or preheated 300 degrees F oven for about 5 minutes, until warm.

Note: Home ovens can’t get as hot as commercial ovens so I wouldn’t worry if you don’t achieve the dark brown splotches unique to Portuguese egg tarts.

32,32,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Ford demonstrates Magna's seamless rear window on new F-150 - Automotive News,https://www.autonews.com/article/20140813/OEM10/140819954/ford-demonstrates-magna-s-seamless-rear-window-on-new-f-150,"DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. today demonstrated its “seamless sliding rear window” feature developed by Canadian supplier Magna International Inc. for the new 2015 Ford F-150 pickups.

The current sliding glass rear windows, optional on many pickups, require three panes of glass and an elaborate support structure of plastic frames and sealing material that’s complex to assemble and vulnerable to quality glitches and leakage.

When Ford started designing its next-generation Ford F-150 in 2010, the company staged a design contest to come up with a better solution. One supplier emerged the clear winner -- Magna.

The company, based near Toronto, came up with a technology it refers to as “hole in glass” that resulted in the 2015 F-150’s “seamless sliding rear window.”

Lighter, easier to install

The new rear window has several advantages: it’s about 4.5 percent lighter, can be installed in one assembly line operation instead of several, gives the rear a streamlined look and provides continuous defrosting whether the window is open or not.

“Magna blew us away with their hole-in-glass technology that allowed us to get a flush, seamless look” for the rear window, said Noah Mass, Ford body exterior mechanisms manager.

Magna worked with its Tier 2 supplier, Pittsburgh Glass Works, to develop a technique for cutting a hole in the window using high-pressure water jets.

The technique is expensive, so Magna needed a high-volume vehicle program to amortize the cost, said Troy Tooker, Magna design engineering manager.

Ford will offer the seamless sliding rear window on XL and XLT versions of the F-150 as a $300 option for Supercab and SuperCrew models. It will not be offered on Regular Cab models. It will be standard on the Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum models. About 25 percent of customers opt for the sliding glass panel on the current F-150, and the company expects the new seamless window will increase that number to 40 percent on the new truck.

The 2015 F-150 is due in dealerships near the end of this year.

Ford also is using the technology for pop-out windows on the new Ford Transit commercial van.","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/OEM10_140819954_AR_-1_TQMYXAMIFSVR.jpg,"['window', 'demonstrates', 'supplier', 'rear', 'seamless', 'magnas', 'f150', 'technology', 'models', 'ford', 'glass', 'sliding']", ,none
33,33,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,India Inaugurates Largest Indigenously Built Warship – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/india-inaugurates-largest-indigenously-built-warship/,"Advertisement

This past Saturday, a day after making a speech urging more manufacturing in India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India’s largest indigenously built warship, the INS Kolkata, in Mumbai. This comes two months after the prime minister dedicated another large ship, the INS Vikramaditya, in June. India’s Defense Minister Arun Jaitley and Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral R.K. Dhowan were also present at the ceremony. The INS Kolkata will be deployed in the Indian Western Fleet under the Indian Navy‘s Western Command.

The warship, which was inaugurated on August 16, 2014, represents a step forward in India’s goal of becoming more self-sufficient in meeting its own defense needs. As Modi said during a speech at the warship’s inauguration, “India can become self-reliant in this sector [defense]. Our youth will become innovative and a day will come when India will export in this sector.”

The 6,800 ton warship is considered a leap in Indian shipbuilding technology. According to reports, “INS Kolkata will be a part of the Kolkata-Class destroyers of the Indian Navy which will include follow-on ships by the names of INS Kochi and INS Chennai.” The INS Kolkata has two main guns along with chaff and close-in weapon systems. The ship will also feature an air defense weapon, the Long Range-Surface to Air Missile (LR-SAM), which is currently under development in a joint venture between India and Israel. However, the missile’s deployment has been delayed due to testing and technical issues. Some of the other capabilities of the warship include the ability to travel at a speed of 30 knots due to the propulsion of four gas turbines and the capacity to fire the 290 kilometer-range BrahMos supersonic anti-ship cruise missile.

Prime Minister Modi used the INS Kolkata’s inauguration to touch upon larger themes in a speech. Modi stressed the importance of maritime security in global trade and commerce. “In the coming days, INS Kolkata will inspire confidence to those involved in maritime trade,” Modi said. Modi additionally stated that “INS Kolkata is also a great communication platform and will be useful in securing India’s trade interests at sea.” Using a speech on security affairs to discuss commerce demonstrates Modi’s holistic vision for India’s future. Modi pointed out that India has a long coast, which gives it enormous commercial potential in the form of harbors and trade. This potential, Modi said, needs to be exploited.

Modi’s vision of India providing maritime security for the international community, especially in the Indian Ocean, aligns with India’s interests and capabilities as the greatest indigenous maritime power in the Indian Ocean. As I argued previously, Indian assertion of power in its own maritime backyard is one of the most geographically and politically feasible (and obvious) courses of action India can take in order to enhance its geopolitical position.

Modi also articulated a theory of robust security that is much more assertive than the views of his predecessors and resembles United States military views of deterrence. These views, which could potentially one day be known as the “Modi Doctrine” of Indian security, stress the need for India to be prepared and proactive on security and foreign policy issues at all times. Modi stated in his speech at the INS Kolkata inauguration that “fighting a war and winning it have now become less difficult these days. But a modern military, armed with state of the art weaponry alone is a guarantee against war. When we are capable, no one can dare challenge us.” He added that “when people have a sense of our military capability, nobody will ever dare to cast an evil eye on our nation.”

Of course, India still has some way to go before its navy or military forces reach a level where they can fully deter the “evil eyes” of other nations. However, the fact that India is making strides toward this goal demonstrates the renewed seriousness of the new leadership in attending to important security matters. Additionally, the very fact that India’s security goals and rationale have been clearly articulated and are commensurate with India’s size and potential is positive. These goals would help enhance global security, and are considered beneficial by many other countries, including Southeast Asian countries, Japan, Australia, and the United States. Finally, it is beneficial for the Indian people to hear a dose of realpolitik from their leaders, which would have the effect of shifting domestic discourse away from antiquated notions of international idealism that still linger from the time of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.","Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2014-08-19_18-43-24.jpg,"['largest', 'indian', 'minister', 'indigenously', 'inaugurates', 'warship', 'modi', 'built', 'indias', 'speech', 'maritime', 'kolkata', 'security', 'ins', 'india']", ,none

[18:30] One hour and a half to the Closing Ceremony. Here we share with you some unforgettable moments at YOG >>

[18:20] Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited YOG volunteers Thursday afternoon and interacted with Mascot “LELE”.

[15:30] China sent 123 athletes to take part in the Games. And China’s deputy chef de mission Xiao Tian said Thursday afternoon that Chinese athletes did a great job at the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games as they not only achieved good results but also took part in many social and educational activities.

[13:30] International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach is full of praise for Nanjing YOG, saying he really enjoys what he has experienced here. He said during an interview with Xinhua on Sunday:

It is a great experience, just very enjoyable, to meet the athletes, to see the organization here is flawless. We don’t have any kind of problems to solve, we can just enjoy the games, enjoy it with the athletes, with the volunteers, with the people of Nanjing.”

[13:05] Young people gathered for a farewell party in the Youth Olympic Village Wednesday night. See photos here>>

[11:00] Chinese tennis player Xu Shilin won the YOG women’s tennis singles champion at the age of 16. She’s the favorite candidate to take the place of Li Na, who is China’s No. 1 tennis player with two Grand Slam titles from the French and Australia Opens.

[10:32] How could somebody who already won an Olympic gold be eligible for the Youth Olympics, which is staged for athletes aged 15-18? Well, Ruta Meilutyte stunned in London when she was 15. It’s just a “experience journey” for the reigning Olympic 100m breaststroke champion Meilutyte to attend the Nanjing YOG.

[10:30] All the competitions ended on Wednesday, August 27. Now, let’s look at some future stars rising from the Youth Olympics.

[9:50] A total of 20,000 volunteers were recruited for the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games to cover 400 positions in spectator services, competition organization, food and beverage, medical services, NOC services and other fields. Dressed in green kit, they are given the name of “Little lime.”

[9:46] Chen said one of the eight chapters in the closing ceremony is designed to pay tribute to the volunteers. He said:

Five volunteer representatives will be on the stage to receive flowers. By doing this we want to show our recognition and appreciation of the volunteers’ great contribution to the Games. They deserve it.”

[9:45] Chief Director Chen Weiya has pledged that the closing ceremony of the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games will be a big youth party and has invited all the youngsters at the Games to join in. He said:

The Youth Olympic Games is a gathering of youngsters from all over the world. Bearing that in mind, we’ll make the closing ceremony a big party for young people.”

[9:40] Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is to attend the closing ceremony, along with Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne, Djibouti’s Prime Minister Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed and Madagascar’s Prime Minister Kolo Roger.

[9:30] Running from Aug.16-28, the second Summer Youth Olympic Games will come to an end this evening.","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://live.china.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/favicon.ico,"['youth', 'olympic', 'games', 'yog', 'updates', 'young', 'events', 'major', 'chinaorgcn', 'chinese', 'closing', 'ceremony', 'athletes', 'live', 'nanjing']", ,none
35,35,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Researchers erase fearful memories in mice - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/researchers-erase-fearful-memories-mice,"By manipulating brain activity in mice with light, a research team has neutralized “fearful” memories in the rodents and even colored them with more positive emotions. Although the technique is too invasive to use on humans, researchers hope it will lead to future treatments for post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders.

Our memory of the past is constantly under revision as we learn from new experiences, says Susumu Tonegawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. In some cases, the natural malleability of memory can help people recover from trauma—therapists, for example, often ask patients to repeatedly confront their fears while experiencing a physical distraction such as rhythmic tapping, or summoning happier thoughts to counteract negative emotions. Such treatments do seem to alleviate suffering for some people, and researchers have long hypothesized that they might work by remodeling memory circuits in the brain to incorporate new, positive input. Until recently, however, there has been little scientific evidence to support that hypothesis, Tonegawa says.

To manipulate memory on a neuronal level, he and his colleagues use optogenetics, a tool that allows scientists to trigger neurons that have been genetically engineered to fire when light shines on them. The lab has also added a twist to the technology—""a technical tour de force"" that allows the team to trace specific memories as they form, says Loren Frank, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. In the new method, mice are genetically engineered to express a light-sensitive protein in neurons, or are injected with an inert virus that delivers the protein to specific brain regions. The protein is expressed only when a neuron fires, and only if the animals have been taken off a specific antibiotic. Using this technique, the team can briefly switch expression of the protein on or off so that it tags only those cells involved in encoding specific memories.

In 2013, Tonegawa and colleagues used the method to instill a fake memory in mice. In the experiment, published in Science, they traced two separate memories—one in the hippocampus, which encodes spatial aspects of memory, and the other in the amygdala, which assigns emotional value to events as we experience them. Then they used optogenetics to make both sets of cells fire together. Activating hippocampal neurons associated with a familiar cage and the amygdala neurons that fired when the mouse received a shock in the foot tricked the mice into later behaving as though they had been shocked in the cage, even though they had never been injured there.

In the new study, reported online this week in Nature, Tonegawa’s team decided to see if it could change bad memories into good ones. First, the researchers gave another group of male mice a mild electrical shock, then put them in a rectangular box where they could explore freely. When the rodents wandered into one side of the box, a laser implanted into their brains switched on and reactivated the cells that formed the memory of being shocked. Even though the danger was all in their heads, the mice still quickly learned to avoid that side of the box.

Next, the researchers took the mice out of the enclosure and provided what they consider to be a fail-safe source of rodent joy: contact with the opposite sex. For male mice never exposed to females before, ""it's a big deal,"" says Roger Redondo, a postdoctoral student in Tonegawa's lab and lead author of the new work. ""They go crazy."" As the mice grew accustomed to their change in fortune, the team reactivated their memories of being shocked with the laser beam. They wanted to see if stimulating neurons involved in forming the original fearful memory would make them more susceptible to positive input from new experiences, or simply make the animals afraid of females.

The mice did not develop a sudden phobia of the opposite sex—in fact, quite the opposite occurred, Redondo says. To see if the rodents’ old memories of fear had been supplanted by more agreeable associations, the group placed the rodents back in the enclosure and flipped the laser on again. Now, mice who had avoided the laser firing zone before sniffed around their enclosures looking for their former companions. They even seemed drawn to the laser zone, suggesting that the light stimulation might be triggering pleasant reminiscences.

Additional experiments showed that happy memories could also be soured if they were reactivated at the same time the mice were being shocked. Interestingly, the switch works only when applied to neurons in the hippocampus, and not the amygdala, Tonegawa says. Based on that finding and microscopic studies of the rodents' brain tissue, Tonegawa believes that there are two types of amygdala cell populations, one involved in fear memories and the other involved in positive memories. Hippocampal neurons appear to drive which of the two populations wins out, he says. Although it isn't possible to put optic fibers directly into the human brain, the connection between the two regions could be the target for drugs or other therapies, he suggests.

It's unlikely that reactivating such a narrow subset of cells in mice truly triggers the kind of rich, sequential memory that allows us to remember which route we took to get to work and what we ate for breakfast, Frank notes. Such distinctions are important when attempting to apply the results to disorders such as post-traumatic stress, he says. Still, ""this is first time that people have shown that you can activate a mental representation artificially and change what it’s connected to in the brain,"" he says. ""It's a really impressive, massive step forward for the field.""","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-memoryH.jpg?itok=18QKjyPC,"['rodents', 'brain', 'tonegawa', 'memories', 'memory', 'team', 'fearful', 'neurons', 'laser', 'specific', 'mice', 'erase', 'researchers']", ,none

On the surface, it seems to make sense. Exercise first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and your body should burn more fat. After all, without food intake for eight to 12 hours, you are in a fasted state. With glycogen stores depleted and low morning insulin levels, your body has to turn to other energy sources to power through your workout, and it’s more likely to turn to fat for fuel.

Fasted cardio is a technique that has been around for years in the bodybuilding community, and one that’s gaining popularity among regular gym goers and even endurance athletes. But will forgoing your morning oatmeal really lead to a leaner body and better athletic performance?

Here’s the skinny on sweating it out sans food and whether or not it is suitable for your body and fitness goals.

The Fast Track to Fat Loss?

Early morning, un-fueled workouts are a common protocol among bodybuilders, especially in preparation for competition when they need to lean out as much as possible before they walk on stage. Some celebrities also turn to this technique to get ready for their close-up, whether that’s a photo shoot or red carpet event.

“Is fasted cardio a good way to burn fat? The answer is yes and the answer is also no,” says Jay Cardiello, a NSCA and ISSA-certified strength and conditioning and fitness expert who has worked with celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and Sofia Vergara. “It’s effective, but it’s not sustainable,” he says.

Some studies have found that exercising in a fasted state can burn almost 20 percent more fat compared to exercising with fuel in the tank. Why? Once we eat, insulin (which regulates the breakdown of fat) increases in our body. And, according to some research, higher insulin levels have been shown to suppress fat metabolism by up to 22 percent.

However, research has demonstrated that fasted cardio does not increase fat burning over a 24-hour period. While your muscles adapt to using more fat when you exercise, you don’t actually lose more fat overall on the days that you exercise compared to days that you don’t. Another study suggests that ingesting carbs before working out increases the post-exercise “afterburn” effect more than the fasted state. That means more calories burned throughout the day, not just during your sweat session.

While more research is needed, if you’re curious about running on empty, be sure not to go it alone. Cardiello has employed the fasted cardio method with clients for a short period of time and within a controlled environment. He advises that fasted cardio “shouldn’t be used unless you are being looked after by a nutritionist, professional strength training coach and a medical professional.” For example, 50 Cent used fasted cardio to prepare for an album cover photo shoot. Cardiello closely monitored the rapper’s fitness and nutrition throughout this period to ensure that he was healthy and safe.

Glycogen-Depleted Workouts: The New Face of Fasted Cardio

Beyond bodybuilding and celeb weight loss, endurance athletes have started to turn to “glycogen-depleted workouts,” too. The hope is to teach their body to adapt to low blood sugar levels by burning fat and, as a result, prevent “bonking” during a race. Occasional early morning exercise without fuel has been shown to increase VO2 max and the concentration of glycogen found in muscles when at rest.

Fasted runs may have their ups, but keep in mind that while these workouts can adapt the body to more efficiently burn fat as fuel, they didn’t help athletes lose weight or improve their aerobic conditioning or endurance during the studies. Plus, runners still need to practice fueling during workouts to properly prepare for taking in nutrition on race day—particularly if you’re going the 13.1-distance or more.

Not So Fast

While it appears that fasted cardio can turn your body into an efficient fat burning machine, Lauren Antonucci, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist and Certified Sports Dietitian, and Owner of Nutrition Energy, cautions against this technique. “Can I force my body to burn a higher percentage of fat than carbs? Yes, I can. But I think that the more important question is will I see a benefit as an athlete? So far, the answer is no,” says Antonucci. “For most people that small change won’t translate into body fat changes and performance benefits over the long-term,” she says.

When you wake up in the morning, your body is in a catabolic state due to high levels of cortisol—the hormone associated with stress. That means that your body is primed to breakdown molecules for energy. But if you’re in this state too long, it can lead to degradation of body tissue, including muscle, and a decrease in overall health.

“If you don’t eat, you’re not going to have the energy to train at full capacity,” says Cardiello. “If you’re on empty, you’ll go into a major breakdown phase after the workout.” In fact, research has shown that hitting the weights without fuel can lead to the breakdown of muscle.

“Recovery from these types of workouts can be very long and not as enjoyable. I’d rather fuel myself optimally and give myself the best chance of recovery,” Antonucci says. “The return on investment [for proper fueling] will make it back to you in how you feel during your workout, how you recover, and over the long-term,” she says.

To Eat Or Not to Eat

If eating before your early morning session at the track or gym doesn’t work with your schedule or stomach, that’s fine. Just pay attention to potential side effects such as dizziness or nausea.

And if you’re truly interested in improving athletic performance or losing fat, make sure you’re asking the right question—not are you eating before workouts, but what are you eating throughout the day?

“Check in on your diet and reduce your calories. Make some dietary changes overall,” says Antonucci. According to Cardiello, “Feeding the whole system will help increase the intensity level during a workout, thus recruiting more muscle activation and boosting metabolism for the whole day.”

August 21, 2014

Our respirators are on, as are three pairs of gloves secured with tape, two pairs of socks, rubber boots, a hard hat and a hazmat suit that encases our bodies in polyethylene. Ice packs cool our torsos, but photographer Dominic Nahr, reporter Chie Kobayashi and I start sweating. Maybe it’s nerves, or maybe it’s just the sticky humidity of summertime Japan.

Soon we approach the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant—ground zero of the worst atomic meltdown since Chernobyl. Dosimeters around our necks record the rising levels of radiation. After the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11, 2011, the aging plant on Japan’s northeastern coast suffered a total power failure, causing the cooling system to shut down. Three of the station’s nuclear-­reactor cores overheated, sending plumes of radiation over a placid landscape of fishing villages, rice paddies and dairy farms. (The station has a total of six reactors. Two were in cold shutdown at the time of the accident; another, which had been defueled, suffered an explosion.) As we lumber through the plant like clumsy B-movie extras, I’m reminded that our many layers don’t protect against every type of radiation. Not to worry, we are told by officials from Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO). The radiation levels in certain parts of the nuclear complex are actually lower than in some populated swaths of Fuku­shima prefecture. Later, as I sit in a futuristic cubicle in the plant complex, undergoing a full-body internal radiation check, the soundtrack underscores TEPCO’s soothing message. A line from one song’s lyrics, tinkly and sweetened: “You’ve got a friend in Jesus.”

Three and a half years after the most devastating nuclear accident in a generation, Fukushima Daiichi is still in crisis. Some 6,000 workers, somehow going about their jobs despite the suffocating gear they must wear for hours at a time, struggle to contain the damage. So much radiation still pulses inside the crippled reactor cores that no one has been able to get close enough to survey the full extent of the destruction. Every 2½ days, workers deploy a new giant storage tank to house radioactive water contaminated after passing through the damaged reactors. We wander past a forest of some 1,300 of these tanks, each filled with 1,000 tons of toxic water, some of which was used to cool the reactors.

Leaks have plagued the site. In February, water with a radiation level several million times higher than what’s safe gushed out from a storage tank near the coast on the Pacific Ocean. TEPCO said it was unlikely the water made its way into the ocean, but whistle-­blower workers aren’t as sure. There’s the question of what will happen when—not if—­another major earthquake strikes this seismically cursed land. The latest plan by TEPCO, Japan’s largest power provider, is to build a wall of frozen earth around the damaged reactors and other highly radioactive areas to prevent radiation from seeping out of the site. But even if this and other technological fixes succeed, the government estimates it will take at least 30 years to decommission Fukushima Daiichi and make the site safe from radiation.

Japan took all of its other 48 nuclear power plants off-line after Fukushima, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to restart some of them despite public opposition. Commissioned in 1971, Fukushima Daiichi should have been retired or retrofitted long before a 46-ft. (14 m) tsunami forced the issue. Touring the site, I’m struck by how much of the damage remains. It’s not just the throbbing danger of the unseen nuclear-­fuel rods. The carcasses of the reactors themselves are exposed in ­places like autopsied remains, stained from the soot of the hydrogen explosions that resulted from the meltdown. We walk into a building that housed the control room for Reactors 1 and 2, where a dozen workers, plunged into darkness by the power cut, labored by flashlight to try to achieve cold shutdown.

Dominic Nahr for TIME

In the control room, amid the rows of screens and panels, calculations scrawled on metal by engineers represent the desperate graffiti of men who could not halt a nuclear meltdown. Electricity was not restored until March 24, nearly two weeks after the tsunami. “We have to honestly and deeply reflect on the accident,” says Takafumi Anegawa, TEPCO’s managing executive officer, whose role is to shake up a utility he has accused of cozy relations with regulators and a cavalier attitude toward safety. “We should reset the level we pursue to the very highest. If we cannot achieve that level because of our capability or our culture, it means we are not qualified.” Akira Ono, the plant superintendent at Fukushima Daiichi, is equally blunt—at least in a Japanese ­context—about the need to reassess the nation’s nuclear future. “Because of the accident,” he says, “nuclear energy is an issue that should be discussed again in our country.”

There’s no question that Fukushima Daiichi is a huge test for ­TEPCO—and for Japan. Yet the destroyed plant feels enervated and empty, like a Hollywood version of a nuclear wasteland. Thousands of workers may be on the payroll, but few are in evidence. The protective suits slow everyone down, masking any sense of urgency. Just outside the destroyed ­reactors, in a swath of Fukushima declared uninhabitable for mankind, azaleas are in full bloom. A rabbit hops across the road—I wonder where, in this devastated landscape, it is going.

It’s a truism, but that doesn’t make it any less true: Japan is perhaps the world’s most collectivist society. But what happens when that collective trust is so fundamentally breached? Fukushima was not just an epic natural disaster in a nation long conditioned to frequent betrayals by land and sea. It was also a man-made crisis, born of political hubris, corporate dereliction and an instinct to obscure Japan’s ugliest elements that remains unchanged to this day. The Japanese, as a people, may bow before the temple of precision, fetishizing detail and safety. But Fukushima proved that no matter how many cool innovations Japanese companies churn out, a lack of oversight and emergency initiative can be deadly.

Dominic Nahr for TIME

You’d think, for example, that a nation ranking as one of the world’s most seismically active would take heed when building a nuclear plant on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Yet TEPCO’s disaster plan and post­accident ­coordination were woeful. It had ignored a joint government and utility-­company study on potential inundation by a tsunami. TEPCO’s advisory ranks were weighed down with too many retired officials. But the fault went well beyond one power company. The Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, authorized by Japan’s parliament, was damning in its 2012 report on the nuclear meltdown: “What must be ­admitted—­very ­painfully—is that this was a disaster ‘Made in Japan.’ Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to ‘sticking with the program’; our groupism; and our insularity.” The panel, composed of Japanese scientists, doctors and engineers, among others, continued with a candor exceptional for Japan: “The consequences of negligence at Fukushima stand out as catastrophic, but the mind-set that supported it can be found across Japan.”

“What must be ­admitted—­very ­painfully—is that this was a disaster ‘Made in Japan.’”

—Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission

Yet the hope that Japan’s nuclear crisis would spark a national reset has gone unfulfilled. The disasters of 3/11 caused the largest single loss of life on Japanese soil since the U.S. detonated atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But Japan was reborn after that catastrophe nearly 70 years ago, rising from the ashes of defeat and building, in just a few decades, an economic powerhouse that would eventually draw a third of its energy from nuclear power. This time around, though, the phoenix never emerged. Public faith in the government’s ability to ensure safety and respond to crises has eroded because of the nuclear accident, but Fukushima has not inspired new environmental or civil-­society movements that can boast of major accomplishments. “Inertia is still very strong,” says Akihiro Sawa, an executive senior fellow at the Keidanren business federation’s 21st Century Public Policy Institute.

In the meantime, Fukushima’s fallout continues to claim victims. Nearly 20,000 ­people—­mostly in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures but also in Fukushima ­prefecture—were killed by the earthquake and tsunami. Yet only in Fukushima, the epicenter of the nuclear catastrophe, does the number of people who the Japanese government says have since died from causes indirectly linked to the natural disaster now exceed the initial death toll. Stress, both physical and mental, has led to a rise in suicides.

About 125,000 Fukushima residents, most of whom used to reside within an 18-mile (30 km) radius of the nuclear station, still exist as evacuees because their homes are within a government-mandated exclusion zone. Some now subsist in prefab units more evocative of a third-world disaster zone than the world’s third largest economy. In June the Ministry of Environment admitted that decontamination efforts in some towns near the stricken plant had failed; residents cannot return, even if they want to. Fear has infected other neighborhoods as parents wonder whether the radiation clouds that spewed out of the ruined reactors in the days following the tsunami harmed their children. At the disabled plant itself, many experienced employees have reached the official limit on maximum dosages of ­radiation—­leaving critical work in less skilled hands.

Despite all this, the Japanese government’s message to the world is, Trust us. Last year Prime Minister Abe visited Fukushima, flashed a grin and bit into a locally grown peach to prove that the area’s ­produce—an economic ­mainstay—was safe to eat. Shortly after his fruit tasting, Abe traveled to Buenos Aires and gave a speech that propelled Tokyo to victory as the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics. “Let me assure you the situation is under control,” he said. But is it? “This was a grave accident in which many mistakes were made,” says Haruo Kurasawa, one of Japan’s foremost TV commentators on nuclear issues. “But no one has gone to jail, and no one wants to take responsibility. Everyone still wants to look the other way. Nothing has really changed.”

The road to the Fukushima Daiichi plant is lined with scenes of small-town Japan: a noodle eatery with chopsticks and condiments on the counter, farmhouses with shingled roofs, even a loader with a claw hanging in midair. Billboards boast of diners, bowling alleys and hot-spring resorts. But no one lives here. The area began to be abandoned on March 12, 2011, when the first of the reactors exploded and left entire towns preserved in radioactive amber.

Yukie lived in Futaba, a tidy town where many residents worked at the nearby nuclear plant. Other parts of rural Japan have been slowly depopulating as society has grayed and the young have flocked to the big ­cities. But Futaba survived because of atomic power. Fukushima Daiichi’s history is intertwined with Yukie’s family lore: her grandmother grew up on farmland that was given up for the future site of the nuclear plant, and Yukie entered an arranged marriage with a nuclear worker. (Her husband still works at the plant, which is why she doesn’t want her full name used.) “We were a TEPCO family,” she says. After the evacuation order went out, Yukie and her family ran home—just under 2 miles (3.2 km) from Fukushima ­Daiichi—to grab a few essentials, like blankets and diapers for her ­daughter. Then they piled into a car and drove northwest. Unbeknownst to them, the prevailing winds blew radiation along the very same path.

Since then, Yukie and her family have moved 10 times, from one set of cramped rooms to another. But the specter of ­radiation—­invisible, odorless, ­tasteless—­follows them. Yukie, 33, and her two small children now live like shut-ins on the outskirts of Iwaki, the biggest city near Fukushima Daiichi, about 25 miles (40 km) away. Earlier this year, her daughter broke out in mysterious ­rashes; one visiting doctor speculated that radiation could have caused the outbreaks. (Other doctors, however, blamed different causes.) Yukie suffers from frequent nosebleeds, which she says she never had before the disaster.

Dominic Nahr for TIME

As yet there’s no clear evidence of any connection between the Fukushima meltdown and ill health in the area, even among nuclear workers. The government has pointed out that taking an X-ray or even a long-haul flight can expose our bodies to surprisingly high doses of radiation, yet somehow we go about our lives without worrying about the risk. But even if the science says otherwise, the radiation from an accident like Fuku­shima feels ­different—and dangerous. “There’s so much societal pressure to not even mention the word radiation,” says Sachihiko Fuse, an oncologist who helps run a private medical clinic in Fukushima city. “The national and prefectural governments say, ‘Please, there’s no danger, live as normal.’ But people are concerned.”

There’s no doubting the very real mental-­health crisis caused by ­Fukushima—and no one knows exactly how stress can manifest itself in physical complaints, including nosebleeds. And sometimes the consequences are far worse. Many suicides aren’t reported by families who worry about being stigmatized, say local doctors, obscuring the real death toll. Shigekiyo Kanno, 54, didn’t hide his feelings. A dairy farmer from Soma who lost his livelihood because people feared his milk was radioactive, Kanno used his barn walls for his suicide note. “I’ve lost the will to try,” he wrote, apologizing to his wife and sons before hanging himself from a rafter. “If only there was no nuclear plant.” Kanno’s death was not initially categorized as Fukushima-related.

Atomic power is entrenched in the Japanese government. In 2009 more than 70% of individual donations to the now ruling Liberal Democratic Party came from current or former electric-­company executives. The LDP supports restarting Japan’s nuclear power plants, which were idled by a previous government. Toshikazu Okuya, director of the energy supply and demand office at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, frames the need to restart the reactors as both environmental and economic in a land starved of domestic energy resources. Japan’s greenhouse-­gas emissions increased by 7% from 2010 to 2012 as imported fossil fuels replaced carbon-­free nuclear. The ­government has ­estimated the direct impact of the nuclear shutdown to be $35.4 billion a year—this at a time when Abe is trying to revive the national economy. “We cannot say there is no risk,” Okuya admits of nuclear power. But “we need to try to take back public confidence.”

In Fukushima, that starts with mothers, an unlikely demographic that has become politically active and increasingly anti­nuclear. For months after the meltdown, Kayoko Hashimoto’s daughter wore a dosimeter to school, just as authorities urged. The radiation cloud had passed over the region, but locals were told the area was safe. So why was her daughter’s dosimeter recording high levels of radiation? Hashimoto bought a top-of-the-line dosimeter and began testing the route her daughter took to school. To her shock, she discovered tiny hot spots of radiation throughout the community: one by a bakery, another by a dog kennel, still another in the school parking lot. These levels were even higher than in some towns that had limited outdoor playtime because of fears over radiation exposure. The health effects of such small hot spots aren’t clear, but Hashimoto is worried. “People are scared of radioactivity,” she says, “but they don’t want to make a fuss or draw attention to themselves.”

“[My hometown] is finished. It’s only fit for ghosts.”

—Tatsuko Shiga, 77, a former resident of Futaba, in the Fukushima exclusion zone

Hashimoto has also campaigned against the storage of decontamination waste on school grounds. Piles of black plastic bags—filled with radiation-­tainted topsoil and ­vegetation—are scattered across Fukushima. But no one wants a formal dumping ground near them. Even designating temporary storage sites for the bags is difficult, which is why schools have been used. The bags have a life span of a few years, and already some have grass and debris poking through. “It’s wrong to call this decontamination,” says nuclear analyst Kurasawa. “It’s just moving around contaminated waste.”

Some of the laborers in charge of that decontamination are poorly paid and trained; recruiters have even been known to target the homeless. At Fukushima ­Daiichi itself, three-quarters of the white-­suited workers are subcontracted laborers. In March a contract worker died in an accident after it took an hour to get him to a hospital. “Before I was proud because I thought I was helping to save Japan,” says Sunny, who uses a nickname because he still works at the plant and isn’t supposed to speak out. “But it’s long hours and bad pay. The new foot soldiers don’t get any training, and the media say we’re constantly screwing up. I’ve lost my pride.”

For Kyoji Konnai, a tatami-­mat maker and former nuclear-­plant worker, radiation isn’t a concern. In April the government formally lifted an evacuation order for Miyakoji, just over a mountain road from Fukushima Daiichi, after decontamination work was carried out. Konnai and about a third of other neighborhood residents have returned and cleared the mold, vermin and ruined furniture from their homes. “I still think the nuclear industry is important,” he says. “Without it, we’d have no jobs in the area.” But others cannot go home. On the outskirts of Iwaki, a grim collection of metal huts is the latest temporary housing offered to 250 Futaba families. Tatsuko Shiga, 77, has pots of flowers in front of her tiny living space. A shelf holds the family altar. But there’s only so much you can do with a prefab shack. Still, Shiga has no wish to return to her farmhouse, one of the few in her community to have escaped the tsunami’s wrath. “That place is finished,” she says. “It’s only fit for ghosts.”

Antarctica has been touched by great earthquakes before. In March 2011, Japan's Tohoku tsunami tore off two Manhattan-size icebergs from the Sulzberger Ice Shelf, more than 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) south. Sailors also reported a massive Antarctica iceberg-calving event after Chile's 1868 great earthquake.

But this is the first evidence that distant earthquakes can trigger icequakes in Antarctica. Icequakes are seismic tremblings caused by sudden movement within a glacier or ice sheet, such as from a fracturing crevasse. (Anyone who has dropped an ice cube into a glass of water knows ice snaps under stress.) [Listen to Antarctica's Icequakes]

A little crack

Chile's magnitude-8.8 earthquake on Feb. 27, 2010, set off a flurry of Antarctic icequakes, each lasting from one to 10 seconds, researchers report today (Aug. 10) in the journal Nature Geoscience. The epicenter was 2,900 miles (4,700 km) north of Antarctica.

""Regular icequakes probably occur all the time in Antarctica and other polar regions,"" said lead study author Zhigang Peng, a seismologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. ""What we found is that they occurred more during the seismic waves of the Maule event.""

Many different kinds of icequakes rumble across Antarctica and Greenland. Known icequake triggers include opening and closing of the fractures called crevasses; glaciers tearing away from sticky bedrock; water runoff; and calving, the breaking off of an iceberg. Spooky underwater sounds from melting, cracking icebergs were once called The Bloop.

Only 12 of Antarctica's 42 seismometers picked up icequakes after the Maule earthquake, but the signals seemed to fit a pattern. The pattern suggests that opening or closing of shallow crevasses generated the tiny tremors. For example, seismic stations near Antarctica's mountain ranges and fast-flowing ice rivers known as ice streams were more likely to see icequakes. These are areas with a lot of crevasses. The high-frequency shaking also fits with cracking of brittle ice. [Album: Stunning Photos of Antarctic Ice]

""We think the crevasses are being activated by the surface waves from this big earthquake coming through, and that's making the icequake,"" said study co-author Jacob Walter, a research scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics in Austin.

There are also intriguing hints that only crevasses properly aligned toward the incoming seismic surface waves were pinched closed or jacked open, setting off icequakes. However, the evidence is too sparse to test the idea at this time, Walter said.

""For fault zones and tectonic earthquakes, there is a dependence on which direction the wave came from,"" Walter told Live Science. ""We're continuing to work on understanding the phenomenon.""

Like a rolling stone

As Walter notes, just one kind of seismic wave, a surface wave, gets the blame for most of Antarctica's icequakes.

A powerful earthquake the size of the Maule quake unleashes strong seismic waves that ripple around the Earth, some of them racing as fast as the speed of sound before tapering off.

The culprit in this case is called a Rayleigh wave. It travels close to the Earth's surface, rolling along like a wave in a lake or the ocean.

The icequake shaking at different stations occurred as the Rayleigh waves traveled across Antarctica, the study reports. (At some stations, there was also a short icequake burst from a seismic ""P wave,"" which travel through the Earth's interior.)

Peng and his colleagues plan to examine the data from older great earthquakes to see if they also spawned icequakes. Walter is also testing whether distant earthquakes may momentarily change the speed of glaciers, by causing them to suddenly unstick and slide.

""It's an interesting result,"" Walter said. ""A big earthquake on the other side of the world can shift things in the Earth and make it crack.""

India imports about 75% of its oil requirements, and receives 75% of its rains in the southwest monsoon season that runs from June to September, making it very vulnerable to both factors, Padamadan said in an interview.

Edited excerpts:

How would you rate the performance of the Narendra Modi-led government in its first three months? As an investor, are you disappointed on the pace of reforms as well as the government’s failure to push through tough decisions at the start of its tenure, given its large mandate? Do you sense a bit of disappointment with the new government, and what do you think Modi should do to temper the rising pessimism?

As a fundamental investor, I look for changes in the fundamentals. Nothing has changed—yet. This is disappointing. But we are not in a hurry; we expect to see some action in terms of ground-level execution on various fronts in the coming months. There is so much to do, a lot of low-hanging fruits, in terms of getting the basics right: approving coal projects, power supply agreements, etc. Getting those going will have immediate, meaningful impact. All the government has to do is its regular job. Nothing sensational is needed.

India has always found it difficult to do tough decisions due to dysfunctional politics. The same party will oppose a measure when it is in the opposition, while it may have proposed it when it was in power. Therefore, the issue is not the subject matter, but realpolitik. India can ill-afford such loss of time, as time lost is money lost.

But many key reform proposals require cooperation from the states, and there is nothing that Modi or the centre can do about it—be it general sales tax (GST), land acquisition for infrastructure projects, reforms in the electricity sector and labour markets.

The constitution gave certain subjects to the states, and it is hard to change it without revising that foundation. The centre needs to work cooperatively with the states, and this is a mammoth exercise in negotiations. A reasonable compromise can be found if the politicians are willing to find a solution. I am not holding my breath...still waiting for GST negotiations to achieve what separate countries have been able to agree to in Europe, when they created the European Common Market.

You are of the view that despite India enjoying the most favourable demographic profile in the world, looking ahead at the next 10 years, the country will be pinned down due to unknowns such as oil price movements, and also due to the unpredictability of monsoon rainfall. Can you explain this stance?

India imports most of its oil—about 75% —and that makes it vulnerable to oil price hikes. Hedging is not a solution—it only means you pay for the peaks smoothly over time. Until India finds more oil, an investor in India is forced to take a view on Iraq and the Persian Gulf and the price of oil. If they are not doing this, they ought to.

India receives most of its rainfall—again about 75%—in the June-September period. The dependence of agricultural income on a good monsoon is still very large. The percentage of land under irrigation hasn’t reduced the linkage as the water supply comes largely from the monsoon. Average reduction in total GDP (gross domestic product) was 2.6% during 12 droughts since 1960, as per a study by the Reserve Bank of India and HDFC Bank Ltd. Fossil reservoirs are rapidly depleting, and the water table is getting lower each year in most places, as farmers will testify.

I used to be a climate change analyst at a large global bank. In our research, India came out as the most vulnerable of the G20 (group of 20 nations), by the end of the decade. This is just in the base case, with the small continued rise in global temperatures of 0.2°C per decade. We did not model stress scenarios such as drought, El Niño, etc. All El Niño years do not have a drought, but the probability goes up.

According to you, another factor that can derail India’s growth is the fiscal deficit. Can you explain this? Your views on the subsidies regime in India? Farm subsidies have risen each year, causing inflation.

The currency of a country takes its strength from the government’s handling of its budget. The oil subsidy, the monsoon and its impact on agriculture—say farm loan waiver in a drought year—and foodgrain subsidies all add to a high level of uncertainty in government finances. The government can plan, but the oil market and the rain gods might not be in agreement. Since fuel is still subsidized in India, the variations in market prices flow through erratically to the market, with the government picking up the tab for a bulk of the changes. It is partly passed on to some of the government-controlled firms, adding to uncertainty for shareholders of those. The relentless rise of the minimum support price (MSP) pulls up the price of food each year. Instead of setting a floor for the farmer to have a full cost recovery, it is used as a mechanism to increase farming profits to help farmers. And then the government is surprised each year by the rise in grain prices and its attendant feed-through effect, and warns of strict action against speculators. All this without realizing that it is the root cause. It is the biggest speculator—a speculator who also sets prices. The situation is sadly worse than a common speculator, who at least will not allow the grains to go waste. Wasted grain is paid for by the country in higher grain prices at a retail shop.

The policy on farm subsidies is very skewed, and it can only help the rich farmer and not the subsistence farmer in whose name it is carried out. The farmers who need help the most, the subsistence farmers, end up becoming poorer with the rise in MSP. As foodgrain prices rise, the prices of all farm inputs rise—fertilizer, equipment, etc. For farmers with a surplus, there is a net gain as they benefit from higher revenue from the surplus grain they sell. For the subsistence farmer, the higher input costs translate to less grain to eat. The subsistence farmer has nothing to sell, by definition. This is without looking at the effect of NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and labour costs escalation coming from that, that is a different example of a misguided subsidy.

Only 36 million people in India pay income tax. Everyone else wants to live off these 36 million, making all these subsidies skewed. Welfare programmes can be used in a targeted way to help a small section. In India, a small percentage of the population is asked to pay for the majority, making it very unique from a global perspective.

Why are you of the view that India is the most difficult country if one were to come up with a country risk premium?

India has a variety of industries, some of which are global: information technology and healthcare are to be anlaysed as global sectors, with USD revenue. They deserve a different risk premium than a sector whose income is in INR. This fact, coupled with the three unknowns—oil, rainfall, fiscal deficit—make it one of the countries where I give different risk premia for different sectors, assessing the currency of revenue, exposure to each of the major risk factors separately.

Do you think India’s record foreign exchange reserves will act as a cushion against rupee volatility when global interest rates start to climb?

Not enough. India’s reserves are less than that of the islands of Taiwan and Hong Kong. With inflation, everyone’s salaries are at a record lifetime high, in nominal terms, but that doesn’t mean they are rich. India’s forex reserves have to be measured in terms of months of imports—it is just (enough to pay for) six months’ imports. The current account deficit means Indian currency will weaken if foreigners stop putting money into India. India will be forced to raise rates if global interest rates climb, or risk a massive flight of capital. Worst case is that both happen.

Despite global growth, there is no big pick-up in demand for Asian exports—is that a concern? How do you see China over the next two years?

Asian rig builders are seeing robust demand. But it is too late to buy them, it is late in the cycle, and orders may drop precipitously. China will be the giant driver of global growth in the decade to 2020, make no mistake. I spend time every week learning Chinese. China has a large domestic market, with a scale to support global giants. India, unfortunately, has no single domestic market, it is a series of fragmented state markets. Still waiting for GST. India’s global giants are the ones who have for the most part tapped into global markets for their end product—technology and healthcare in particular.

Why are Indian markets rallying—how long will it last? Who is buying India? Do you feel markets, in recent months, have pinned too much hope over when RBI might start paring rates?

I always wonder—who is buying? It is sentiment-driven, based on expectations of reform, for sure. I lose my bearings in sentiment-driven markets as I have no anchor. If investors are coming in based on an expected rate cut, it is a macro bet, the most difficult ones of all. In my personal account, I have 10-year government bonds—which I bought three years back on expectation of a rate cut. I am still waiting.

From the investors’ point of view, what are the best bets in India and Asia currently?

I would skip trying to read the sentiment and look at companies where you can estimate where they will be in 10 years’ time. Infrastructure and power companies are likely to be in a better place than now.

In China, select consumer stocks are nearing attractive entry points. Some China infrastructure companies have exposure to Africa’s infrastructure build-out and they are quite attractive.

In Korea, spin-offs and demergers from the state’s large financial holding group are providing a lot of feedstock for someone like us who love getting into special situations. Also, we see some Korean firms offering attractive entry points—they have global giants trading at single-digit price-earnings ratios.

In Japan, the macro is too hard to call in that export-driven economy. Avoid for now, wait for better opportunities later.

In rest of Asia: most other sectors are quite fully valued. Stock-specific calls are based on a study of business models and specific price points, so I won’t go into them. Apart from these, I see more short candidates than long candidates, or in other words, I see more downside than upside.

Don’t you think the slow pace of India’s recovery is actually good for both firms and policymakers? Policymakers get time to put their house in order and firms can use this time to get their balance sheets in better shape to capitalize on the growth that will come from reforms.

Time lost is money lost. Make a plan and do it on time. Else what is the point? Capital markets reward companies and countries where a good return is earned per unit of time. India needs to have a better sense of time. Indeed, 100 days is too short to evaluate anything. But a chalta hai attitude to decision-making and implementation has been the bane of this illustrious civilization.

46,46,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Rain damage drives EU wheat onto feed market - FeedNavigator.com,https://www.feednavigator.com/Article/2014/08/14/Rain-damage-drives-EU-wheat-onto-feed-market,"“Wet conditions in parts of Western Europe have had an impact on wheat quality, so that more of the EU crop will be destined for the feed market,”? Jack Watts, lead analyst, cereals and oilseeds, with Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Market Intelligence, told FeedNavigator.

Watts speculates that this could prompt some European feed producers to replace imported corn with homegrown wheat in their formulations, particularly given current uncertainty around the size of the Ukrainian corn crop.

Overall, the USDA has reined in its estimates for EU wheat production, although the global picture is one of bumper wheat production.

“A big global wheat crop that just keeps getting bigger is the highlight of the report,”? said Watts.

World wheat production for 2014/15 was raised 10.9mt to a record 716.1mt, with Russia, China and the Ukraine slated for the largest increases, of 6mt, 2mt and 1mt respectively.

“This is being driven by high winter yields, especially for Russia, and will put pressure on the price of Russian and Ukrainian crops, forcing them to be aggressive exporters,”? said Watts.

He added that the current instability, which was reportedly leading to financing issues, was also compounding pressure on Russia and the Ukraine to become keen sellers.

Raise for maize?

Projected US feed grain supplies are also raised, with higher production forecasts for corn, sorghum, barley and oats.

The US agency has raised its projections for corn production, although not by as much as anticipated.

“Our expectation was that the USDA would increase its estimates for US maize yield, which it did, but not as much as people were expecting,”? said Watts.

US corn production for 2014/15 has been revised by 172 million bushels, putting it at a record 14,032 million bushels, and Watts believes this figure will be upgraded in coming months.

“It is likely the USDA will gradually increase its US maize forecast over time; the outlook is bearish for feed prices,” ?he said.

The projected season-average farm price for corn has been lowered by 10 cents at both ends of the range to $3.55 to $4.25 per bushel.

EU corn production projections have also been revised upwards by 1.4mt after “abundant rainfall and favourable temperatures”? during July.

On the back of these larger than expected corn crops in both the US and EU, the USDA has increased its projections for global coarse grain supplies by 4.9mt.

This updated figure also reflects higher production forecasts for barley production in the former Soviet Union countries, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

However, the delayed monsoon has dampened prospects for corn, sorghum and millet in India, where total coarse grain production predictions have been downgraded by 2.7mt.

Slight adjustments for soybean?

There were also minor revisions to the forecast for soybean products. Production has been revised by 16 million up to 3,816 million bushels, due to a higher yield, and supplies for 2014/15 are projected slightly above last month based on this forecast.

The US season-average soybean price for 2014/15 is forecast at $9.35 to $11.35 per bushel, down 15 cents on both ends. Soybean meal and oil prices are forecast at $340 to $380, down $10 at the midpoint. Soybean oil prices are forecast at 35 to 39 cents per pound, down 1 cent at the midpoint.

However, higher US production is offset by a reduction for India, where the delayed monsoon has resulted in a lower planted area.","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/9/3/9/7/3187939-1-eng-GB/Rain-damage-drives-EU-wheat-onto-feed-market.jpg,"['eu', 'soybean', 'forecast', 'russia', 'drives', 'corn', 'production', 'usda', 'wheat', 'damage', 'million', 'market', 'higher', 'feed', 'rain']", ,none
47,47,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Why Business Leaders Support a Price on Carbon - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/08/11/business-leaders-support-carbon-pricing,"The companies we turn to every day for electricity, transportation, consumer goods, and even electronics face risks from climate change. Most need reliable water for production processes and products. Extreme weather and temperatures can hurt their productivity and damage their supply chains and assets.

Business leaders understand that climate change can have real economic impact, and that their current business models may not be profitable in a 4-degree warmer world. They also see opportunity in innovating for a cleaner future.

Several global companies, including Google, Walmart, and Shell, have started using an internal “shadow price” on carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, in their investment planning to help avoid risks and find opportunities that can increase energy and resource efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions, and give them a competitive edge. A few industries internally pricing emissions won’t move an entire industry to better practices, though; a sector- or economy-wide price on emissions can.

In about 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces, these companies and others also work with a formal price on emissions that is set or planned for entire sectors or economies through carbon taxes or carbon markets. That price on carbon, as it frequently referred to, sends a consistent economic signal that investing in cleaner, low-carbon growth can pay off for everyone.

Business leaders are increasingly speaking out in favor of expanding those carbon pricing policies.

More than 250 companies have already joined a statement that is being organized by the World Bank Group and partners including the World Economic Forum, UN Global Compact, and the Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group encouraging governments to explore carbon pricing methods and set their own predictable price on carbon.

Flexibility, innovation & efficiency

The energy giant GDF Suez, sees carbon pricing as a cost-effective way of addressing climate change while letting businesses choose how they lower their emissions. The France-based multinational operates on five continents in about 70 countries – some of which have carbon pricing systems in place. In positioning itself for the future, the company is aggressively developing renewable energy resources to reduce its carbon footprint, a move that has put it at the cutting edge of the energy sector.

“We at GDF Suez support carbon pricing because we believe there is a need to address risks linked to climate change, and we support action to address emissions reductions cost effectively. We are in favor of market-based approaches and emissions trading which allow business the flexibility to reduce when and where it makes the most business sense,” the company wrote in adding its name to the public statement encouraging governments worldwide to put a price on carbon.

KDF Energy of Romania, another supporter of the carbon pricing statement, writes that “carbon pricing improves the efficiency of the economy, and it is a signal for investment in low-carbon and resilient economic growth.”

Software company Microsoft, which uses shadow carbon pricing, describes similar benefits from its internal carbon fee model. It says the internal pricing mechanism provides justification to prioritize efficiency at every level of the organization. “We’ve found over time that the more we can integrate sustainability goals across the business, the better position we are in to respond to changing economic, social and environmental conditions. Our carbon fee model supports a culture of innovation and efficiency,” Microsoft told CDP for a recent report on internal carbon pricing.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['change', 'internal', 'emissions', 'economic', 'carbon', 'price', 'business', 'energy', 'leaders', 'support', 'pricing', 'efficiency', 'climate']", ,none

It is dreaded, frustrating, and horrible. Sitting helplessly in your car takes a great emotional toll on you. Stress brought by the traffic jam is very challenging to manage, especially with all the honking and cursing in your surroundings.

What once used to be traveled only for 20 minutes is now taking double the time. With the idle hours caused by the traffic jam, you might as well try something productive. Instead of having an awful mood that could ruin your whole day and a high blood pressure which could harm your health, you may try these things to alleviate the stress while waiting for the traffic mess to get fixed.

Use the steering wheel as your own stress ball

Tightening your grip on the steering wheel, just like how you tighten your grip on a stress ball is an effective tension reliever. Clutch it tightly, hold for five seconds, then release. Repeat until you’re relaxed. This also focuses you on something besides the traffic.

50,50,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Accelerating a Cycle of Violence: Tallying the Damage to Gaza’s Youth - New Security Beat,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2014/08/accelerating-cycle-violence-tallying-damage-gazas-youth/,"Amid stop-and-start ceasefires, the tally of death and destruction from the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip has begun. Whatever the final losses incurred – casualties and damage are considerable with estimates varying significantly depending on the source – Gaza’s youngest residents are likely to be most profoundly affected.

As money for school fees disappear and soldiers grow scarce, young people leave classrooms and enter battlefields

Young people tend to suffer most from violent conflict; as money for school fees disappear and soldiers grow scarce, they leave classrooms and enter battlefields, with consequences that follow them for the rest of their lives. Girls – who are pulled out of school at much higher rates than boys, are more likely to be married off while underage, and are often the targets of sexual violence that accompanies conflict – are particularly vulnerable.

But Gazan youth face an even more severe set of challenges, rooted in the area’s unique demographics, geography, and history of violence. Growing at a rapid rate, Gaza is both one of the most youthful and most densely populated areas in the world, all within a mere 139 square miles that have been blockaded by Israel and Egypt for nearly a decade.

The physical, social, economic, and psychological tolls from the most recent fighting between Hamas and Israel will exacerbate these challenges, shaping the lives of the young people of Gaza for years to come.

Falling Further and Further Behind

There are 1.2 million people under the age of 25 in Gaza, representing 65 percent of the total population. The average age is 18 (compare to the global average of 28). Even with a projected decline in total fertility from 4.4 children per woman to 2.3 by 2030, Gaza’s population is expected to balloon to 2.6 million people by 2030 and 3.4 million by 2050, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

A 2012 UN report predicted that without major changes, Gaza will be virtually “unlivable” by 2020

How many of the 1,800 to 2,200 Palestinians reportedly killed during the recent fighting were under the age of 25 is up for debate, but high casualty rates can be assumed as most of the territory’s population, as well as the majority of Hamas combatants, are relatively young. There are reports of anywhere between 400 and 500 children killed, and at least 1,000 of the 3,000 injured are expected to suffer lifelong disabilities, according to the UN. Israel has suffered youth casualties as well: 64 soldiers were killed, many of whom were likely under 25 and it was the deaths of three teenage boys that sparked the fighting over a month ago.

Young people also bear the brunt of damage to infrastructure, services, and the economy in Gaza. Estimates include $50 million in infrastructural damage, over 17,200 destroyed homes and 390,000 displaced individuals as of August 20, and $6 billion in economic losses. At least 142 damaged or destroyed schools have been reported by UNICEF, and at least 90 UN schools have been occupied by displaced families. The Ministry of Education has postponed the August 24 start of the new school year indefinitely.

Even before the recent conflict, restrictions on Gaza’s borders and access to farming and fishing had pushed food insecurity to 60 percent and aid dependency to 80 percent this year, according to the International Labor Organization. In an economy choked of resources but increasingly flooded with workers, unemployment is rampant. Youth unemployment in Gaza stood at 57 percent in 2013, compared to 30 percent in the West Bank.

A 2012 UN report predicted that without major changes, Gaza will be virtually “unlivable” by 2020, as its economy, education system, infrastructure, and social services crumble. But if Hamas and Israel continue to clash, that timeline will be greatly accelerated.

Dislocation and Despair

Through the distorting lens of instability, violence can actually become palatable to young people. The gradual descent of youth into cycles of violence is guided by a complex, interrelated set of push and pull factors, said Maryanne Yerkes, a senior civil society and youth advisor at USAID, at the U.S. Institute of Peace earlier this year. These factors include job availability, education enrollment, demographic exclusion, and social stability, which can converge in ways that prevent youth from completing the transition to adulthood and leave them permanently excluded from society.

Former Wilson Center fellow and current visiting researcher at Boston University’s African Studies Center Marc Sommers has explored this phenomenon in Rwanda and the Palestinian Territories, finding ways that the path to adulthood is blocked by conflict and poorly managed development. In Rwanda, for example, land management policies meant to protect the poor actually restricted the ability of young men to build their own houses, a critical step towards maturity and social recognition.

For some, psychological trauma from growing up in a conflict zone can be a barrier. After Israel’s 2012 offensive in Gaza, a UNICEF rapid psycho-social assessment found that 91 percent of children surveyed in Gaza had difficulty sleeping, 85 percent struggled to concentrate, and 82 percent reported feelings of anger and symptoms of mental strain.

As noted in The New York Times, anyone over the age of seven in Gaza has lived through at least three sustained Israeli attacks. And at least half of all Gazans between 15 and 19 years old suffered from full or partial post-traumatic stress disorder after clashes in 2008 and 2009, according to a study published in the Arab Journal of Psychiatry.

Anyone over the age of seven in Gaza has lived through at least three sustained Israeli attacks

Such mental trauma, combined with the hopelessness of Gaza’s outlook, may have contributed to a sharp uptick in suicide attempts in 2013 – the vast majority committed by youth – which Palestinian officials blamed on “educational problems and unemployment,” as well as “harsh living conditions” such as food, water, and housing shortages.

In the absence of viable paths to adulthood, participation in violence often fills the void. During the First Intifada, Sommers explained at the U.S. Institute of Peace, “Palestinian male youth were using violent resistance to the Israeli military as a contemporary rite of passage into manhood” and were “welcomed as heroes” after imprisonment by Israeli forces.

It is difficult to determine to what extent this same path is being followed by young people today. Although Hamas militants are predominately between 20 and 29 years old, a 2013 study from the Arab World for Research and Development found that 48 percent of Palestinians in Gaza aged 18 to 30 would support a populist uprising against the organization.

As Missiles Soar, So Do Child Marriage Rates

Young girls are even more disproportionally affected by conflict in ways that damage tallies do not reveal. Not only do levels of sexual violence and sex trafficking tend to rise during violent conflict, but child marriage rates do too, sharply limiting the potential of thousands of girls, as the Council on Foreign Relations’ Gayle Tzemach Lemmon explains in a recent working paper.

“Child marriage does not cause fragile states, but it does reinforce poverty, limit girls’ education, stymie economic progress, and, as a result, contribute to regional instability”

Nine of the top ten countries with the world’s highest child marriage rates are on the OECD list of fragile states, which includes Palestine. In these states, where families face economic insecurity and gender-based violence is routine, many parents see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters and ease the financial burden of supporting girls who can’t earn substantial wages and sometimes require higher medical fees and dowries. Marriage also becomes a more enticing path when girls drop out of school due to damaged classrooms or dangerous routes to class, as Lemmon explains.

In Gaza, electricity shortages have added to these pressures by increasing the daily household workload for women and girls, keeping more girls home and out of school.

Palestine’s overall child marriage rate of 19 percent falls below that of several of its neighbors, according to the Population Reference Bureau. But in Gaza, the issue is far more acute: 35 percent of the 17,000 registered matrimonies in 2012 involved brides under the age of 17, according to a report by Al-Monitor. Sociologist Fadel Abu Hein told the paper in 2013 that poverty and unemployment are key drivers of early and forced marriage, and a study published in Genus from 2006 found during the First Intifada that Gazan women were encouraged to marry earlier so they could bear as many children as possible to augment the territory’s military capacity.

The result is that every spike in violence brings with it new risks for young girls and women. These vulnerabilities may even contribute to perpetuating instability, writes Lemmon. “Child marriage does not cause fragile states, but it does reinforce poverty, limit girls’ education, stymie economic progress, and, as a result, contribute to regional instability.”

The Importance of Hope

Caught in the crossfire of history they had no part in, the senseless murder of four Israeli and Palestinian boys that sparked this summer’s conflict is sadly symbolic of the plight of the region’s young people.

Every violent exchange between Hamas and Israel darkens an already bleak future for Gazan youth

Although some observers are focused on deciding political wins and losses, both Israel and Palestine, as well as the international community, will lose out if the youngest generations – part of the world’s largest generations – continue to sink into despair. A Gaza where young people have no alternatives to joining the cycle of violence is one that will undoubtedly continue to produce dangerous politics.

The confluence of factors that make Gaza’s young people so vulnerable to each new round of violence cannot easily be tracked or quantified, but a closer look reveals the need for interventions that provide hope to young people through education, job training, and girls’ and women’s empowerment.

Instead, by destroying opportunities and services for youth in a place where both are hard to come by, every violent exchange between Hamas and Israel darkens an already bleak future for Gazan youth, subverting stability in the region for decades to come.","Thu, 27 Aug 2015 03:35:56 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GAZA-300x218.jpg,"['israel', 'hamas', 'youth', 'tallying', 'gazas', 'education', 'damage', 'young', 'marriage', 'conflict', 'violence', 'accelerating', 'gaza', 'girls', 'cycle']", ,none

53,53,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Lunch with the FT: Xavier López Ancona - Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/1bc2e7f6-17e1-11e4-b842-00144feabdc0,"There is more than a touch of Willy Wonka about Xavier López Ancona. Roald Dahl’s Wonka created an astonishing world of chocolate inside his factory, and the Mexican entrepreneur oozes the same excitement about KidZania, the amusement parks where children play at working in adult jobs. He founded the company 15 years ago and there are now 16 branches worldwide, with several more, including one in London, under construction.

We have arranged to meet, somewhat unimaginatively, at the restaurant below his office – but then the plan changes. López would like to take me on a tour of his newest KidZania park in Mexico City, and we’ll grab lunch afterwards.

I head to his headquarters in the Santa Fe business district on the western edge of the city, a neighbourhood of gleaming skyscrapers, commanding towering rents to match, built on what was once a rubbish dump. He is in a meeting when I arrive. I had been expecting him to exude a hip Google vibe to match his open-plan offices where employees work for fictional “ministries” in the service of a republic run by children (who make up 65 per cent of the 35m people who have so far visited KidZania theme parks) and everyone is on first-name terms. When the boss emerges, however, he is dressed formally in navy blazer and grey trousers.

López, 50, is chatty and friendly as we discuss whether to speak English or Spanish (we stick to Spanish). He prefers to drive himself around and, with mercifully little traffic, it takes less than half an hour down the motorway to reach the southern neighbourhood of Cuicuilco (pronounced “Kwi-Kwilco”), possibly the Valley of Mexico’s oldest settlement, where I am to see the shape of KidZania to come.

This third and newest park in Mexico – one is in Santa Fe and the other in the northern city of Monterrey – is the biggest yet, a kind of “KidZania 2.0”, López says. The company’s European flagship park is taking shape (passers-by can already see a giant KidZania sign) at west London’s Westfield shopping centre. It opens next year, and other new projects include, he hopes, a US park by 2016.

At Cuicuilco, the Wonka-ness goes into overdrive: López beams as he inducts me into the KidZania concept – each park is a child-scale city. Visitors enter with pretend passports through an airport terminal, then spend the day role-playing at working, for which they earn the park’s local currency (which they can spend) while their parents trail along behind.

Instead of Wonka’s Oompa Loompas, there are fully grown staff speaking the KidZania lingo: “kai” for hello (this comes with a splayed finger-over-the-heart gesture that makes me think of Star Trek) and the message: “Have a productive day.” (The correct response, in case you’re wondering, is “ZanKs”, and goodbye is “Z-U”.)

López gallops along, as excited as a child showing off a new toy with loads of cool features. I must drive on the car track, he insists, presenting me with a personalised KidZania licence. “Oh! we must look in here,” he says, leaping to see how the park’s banknotes (called KidZos) are made. We zip around the “town” as he shows me how children can rent mobile phones, make tortillas, build a motorbike, recycle Tetra Pak packaging, make frozen yoghurt, open a bank account, film a television show, put on a play, be a firefighter, a judge or courier and much, much more.

On top of the current 16 locations in 13 countries – all except Cuicuilco (part of which is outside) are indoor attractions – 11 more KidZanias are under construction: as well as London, there are projects in cities including Delhi, Singapore, São Paulo and Doha. None is as big as Cuicuilco, which opened in May 2012; nor will they offer as many “edutainment” activities. Kid­Zania’s pitch is that children love role play, so it lets them play at doing the jobs adults do.

Everyone gets a KidZos cheque on arrival, which they have to cash, and they can earn more only by working at different jobs. They can spend their KidZos (on food, treats or entertainment such as go-karting) but if they run out, they need to do more work to earn more. They can open a bank account, deposit their cheque, be issued with a debit card and use cash machines. Just like grown-ups.

It is “performance with purpose”, says López after we leave KidZania and the buzz of children on school holidays, and cross the car park to a yellow-fronted Argentine restaurant called Piantao where, he assures me (deftly slipping in that he knows I am vegetarian) that the pasta is good.

It’s a slight relief, for someone as shopping centre-phobic as me, to be back out in daylight. López is keen to sit outside. We are ushered to a table on a patio with open sides and a glass roof. The other tables quickly fill up with shoppers, their children playing on a grassy bank in the patio area, and with workers from local offices.

How about pasties – empanadas – to start, he suggests, and a grilled cheese called provoleta to share? He orders a diet fizzy apple drink and I ask for mineral water.

López turned 50 in April – “I’m on the fifth floor now,” he jokes, and is very trim, having lost 11kg on a Kid­Zania employees’ challenge two years ago. After taking part in a marathon with his staff, he wants to do a triathlon next year and tells me he is about to run a half-marathon in San Francisco. He admits to being ambitious and driven. “I want to do it all,” he says. He was born in Mexico City in 1964 and his father worked at a variety of businesses, largely in the food industry, while his mother stayed at home with the seven children. López is not married and has no children himself but has 16 nephews and nieces.

When his pasty comes, he’s pleased to see that it is baked, not fried – “it’s healthier like that” – but still proceeds to cut off all the pastry and eat just the meat inside. “I’m very pernickety,” he smiles, “but only about food”. I am not so lucky – my spinach and cheese pasty is fried but I eat it anyway.

…

There’s a question I’ve been burning to ask ever since my son went to a birthday party at KidZania: don’t these theme parks just push consumerism? There are big brands and fast food everywhere, reinforcing corporate marketing messages. Almost all KidZanias are in malls and though they are designed to mimic a city, the “shopping centre” feel is everywhere.

There are few [Mexican] success stories for kids to think “I could be him”

López responds by stressing, first, that his parks are “more educational every day” and there are plenty of neutral activities – such as being a judge, doctor or policeman, attending the KidZania university, visiting the tax office or recycling plastic bottles – that are less brand-focused. Also, he says, kids are quietly learning about supply and demand: activities that are not so sought-after are also cheaper than being a firefighter or making pizza – and that has its appeal when the supply of KidZos is running low.

The company likes to say that its 800 global “industry partners” – these are the names visitors see inside KidZania, including Nestlé, American Airlines, Mitsubishi, Johnson & Johnson, Honda, Unilever and Nike – “authenticate the content”. In other words, the mini versions of stores, banks and offices with their familiar logos make the role-play real. López looks a bit puzzled by my question about consumerism. Without “industry partners”, he has no product, after all. And though he doesn’t say it, I am sure that he thinks the role play would be abstract – and boring for kids – without the real brands.

The role play is so real, in fact, that children can use earned KidZos to buy trinkets, or save them over several visits to buy a bigger item – such as a games console (or, more oddly, a food mixer) from the park’s department store. Indeed, López is far less concerned about brand bombardment than about stressing to me that there are no video games inside his parks: KidZania, he says, is about good old-fashioned play and learning.

He also flatly rejects any suggestion that the parks push fast food, even if the sports stadium is sponsored by Coca-Cola. Domino’s, where visitors make and eat their own pizza, is there “because the children love that – they make it and get to take away the finished product,” but he stresses that sushi and sandwiches are also on offer. The food issue is a bit of a raw nerve – the company is, in fact, phasing out one fast-food supplier. “We want parents to feel comfortable,” he says, before steering the conversation back to safer topics.

We have to go where the cities are, and 60 per cent of [world] population is in Asia

The main courses arrive. López has a flank steak, called vacío, and salad, and picks absent-mindedly at the chips that come with it. My fettuccine with pesto is tasty but unremarkable. López has been called the “Mexican Walt Disney” for the way he has carved out a new niche in the entertainment industry. While Disney theme parks offer children a few minutes of pure magic on a thrilling ride, there is also the prospect of hours of queueing and long walks from one attraction to another. López’s vision for KidZania is, rather, that visitors are “learning, being entertained, being engaged” at all times – and that’s important, since education is Mexico’s major problem, he says. “We are a good example of a Mexican company that can grow internationally. Mexico needs entrepreneurs. There are very few success stories for kids to think, ‘I could be him.’”

He says he never set out to be an entrepreneur. After studying for a year at a high school in Tulsa he went back to Mexico for a business administration degree and then took an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois.

“When I was doing my masters, everyone was talking about consulting,” López recalls. So he joined Booz Allen Hamilton in Mexico. “In consulting, everyone wanted to change to private equity. I got headhunted but I said no, I loved consulting.”

In 1996 he did move on, to General Electric, where he was vice-president of the equity capital group. And he loved that, too, although he noticed that in private equity, “everyone wanted to start their own business”. Again, he didn’t think too much about it until an old school friend approached him with an idea to launch nurseries focusing on role-play activities for children. He worked on the plan for months in his spare time before asking for a sabbatical from GE to see if the idea had legs. His boss chided him that he was “just playing at his little business” before giving him six months off: López never looked – or went – back.

The kindergarten idea morphed into KidZania and the first park opened in Santa Fe in 1999. López later bought out his school friend-turned-business partner, Luis Javier Laresgoiti. It is a not a subject he wants to dwell on.

López is a very wealthy man (it’s hard to tell exactly how wealthy, as KidZania does not make its revenue figures public). He owns the three Mexican KidZanias outright and franchises the rest. His only extravagance appears to be cruise holidays. He has driven me here in his Volkswagen car and, I note, he is wearing a plastic watch and a bracelet from a KidZania souvenir shop.

In the UK, his KidZania franchise partner is the entrepreneur Joel Cadbury (who is, perhaps appropriately, a member of the British chocolate dynasty). Company projections aim for 1m visitors at the London park each year, which will help KidZania towards a worldwide target of 10m visitors annually. The parks cost up to $35m to build and admission costs range from around $15 in Mumbai to nearly $50 in Tokyo.

In the US, López is planning a different approach and intends to team up with a US partner (he won’t name it) for a launch, probably in Chicago or Dallas. He is currently conducting due diligence and hopes to have a deal signed and sealed “well before the end of this year”.

When KidZania was proving itself a successful concept, he tested the waters in the US but bowed to the counsel of, among others, Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who told him he was not ready and should build successful franchises outside Mexico before targeting the US. “It was quite good advice,” he smiles. Starbucks much later became a company partner in Kuwait and Istanbul (although the Starbucks outlets in KidZania offer refreshments for weary accompanying adults, not activities for children).

While Mexican companies had traditionally looked south to Central America or north to the US, KidZania became only the second Mexican group to invest in Japan, and the first in Indonesia and Kuwait. Parks have followed in places such as Seoul, Cairo and Istanbul – although Kid­Zania is not yet operating in China. That may well change: “We have to go where the cities are, and 60 per cent of the population is in Asia.”

López sees himself as a national trailblazer: “We need more Mexican brands,” he says. Aside from cement company Cemex, baking group Bimbo and beer brands such as Corona, Mexico has only a few companies that are international household names. This is a message he likes to stress whenever he is invited to conferences, and though he says he avoids dishing out criticism at such events, he says that Mexico also “needs a better image . . . outside Mexico, this country’s image is terrible”.

Indeed, just as we are finishing our meals, it belatedly occurs to him that we should have gone to a different restaurant, “somewhere more Mexican to promote Mexico. I just didn’t think.”

He recommends the “very good chocolate dessert” but skips it himself with a practised “Oh no, I’m on a diet.” I skip it too. After coffee (on the house) I pick up the bill. It’s hard for a Mexican man to accept being invited by a woman, and López has already said he wants to pay, but reluctantly accepts the FT’s rules.

We drive back to KidZania HQ, where he immediately dashes up the stairs to find someone going my way home who can give me a lift through the clogged rush-hour traffic. He says he goes to work happy, and it shows. “I love my job and my product,” he smiles. No wonder: he says he has margins of 20 to 30 per cent and sees returns in three to five years, above the industry average. “It’s a good business,” he says. “We’re doing good, and doing well.”

55,55,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,6 Inconvenient Skin Treatments I've Tried for Psoriasis - Everyday Health,https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/howard-chang-the-itch-to-beat-psoriasis/inconvenient-skin-treatments-ive-tried-psoriasis/,"Skin treatments can be especially inconvenient and uncomfortable. Recently my dermatologist prescribed an at-home treatment I had never heard of before, wet wrap therapy (WWT). As I listened to the instructions I thought, “Easy for you to say, but it sounds really messy.” At first I protested, telling him that I would need to travel over the weekend. My four-day weekend road trip would interrupt the two-week trial run. No matter, he said I could take what I needed with me. A doctor can give instructions in a few minutes, print out an article to read, and go on his way. The patient, on the other hand, is left with the burden of carrying them out day in and day out.

Over the years I’ve tried many different skin treatments and regimens. Some of them have been quite easy to administer — as easy as popping a couple of pills a day. Others involved travel, gooey messes of ointments, or smelly concoctions. Some worked better than others, none have been effective long term.

What follows are some of the most inconvenient and uncomfortable skin treatments I’ve tried in treating psoriasis, eczema, and other skin conditions.

Coal Tar

As a child I slathered liquid coal tar in a petrolatum base all over my body each night, sleeping in greasy pajamas. My sheets, clothes, and even bathtub were stained from the tar residue. When I visited the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles I told my kids, “That’s what my tar treatment used to smell like.” They wrinkled their noses at me. Imagine putting that all over your skin at bedtime as an eight year old.

Phototherapy

Over the years I’ve undergone various light treatments. As a child my mom took me out of school three days a week and drove me thirty-five minutes each way to the hospital. Since those early days I’ve traveled up to forty-five minutes each way to clinics for broadband ultraviolet B treatment (UVB), narrowband UVB (NUVB), and Psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA). One memorable time I drove through snow and ice to get to the clinic, only to find out that the light box nurse didn’t make it to work. I could not restrain my displeasure, giving the clinic administrator an earful.

Anthralin Paste

After high school graduation, while others departed for graduation trips, I drove to a psoriasis treatment clinic near Stanford University. For six weeks, five days a week, I took a bus from my relative’s house to the daycare clinic. There I would stay for five to six hours. The day started with scalp treatments, then progressed to applying a paste with anthralin on EVERY psoriasis sore I had. That took a while and even frustrated the nurse when I did not improve as quickly as she wanted. I wore pajamas over the paste and couldn’t go anywhere. After the required time elapsed, I washed off the paste, took a dose of ultraviolet light, and rode the bus back to the house.

Injections at the Hospital

A couple of times I needed to go to the hospital for injections. The pills upset my stomach for days at a time so my doctor thought I could inject it in my hip, as some cancer patients do. Methotrexate was the first. The injection hurt more than any other I had before, and, unfortunately, did not help my upset stomach. After a few weeks of losing a day or two of work a week, and little improvement, I stopped the treatment.

In the early 2000’s biologic treatments came to market. One of the first is called Amevive. When it first came out I had it administered in the oncology clinic intravenously. The injection itself did not take long, but the waiting, prep, and staying after to make sure I did not have an adverse reaction to the treatment took a couple hours. The worst part? My skin got worse, not better, over time.

Chinese Herbal Remedies

I’m Chinese American so when someone asks me if I’ve tried Chinese medicine I just smile. I grew up near San Francisco, which has a large and active Chinatown. As a child my family drove into “The City” to buy groceries and, yes, visit the Chinese herbal doctors and medicine stores. Boiling the herbs made the house smell and took hours to prepare. But drinking the bitter medicine proved to be much worse. Don’t tell my parents that I sometimes poured it down the drain.

Another Chinese medication involved snake powder. I mixed it with water and drank it. After a couple weeks I started gaining lots of weight and retaining water. Suffice to say that some of that toxic mixture also ended up in the drain.

I did have one success story, however, with Chinese medicine. When I went to China after college graduation one doctor gave me a solution I put on my skin twice a day. For the duration of my trip my psoriasis cleared completely. I couldn’t find that solution again, and once I returned home it stopped working anyhow.

Wet Wrap Therapy (WWT)

Over the past few weeks I have administered wet wrap therapy at-home and on the road. The treatment is primarily for eczema, but it helps my psoriasis too. WWT involves bathing, slathering (my doctor’s word not mine) a medium strength topical corticosteroid ointment on my skin, then covering it with wet clothes. Over the wet clothes I put a layer of dry clothes which helps keep the wet clothes damp. After about an hour I re-wet the wet layer of clothes. Some leave the wet clothes on overnight, or for some hours. I usually leave it for about two to three hours in the evening. The treatment moisturizes the skin, allows the medicine to penetrate the skin, and cools inflammation.

Worth the Trouble?

For all the inconvenience skin treatments might present, some have worked quite well. Currently, wet wrap therapy is amazingly effective at calming my skin irritation and itch. After two weeks I returned to see my dermatologist to show him the results of the WWT experiment. He was amazed at how well it worked and wished he had prescribed it earlier. Now I am testing how often I need to do the treatment to keep my skin conditions under control. My skin's become sensitive to coal tar, but I had good results in the past and heard great results from others. At this last visit my doctor mentioned that some using a therapy called Goeckermann (coal tar with phototherapy) can go into remission. While I didn't do well with methotrexate or Amevive, and I haven't used phototherapy in a while, going to the hospital or clinic can be a life saver if effective for you (some have used phototherapy at home to make light treatment much more accessible). Despite the ill smells, cost, and time involved, complementary treatments such as Chinese medicine offer alternatives to conventional approaches that many people are seeking.

As inconvenient or uncomfortable skin treatments may be, I have no doubt I’ll keep trying them. It's worth the trouble as long as there's hope for relief.

""Since the beginning of the collaboration it has been clear that a solo exhibition of Eliasson's work at Louisiana would inevitably be a radical, site-specific exhibition dealing with the reality of the museum as an institution and physical locality,"" said a statement from the museum.

""Movement through the space at Humblebaek has always been at the heart of the experience – the architects have made sure of that, and Eliasson wishes to profile this as the most important feature in Louisiana.""

Visitors can walk on the rocky surface, which slopes up towards the sides of a series of rooms that make up the museum's south wing. A narrow path running through the spaces has been filled with water to recreate the trickle at the bottom of a dried river.

At the top of the south wing, a library has been created to house a collection of Eliasson's art books – including a new publication produced for the exhibition featuring landscape photographs of Iceland from 1986 to 2013 – and digital screens to provide access to his online archive.

Eliasson has also created a series of geometric models with Icelandic artist Einar Thorsteinn to add to his Model Room, which has been in progress since 2003 and will be hosted in the museum's north wing during the exhibition.

The building's main hall will show three video works – a portrait of Berlin called Innen Stadt Aussen from 2010; an exploration of a Chinese garden in Suzhou through movements created by choreographer Steen Koerner titled Your Embodied Garden filmed in 2011; and Movement Microscope, a 2013 movie that follows a group of dancers in Eliasson's own studio.

The exhibition is due to open to the public on 20 August.","Tue, 19 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2014/08/Riverbed-by-Olafur-Eliasson_dezeen_468_SQ2.jpg,"['art', 'titled', 'olafur', 'fills', 'eliasson', 'exhibition', 'louisiana', 'giant', 'eliassons', 'museum', 'created', 'south', 'modern', 'wing', 'danish', 'landscape']", ,none

Please say it isn't so!

The answer: I hate to say this, because I used to love relaxing in flip-flops or wearing them to show off a pedicure, but most sandals are not great for your feet – and flip-flops are the worst offenders.

Since they don't offer heel, arch or lateral support, they alter both how you walk (your gait) and how you stand.

Story continues below advertisement

Your foot is kinesthetically linked to your entire body. Altering how your foot interacts with the ground causes the rest of your body to compensate, which can result in injuries to the knees, hip and back, not to mention to the foot itself.

Lack of support can cause the foot to overpronate (roll in) or oversupinate (roll out), stressing the fascia. This stress can lead to inflammation and heel pain (commonly referred to as plantar fasciitis).

Unfortunately, the list continues: Flip-flops also cause the toes to grip. This, yet again, affects gait and can result in trigger points developing in your feet and lower legs, inflammation, hammer toes and bunions.

Since the back of the flip-flop slaps against your heel, blisters and chafing can develop and, in the worst cases, a stress fracture can develop.

Now, I am not arguing you should never wear flip-flops. If you really love them, no matter what I say, you will most likely keep wearing them in some capacity. Just use common sense. Don't wear them to walk any distance, while carrying anything heavy or while standing for long periods.

My personal rule is to think of them as water-shoes: Only wear them in the shower or around the pool.

If you must wear sandals daily, wear ones with a heel strap or full-heel support. And make sure they fit. This may sound obvious, but many people rationalize sloppy summer shoes by thinking ""they are just sandals.""

Trainer's tip: Clean or replace your sandals regularly to get rid of icky bacteria. You should also inspect them closely every few weeks. You need to prioritize more supportive shoes if your sandals are more worn on one side than the other.

Did you know that other than strengthening your bones calcium calms anxiety issues, decreases blood sugar and lowers high blood pressure. This popular nutrient can be found in multiple foods such as milk, almonds, organic yogurt, almond milk and leafy greens. More greens, please. Also Read - Explained: What Happens When Black Fungus Enters Your Brain

2. Potassium

Also Read - Post-Covid Care: Easy Steps to Rebuild Your Immunity at Home

Potassium allows your body to keep an equal water balance, and similar to calcium helps lower your blood pressure. This nutrient an easy find as it exists in various snacks, such as nuts, dried fruits, yogurt, celery, fish, leafy greens, tomatoes, avocados, sweet potato, seeds and cucumber.

3. Magnesium

The great thing about the third nutrient, magnesium, is its effect to help you effortlessly fall asleep. Not only does magnesium lower blood pressure and reduce anxiety, but it can also cure headaches–especially PMS. Although a good portion of magnesium can be found in multivitamins and magnesium supplements, the best way to get the most of this nutrient is through food. Carrots, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, dark chocolate, bananas, fish and kiwi are all great sources of magnesium.

4. Iron

A popular nutrient that you may remember your parents telling you about is iron. Eating an iron-rich diet can help get rid of fatigue and help you kiss insomnia goodbye. Iron is most commonly found in beans, red meat, and broccoli

5. Vitamin B6

Vitamin B6 attacks stress and calms your nervous system. It is a win-win nutrient. Foods like bananas, eggs, oats, avocados, peanut butter, yogurt, cashews, fish, spinach, tomatoes and sweet potatoes all have vitamin B6.

6. Proteins

Proteins is a common nutrient that lowers stress hormones and insulin. Great foods that have protein are eggs, beans, leafy greens, seafood, nuts, oats, seeds, meat and cheese.

7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Omega-3 fatty acid fights off stress, tries to increase relaxation on the body, improves your sleep and heals inflammation. Eggs, walnuts, chia seeds and hemp all have omega-3 fatty acids.

8. Tryptophan

The eighth nutrient, tryptophan, relaxes your nervous system. Incorporating more tryptophan into your diet can help you reach a peaceful mind that always leads to a better sleep. This nutrient is found in chicken, turkey, eggs, sweet potatoes, pumpkin seeds, yogurt, leafy greens and almonds.

It is time to stock up on your nutrients. Be strong, healthy and finally get that good night’s sleep you have been craving.","Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8essentialnutrientssleep.jpg,"['better', 'greens', 'help', 'sleep', 'eggs', 'leafy', 'nutrients', 'essential', 'seeds', 'magnesium', 'yogurt', 'sweet', 'nutrient', 'nights']", ,none
59,59,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,The unexpected costs of rebalancing and how to address them - Pensions & Investments,https://www.pionline.com/article/20140827/ONLINE/140829911/the-unexpected-costs-of-rebalancing-and-how-to-address-them,"A passive buy-and-hold strategy is an alternative to a strategy of rebalancing to fixed weight. The capital allocation within the portfolio will drift as market prices change, but the investor remains passive. In contrast, the active rebalancing strategy will restore the target fixed weights.

The motivations behind a rebalancing strategy are straightforward. First, the drifting weights, implied by the buy-and-hold approach, might become extreme as assets diverge and few investors would remain passive indefinitely. The strategy of rebalancing to fixed weights puts this adjustment process on a regular schedule.

The so-called “rebalancing premium” is a second motivation for the fixed-weights strategy. The premium refers to the extra returns that the rebalancing process generates under certain circumstances. Consider how such profits might arise. Divergent asset performance will cause the weights to differ from the target allocation. To restore the desired allocation, the investor must buy some of the underperforming assets and sell some of the outperformers. Buying low and selling high has an intuitive appeal, and provided there is mean reversion in relative asset performance, rebalancing to fixed weights might generate positive returns.

On the other hand, when assets diverge strongly over time, fixed-weight rebalancing might cause losses relative to buy-and-hold as the rebalancing continues to increase the allocation to the underperforming asset.

The performance difference between fixed weights and drift weights shows the characteristic return profile (sometimes called negative convexity) of an investor who has sold both put and call options (although no actual options are sold of course). This profile shows positive, but limited, returns under small moves and large negative returns under large moves. The driver is the divergence in stock and bond returns because differences in return change the allocation.

Buying losers and selling winners is the essence of rebalancing to fixed weights. Market dynamics ultimately determine whether such a trading strategy is profitable. A trendless environment, especially one characterized by mean reversion, would clearly be friendly to this strategy. However, trending markets, e.g. where equities keep losing relative to bonds, pose a problem for rebalancing. A sustained trend means one buys an asset on the way down. Trending is a well-established property of markets over the last century and remains an important trading signal. One ignores trends at one's own peril.

Rebalancing is therefore no free lunch, but represents an implicit bet against diverging asset performance. The cost occurs when markets trend and rebalanced portfolios experience deeper drawdowns than buy-and-hold portfolios. For small values of stock-bond return divergence, fixed-weight rebalancing modestly outperforms buy-and-hold; for large divergences, the underperformance of the rebalancing strategy is marked. This extra risk is therefore a fundamental property of the dynamic behavior of the rebalanced strategy.","Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/ONLINE_140829911_AR_-1_MISXJLKDRZUS.jpg,"['allocation', 'performance', 'buyandhold', 'costs', 'fixed', 'returns', 'return', 'asset', 'address', 'unexpected', 'rebalancing', 'weights', 'strategy']", ,none

Advertising Read more

The streets leading up to Seoul’s iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with Koreans honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church here in the 18th century.

Korea’s church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests - as occurred in most of the world - but by members of Korea’s own noble classes who learned of Christianity by reading books about it.

These early Catholics were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Joseon Dynasty, which tried to shut the Korean Peninsula off from Western influence.

Police in Seoul declined to give an estimate of the crowd size, but the Vatican said about 800,000 people had turned out. The number was significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Korea’s 50 million people.

The Mass kicked off a busy day for Francis as he passed the halfway mark of his five-day South Korea visit. In the afternoon, he traveled to a religious community that cares for severely disabled Koreans and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies - a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hot-button “culture war” issues like abortion.

The Mass in Seoul, though, was one of the highlights of his trip, providing Francis with an opportunity to stress how the lessons of Korea’s early martyrs were relevant today for Korea’s church, which is small but growing and is seen as a model for the rest of the world.

“They were willing to make great sacrifices and let themselves be stripped of whatever kept them from Christ - possessions and land, prestige and honor - for they knew that Christ alone was their true treasure,” he said. “They challenge us to think about what, if anything, we ourselves would be willing to die for.”

Francis praised in particular the fact that laypeople were so crucial to the church’s foundation and growth in Korea - a theme he stressed later in the day when he met with leaders of Korean lay movements. The church is counting on such laymen and laywomen to spread the faith in Asia, which the Vatican considers the future of the church. The main reason for Francis’ visit to South Korea, in fact, was to attend an Asian Catholic youth festival; the church sees such rallies as a crucial way of inspiring the next generation of Catholics to evangelize.

Big moment for Korean Catholics



“Today as ever, the church needs credible lay witnesses to the saving truth of the Gospel,” Francis said, stressing in particular the need for their outreach to focus on the poor and most marginalized.

A collective cheer erupted from the masses when Francis declared the 124 “blessed” the first step toward possible sainthood. Many of the women in the crowd wore lace veils; others sported paper sun visors with “Papa Francesco” written across them, protecting them from the overcast, hazy skies.

The scene was impressive, with thousands of people neatly packed into fenced-in sections leading away from the altar, which was set up in front of Gwanghwamun, the south gate to Gyeongbokgung palace, with mountains looming above and the presidential Blue House on the lower slope. Police in green vests stood guard along the barricades and volunteers handed out water to guard against the warm, humid temperatures.

“I’m so thankful that the pope visited South Korea,” said 75-year-old Yu Pil-sang, a Catholic who was trying to get a glimpse of Francis just outside the police barricades. “But I’m so sorry that all the ways to see the pope are blocked. I came to hear at least his voice.”

En route to the altar before Mass, Francis stopped his open-topped car so he could get out and bless a group of families who lost loved ones in the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April, in which more than 300 people, most of them high school students, were killed.

On his white cassock, Francis wore a yellow ribbon given to him by the families a day earlier when he met with them privately to try to console them.

“We want the truth,” read a yellow banner, a reference to the families’ demands for an independent inquiry into the sinking. Officials said 400 families had been invited to the Mass.

10,000 Catholics killed by Joseon Dynasty

The main figure in the group that was beatified is Paul Yun Ji-Chung, who was born in 1759 and was among the earliest Catholics on the peninsula. He was beheaded in 1791 - the first Korean martyr - after he violated the traditional Confucian funeral rites for his mother. In all, the Joseon Dynasty killed about 10,000 Catholics for refusing to renounce their faith.

Historians say Korea’s early believers were struck by the idea of a religion that preached universal equality in divine eyes at a time when the nobility’s discriminatory hierarchical system brutally exploited ordinary people.

St. John Paul II canonized another 103 martyrs during a visit to South Korea in 1984. Francis began his day by praying at a monument in Seoul commemorating the martyrs on the site where many of them were killed.

Even non-Catholics turned out for the Mass, impressed by Francis’ humble gestures and call for South Koreans to pay more attention to the poor than their own material gain.

“I do not know much about Catholics and South Korea’s Catholic history, but it seems that the pope is making sure to reach out equally to everyone,” said Eom Yae-sung, 49, a Protestant who said Francis had inspired her to make changes in her own life.

“I plan to do volunteering and a lot of sharing so that when I look back at my life 10 years from now, I will think that the pope’s visit motivated me to change,” Eom said.

The initial results of the Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey 2013, released Monday, found that 5.3 per cent of soldiers reported experiencing PTSD in the 12 months prior to the survey, up from 2.8 per cent 11 years earlier when Statistics Canada last asked soldiers, sailors and airmen and airwomen about their mental health.

The new figures represent the first findings from approximately 6,700 two-hour, face-to-face interviews with full-time members of the Canadian Forces, and they come after a rash of returning soldiers' suicides raised questions about the Canadian military's ability to cope with the psychological fallout of the Afghanistan mission.

""There's no question that the issue of PTSD and depression in the ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces is a significant issue,"" said Chris Linford, a 54-year-old retired lieutenant colonel who battled PTSD after tours of duty in Rwanda and Afghanistan.

The increase in PTSD rates is ""not that surprising after 10 years of being involved in a very heavy combat mission,"" said Colonel Rakesh Jetly, a senior psychiatrist and mental-health adviser to the Canadian Forces surgeon-general.

The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder among full-time members of the Canadian Forces has nearly doubled since 2002, according to a new Statistics Canada report. Read the full story.

Type of mental disorder Rate (%) 2002 Rate (%) 2013 Major depressive episode 8 8 Post traumatic stress disorder 2.8 5.3 Panic disorder 2 3.4

Although Canadian soldiers saw action in places such as Rwanda, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia in the years before the Afghan deployment began, ""those didn't compare to the intensity and frequency of the combat our soldiers have seen [in Afghanistan],"" he added.

The initial results of the survey reflect the mental-illness rates among full-time members of the Canadian Forces, not just those who served in Afghanistan, according to Vincent Dale, the assistant director of the special surveys division of Statistics Canada, which conducted the survey in partnership with the Department of National Defence.

A more detailed analysis of the survey, which was conducted from April to August of last year, is expected in the fall.

The 2013 survey asked soldiers, sailors and airmen and airwomen whether they had experienced one of the following six conditions in the past year: Depression, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.

A total of 16.5 per cent of soldiers reported experiencing at least one. Of those conditions, three were examined in the same way in the 2002 survey. (The official definitions of the others changed in the interim, making an apples-to-apples comparison difficult, Mr. Dale said.)

Along with PTSD, rates of panic disorder among soldiers rose from 2 per cent in 2002 to 3.4 per cent in 2013.

However, the mental-health problem that affects the largest percentage of soldiers – depression – remained unchanged between 2002 and 2013. In both years, the survey found 8 per cent of soldiers reported experiencing depression in the past 12 months.

The federal government has been adamant it is doing everything it can to support soldiers with mental-health issues, but some returning soldiers have expressed fears in the past that they will be medically discharged from the military if they seek help for their problems.

Mr. Linford was medically released in February, about two years earlier than he would have retired by choice.

However, he praised the mental-health services he received from the Canadian Forces for his PTSD a decade after serving in Rwanda and again after a seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2009-10.

Col. Jetly said Canadian Forces brass are keenly aware of the prevalence of PTSD in their ranks, and better prepared now than ever to treat suffering soldiers.

63,63,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Ukraine Trauma Counselors Battle 'Info-Intoxication' - TIME,https://time.com/3079245/ukraine-trauma-counselors-battle-info-intoxication/,"In the middle of summer, as the fighting in eastern Ukraine receded toward the Russian border, psychiatrists working in the area began to notice a strange affliction among the people caught up in the conflict. Its symptoms were hard to discern at first from the more typical psychological damage the war was inflicting on local people—anxiety, insomnia, depression—but they were distinct enough for the doctors to start giving the malady names: “info-intoxication,” they called it, or more simply, “Ukrainian syndrome.”



The difficulties of treating it became clear to Dr. Yuri Fisun in early July, when the pro-Russian rebel militias retreated from his hometown of Slavyansk, and he was finally able to see patients again, working as a volunteer at a makeshift counseling center set up inside the separatists’ former headquarters in the local City Hall. He never took sides in the conflict, but like many of the people who lived through it, he came away shell-shocked and suspicious of both sides. The Ukrainian military had bombarded this key rebel stronghold with heavy artillery for weeks, depriving it of water and power as they encircled it with military hardware. “The people who stayed during the fighting had trouble sleeping once the sound of explosions had stopped,” he says. “They had gotten so used to them.”



But the town has slowly started coming back to life as the government retakes control. Pension payments have resumed, the people who fled the fighting are returning home, a couple of cafes have reopened, and in City Hall, a group of trauma therapists is trying to treat a community that seems to be suffering from a collective case of post-traumatic stress. The therapists don’t see their work as merely a source of comfort for the locals. It is rather a test of whether the deeper tensions of this conflict can be resolved, or whether they are bound to bubble up again with another round of violence.



What Fisun and his colleagues noticed was that the forces feeding the hatred in Slavyansk survived even after the fighting stopped. Mixed in among the signs of trauma was a great deal of aggression and paranoia, usually expressed with peculiar phrases that Fisun sensed his patients were not coming up with on their own. He eventually found their source: television.



A slight man with a lulling timbre to his voice, Fisun did not own a TV himself, so he got into the habit of watching the news every evening online and taking notes in preparation for his patients the next day. He focused on the Russian state-run networks, which many of the locals still get through satellite dishes or the Internet, and he found a pattern. “Overnight they had internalized the latest propaganda,” he tells TIME. “And it was surprisingly hard to dislodge.”



Ever since the Ukrainian forces took back control of Slavyansk, Russian state media has insisted that wholesale purges of the population had ensued. There were mass arrests, “execution lists” and bounties for the bodies of civilians, according to Kremlin-run TV broadcasts. A particularly sickening report on Channel One, the Kremlin’s main network, claimed that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old boy on a bulletin board in the central square of Slavyansk and made his mother watch him bleed to death.



None of this had any basis in fact, as TIME confirmed through two weeks of reporting in the former rebel strongholds. These towns and villages have indeed suffered extensive damage from the Ukrainian bombardment, and the U.N. estimates that hundreds of civilians have been killed in the conflict so far, many from the impact of shelling. But once the army moves in to retake control, they have so far made few discernible attempts to weed out the remaining separatists, many of whom have melted back into these communities.



“They came once in the beginning, checked my papers to make sure I’m local, and I haven’t seen them since then,” says Alexei, a 34-year-old lumberjack in the war-ravaged village of Semyonovka, declining to give his surname. “I haven’t even heard of anybody getting arrested or interrogated,” says Sergei, a 38-year-old mechanic in the town of Debaltsevo, who also declined to be named, citing a distrust of journalists. Both of them said they had not joined the separatist militias themselves. But while Slavyansk was in rebel control, many if not most of the men in the area provided at least some help to the pro-Russian cause. Failing to do so would have drawn the suspicion of, if not also reprisals from, the rebels and their supporters.



These days armed soldiers are rarely seen patrolling the streets of Slavyansk, and state security agents identifiable by their bullet proof vests and sidearms seem to go out of their way to interact politely with locals while standing in line at a pizzeria or grocery store. “Don’t get me wrong, there is a desire among some of the boys to go in and raise hell,” says Taras Katsuba, a Ukrainian lieutenant colonel, standing with a group of soldiers outside town of Debaltsevo on August 1, the day after government forces took control of it. “They’ve seen their buddies get killed. But we know the situation is overheated right now. Folks are scared, and if we go in and start arresting people or whatever, it’ll only make things worse.”



Yet the rumors of Ukrainian death squads and “cleanup operations” have nevertheless persisted in these towns, and Fisun says it is the goal of mental health professionals to counteract them one by one. Armed with his notes on the latest Russian news broadcasts, he goes into therapy sessions with an aim to persuade patients that they are false, that they have nothing to fear from the Ukrainian government. “This is a top priority for us right now,” he says. “It is the main thing driving the neuroses and the social aggression.”



His colleagues have taken a more direct approach. Tatyana Aslanyan, a psychiatrist who is coordinating teams of trauma counselors working around Slavyansk, usually sits and listens quietly to the people who come for her therapy sessions. These sessions are open to the public, organized by civil society groups and run by local volunteers. But the mistrust in the city is so pervasive, Aslanyan says, “many people still see us as some kind of filtration center; they’re scared we’ll hand them over to the security services.” So it’s no surprise that turnout is usually modest, and men are rare among the people seeking help.



During a recent group session in the village of Semyonovka, about a dozen local women sat around in a circle at the village congress hall, whose roof had been blown open with a mortar during the fighting in May and June. Semyonovka has suffered more physical damage than perhaps any other place in the war. “It was better when we didn’t have electricity,” said one of the locals taking part in the session, a young mother of three. (The therapists asked TIME not to print their names.) “But now we can turn on the TV and get depressed again.”



For the first time Aslanyan interjected sharply: “No television!” she shouted. “Listen to me, turn it off, throw it away.” The woman began to cry.



The source of distress is not only the Russian media, Aslanyan says in an interview the previous day. Though most of Ukraine’s news networks are privately owned, they have often sought to fight fire with fire in the propaganda war, denouncing the separatist rebels as terrorists and their sympathizers as traitors. Numerous reports have accused the rebel fighters of “kidnapping” dozens of children when they were, in fact, apparently just trying to evacuate them from the warzone.



In May, separatist fighters helped evacuate the mental hospital outside Slavyansk where Fisun has worked for 35 years. It had been hit by a number of mortars by then, he says, and the rebels “brought buses around” to drive the patients to safety. “As I understand, these were the local boys,” says Fisun, “not Russians but men from Slavyansk who had joined the rebel militias.” He has no sympathy for their cause, but the depictions of them as terrorists on Ukrainian television have simply mirrored the warped picture available on the Russian airwaves. “As a result you hear people demanding more of a purge in their own communities,” says Aslanyan. “Many of them feel the Ukrainian forces have been too soft, that they have not done enough to punish people.”



Olga Kadysheva, another psychiatrist working as a volunteer in the warzone, also believes that what she calls the “info-intoxication” is coming from all sides, with television and online news reports feeding rumors that get spread by word of mouth. “The treatment is diet: cut off the intake of information, all of it, Ukrainian, Russian, it doesn’t matter.” But the deeper concern among the therapists is that the rumor mill is only feeding fears and prejudices that existed long before the conflict, and could persist long after the fighting stops. The ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, who make up a majority in many towns across the region, have long felt like outsiders in their own country, in part because Ukrainian is the only official language.



“The polarization of society is what deepens the break in the psyche,” says Kadysheva, who came from the city of Kharkiv, outside the warzone, to help coordinate and train therapists in Slavyansk. “Am I Russian or am I Ukrainian? Am I a separatist or am I not?” As the rebels retreat from their strongholds deeper into southern and eastern Ukraine, the rifts in society that their war has left behind have looked more like a shattered mirror than any clean split down the middle. Those who stayed in bomb shelters throughout the fighting condemn those who fled the warzone. Those who did not support the separatists condemn those two did, and vice versa. The dividing lines now seem to form a tapestry of mistrust and mutual reprobation, the local psychiatrists say, and mending them up again will take years. In the meantime, the propaganda outlets on both sides will be able to play on these divisions, making it harder for the communities to get on with their lives.

64,64,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Sea cows could lose their endangered species status - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-manatee-endangered-species-20140815-story.html,"About 2,500 manatees have perished in Florida over the last four years, heightening tension between conservationists and property owners as federal officials prepare to decide whether to down-list the creature to threatened status.

Conservationists say the deaths are evidence of the vulnerability of the walrus-like mammals, which were included on the endangered species list in 1967 because of boat collisions and destruction of sea grasses in the shallow coastal inlets they inhabit.

But owners of waterfront property and businesses filed a lawsuit in April in federal court accusing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of failing to adhere to its own 2007 recommendation that down-listing is warranted because there are now more manatees than ever.

Most of the 4,800 pudgy sea-grass-munching mammals in the U.S. gather in each year in Florida, where warm, temperate coastal water, power plant discharges and warm-water springs act as buffers to the lethal effects of icy winters.

The agency’s delay in implementing the recommendation prompted the Pacific Legal Foundation to sue on behalf of a group called “Save Crystal River Inc.”

The group takes its name from the Crystal River, a destination about 100 miles north of Tampa, known for sport fishing and manatee tours in the vicinity of its headwaters.

“Environmentalists want to turn the entire Crystal River into a sanctuary, which would hurt our clientele,” said Christina Martin, a Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer representing property owners in the case. “Our clients simply want the federal government to pay attention to what its own biologists are saying and down-list.”

Opponents of down-listing argue that the agency’s recommendation came before two major mortality events. They also fear that decreasing protection would leave manatees more vulnerable to potentially catastrophic die-offs.

In 2010, 766 of an estimated 5,077 U.S. manatees died, largely due to cold stress. In 2013, 830 manatees died amid red tide blooms. In the meantime, dozens of manatees are killed each year in boat collisions, despite rules and regulations enacted to safeguard the animals.

“We’re up against an antigovernment group that wants to roll back the very protections that have prompted a comeback of a species once hunted to near extinction,” said Pat Rose, executive director of the nonprofit Save the Manatee Club. “Then they could run their boats where they want, when they want and as fast as they want.

“We’re trying to get as many people as possible to put pressure on the Fish and Wildlife Service before the public comment period on this matter ends,” he said. “We want the agency to base its final decision on the most up-to-date scientific information available.”

The Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to take comments until Sept. 2, then make a final decision with a year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The Giants are going in one direction and the Kansas City Royals in another.

James Shields threw a four-hitter and Alex Gordon homered as the Royals won their sixth straight, beating the Giants 5-0 on Saturday night.

The Royals have won nine of 10 to move with 11/2 games of AL Central-leading Detroit. The Royals, who have not made the playoffs since beating St. Louis in the 1985 World Series, are in second place in the AL wild card standings.

On the flip side, the Giants have lost 34 of their past 54 games, a .370 winning percentage, the third-worst in the majors in that span. On June 9, the Giants were a major league-best 42-21 with a 9½-game lead in the NL West.

They trail the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers by 3½ games after the Saturday loss They are in a virtual tie with Pittsburgh and St. Louis for the top spot in the NL wild card standings.

“We’re in a position to make a run and if you’re in the playoffs anything can happen,” Giants catcher Buster Posey said. “We know we can win games against good teams. If we get hot down the stretch anything can happen.”

Is it too early to be thinking about the Dodgers, Pirates and Cardinals?

“We have a little under 50 games left and we’re focusing on trying to play solid baseball, so ask me that a little later,” Posey said.

Tim Hudson (8-9) gave up a home run to Gordon to lead off the fifth inning.

The Giants have lost seven of their past eight games against AL clubs.

“We have to keep pushing and stay positive,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “They’re playing very well. When you play good teams you have to play your best ball. Last night we let it get away. Tonight we just ran into a well-pitched game.”

Hudson yielded three straight hits to start the four-run seventh and was replaced by Jeremy Affeldt.","Sat, 09 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://imengine.prod.srp.navigacloud.com?uuid=CDF946F8-C12B-4F08-AFD7-9C0BD8ECE4DE&type=primary&q=72&width=1200,"['6th', '50', 'won', 'play', 'straight', 'games', 'wild', 'giants', 'wvideo', 'win', 'royals', 'al']", ,none
66,66,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Risk allocation must replace asset allocation - Pensions & Investments,https://www.pionline.com/article/20140813/ONLINE/140819958/risk-allocation-must-replace-asset-allocation,"The investment industry has made great strides in using technology to modernize the investment process. The growth of exchange-traded funds is testimony to the desire to increase liquidity and transparency, and lower transaction and management costs. Transaction fees are ever shrinking. Information technology puts market and investment information in managers' and investors' hands with lightning speed and laser accuracy.

But the most important part of the investment process — portfolio construction and management — is like using a rotary telephone! The asset allocation process is outdated, mired in 20th century thinking in a 21st century world, and — most importantly — fails to address investor needs.

Using risk allocation in place of asset allocation will change the way the investment industry thinks and operates proportionate to the way smartphones and networked devices have changed the way we communicate, gather and disseminate information. Risk knows the difference between T-bills and junk bonds, and sets the stage for all the enhancing apps that will not work in the rotary phone environment. We should protect our portfolios from significant risk of loss just the way we now protect ourselves from inclement weather, traffic jams and changes in tides — by using intelligently and coherently all the market information that is available at a moment's notice, rather than reading about the damage in the papers and on our account statements after the fact.

Risk allocation has several key advantages over asset allocation:

• Risk changes quickly, often daily — being unresponsive to it doesn't make sense. Traditional asset managers do not take the daily changes of risk into consideration. They instead focus on benchmark-relative performance, and wait until the end of each quarter to find out what happened to their portfolio and then rebalance. Would we wait 90 days to react to any other negative stimulus in our lives? Why allow asset managers to do so?

• Balanced allocations are no replacement for risk management. Traditional asset allocators use fixed allocations to bonds to control risk whereas risk managers use risk management to control risk.

Note the logic? Bonds don't control anything — they reduce returns too much when risk warrants more productive equity allocations, and do far too little to help when our portfolios really need it.

• Asset managers must rely on accurate forecasting, when evidence shows it cannot be done. According to Bloomberg, somewhere between 10% and 15% of economic and market forecasts come true. That means that seven out of eight times forecasts are wrong. That would be enough to get a student kicked out of school or an employee fired in any business except the investment industry. Perhaps John Kenneth Galbraith was right when he said: “The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” Asset allocators stay up nights and weekends fretting over whether their allocation of assets to emerging markets should be 12.5% or 14%. The stress is palpable and unnecessary.

• Risk managers recognize that asset class relative returns are generally unpredictable, but risk and changes to risk are measurable – and if one has the wisdom to use it, significantly enhance returns over time. Rather than rely on impossible and unreliable forecasts, they rely instead on daily market observation and risk measurement. Risk managers play golf and tennis, and sail on weekends knowing that Monday might be treacherous, and they will be prepared to change market exposure on Tuesday if they need to get out of harm's way.","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/HOLD_310159990_AR_-1_0.jpg,"['allocation', 'changes', 'replace', 'risk', 'investment', 'way', 'management', 'asset', 'information', 'market', 'managers']", ,none
67,67,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,"In Japan, official effort to replicate STAP stem cells comes up empty - Science AAAS",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/japan-official-effort-replicate-stap-stem-cells-comes-empty,"TOKYO—A team of researchers at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (CDB) in Kobe, Japan, reported today that they have been unable to reproduce a simple method of creating stem cells that was reported in two Nature papers by CDB scientists earlier this year. ""But these are just interim results, not a final conclusion,” said Shinichi Aizawa, a RIKEN developmental biologist, at a press conference.

RIKEN, which operates a network of nationally funded research institutes, also announced today that CDB will be downsized, renamed, and relaunched in November under new management.

In two papers, published online in Nature on 29 January, CDB's Haruko Obokata and others reported that simply subjecting mature mouse cells to a mild acid bath could produce stem cells, which are capable of developing into all the cell types in a body. Stem cells are likely to be at the heart of a wide range of future medical treatments. The stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) method, as the researchers named it, was far simpler than all other known methods of creating stem cells. Co-authors of the paper include researchers at CDB, at other institutions in Japan, and at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.

But the claims started unraveling within days as bloggers and contributors to the PubPeer website started noting problematic images and plagiarized text. Researchers around the world started reporting that they couldn’t replicate the results. A RIKEN investigating committee on 1 April announced finding Obokata guilty of research misconduct for several instances of falsification and fabrication in the papers. The committee cleared other co-authors of misconduct but said that senior scientists involved bore heavy responsibility for lax oversight of the then–30-year-old Obokata.

That month, RIKEN also set up a team to try to replicate the STAP phenomenon. An outside committee reviewing the case on 12 June recommended that CDB be dismantled. The authors retracted the papers on 2 July, though Obokata has continued to claim that the STAP phenomenon is real. In a tragic turn, Yoshiki Sasai, a highly respected stem cell scientist who was a co-author of the papers and CDB deputy director, committed suicide on 5 August. Reportedly one of the notes he left behind blamed the stress of the media attention.

The team attempting to replicate the STAP results is led by Aizawa and Hitoshi Niwa, another respected stem cell researcher who was also a co-author of the papers. In repeated experiments using different types of stress and cells from different tissues, they neither saw the fluorescent signal characteristic of stem cells generated from mice carrying a gene for green fluorescent protein, nor were they able to produce a cell mass as reported in the Obokata papers. Niwa noted that they used a common laboratory mouse strain known as C57 black 6. (A report in Japanese is here.) To be thorough, they intend to repeat the experiments with other mouse strains. They are also giving Obokata herself a chance to reproduce her results. They expect to complete their work by next March.

As for the fate of CDB, RIKEN President Ryoji Noyori said they will rebuild the institute around 250 researchers with the remaining staff moved to other RIKEN institutes. (A Japanese report is here.) CDB had a staff of 541 in 2013, according to the institute's annual report that year. A new director will be appointed for the institute, which RIKEN has tentatively named the ""Multicellular System Formation Research Center.""

Noyori also announced a multifaceted action plan to strengthen governance, establish a new research compliance office, improve awareness of research ethics, and provide guidance in properly recording and managing research data all to prevent a recurrence of misconduct and to regain the trust of the Japanese public.

SANTA CLARA - The San Francisco 49ers have signed injured defensive lineman Glenn Dorsey to a two-year contract extension through the 2016 season.

Dorsey, 29, is sidelined with a torn left biceps muscle that required surgery. He was injured Aug. 1, but hasn’t been ruled out for the season. He is expected to miss significant time after arriving for training camp as the projected starting nose tackle.

The 49ers announced the deal Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after coach Jim Harbaugh’s news conference. Dorsey is entering his seventh NFL season out of LSU.

In 16 games with 13 starts last season in his first year with the Niners, Dorsey had 41 tackles and two sacks. By San Francisco’s own count, his 100 tackles were a career high.

“Glenn is a true pro who has quickly become a valued contributor to our organization both on and off the field,” general manager Trent Baalke said. “He is a quick study and a very good football player that has earned this extension, and we look forward to his future contributions.”

Losing Dorsey was a devastating blow 11 months after 2013 starting nose tackle Ian Williams went down with a season-ending ankle injury in a Week 2 loss at Seattle. Dorsey quickly emerged as a reliable replacement and stabilizing force for the defensive line. Williams is making significant progress now that he has been activated from the physically unable to perform list.

“Obviously, very disappointed for Glenn and him personally,” defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said after the injury. “He was in great shape. Played great for us last year. Got better and better for us as the season went on last year and was looking even better this year. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for us that we won’t have him for a while. We’ll just move on and get the rest of the guys ready.”

Dorsey joins a long list of players on the team’s vaunted defense who will be around for the coming seasons, including star linebackers Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman and Ahmad Brooks.

CommonHealth Intern Like many patients with chronic conditions, Lesley Watts used to come in to the doctor's office for a check-up on her digestive disorder every 12 months. This not only meant time spent in traffic and scouring for a parking spot, but also the brain fog and stress of answering her doctor's questions on the spot. But a year ago, when it was time for her visit, she instead received an email reminder to pull up an online form that asked her everything her doctor needed to know about her symptoms. From the comfort of her recliner, Watts carefully answered the questions, among them: ""Overall, how have your reflux symptoms been since your last office visit?"" ""How much have your symptoms affected your work, social, and/or home life?"" When she was satisfied with her responses, she clicked ""submit."" The next day, she received instructions from her doctor about how to manage her symptoms better. Visit complete. And patient satisfied. ""It asked me questions that I had never been asked before, and as a consequence, I learned about symptoms I had not recognized,"" she remembers. ""I believe I received better care because I was able to take my time and provide more accurate answers.""

""We believe that it can actually increase your engagement with the system because you’re thinking about your condition outside of the physician’s office."" Dr. Ronald Dixon

Virtual care and tele-medicine are hot health topics, replete with weighty promises of revolutionizing healthcare. But they often refer to realtime video-chatting or texting with a clinician—whether it's your personal provider or a random doctor overseas. The Massachusetts General Hospital service that Lesley Watts participated in aims to conduct virtual visits without the realtime interaction. Instead, patients complete an online questionnaire for their specific conditions, and send it to their personal doctor—whom they already know and trust—for review and response. For the past two years, primary care clinicians at an MGH Beacon Hill practice have been using over 30 different forms to follow up with some of their adult patients. According to Dr. Amy Fogelman, a physician at the Beacon Hill practice, the clinical questionnaires are especially useful for chronic conditions that need management over time, like obesity and hypertension. In fact, the obesity questionnaire has proven more effective at helping patients lose weight than any other method she’s tried, she says. “Knowing that they’re going to check in with me every month helps my patients stay motivated,” she explains. “They put in their weight, exercise, and a 24-hour food recall. If a patient reports that this past month wasn’t so great, I’ll write back, ‘You can do it, get back on track.’ Having your doctor there with you as a team is really helpful.” According to a recent study, published in the journal ""Telemedicine and e-Health,"" these asynchronous (not in realtime) virtual visits took significantly less time than in-person visits. On average, the patients spent eight and a half minutes to complete each questionnaire, whereas the doctors spent only three and a half minutes reviewing responses and making recommendations. By contrast, clinicians typically spend 15 minutes on face-to-face visits. “We’re really trying to maximize the efficiency for both parties,” explains Dr. Ronald Dixon, the Medical Director of the Beacon Hill clinic who created the tools. Sample partial virtual visit for hypertension. (Courtesy of Dr. Ronald Dixon) Many patients welcome the opportunity to avoid a lengthy trip to the clinic. ""My primary concerns at the doctor's office are one, to maximize my use of the doctor's time so I don’t have to come back again for as long as possible and two, to get out of there as quickly as possible,"" Lesley Watts says. “Consequently, my answers to questions can be incomplete and then the doctor doesn’t ask as many questions because I mask my symptoms.”

Dr. Dixon has found that patients tend to be more accurate and insightful when answering questions virtually, on their own time. “We believe that it can actually increase your engagement with the system because you’re thinking about your condition outside of the physician’s office,” he says. In fact, using the virtual visits, Dr. Dixon and his colleagues discovered that more than a dozen clinically depressed patients were having some suicidal thoughts that had not been expressed before in clinic visits. Because of these patients' more honest answers to the online questionnaires, the clinicians were able to modify and improve their care plans, he says. The ""Telemedicine and eHealth"" study found that both patients and health-care providers were generally satisfied with the new process. Lesley Watts says she found the forms easy to use and especially liked focusing on one condition at a time: ""Normally, I try to get everything taken care of as quickly as possible in one visit."" While most patients appreciate the condition-specific questionnaires, not all patients like being pigeonholed this way, says Dr. Fogelman. “Nobody is just one condition,” Dr. Fogelman says. “Everyone’s got multiple things going on, so that can feel a little limiting.” To address this drawback, Dr. Dixon and the other creators are considering ways to combine chronic conditions in future versions of the software. Another remaining challenge: Since the virtual follow-ups are pre-populated with questions and answer choices, patients don’t have a lot of space to express additional concerns or give detailed descriptions for all their symptoms. Space for free text is purposefully limited to specific questions so that doctors can make decisions efficiently without sorting through extra information that’s not relevant to the condition being treated—like gastrointestinal complaints when discussing hypertension. “One of the problems that we had with non-structured visits using an online portal is that you get into a long back-and-forth exchange with multiple iterations that eventually require the patient to present to the clinic for follow-up,” Dr. Dixon says. That rings true to me. I have my own wordy email chain with my doctor that began as a simple follow-up about some blood-work results. Eight messages later, my doctor and I still hadn't come to a conclusion about my treatment, so she asked that I come in for a face-to-face appointment instead. The back-and-forth tennis match of emails wasn’t getting us anywhere. Patients who prefer to discuss multiple issues at once can still follow up using the Beacon Hill clinic's online portal—basically just an email account.

“For patients who may be isolated or suffering from something that requires human contact, then the online follow-ups aren’t necessarily the best thing.""","Fri, 15 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2014/08/8378659933_5941c7a83b_b-1000x667.jpg,"['checkups', 'dixon', 'visits', 'patients', 'virtual', 'doctors', 'watts', 'online', 'symptoms', 'dr', 'doctor', 'questions', 'responses']", ,none
71,71,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,The mysterious oddities of jellyfish - Independent Online,https://www.iol.co.za/travel/world/asia/the-mysterious-oddities-of-jellyfish-1731754,"Fujisawa, Japan - Round, bell-like bodies drifting and dancing through the water — a most relaxing sight that also carries an air of mystery. Jellyfish, those soothing, umbrella-shaped creatures, are aquarium idols that attract many people.

At Enoshima Aquarium in Fujisawa, Japan, jellyfish illuminated in dark blue light swim amid relaxing music in a jellyfish exhibit hall that was renovated last year. The aquarium started exhibiting jellyfish on a permanent basis in 1973 and is now known as a pioneer of raising jellyfish for exhibitions.

It currently exhibits about 3 000 jellyfish from about 40 species in Japan and elsewhere.

“Some studies show that viewing jellyfish can ease mental stress. Their healing effects attract people's attention,” said Aya Adachi, a curator at the aquarium in charge of keeping jellyfish. Asked which jellyfish species are popular these days, Adachi showed me a species called aurelia in an eye-catching globe-shaped water tank that was installed last summer. Aurelia are often seen in waters around Japan.

“It's not showy. It just swims along with the current, opening and closing its umbrella. Many visitors to our aquarium say they feel healed after watching them,” Adachi said. She also said the shape of the water tank was intended to give visitors an impression of gentleness, just as the jellyfish do.

Adachi's next suggestion was the Pacific sea nettle, which has an umbrella more than 30 centimetres (about 11 inches) in diameter. It inhabits the Pacific coastal area of North America and is one of the largest jellyfish species in the world. Seeing them drift through the water with their tentacles trailing softly behind is compelling.

Meanwhile, the blue jellyfish actually comes in various colours such as blue, brown and white — hence its other nickname, colour jellyfish.

“Its chubby shape is cute. It's also agile. These jellyfish are popular among children,” said Adachi.

The brown jellyfish matches its name with brownish tones. Its umbrella is 10 to 15 centimetres in diameter, but its tentacles are about one to two meters long and slowly retract after they snag prey.

“We occasionally feed them during the aquarium's opening hours. So if you're here at that time, you can see it,” she said.

Visitors are allowed to take photos as long as they don't use a flash, so many jellyfish lovers come to Enoshima Aquarium to snap pictures, Adachi said.

A cafe on the second floor sells a custard bun and a jelly dessert both designed after jellyfish.

An increasing number of people are buying jellyfish at pet shops and keeping them at home to enjoy their appearance. However, such owners must educate themselves on jellyfish behaviour and other important factors, such as toxins. A water current must also be generated in the tank using water jet pumps.

“You may have an image of jellyfish as dangerous, but visitors can forget that here and just enjoy watching them,” Adachi said. Once people understand that jellyfish toxins are meant to catch prey, they will probably be more enchanted by their beauty and forget their fears that they are dangerous creatures.

Jellyfish can also be seen at other aquariums across Japan.

The Tsuruoka municipal Kamo Aquarium in Yamagata Prefecture exhibits more than 50 species of jellyfish. It also sells original goods themed on jellyfish, including the Kurageiri Kasuterayaki cake containing sweetened bean paste mixed with drained and processed jellyfish. Jellyfish have no taste, but their gummy elastic texture is delightful.

The cake is a popular souvenir at the aquarium. Yokan sweet bean cake, which also includes jellyfish, is also popular.

Shinagawa Aquarium and Sunshine Aquarium in Tokyo and Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan in Osaka also entertain visitors with their jellyfish exhibitions.

72,72,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Scientific proof that a summer World Cup in Doha is too hot - for fans - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-world-cup-doha-qatar-weather-20140822-story.html,"German researchers have some advice to the organizers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Doha, Qatar: Hold the soccer tournament during the winter. Or, if the matches really must be played during the summer, hold them at night.

The reason, they say, is not that it would be dangerous for soccer players to run around the pitch for 90-plus minutes in Doha’s 122-degree heat (though one presumes it would be). Their primary concern is the health of the spectators who would be watching.

In particular, they’re concerned about fans from Europe and places with similar climates who are not at all used to Qatar’s “extreme meteorological conditions,” they wrote in the International Journal of Biometeorology. (Biometeorology is a scientific field that examines the weather’s effect on living things.)

The researchers don’t say in their study whether they are soccer fans who would like to attend the World Cup eight years from now. However, they do work at the Meteorological Institute at the University of Freiburg in Germany, the country that won this year’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

The study authors, Andreas Matzarakis and Dominik Frohlich, are part of a team that looks at how global warming will affect tourism. As scientists, they use a measure called physiologically equivalent temperature, or PET, to assess “the changes in human thermal comfort.” Or, in this case, discomfort.

The PET is the temperature (measured in degrees Celsius) you would have to set in a room to mimic the conditions you would feel in an outdoor setting, including your core temperature and skin temperature. In the 1990s, Matzarakis and another colleague developed a PET scale that ranged from 4 and below (causing “extreme cold stress”) up to 41-45 (causing “extreme heat stress”). For this study, Matzarakis and Frohlich had to add two additional categories for PETs: one in the 45-50 range (113 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit) and one for above 50 (greater than 122 degrees F).

The two researchers examined meteorological data taken at the Doha International Airport from March 1999 to January 2014. During the months of June and July – when the World Cup is usually played – the air temperature was typically in the range of 95 degrees F. During the first week of June, temperatures dipped below 84 degrees less than 10% of the time; by July, that figure dropped to 0%.

The most comfortable PET range is 18-23 (the equivalent of 64 to 73 F), when humans feel neither cold nor heat stress, the researchers wrote. In Doha, this range “dominates during winter time.” If such temperatures are ever felt during summer, it’s “only at nighttime,” according to the study.

Temperatures in Doha are likely to top 95 degrees F about 50% of the time during the first week in June and more than 55% of the time come July. “Favorable thermal comfort conditions for Europeans are likely to occur at less than 5% of all cases in June and almost none in July,” Matzarakis and Frohlich wrote. “Even at nighttime, conditions in Doha may cause heat stress for Europeans.” (Since Qatar’s climate is more extreme than in most places, plenty of spectators would face the same problem as the Europeans, the pair wrote.)

Concerns about heat (and humidity, which isn’t a problem in Qatar) arose during this year’s World Cup in Brazil, as four matches were played in Manaus, a city in the Amazon rain forest. A match on June 22 between the U.S. and Portugal made history for having the tournament’s first official water break.

But organizers of the Doha tournament say they’ll tame the heat by equipping soccer stadiums with new outdoor air-conditioning technology. Though that could make the matches more comfortable for spectators in a stadium, “it will make things even worse as soon as they leave it,” according to the study.

Matzarakis and Frohlich are hardly the first people to criticize FIFA’s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to a hot, arid city on the Arabian Peninsula. Critics have been agitating for a revote, and the tournament’s executive committee has begun “a consultation process” to determine the best dates for the matches. (A big consideration is likely to be the fact that most European professional soccer leagues in Europe are on break during June and July.)

“It is not the aim of this study to show that Doha City is inappropriate for the FIFA 2022 but to find a time period with the most suitable thermal conditions for visitors and tourists,” the German researchers wrote. “According to the results, this is the time from November to February.”

Fu Wengui, nicknamed “giraffe boy,” has three extra vertebrae in his neck — a condition known as congenital scoliosis — causing pain, stress on his nerves, and making it difficult for him to walk. The corrective surgery, sponsored by an undisclosed Beijing charity, will allow Wengui to go out in public again, without the unwanted attention.

""I hope I can have a normal neck,"" said Wengui, the NY Daily News reported. The extra vertebrae press on his nerves in his neck and make it difficult for him to walk. Currently, Wengui doesn’t like to go out anymore because his condition attracts attention from strangers as he struggles to walk.

At the age of 6, Wengui was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis and an abnormal chest frame. This spinal deformity occurs very early in development, in the first six weeks of embryonic formation, says the Scoliosis Research Society, and it mostly happens before the mother knows she is pregnant. While it is typically discovered during the infant or toddler period, the condition does not appear until a child’s adolescent years, like in Wengui’s case.

The Chinese teen is expected to undergo a surgical procedure by doctors in Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, who are making out a treatment plan. Surgical treatments Wengui may go through include spinal fusion and hemivertebra removal. In spinal fusion, the abnormal curved vertebrae are fused together so that they heal into a single, solid bone. This is able to stop the growth in the abnormal part of the spine, preventing the curve from getting worse. In hemivertebra removal, a single hemivertbra can be surgically removed, and then doctors use metal implants to correct the curve. The procedure will only fuse two to three vertebrae together.

It remains unknown exactly how much of Wengui’s neck can be removed without causing severe damage. The corrective surgery for the boy’s neck is expected to relieve his condition. Wengui’s dad, Fu Genyou, like his son, hopes to eliminate the public commotion the long neck causes. “He always causes a stir whenever he goes out,” said Genyou, the Daily Mail reported.

Wengui's surgery date is pending on the treatment plan doctors in Beijing are designing for him to shorten his neck.","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/chinese-boy-get-corrective-surgery-super-long-neck.png,"['undergo', 'doctors', 'corrective', 'vertebrae', 'neck', 'giraffe', 'scoliosis', 'long', 'extra', 'congenital', 'wengui', 'condition', 'spinal', 'surgery', 'beijing', 'wenguis']", ,none

The college financial aid application process can be tough for any family to manage on their own, but is it worth the money to bring in a professional?

Certified college aid planners and consultants promise to help families maximize their chances of securing financial aid. Since the recession, the National Institute of Certified College Planners, which offers a certificate in college aid planning to financial professionals, has doubled its membership, from 600 in 2006 to 1,300 this year, according to co-founder Ron Them.

Some of these pros play dual roles, counseling families through the college application and selection process, and then helping them handle financial aid applications afterward. Others are traditional wealth managers or accountants who have begun offering college aid planning as a bonus to their existing roster of clients.

“There’s generally a lot of concern right now about how families are going to be able to pay for college and I think folks know that there are a lot of different places that money can come from,” says Megan McClean, director of policy at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “The process can seem overwhelming at the onset and perhaps that’s why people turn to these advisors, to gain some clarity.”

For middle-income families, the financial aid process is especially crucial. College costs have soared more than 1,000% in the last three decades, while middle class household income has remained frustratingly stagnant. And because the lion’s share of federal and institutional grant and scholarship aid typically go to low-income households, college can be much more expensive for middle-income families.

A growing need for middle-income families

Joseph Orsolini, a certified financial planner and founder of CollegeAidPlanning.com, says the recession drew many more upper-middle class clients through his door. His lowest-earning client earns $13,000 a year and his highest earns $600,000, with the median income falling just shy of $90,000.

Story continues

“I’m dealing with clients who, pre-recession, wouldn’t have come in and even talked to me,” he says. “Wealthier families are starting to feel the bite even more.”

For Maureen Jankowski, who has three children close in age, the prospect of figuring out how to put them through college at the same time was daunting enough for her to seek outside help. Neither Maureen nor her husband, Jerry, who live in Batavia, Ill., had attended college or even seen a FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, before. The fact that they had incurred an unexpected $65,000 debt when health problems arose for one of their daughters in middle school further complicated matters.

“I did it for the peace of mind,” says Jankowski, who paid $100 to have each of her children’s FAFSAs completed. “[Our planner] explains things so easily in a way that we can understand them. Once you’ve found somebody you trust, it’s a good feeling.”

But is it worth it?

The primary job of any good college aid consultant is to help families ace their FAFSA. Completing that application is the only way to qualify for federal student aid. But with more than 100 questions — twice that of a typical income tax form — it can be intimidating for inexperienced parents. Errors aren’t uncommon, and a small mistake could mean thousands of dollars in lost student aid. The bulk of questions pertain to income and assets, like savings accounts, 529 plans and real estate holdings. Household income has the largest influence on aid eligibility. One of the most common mistakes Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, sees families make is with retirement plans. Assets from retirement plans don’t have to be included on a FAFSA, but some families add them in as part of their investment income, unnecessarily driving up their income and lowering their chances of getting aid.

Depending on the level of service, consultants can charge anywhere from $100 to file a FAFSA to thousands of dollars if they tack on help with scholarship and college applications.

“It’s a complicated form, but the FAFSA isn’t rocket science,” says Kantrowitz, a staunch supporter of legislation that would simplify the FAFSA. “I don’t know if I would pay thousands of dollars for that kind of handholding.”

As its name suggests, the FAFSA is free to file. So if you’re paying a professional just to fill in the boxes for you, you shouldn’t be paying more than $50 to $100, Kantrowitz says.

Planners like Orsolini, however, charge more. Families pay $75 for an initial consultation and a $750 flat fee for a basic college aid assistance package. But for that price, he does more than fill in the blanks on a form. He sets them up with a budget to control their expenses, helps weed out schools that are too costly, finds scholarship and grant opportunities, and offers guidance throughout the school year.

But the majority of his clients tend to have more complicated financial situations than most families. He estimates that 40% of his client base consist of divorced parents grappling with how to report income on their child’s FAFSA.

Get what you pay for

Unlike certifications to become a financial planner or a tax preparer, there is no nationally established college aid planning certification. In fact, traditional exams for financial planning don’t include a college aid section at all, Kantrowitz says.

The National Institute for Certified College Planners offers a Certified College Planning Specialist certification, which requires candidates to take an online exam and complete 16 hours of continuing education each year. All CCPs are licensed financial professionals that include CPAs, CFPs, investment advisors, and retirement planners.

There’s also the American Institute of Certified Educational Planners, whose work encompasses everything from college aid planning to college admissions counseling. Most CEPs are typically high school or college counselors already. If you’re looking for a college planner, the directories on these sites can be a good place to start.

Both of these organizations have boards in charge of fielding complaints from consumers about unethical practices by its members. But here are a few tips to be sure you’re getting what you pay for:

Make sure they sign your FAFSA. The same way that tax preparers have to list their professional ID with any tax returns they file, college aid planners have to sign your FAFSA form. This ensures that they can be held liable if any evidence of fraud is later found. If your FAFSA preparer refuses to sign your form, that’s a red flag.

Don’t trust anyone who says the FAFSA isn’t free. You should also never trust a planner who tells you they’re the only one qualified to complete a FAFSA. They should be upfront and tell you that it is available for free online. There are many websites that offer FAFSA guidance from independent advisors, usually by calling an 800 number. They should explicitly state on their website that they’re not affiliated with the government and that the FAFSA is a free document. If they suggest otherwise, they probably don’t have your best interests in mind.

Seek advice early. Kantrowitz recommends seeking college aid advice no later than your child’s junior year of high school. Since the FAFSA uses financial information from the prior tax year, some of the strategies planners use to maximize aid for their clients can’t be used if families show up a few months before high school graduation. For example, if you have a couple of years of lead time, they can find ways to offset investment gains with capital losses in order to reduce your income for the year and potentially help you qualify for more aid.

Take advantage of free resources first. Before you hire a pro, make sure you’re aware of other free options for financial aid counseling. There is no shortage of free advice available online or through high school counseling offices.



Kantrowitz has decades of experience in student aid counseling and recently published a book on how to file a FAFSA properly, which can be downloaded for free. Beginning in January, financial planners across the country will participate in College Goal Sunday, an initiative that sets families up with free college aid counseling.

“We’re really focused on making sure the public realizes that they can get this information without paying for it,” says McClean of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

75,75,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Eating out usually means eating more - CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eating-out-usually-means-eating-more/,"A new study finds that people who eat out consume an average of about 200 calories more a day than when they cook at home.

They also take in more saturated fat, sugar and salt.

The study has limitations. It doesn't say anything about whether frequent restaurant diners are unhealthier than at-home eaters, and it doesn't take into account the potential benefits of eating out, such as socializing and reducing the stress of cooking.

Still, the findings show that ""eating out at restaurants should be the exception, not the norm,"" said study co-author Lisa Powell, a professor of health policy and administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Powell said the researchers wanted to better understand the role of restaurant food in people's diets. ""We know that parallel to the rising rates of obesity, Americans have been increasingly eating food away from home, and they now take in, on average, about 600 calories a day from restaurants,"" she said.

That wouldn't be a problem for people's health if their diets were similar on the road compared to at home. But the study found otherwise.

The researchers based their findings on the responses of over 12,000 people aged 20 to 64 who took part in federal surveys from 2003-2010. The participants answered questions about what they ate over two separate days.

People who ate at fast-food places or full-service restaurants consumed an average of 194 and 205 extra calories per day, respectively. They also consumed more saturated fat (3 and 2.5 grams extra, respectively) and salt (296 and 451 milligrams, respectively).

Where do all the extra calories come from? ""More energy-dense foods, larger portions, more empty calories such as sugar-sweetened beverages,"" Powell said.

Previous research suggests that 36 percent of adults eat food, drinks or both from fast-food restaurants per day, and 27 percent eat at full-service restaurants. With those numbers in mind, Powell estimated that the typical person in the United States consumes an extra 24,000 calories a year by eating out -- the equivalent of 6 to 7 pounds annually.

Susan Roberts, director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, said it's possible that the people who ate out at sit-down restaurants actually consumed more than they recalled because it's hard to estimate portion size at those eateries.

""We always underestimate large portions, so people don't realize that restaurant portions are as excessive as they are,"" she said. ""This is why we need menu labeling on all restaurant meals, not just the fast-food and larger chains.""

How can people avoid extra calories when they eat out?

""See if you can order a half portion,"" Powell said. ""When there is a choice of sides, opt for veggies and salad rather than fried items. See if you can get the sauce or dressing on the side, and drink water rather than soda.""

Roberts suggests assuming that all restaurant meals include two to three times the calories that you need. ""That means at the minimum you should eat half or less of a portion in order to not gain weight,"" she said. ""You can ask the server to box up half before it gets to the table. You can also ask for salads with dressing, cheese, croutons on the side, and then just use what you want. Micromanaging your order generally is a great way to go.""

76,76,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,"Fighting death: At 75, nun's soul still stirs for cause - CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/us/executions-dead-man-walking-nun/index.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) Sister Helen Prejean blasts the air-conditioner in her champagne-colored Toyota Corolla, the back bumper held up with duct tape. It's clear why friends insist on driving when they are with her. She could rival NASCAR's Danica Patrick on the gas pedal. Age -- she turned 75 this year -- hasn't slowed her down.

She was weaving all over Interstate 10 when police stopped her one time. Turned out she was reading while driving. The officer let her go when he discovered who she was: ""I'll go straight to hell if I ticket a nun,"" he said.

He made her promise she would never do that again.

These days, she depends on iPhone's Siri for driving directions and making phone calls. She also likes to play ""Plants vs. Zombies"" (not while in motion, of course) even though the violent nature of the game goes against her Christian principles.

""It's OK,"" she says. ""The zombies are already dead.""

On this day in late July, Prejean is nearing Louisiana State Penitentiary, otherwise known as Angola, for the post office that serves it. She's been here so many times the warden no longer subjects her to the protocol for visitors.

She drives down State Highway 66, through the guarded gates, past lush green cypress trees and fields brimming with flowers, okra and collards to Camp F, where the prison constructed a $9 million brick building to lock up the condemned.

Built on a former slave plantation surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi River, Angola is the nation's largest maximum-security facility. It houses more than 6,000 inmates and encompasses a chunk of fertile Southern farmland almost the size of Manhattan.

Prejean is here to see Manuel Ortiz, convicted in 1992 of the murders of his wife, Tracie Williams, and her friend Cheryl Mallory. He's been on death row for more than two decades; Prejean began visiting him 13 years ago.

Ortiz maintains he was framed in a murder-for-hire scheme. Prejean believes his claim of innocence . But that is almost beside the point.

Prejean, who gained fame as a death penalty abolitionist after the movie ""Dead Man Walking"" hit theaters in 1995, is not always concerned with a convicted murderer's guilt or innocence. It's easy to forgive the innocent. It's the guilty, she says, who test our morality.

She ministers to the worst of humanity because she believes in the restoration of life and that every human being deserves to be treated with dignity.

That is what Jesus preached. She likes to say that Christ was more radical than Karl Marx in his embrace of the lowest rungs of society.

Three decades ago, Prejean embarked on a mission to end the death penalty based on her Catholic faith and belief in human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, she says, forbids torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.

Ministering to death row inmates and learning the intricacies of American criminal justice, Prejean arrived at another steadfast belief: The process is broken.

Outside the entrance to death row, there's a porch with three dark wooden rocking chairs. The warden, she thinks, could have had a career in decorating the way the place is all fixed up.

A prison staffer leads her into one of the booths reserved for lawyers who come to meet with their clients. She sits on one side of the thick glass with a phone in her hand.

Ortiz walks in on the other side with leg irons, handcuffs and a chain around his waist. He always feels cold when he comes out of his 6-foot by 10-foot cell on death row. It's not air-conditioned and has louvered windows. A federal lawsuit filed by three inmates claims the heat index has reached 172 degrees.

The first thing Prejean does is order food for Ortiz from prison concessions; otherwise he will have to eat the normal slop that is served in the cells and never contains anything fresh.

""It's part of the attitude here. You committed a crime so you must always suffer,"" Prejean says.

Helen Prejean visits Manuel Ortiz on Louisiana's death row. She believes he is innocent.

She knows Ortiz does not have the money to buy anything. And food is important to her. It is the most basic necessity of life; it should be celebrated when shared with family and friends, she says.

Ortiz wants a catfish Po' Boy, a roast beef Po' Boy, five bags of potato chips, two Cokes and two Sprites. He also orders four strawberry and two cinnamon Danishes for breakfast the next morning and two hamburgers for lunch because Prejean has some money left.

She orders a grilled cheese for herself. She and Ortiz pray together.

""You are a son of God,"" she tells death row inmates. ""Christ is with you. What is being done to you is wrong. I will be there for you.""

Prejean finds Ortiz in high spirits on this day. With her help, he recently changed lawyers because he felt he wasn't being heard. He is desperate to prove his innocence and filed for FBI documents pertaining to his case through the Freedom of Information Act.

Ortiz dreams about the day he might walk out of Angola. He dreams of taking Prejean to one of the volcanic lakes in his native El Salvador. He wants to teach her to scuba dive.

They talk about everything from Marco Polo to J. Robert Oppenheimer's invention of the atom bomb. The science was so sweet; the end result, ghastly.

In the last hour of their visit, Ortiz narrates the plot lines to movies he's seen recently: ""Band of Angels"" with Clark Gable and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.""

""I feel like I've seen the movies now,"" Prejean says.

It's as though they were sitting on a couch in someone's family room, sipping a cocktail -- Prejean loves her single malt Scotch -- and munching on popcorn.

She lets Ortiz carry on because it gives him dignity.

Equal justice under the law

Two troubled and recent executions in Arizona and Oklahoma, Prejean hopes, will trigger more opposition to carrying out the death penalty in the United States, the only country in the Western hemisphere that still puts the convicted to death.

A 2013 Gallup Poll found that 60% of Americans still support capital punishment, though that number is the lowest it has been since 1972, when the Supreme Court constitutionally banned it.

Executions are shrouded in secrecy, masked, sanitized, Prejean says. She remains convinced that if people could see the brutality of killing a human being, they might reconsider their support for the death penalty.

Execution is torture, she believes. And so is the time waiting for it. Death row inmates, she says, ""die a thousand times before they physically die.""

The July 23 execution by injection of Joseph Wood in Arizona took nearly two hours. Witnesses reported that Wood snorted and gasped for air throughout the process. The April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma turned into a grisly show as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney and finally died of a heart attack.

Both men committed chilling crimes. Wood shot his former partner, Debbie Dietz, and her father, Gene, at their body shop in Tucson. Lockett shot 19-year-old Stephanie Neiman and then watched accomplices bury her alive.

Early Wednesday morning, Missouri became the first state to carry out an execution since the ""botched"" lethal injections. The state put to death Michael Worthington for the 1995 rape and murder of college student Melinda Griffin.

Death penalty supporters accuse Prejean of having empathy for undeserving, coldblooded killers. The crimes justify the punishment, they say.

But even advocates of capital punishment, like R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, have said it's one thing to support death as punishment and quite another to explain it, fix it and sustain it with justice.

Prejean wants Americans to understand that it's not just the act of killing that was botched in the cases of Wood and Lockett. She believes the entire death penalty system is botched -- from the moment an arrest takes place to the trial, conviction, appeals and execution.

""It is random, arbitrary and capricious and disproportionately meted out to minorities and poor people,"" she says. ""Race plays such a huge role.""

If you kill a person of color, Prejean says, you are not likely to be condemned.

In 76% of cases in which death is the punishment, the victims were white, according to the Death Penalty Information Center . Almost 42% of death row inmates are black even though African-Americans make up about 12% of the U.S. population.

She directs much of her wrath at the Supreme Court, which, she says, has given absolute power to the states without demanding transparency. Trying out new drug cocktails for lethal injections, she says, amounts to medical experimentation on human beings to see what it takes to kill a person.

The ruling found that in the most heinous crimes, the death penalty could be employed; it laid out certain procedures to prevent prejudice and arbitrariness in state trials.

But Prejean asks: How can 50 states, bound by the same Constitution and Supreme Court rulings, behave so differently? The high court's guidelines, she says, are unclear and not workable and so what happens is the culture of each state takes over.

There's a reason, she says, that a good number of death row inmates are in Southern states that supported slavery.

A soul on fire

For a Catholic girl in the 1950s, reaching adulthood meant two things, Prejean jokes. It was either time to get married or enter the sisterhood. She chose the latter and joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Medaille, now known as the Congregation of St. Joseph.

She had been raised in a comfortable household in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, blind to the brutality of Jim Crow laws, oblivious to American poverty.

But in the early 1980s, she had an awakening of sorts and decided to dedicate her life to the poor. She went to live at the St. Thomas housing project in New Orleans, a white nun sharing space with very poor black people. That was the start of her real education.

Prejean began exchanging letters with death row inmate Patrick Sonnier in 1982. His execution was the first she witnessed.

It was while living there that she began communicating with Elmo Patrick Sonnier, prisoner number 95821 at Angola.

Sonnier and his brother Eddie were convicted in 1978 of abducting a young couple, Loretta Bourque, 18, and David LeBlanc, 16. They raped her and then forced both of them to lie face down on the ground and shot them.

Sonnier told Prejean that he was Catholic and asked her to become his spiritual adviser. It was one thing to write letters, she thought. It was another to visit death row.

She was scared to walk into the belly of the beast. She'd never faced a murderer before. The warden asked her what a nun was doing there. She told him she'd come to help Sonnier take responsibility for his terrible deeds.

She wondered if he would be a monster.

But everything changed when she saw Sonnier's face. She knew then that whatever unspeakable act he had committed, his life was worth more than what it was in that criminal moment.

She visited him at Angola until the day he was put to death, April 5, 1984. It was the first time in her life that she had stood up for something.

When he was strapped into the oak electric chair, nicknamed Gruesome Gertie, Sonnier looked at Leblanc's father and asked for forgiveness. And before almost 2,000 volts charged through his body, he found Prejean's face on the other side of the glass window.

""I want the last thing in this world you see to be the face of love,"" she'd told him. ""You look at me.""

Sonnier's eyes met Prejean's. ""I love you,"" he told her.

She stretched her arm toward him. ""I love you, too.""

When it was over, Prejean felt a cold descend on her. On the trip back from Angola, she had to stop the car to get out and vomit.

She would never be the same again. The state's execution of Sonnier set her soul on fire.

'Dead Man Walking'

Prejean has witnessed five other executions since that day. She's written two books: ""Dead Man Walking"" was turned into a movie starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn; ""The Death of Innocents"" focuses on two men she believes were wrongly executed. She is working on a third book now, a spiritual memoir called ""River of Fire.""

""Dead Man Walking"" sparked a national debate on the death penalty at a time when executions were more common than they are now. Since 1976, America has put to death 1,385 people.

She travels around the world, lecturing on capital punishment -- she savors airplanes as her cloister, where no one can get to her. She often attends performances of the play ""Dead Man Walking,"" written by Tim Robbins for student actors and audiences. It is intended to make a new generation of Americans ponder the death penalty.

All of it has contributed to making Prejean one of America's best-known anti-death penalty activists. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.

In her hectic life, she still finds time to meditate every day and attend weekly Mass at St. Gabriel the Archangel, a predominantly African-American Catholic Church in New Orleans.

After all these years, her body tires more quickly but the fire inside still burns.

I'd read Prejean's books, seen ""Dead Man Walking"" several times. I had an image in my mind based on Sarandon's portrayal of her. Compassionate, committed, dedicated, serious about her work.

I wondered if I would find a woman who had grown weary from 30 years of death. I discover otherwise.

She repeats a joke she told recently at a California forum celebrating the life of Catholic priest and Earth scholar Thomas Berry.

""There's an old guy sitting on a bench with a young guy with a Mohawk hairdo and covered with tattoos and piercings,"" she begins in her deep Cajun voice.

""Whassa matter, pops? Didn't you ever do something wild in your life?"" asks the young guy.

""Yeah. One time, I had sex with a parrot. I was checking you out and thought you might be my son.""

Prejean looks at me with a mischievous smile, taking in my shock at a nun -- a death penalty nun -- making a rather juvenile joke.

But without humor, without relaxation and good friends, her work would be overwhelming.

She dispels every cliché about Catholic nuns. She's wearing a blue printed blouse, cotton pants and tan leather mules. She doesn't even have a cross around her neck.

I ask about her lack of gray hair, despite the stress in her life.

""I don't know how that happened. It's like the immaculate conception."" Then she admits she likes to keep it that way so it matches her spirit.

Prejean with actress Susan Sarandon, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the nun, and Father Roy Bourgeois at protest in Fort Benning.

Sarandon was equally surprised by Prejean's demeanor when she first met her. ""Dead Man Walking"" had just been published. The Hollywood star was in New Orleans filming ""The Client"" and called up Prejean.

They met for a crawfish dinner at The Bon Ton Café on Magazine Street.

""I have to say I was predisposed against religion,"" Sarandon says of her Catholic school experiences. ""I brought all that baggage to dinner. But she was very accessible. She has a bit of wonder.""

Sarandon was taken with Prejean's personal involvement with death row inmates; that she never asked about their guilt. She had the unconditional love of a mother for her child.

""I became completely mesmerized,"" Sarandon says. ""She was a big laugher, eater, drinker. We ate tons of crawfish that night.

""People have such a wrong idea of activists. They think of these people as scolding, guilt-making personalities when it has been my experience that they are the most celebratory -- dancing, singing, partaking of food and wine in the biggest way possible. Craving for social justice is another craving they have and that doesn't mean they are closed off to other avenues.""

Sarandon made no promises to Prejean that night but told her she was interested in making a movie. It took nine months before she could convince her then-partner, actor/director Robbins, to read it and take on the project.

In 1995, the movie, co-produced and directed by Robbins, screened in American theaters. Sarandon won an Oscar for her portrayal of Prejean. Sean Penn's character, Matthew Poncelet, was a composite of Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie, whose crime sounded like it was straight out of Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood.""

A grave mistake

When a death penalty lawyer contacted Prejean and filled her in on Willie's crime, the first people she thought about were the victim's family.

Faith Hathaway's stepfather and mother, Vernon and Elizabeth Harvey, had both been very public with their support for the death penalty. They said they couldn't wait to see Willie fry.

Prejean had never visited the families of Sonnier's victims. The first time she saw them was at a clemency board hearing where she asked the state to spare the life of the man who killed their loved ones.

The family of Loretta Bourque, one of Sonnier's victims, later told reporters that they were deeply hurt that Loretta's death was used to sell an anti-death penalty book and movie without anyone ever speaking to them.

Prejean recognized she'd made a grave mistake -- one she was determined not to repeat -- even if the families rejected her. The church, she says, has to be on both sides.

She knew many victims' families despised her, as did advocates of the death penalty. They saw her as someone who showed sympathy for vile human beings who deserved to die for their sins. They blamed her for not siding with innocent victims. There were some crimes, they argued, that just could not be forgiven.

Willie's was one of them.

He and his accomplice, Joseph Vaccaro, blindfolded and raped 18-year-old Hathaway, then stabbed her in the neck and upper chest 17 times. They left her to die in the woods. Some fingers of her right hand were missing; she'd tried to shield herself from her attackers.

Four years after the murder, when Willie's execution seemed imminent, Prejean went to visit the Harveys at their home in Covington, a small town on the north side of Lake Pontchartrain. She thought of a prayer to Mary, who watched her son dying on a cross. ""Great as the sea is thy sorrow.""

The Harveys talked about their daughter and the events of May 28, 1980, the day tragedy struck their family. They talked about what Willie and Vaccaro had done to their daughter in graphic detail.

They told Prejean that the only way to be certain an unrepentant madman like Willie would never kill again was to kill him. Prejean recounted her conversation with the Harveys in her book.

""The SOB, Vaccaro, got a life sentence,"" Vernon Harvey told Prejean. ""And it's been four years and they haven't fried Willie's ass yet. We've been waiting and waiting for justice to be done. All you hear about these days is the rights of the criminal. What about our rights? Don't we have a right to see this chapter closed?""

The intensity of the Harveys' sorrow silenced Prejean in that moment.

But now, 30 years later in her modest New Orleans Mid-City apartment, she explains why she believes the death penalty re-victimizes people.

If a killer is sentenced to life in prison, he or she is locked up and never heard from again. But a condemned man?

That killer makes news every time there is movement in the case: a hearing, an appeal, a court ruling. Death row inmates typically spend over a decade awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Sometimes, it can last over two decades, as was the case with Troy Davis, put to death in Georgia in September 2011 for the killing of a police officer in 1989.

Prejean says she has seen victims' families follow cases through the courts for years. They wait and wait, reliving the crime over and over again with the hope that they will find ""closure"" when the killer dies. The Harveys, Prejean says, could have watched Willie get electrocuted a thousand times and still it would never fill the void in their lives.

Vernon Harvey, she says, was a thirsty man drinking a tall glass of salty water.

""He went home after they killed Willie but (his daughter) Faith is never going to sit in her chair again,"" she says. ""Victims' families buy into the notion that the death penalty is a way of honoring their loved ones.""

A growing number of victims' families are speaking out against capital punishment, she says. In 2007, 62 families sent letters to New Jersey legislators urging passage of an abolition bill. They emphasized the painful toll the process had taken on them.

Prejean has a framed photo of a brightly lit Colosseum, home to gladiators and executions during the Roman Empire. But in the 1990s, Rome began lighting up the ancient arena every time the death penalty was abolished somewhere in the world. It did just that the day New Jersey's bill became law.

'Nunzilla,' and ardent foes

Prejean's apartment is filled with art, books and photographs. There's a depiction of Christ done in batik, which she acquired in Jaipur, India. She calls it her ""yogi Jesus."" And a Bible verse, John 10:10, written in Korean calligraphy.

I ask her what it says. ""I ain't a Baptist so I don't know Bible quoting like a Baptist,"" she says, picking up her holy book to look up the verse.

"" 'I have come that they may have life to the full.' ""

On her coffee table is a magazine with Sarandon on the cover. And a copy of J.D. Salinger's ""Franny and Zooey."" She likes the image of the Fat Lady in that book. Jesus, she says, was the Fat Lady, representing people with faults whom no one loves.

Next to the table, on a buffet, is a photo of Prejean's mother, from whom she says she gets her spunk, and a toy that Sean Penn sent to her. It's a windup plastic nun that sparks fire from her mouth.

""I told him: 'Sean, Nunzilla's gonna get you.'""

Next door is the office for Prejean's Ministry Against the Death Penalty . Her longtime friend Sister Margaret Maggio runs the place and makes sure Prejean is on track with her hectic schedule.

""Helen thinks big. She has big dreams, big hopes,"" Maggio says. ""I'm detail-centered. I'm the backbone.""

Maggio keeps track of all the letters and e-mails Prejean receives. They are kept neatly in folders. One, colored purple, is called ""Ardent Foes."" In it are printed copies of e-mails lashing Prejean.

One man wrote: ""There has not been one instance on the planet where an executed convict ever committed another homicide. The U.S. justice system is the fairest in the world. If you are judged guilty by a jury of your peers based on the evidence presented that is the way it works. If you do not like it then get out of the country.""

Prejean marked it a ""classic"" and asked her staff to post it on her Web page.

In the days ahead, she will travel to a monastery in Wyoming to complete her memoir. Then she will return home to Louisiana to visit Manuel Ortiz on death row again.

She holds on to an idea that was cemented the moment she threw up after Patrick Sonnier's execution: that Americans are far removed from state-sanctioned death but when they get close to it, they will reject it.

""And I see that happening,"" she says, the smile wiped off her face.

Her wish is to see the death penalty abolished in her lifetime.

For a second, I think Prejean will break the seriousness of the moment with another one of her ""bad Cajun jokes,"" as she calls them. Instead, she asks: ""You hungry?""

Woman set herself on fire four months after Fukushima disaster

Fukushima government releases data showing more cases of thyroid cancer

Four years after the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant , questions about the lingering physical and mental health toll of the disaster persist.

The Fukushima District Court ruled Tuesday in favor of a family who filed a landmark lawsuit blaming Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant operator of the crippled nuclear reactor, for the suicide of a woman in 2011.

Four months after three reactors melted down at the Fukushima plant following a devastating earthquake and tsunami, Hamako Watanabe and her husband lost their home, their jobs and the prospect of restoring their lives.

She doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire after slipping into depression. Her husband, Mikio Watanabe, found her charred body.

The Fukushima District Court ordered TEPCO to pay 49 million yen ($471,063 U.S.) to her family, in a ruling that found a link between the nuclear accident and Watanabe's death.

""It is well assumed that the stress caused by sudden loss of the base of her life against her will and unknown future in evacuation was unbearable for her,"" according to the court ruling.

A spokeswoman of TEPCO Mayumi Yoshida said: ""We express deep condolence for the loss for Mrs. Hamako Watanabe. We will examine the ruling closely and continue to deal with it sincerely.""

Thyroid cancer cases monitored

In the wake of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, the local government began monitoring the health of residents who were under the age of 18 at the time of the March, 2011 incident.

The Fukushima Prefectural Government found more cases of thyroid cancer, with 57 people confirmed cases and 46 others listed as possible cases, according to data released this week.

The risk of thyroid cancer increases in people who've been exposed to high doses of radiation. Children are more sensitive to radiation and at risk for a longer period of time than adults, according to medical literature on thyroid cancer.

The cancer rate -- 57 out of 296,026 -- is high compared to known international statistics, but it's difficult to link the nuclear accident to the rates of pediatric thyroid cancer, according to the Fukushima prefecture's health office.

JUST WATCHED The ripple effects of a modern flood Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The ripple effects of a modern flood 01:22

The high rate may be attributed to the thorough method of testing for thyroid cancer, according to the office.

Hisakatsu Kotani, from the Fukushima prefectural government's health research section, said there were no patterns detected between the cases of thyroid cancers and high radiation areas.

""Experts have been saying this is not the time yet to see any health impact by the accident,"" he said.

In the case of Chernobyl, thyroid cancer cases in children reached a peak about 10 years after exposure, according to a report analyzing radiation exposure and the risk of pediatric thyroid cancers.

A scientific review published in 2011 , found that pediatric thyroid cancers only account for 0.5 to 3% of all types of cancers. That review also found that girls have four times higher frequency for pediatric thyroid cancer than boys.

Of the 104 people who were diagnosed with potentially cancerous tumors at Fukushima, 68 were females and 36 were males. More than half of them, 58, had surgery to remove the growth.","Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['case', 'fukushima', 'thyroid', 'health', 'suicide', 'according', 'cancer', 'landmark', 'cases', 'tepco', 'lost', 'watched', 'nuclear', 'plant', 'liable']", ,flood

Eduardo Blumwald’s genetically modified plants don’t look much like “Frankenfood.” Filling four modest greenhouses in a concrete lot behind Blumwald’s laboratory at the University of California, Davis, the tiny seedlings, spiky grasses, alfalfa, and peanut and rice plants in plastic terracotta-colored pots look exactly like the ordinary varieties from which he and his fellow researchers created them. Blumwald’s lab lies just ten miles from Monsanto’s 90,000-square-foot vegetable seed building, a glassy edifice larger than the hangar for a 747. The Monsanto facility is one of the largest centers in the world for plant breeding and genetic engineering. But in the fourteen years that Blumwald, a professor of cell biology, has worked here studying the DNA of crop plants, he has hardly ever spoken to anyone from Monsanto.

Blue-eyed and round-faced, with a lilting Argentinian accent, Blumwald grows exasperated when he talks about the so-called “Big Ag” companies, which he says have been arrogant in dealing with the public, contributing to a distrust of biotech research. But he also doesn’t appreciate the activists who’ve been challenging not only the Monsantos of the world but the entire field of genetic engineering.

“You want to penalize the multinationals; I have no problem with that,” he tells me in his office at the university’s plant biology building. “But because of your political stance against multinationals, you are going to condemn maybe the only viable solution we have for our future? It’s wrong—absolutely wrong.”

Blumwald means the hot future that we expect by 2050—when a world population of 9.5 billion people will scramble to put food on the table, while at least thirty-seven separate countries face extreme water crises. Blumwald thinks that part of the answer is to genetically engineer crops that can better withstand drought, and so he and his researchers are scouring the world for varieties of fruits, vegetables and some basic staples—rice, millet, wheat, maize—that grow well without much water. Then, using a device called a “gene gun,” which inserts DNA on microscopic gold particles, or a soil bacterium capable of changing plant genes, they alter or silence parts of the plant’s genome, adjusting how and when the plant makes the hormones that let it know when to grow and when to wither. The researchers say the methods are more precise and much faster than developing new plant varieties by conventional breeding, which can take decades.

When I tour the rows of rice and peanuts with one of Blumwald’s assistants, a postdoctoral researcher from Madrid, the air in the greenhouse is soupy. About two dozen researchers work in Blumwald’s lab, many of them from hot parts of the world with swelling populations, including Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates. In the greenhouse, the researchers force the rice to cope with heat and deprive it of water just as it’s about to set seed. So far, the genetically altered rice is outperforming the natural kind—given less moisture, the non-engineered rice browns and wilts, but the new plant survives. Blumwald’s goal is to create crops that won’t keel over as quickly when things get hot, dry and stressful—plants that will improve the odds that a farmer can produce food even in a drought.

In about forty years, relentless dry spells may be more frequent across the Southwest, say climate scientists, and California may have more dry years like this one, in which a drought has crippled the agricultural sector. But the state, one of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds in a worldwide fight over the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), isn’t the most inviting home for research like Blumwald’s. Since the 1980s, activists here have run a series of campaigns to require the labeling of GM products and an outright ban on GMO cultivation. Blumwald says the controversy over GMOs has made it more difficult to pursue his research and obtain funding. And even if his GM plants could be an important part of the solution to climate change, they may never make their way into the hands of commercial farmers. Who will invest in his plants, test them in the field and market them if they attract boycotts, protests and lawsuits that make business difficult and consumers skittish?

Many biotech researchers and agronomists argue that a combination of bad will generated by Big Ag and misdirected public outrage is stifling important technological advances in agriculture—innovations that could help prevent famine, fight crop diseases and cope with climate change. But countless activists disagree. The Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit agricultural watchdog group, says genetic engineering will never deliver on promises to feed a growing population and isn’t a trustworthy technology. “The dirty secret of the biotech industry is, after thirty years, they haven’t done anything for consumers,” said Andrew Kimbrell, the founder and executive director of the Center for Food Safety, in a speech at a national heirloom-seed fair in Santa Rosa, California. “No better taste, no more nutrition, zero benefits,” and a number of “potential risks.”

Over the past several years, the political fight over GMOs has become supercharged, and much of the controversy has been driven by a distrust of big business—and of any of the novel biotechnologies it might produce.

“The same corporations that brought us DDT and Agent Orange now want to deny us our right to know what’s in our food,” argued California Right to Know during a 2012 campaign that brought together a coalition of organic farmers, environmental organizations, grassroots groups like Moms Advocating Sustainability, and companies like Clif Bar and Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps. Two years ago, this coalition attempted to pass a statewide referendum that would have required the labeling of food containing GMOs. The anti-GMO activists were vastly outspent: Monsanto alone invested $8 million in efforts to defeat the measure. But the pro-labeling campaign helped launch a movement. This year alone, a series of similar initiatives have been proposed in twenty states, according to the Center for Food Safety; this past April, Vermont became the first state to pass a GMO labeling law. The Grocery Manufacturers Association and several other trade groups have filed a lawsuit to overturn it.

The California campaign’s messages were a jab at Monsanto, in part. Since the 1940s, the company has been manufacturing and selling chemicals, including DDT, the now-banned herbicide that contributed to the near-extinction of bald eagles in the twentieth century. In the 1960s, the company distributed a brochure mocking Rachel Carson’s seminal work, Silent Spring, the book that first brought widespread public attention to the dangers of pesticides and launched the modern environmental movement. Around the same time, Monsanto was producing Agent Orange, the chemical weapon used to strip vegetation in Vietnam war zones—and later linked to birth defects and cancers there and in the United States.

In 1997, Monsanto partly reinvented itself, transferring most of its chemical business to a company called Pharmacia, which later became part of Pfizer. Today, the only chemicals that Monsanto produces are agricultural, including Roundup, an herbicide that the company invented in 1970. It has marketed genetically modified seed since the 1990s; its premier products, among the most common GM crops on the market, are “Roundup Ready”—varieties of soybeans, corn, alfalfa, cotton, canola and sugar beets whose DNA has been modified to keep them from dying when doused with Roundup. In the big grain-growing regions of the United States, such as the Midwest, Roundup Ready is the industry standard. As a result, Roundup, which also goes by the chemical name glyphosate, is the most commonly used herbicide in the country.

Because the DNA of Monsanto’s GM plants is patented, the company has enormous control over the US food system. It has brought 145 suits against American farmers for patent infringement—i.e., for intentionally or, according to at least one farmer, accidentally (since grain DNA travels along with pollen in the wind) growing Monsanto’s GM varieties without paying for them.

The explosion of the Roundup Ready market may have environmental upsides. One biotech researcher I spoke with noted that the use of Roundup Ready seed has reduced reliance on even more toxic agricultural chemicals, and US Department of Agriculture data concur. Roundup is considered more benign than many herbicides: it tends not to linger in the soil and is sometimes used even in places like nature preserves to beat back aggressive weeds. But few chemicals intended to poison plants or pests are entirely harm-free, and new research indicates that Roundup could be more damaging than previously thought: it may contribute to miscarriages and interfere with fetal development. And around the country, weeds that are resistant to Roundup are proliferating. Dow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical and another major player in agribusiness, is about to release a new generation of genetically modified crops that tolerate a more powerful and persistent herbicide—2,4-D, a potential neurotoxin.

According to Robert Fraley, Monsanto’s chief technology officer and executive vice president, his company has been studying the impacts of climate change since 2006. But it has created only one line of GM plants designed to deal with environmental stress—a type of corn called DroughtGard. Like Blumwald’s plants, DroughtGard doesn’t die back as quickly when the weather is dry, though the mechanism driving this trait is different: it relies on inserting bacterial DNA into the plant. In field trials in the Great Plains, DroughtGard performed modestly better than other varieties of corn. Monsanto has now made it available commercially to farmers, and China has approved the seed for import.

But even if such technologies prove useful in mitigating the impacts of climate change, Monsanto’s tarnished history, heavy-handed dealings with the public, lawsuits, and sheer size and might have made it a favorite villain. To a certain segment of the public, everything that Monsanto does is suspect, and genetic engineering looks like a strategy for pushing the company’s brand of herbicides and manipulating the food economy—not a way to a feed a world in crisis.

It can be easy to forget that genetic engineering has an existence and a history beyond Big Ag. Monsanto’s website credits Robert Fraley, then a researcher for the company, with producing the first GM plant in 1982, but there were at least three other institutions working simultaneously—two universities in the United States and one in Belgium—to grow the first plants with spliced genes that year. In the decades since, scores of university researchers, small research and development ventures and even a few nonprofits have used genetic engineering to try to stop diseases from decimating citrus plants, create mustard plants that can clean up toxins from mining and industrial sites, and grow food that can better survive in heat, drought, flooding, freezing and other extreme weather conditions that may get worse in the next several decades.

But almost none of these plants have ever made it beyond a field-testing stage. As of 2010, though 260 genetically engineered traits have been tested in seventy-seven different “specialty crops” (foods that are less profitable and produced on a smaller scale than field corn, cotton, soy, wheat and rice), just four varieties—including insecticide-resistant sweet corn, disease-resistant papaya and squash, and an ornamental purple carnation—are on the market, according to a review by Jamie Miller and Kent Bradford, researchers with the Seed Biotechnology Center at UC Davis. That’s nothing near the scope of innovation one would need to confront a problem as vast as climate change or famine.

When I spoke with Bradford, he blamed anti-GMO activists, in part, for making R&D difficult: “Those groups have driven all of the biotechnology work into the companies they hate,” he said. “They’ve made it impossible for anybody else by raising a stink. Even if the regulatory bars don’t seem so high, [activist groups] will sue.” Only big companies like Monsanto can afford the legal and regulatory costs to test GM varieties and bring them to market, Bradford argues.

Neither biotech researchers nor GMO opponents think the current regulatory process is working well. Anti-GMO groups insist that the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process is too opaque and leaves GMO testing in the hands of food companies. Biotech researchers counter that, in practice, the FDA insists on exhaustive and expensive testing far beyond what has been required for any other kind of food crop, even though years of research suggest that the technology of genetic engineering is safe. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example, has announced that “foods containing ingredients from [GM] crops pose no greater risk than the same foods made from crops modified by conventional plant breeding.” Bradford and others insist that it doesn’t make scientific sense to single out GM crops for special testing when other, far less precise methods of crop development—including blasting plants with radiation—aren’t subject to such rigorous scrutiny.

The high cost of GMO field-testing may explain why the only genetically modified crops that have made it to market are, in the words of environmental scientist Jonathan Foley, “very disappointing” and “come with some big problems.”

“GMO efforts may have started off with good intentions to improve food security,” Foley wrote in a column in the science magazine Ensia in February, “but they ended up in crops that were better at improving profits.”

Whether Blumwald’s plants—or the hundreds of other GM crops designed to be disease- or climate-change-resistant or otherwise useful in feeding the world—ever make it to farm fields may depend a lot on whether food activists, the public and policy-makers can be persuaded that the technology is able to produce worthwhile results.

The heart of one GMO battle is roughly fifty miles west of Blumwald’s lab, in Sonoma County—a land of wineries, towering redwood groves poised at the edge of rocky coastal cliffs, and some of the most innovative organic agriculture in the country.

Much of the opposition to GMOs here has come from organic farmers, partly out of fear that their crops will be tainted by cross-pollination by GM varieties. Under organic certification rules, farmers aren’t allowed to grow GMOs, and their customers often refuse to eat GM food. In March 2004, Mendocino County, just north of Sonoma, became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass a law regulating GM plants, making it illegal to “propagate, cultivate, raise, or grow” them, in order to stop what it called “genetic pollution”; Marin County, to the south, passed a similar ordinance the following November. A grassroots group in Sonoma County is now actively pushing for a countywide ban on GMOs.

Here, on a plot of forest in the tiny unincorporated town of Occidental, several longtime environmental activists run a center for sustainable agriculture research in a cluster of yurts and wood cabins that form an intentional community called the Occidental Arts and Ecology Center (OAEC). Its leader, Dave Henson, co-founded Californians for GE-Free Agriculture, a coalition that ran campaigns against GMOs between 2002 and 2008. But when I asked him how he felt about genetic engineering, his answer surprised me. “If this is public research at a university, I think we will see some really interesting potential solutions with recombinant DNA that could show all kinds of benefits in health and agriculture and other things,” he said. “So baby and bathwater are separate.” Henson added that he’s even guest-lectured to classrooms of biotechnology graduate students at UC Berkeley.

When I described Blumwald’s research, however, Henson was skeptical. “The biotech solution is to change out one variety of one crop with another single variety that’s somehow more adapted by genetic engineering,” he said, while the approach to climate change, drought and other related issues “should be about the whole farm system.”

And that’s the major area of disagreement between food activists and the farm industry: people like Henson believe the entire system of modern agriculture needs a radical makeover to rely less on fossil fuels, irrigation, and the chemical fertilizers and weed killers that are fouling water sources from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi. Tweaking a gene won’t fix all that, Henson argues: “The solution has got to be a return to a more sustainable, soil-focused agriculture.”

Five years ago, Henson, OAEC, and several other groups and individuals involved with the GE-Free coalition partnered with organic and family farmers to form a new organization, the California Climate and Agriculture Network (CalCAN). Their intent was to involve farmers in California’s new climate-change law, the most comprehensive policy on global warming in the country. At the time, the group was also responding to Monsanto. “It was informed by the advertising campaign that Monsanto was doing…around its development of GMO crops that they claimed would respond to a number of [environmental] issues,” says Renata Brillinger, who now heads the group. In 2008 and 2009, Monsanto placed ads in publications like The New Yorker and The Atlantic Monthly and on the radio program Marketplace arguing that its biotech seeds would be necessary to feed the world’s burgeoning population. “We saw a need for other solutions,” Brillinger adds.

Today, CalCAN has no formal position on GMOs, but simply says that it wants, in Brillinger’s words, “shovel-ready” solutions to deal with the drought right now. Most of these are about managing soil. Rich, organic soil—the kind that can be developed by using manure and compost more and tilling less—holds water better than poor soil. In a drought, plants grown in rich soil are less thirsty; in a deluge, such soil absorbs and slows the flow of water, thereby decreasing flooding and erosion. Organic matter is also high in carbon, and storing it in the soil keeps it out of the atmosphere, helping to address the problem of climate change itself. CalCAN has focused on statewide policy, including efforts to wring funding from the California budget to promote soil- and water-conservation practices and climate-change strategies for farmers. To Brillinger, GMO research looks costly and difficult; managing the soil is immediate, cheap and much easier.

Down the road, in Sebastapol, I found a small organic farm that made this convincing. Paul Kaiser drove up to meet me in front of his barn in a small green tractor, then walked me through the densely planted rows spanning his two acres of crop fields, filled with roughly 150 varieties of vegetables. “We earn over $100,000 per crop acre per year,” he says. (By contrast, the average revenue from an acre of California cabbages or cucumbers in 2012 was about $6,000 to $8,000, according to the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture.) Kaiser credits his soil-management practices for his financial success.

Before farming, he worked in agroforestry, restoring fields in the tropics that were so overgrazed they could barely grow grass. To Kaiser, the question of engineering any single plant is unimportant compared with a larger picture involving soil, water, bees, and the various other insects and birds that can thrive on an organic farm and provide natural pest control. Kaiser supports the ban in Sonoma County: “Unless we can prove that a GMO crop is fully safe and beneficial to everything that it touches—the pollinators, the soil it’s grown in, the watershed and our body—we shouldn’t be using it,” he says.

* * *

At its core, nothing about the science of gene splicing precludes good soil management and other sustainable practices. Pamela Ronald, a UC Davis plant pathology professor, and her husband Raoul Adamchak, a farmer and former board president of the group California Certified Organic Farmers, insist that it’s not only possible but necessary to combine techniques like soil conservation with genetic engineering. They’ve also written a book on the subject called Tomorrow’s Table.

Ronald argues that those who object to GMOs are focused on the wrong questions: “It would make a lot more sense to evaluate all crops and all farming practices based on whether they are sustainable, not on the process of developing the seed. We know that the process itself is no more risky than any other kind of genetic process.” GM crops will never be a silver bullet, she adds, and we can’t confront a food crisis without also dealing with the other shortcomings of large-scale agriculture. Even so, genetic modification does offer help, and in a crisis, even a small fix can be worth a lot. Ronald and her colleague, David MacKill, used a combination of genetic engineering and plant breeding to create a variety of rice that can withstand the flooding that has inundated much of Bangladesh and India and devastated the rice fields, a disaster made worse by climate change. Last year, the rice was grown by 4 million farmers.

Ronald doesn’t point fingers at any one party for the public relations difficulties faced by biotech researchers. But she does note that the solution to a world food crisis won’t emerge only in the lab: “There seems to be a communication gap between organic and conventional farmers, as well as between consumers and scientists. It is time to close that gap,” she and Adamchak conclude in Tomorrow’s Table. “Science and good farming alone will not be sufficient.”","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ostrander_otu_img.jpg,"['genetic', 'hungry', 'hot', 'help', 'crops', 'organic', 'gmos', 'plants', 'soil', 'world', 'gm', 'monsanto', 'food', 'feed', 'plant', 'researchers']", ,flood_and_drought

(Image credit: Jesse Lewis)

The province of Palawan pokes out to the West of the Philippine Islands like a long finger squashed between the South China Sea and Sulu Sea. Narcotic seascapes, vibrant coral reefs, dense tropical forests and rugged mountains create a complex ecosystem that serves as refuge for many threatened creatures both on land and sea.



Unlike much of the Philippines, Palawan still retains more than 50 percent of its original forest cover, and contains vast stretches of old growth forest on its mountainous slopes. Because of these intact resources, Palawan has been called the Philippines' ""last biodiversity frontier.""



The Bacuit Archipelago on Palawan's northern coast is a wonderworld of dreamy islands, reefs and azure seas.

Paradise untouched

Palawan Island is surrounded by around 1,780 smaller islands, including the equally spectacular Calamian Archipelago to the north. Collectively these islands boast almost 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) of coastline pockmarked with rocky coves, islets and powder-white sand beaches.



Many of the beaches here are world class tropical paradises. Some, like those near the popular tourist hub of El Nido in norther Palawan receive large numbers of visitors. Most remain largely untouched, visited only by passing fishermen and nesting sea turtles.



Nacpan Beach, pictured above, is a beautiful white ribbon of sand accessed by rugged roads to the north of El Nido.

Striking and mysterious

Palawan is famous for its dramatic geology. Islands of sheer, needle-like cliffs contrast with shallow tropical lagoons. Mist shrouded mountain ranges thrust up from shaggy jungles. And mysterious limestone caves riddle the subterranean landscape like honeycombs.



Many parts of the Palawan are made up of karst, a porous limestone rock often associated with caves. Over time the natural processes of erosion have eaten through the soft limestone hills to create some of the world's most spectacular cave systems, including the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. Often simply called ""the underground river"" this UNESCO World Heritage Site contains the longest navigable underground river in the world at over 24km (15 miles).



This photo shows the surreal entrance to the underground river. Accessible by guided boat tours, the underground river is a wonder of geology and an important refuge for bats.

Unique creatures

Palawan was once connected to the nearby island of Borneo during the last Ice Age when sea levels were much lower. Because of this connection Palawan's flora and fauna are closely related to that of Borneo. Palawan also has many species of plants and animals that are endemic and found nowhere else on Earth but here.



Some notable Palawan species include the Philippine Mouse-deer, the Palawan Peacock-pheasant and the Palawan Bearded Pig. However, these larger species are elusive and hard to see. Visitors are more likely to encounter the songs of over 200 species of birds or glimpse one of the over 600 species of butterflies that flutter through sunbeams.



This is a Wallace's Giant Birdwing Butterfly. As the name suggests the size of these butterflies' wings (6 inches across) rivals that of the birds.

Back to basics

Palawan is sparsely populated and rural. Outside of the provincial capital of Puerto Princesa, a handful of small villages and settlements dot the main island. One (mostly) paved road connects the north to the south.



Traditionally many people on Palawan farm or fish, relying on the bounty of the land and the sea for their livelihoods. The natural rhythms of nature have sustained people here for centuries. However in recent years high migration rates from other parts of the Philippines and rapid urbanization have put stress on natural resources and traditional livelihoods. Paradoxically, the allure of this place threatens to lead to its destruction.



For now island rhythms and traditions are still common in most places on Palawan, as in the sleepy town of Port Barton pictured above.

Enchanted and interesting

At the far tip of northern Palawan Island the rocky outcrops of the hills dive into the sea and disappear. They re-emerge again across a turbulent straight of water to the North in the form of the Calamian archipelago: a smaller, but some argue, even more beguiling group of tropical islands.



The Calamianes are primarily made up of the islands of Busuanga, Coron and Culion. Busuanga, the largest, is the main port-of-call and largest island in the group. Culion has a mysterious history and was once the largest leper colony in the Philippines. While rugged, forest covered Coron is the ancestral home of the indigenous Tagbanwa people and closed off to visitors.



These islands' myriad lagoons, mangroves, seagrass and coral reef, ecosystems provide habitat for rich concentrations of marine life such as dugongs and reef sharks.

Unspoiled

The island of Coron is largely off limits to visitors and tightly controlled by the indigenous Tagbanwa people who are its traditional guardians. Undeveloped, Coron is a place of pristine natural beauty.



Throughout the island's rugged landscape are seven lakes, all of which are sacred cultural sites to the Tagbanwa people. Two are open to visitors, including Kayangan Lake, the cleanest and clearest lake in all of the Philippines and all of Asia.



With visibility extending for 80 feet (24 meters) or more, the lakes of Coron provide superb opportunities for snorkeling and diving. High echoing cliffs, ragged rock formations and clear, turquoise blue lakes create a magical cathedral-like atmosphere for exploration.

Palawan lies in an area of the world known to biologists as the ""Coral Triangle,"" a roughly triangular region encompassing the tropical marine waters between the Philippines, Indonesia and Papau New Guinea. This is the Amazon of the ocean. More reef-building species of coral, tropical fishes and marine biodiversity are found here than anywhere else on Earth.



The coral gardens surrounding these islands are colorful dream worlds of life forms. Snorkeling and diving in these underwater ecosystems you may see green parrotfish munching on algae, small striped cleaner fish grooming visiting fish for parasites, sinuous eels and cryptic octopus's hiding in crevices or wizened sea turtles breaking the surface for air.



The renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau declared Palawan one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world. This starfish is just a glimpse of some of the living art found beneath the waves ...

Vacation destination

The crystal clear waters and rich coral reefs surrounding the Calamian Islands make it one of the best destinations in the Philippines for snorkeling and diving. Easily accessed by bangka boat (large outrigger canoes), the near shore waters of Coron Island also offer some of the best wreck diving in all of Asia and the world.



A number of Japanese ships that sank during World War II litter the Coron sea floor. Most of these wrecks (12 in all) were Japanese supply ships anchored in Coron Bay when the US Navy launched a massive air strike that sank them. Today the skeletal remains of these wrecks are nurseries of undersea life.



Many species of hard and soft corals have attached to these accidental reefs. Amongst their colorful detail divers may stumble upon all kinds of animals. On any given dive is the possibility of seeing creatures like semi-transparent cuttlefish, camouflaged frog fish, delicate sea horses, schools of barracuda and much more.

Protected but in danger

The entirety of Palawan province was declared a Biosphere Reserve by the United National Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1990 because of its astounding biodiversity and unique indigenous cultures.



Despite this designation, the future for Palawan's biodiversity and indigenous groups looks ominous. The felling of forests, erosion of hillsides, and exploitation of fisheries from population growth and uncontrolled development threaten both the pristine ecosystems of the islands and the future of the people who depend on them to live.



The challenge in Palawan, like many places in the world today, lies in finding ways to sustainably manage both natural resources and the livelihoods of people who depend on them. Safeguarding ecosystem services in the form of water, fertile soils, flood control, carbon sequestration and eco-tourism benefit local communities and sustain healthy ecosystems that can ensure Palawan continues to remain the Philippines biodiversity frontier ...","Fri, 01 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5hLZwctTJyDawsGopRPyb-1200-80.jpg,"['species', 'sea', 'photos', 'credit', 'coron', 'frontier', 'jesse', 'world', 'island', 'palawan', 'islands', 'biodiversity', 'philippines']", ,flood

Mainer Jon Rogers started lobstering 47 years ago at the age of 10, when he’d go out on his grandfather’s boat.

Ask him about his health and he says, “No worse than anyone else who uses his body in his work. My hips are sore, my knees are sore, my shoulders are sore, my back is sore. I get up every day and it takes me awhile to get going. I hurt every day.”

But Rogers, who lives on a skinny, south-pointing finger of land in Casco Bay called Orr’s Island, doesn’t go to the doctor much. “I never really complained about too much unless I was really hurting,” he says.

“I’d schedule a doctor’s appointment with all the intentions of going,” Rogers says. “But if there was an opportunity to haul traps for a few days, I’d set aside the doctor’s appointment and go haul traps.” This summer he’s running 800 traps, which means his days starts around 5:30 a.m.

Rogers appears to be pretty typical of Maine’s 5,000 lobstermen, and of all 9,000 people who work in the state’s fishing industry.

“They work really hard and have a lot of chronic diseases,” says Miranda Jo Rogers, Jon's daughter. “These people have a stoic mentality — they don’t seek health [care] until they really need it. So there are no really positive role models on how to be proactive and keep healthy.”

Miranda Rogers aims to do something about that. Although she’s still a Tufts Medical School student, she’s taken on a project she expects will take her to graduation and beyond — maybe decades beyond.

“I am happily indebted to the community that raised me, and I wish to make a long-lasting difference in Maine,” she wrote recently to the state’s lobster harvesters, asking them to fill out a 24-page questionnaire on their health.

It will be the most complete look ever at the health of a difficult-to-reach population with special health care needs, low rates of health insurance and high skepticism of outsiders.

“Up and down the coast, the commercial fisherman is very talkative on his own turf, but it’s a very secretive bunch and not that trusting,” Jon Rogers says.

For that reason, many of them are suspicious-to-hostile toward the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, even though half the Down East population of fishermen lack health insurance and 25 percent of those in southern Maine, far higher than the general population.

“I get emails saying, ‘Why are you asking these questions? Are you an agent of Obama or something?’” Miranda Rogers says. “I say, ‘Nope, I’m not. Don’t worry.’”

“Miranda understands you can’t necessarily use a traditional approach,” says Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, which is supporting her project. “She’s from a lobster-fishing family. She definitely has two feet solidly on the ground and a unique understanding of the needs of this community.”

Ultimately, Rogers hopes she’ll be able to raise enough funding to launch a medical van that can travel from port to port, providing convenient care to fishermen and lobstermen.

But first, she has to document the need. She has some idea what she’s likely to find.","Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2014/08/biglobster-1000x670.jpg,"['miranda', 'shes', 'sore', 'care', 'lobstermen', 'rogers', 'succulent', 'woes', 'hidden', 'health', 'work', 'price', 'lobster', 'maine', 'stoic', 'really', 'traps']", ,none
81,81,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,[Annual Rodent Control Issue] Signs - PCT - PCT Magazine,https://www.pctonline.com/article/pct0814-rodent-infestation-signs/,"Dusts are becoming more popular for bed bugs. Although earlier trials with diatomaceous earth were disappointing, University of Kentucky researchers and pest professionals are seeing exciting things with silica gel.

Bed bugs have long been drenched and dusted with insecticides. While toxicants were more typically applied as liquids, infested beds and belongings also were dusted with such materials as sulfur, pyrethrum and 10 percent DDT powder. Without a simple one-shot solution, companies are again employing dusts in their bed bug management programs.

Today’s dust formulations often contain pyrethroids (e.g., Tempo Dust [Bayer Environmental Science], DeltaDust [Bayer Environmental Science]) or neonicotinoids (Alpine [BASF Corp.]) as active ingredients. While such materials can be efficacious, resistance and other factors have fueled interest in dusts that kill via desiccation. (photo 1). In previous studies with diatomaceous earth, the compound performed well in the lab, but poorly in the field (Romero et al. 2009, Potter et al. 2013). The present study focuses on another dust desiccant, silica gel, evaluated in both the lab and in bed bug-infested apartments.



Understanding Silica Gel.

Silica gels are white, fluffy, powders manufactured from silica. Silica (Si) comprises more than a quarter of the earth’s crust in the form of sand, quartz, clay and other materials. Many plants, including those we eat, absorb soluble forms of silica from soil. Silica does not occur naturally in its pure form, reacting instead with oxygen and water to form silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Thus, the terms “silica” and “silicon dioxide” are often used interchangeably.

Both silica gel and diatomaceous earth (DE) are comprised of silicon dioxide but their origins and manufacture are different. DE is mined from fossilized remains of microscopic plants (diatoms) whose hardened shells contain silica. Silica gel however is synthetically produced, often from sand, via various manufacturing processes. The term “gel” is somewhat misleading since the material is hard and often formed into beads or granules. Silica gel is also amorphous (non-crystalline), which greatly diminishes its potential hazard to humans.

Silica gel and other forms of synthetic amorphous silica have many industrial uses beyond insecticides. They are efficient desiccants (drying agents), which is why small bags of the material are often packaged with electronics to prevent moisture accumulation during shipping and storage. Due to their anti-clumping properties, silica gels are sometimes added to powdered foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Role as Insecticides. Products containing silica gel have been used by the pest control industry for more than a half century. The first such product (Dri-Die, Fairfield American Corp.) was registered in 1956. Formulations employed for pest control tend to be light, fluffy powders comprised of very small, porous particles. The tiny particles often have an electrostatic charge that helps them adhere to insects crawling over treated surfaces. Sometimes referred to as “aerogels,” the resultant dusts can be so light that a pint-size bottle weighs just a few ounces. Because the particles are so lightweight, they often suspend in the air following application. To overcome this, some formulations contain additives such as petroleum distillate (e.g., Drione, Bayer Environmental Science), or are dispensed as liquid aerosols (Tri-Die, BASF Corp.). These two formulations also contain pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. Recently, another formulation (CimeXa) containing 100 percent amorphous silica gel and no other additives, was introduced by Rockwell Labs.

Mechanism of Action. Both silica gel and diatomaceous earth kill insects by removing a portion of the razor-thin, waxy outer coating that helps them conserve moisture. As a result, they desiccate and die from dehydration. Like super-fine sandpaper, DE acts principally by abrading the protective outer layer of wax as the insect crawls over or through the particles. Instead of causing abrasion, silica gel functions more like a sponge to absorb the cuticular waxes onto the particles. Silica gels have tremendous oil-absorbing capability. Studies have shown that such highly “sorptive” dusts are generally more effective than abrasive, less absorptive dusts (such as DE), especially under field conditions (Ebeling 1961, 1971; Subramanyam and Roesli 2000). It should be noted that boric acid is not a desiccant and has little effect on bed bugs since it must be ingested. None of the aforementioned dusts kill insects by clogging the breathing pores (spiracles) as is sometimes erroneously believed.

Safety Profile. Silica gel has low toxicity to mammals. The acute oral LD 50 is comparable to table salt. As noted previously, the compound is routinely added to foods and pharmaceuticals to prevent clumping. With respect to inhalation hazard, an important distinction must be made between synthetically produced, non-crystalline silica gel and naturally occurring crystalline silica such as quartz dust. Inhaling tiny particles of crystalline silica as might occur during sandblasting or mining operations can cause silicosis and other chronic respiratory illnesses. This is not a concern with non-crystalline silica gel insecticides. (Authors’ note: While inhalation of crystalline silica should not be a concern with diatomaceous earth the risk is even lower with silica gel. Synthetically produced silica gel is nearly 100 percent pure non-crystalline silica. Diatomaceous earth is also largely comprised of amorphous [non-crystalline] silica, but may contain impurities, including small amounts of crystalline silica.)

As with any dusty material, airborne silica gel particles can be somewhat irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Due to its desiccating properties, the dust also has a drying effect on skin which can be avoided by wearing gloves or washing after use.



Laboratory Trials.

A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of silica gel on bed bugs. CimeXa insecticide dust (Rockwell Labs, North Kansas City, Mo.) containing 100 percent amorphous silica gel was used in all experiments.

Lab Test #1. In this experiment, adult bed bugs from three different bed bug populations were exposed to surface deposits of either CimeXa dust, Temprid SC (ß-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid, 0.075 percent) or water alone. The populations collected from Lexington (LEX-6) and Cincinnati (CIN-TS) were previously determined to be highly resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. The third population, collected six years ago from New York (NY-1), was initially highly resistant but has since reverted to being somewhat less resistant. Twenty adult males from each population were confined individually on treated discs of black filter paper. The CimeXa dust was applied with a small hobby brush, leaving a fine, barely visible deposit on the black paper surface. Discs wetted with Temprid or water alone were allowed to dry completely before bugs were placed on treated surfaces. Mortality was recorded after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days of continuous exposure to each treatment.





Results. CimeXa dust was highly effective against all three populations, killing all insects within 24 to 48 hours (Figure 1). The rapid result with silica gel was especially noteworthy given the barely visible amount of dust applied. Temprid SC was considerably less effective, especially against the two populations highly resistant to pyrethroids. No bugs from LEX-6 or CIN-TS succumbed during seven days of continuous confinement on treated surfaces, while 45 and 70 percent mortality occurred at three and seven days exposure of the moderately resistant (NY-1) strain.

Lab Test #2. In three additional experiments, we evaluated effects of silica gel applied as a dust, or mixed with water and sprayed onto surfaces. Adult male bed bugs were treated from a moderately resistant population collected eight years ago in Cincinnati (CIN-1). In each experiment, treatments were applied to 4.3-inch diameter discs cut from standard “cut and loop” commercial carpet. To simulate an abbreviated exposure, groups of 10 bed bugs (four replicates per treatment) were released from atop an inverted watch glass in the center of each disc and allowed to crawl across the treated carpet (photo 2). Upon reaching the edge, an exposure ranging from a few seconds to about five minutes, each bed bug was removed and mortality was recorded over a two week period.





In the first such evaluation, CimeXa dust was compared to diatomaceous earth (Mother Earth, BASF Corp.) and carpet left untreated. Both products were applied with a bellows-type hand duster (Executive Pest Control Products, Southlake, Texas) into a Plexiglas cylinder oriented vertically above each disc. The cylinder acted as a void and enabled a more uniform deposition of dust onto the target surface. Another group of discs was left untreated to serve as a control. In a second experiment, bed bugs were exposed to different amounts of silica gel by varying the number of puffs into the Plexiglas void. In a final lab experiment, we compared CimeXa dust to the same material mixed with water and applied as a spray. Dilutions were prepared by mixing 1, 4 and 8 ounces of CimeXa powder per gallon of water. A fine mist spray bottle was used to moisten carpet discs with the aqueous suspension (0.9 ml applied in three squirts).

Results. Silica gel was substantially more effective than diatomaceous earth when bed bugs were exposed briefly to deposits. Almost all of the bugs (97.5 percent) died within 24 hours of walking over silica gel dusted carpet, while only 10 percent succumbed by then to diatomaceous earth (Figure 2). The quantity of CimeXa applied in this instance (1.34 mg/cm2), was typical of commercial practice; however, smaller amounts of dust (0.4 and 0.13 mg/cm2) applied in a subsequent experiment were also effective. Rapid, 100 percent mortality occurred even with the smallest quantity of dust applied (Figure 3, also see photo 3).







Figure 4 (visit www.pctonline.com) shows the result when silica gel was applied as an aqueous spray versus a dust. Both forms of treatment, especially the dust, caused substantial mortality. Although the CimeXa label recommends mixing 16 ounces of powder per gallon of water, we were concerned the milky suspension would leave a noticeable deposit on treated indoor surfaces. Consequently, the maximum dilution we tested was 8 ounces per gallon. This resulted in a silica gel dosage of about 0.55 mg/cm2, about four times greater than the amount applied as a dust (0.13 mg/cm2) yet still not as effective.



Field Trial.

The procedure used to evaluate silica gel in bed bug infested apartments was similar to that used previously to test DE (see “Where Do Bed Bugs Stand When the Dust Settles?” PCT Dec. 2013). Ten infested apartments located in six buildings throughout central Kentucky were chosen for evaluation. Six of the units were treated with CimeXa dust while four were treated with CimeXa mixed with water and applied as a spray. Each apartment was thoroughly inspected before treatment, recording numbers of live bed bugs (adults and nymphs) found on beds, upholstered furniture and in other locations. Several of the units were heavily infested prior to treatment (photo 4). Pretreatment infestation levels based on visual counts ranged from 30 to 1,255 live bugs per apartment (mean=390) in units treated with the dust, and 317 to 2,150 per apartment (mean=1,086) in units treated with the aqueous suspension. Adjacent apartments also were inspected but were not treated since they showed minimal signs of infestation.

Tenants and property managers were informed of the treatment protocol before beginning the study. Residents were advised not to self-treat, and were told to do no preparation prior to our treatment. We did not instruct them to disassemble beds, launder bedding or clothing, or dispose of infested furnishings. Moreover, no encasements were installed on mattresses or box springs. In this manner we hoped to observe the effects of silica gel on bed bug populations, apart from other pest-management tactics.

Each apartment was treated solely with silica gel, i.e., no other insecticides were applied. In lieu of using a commercial duster, the powder was applied with soft-bristle paint and cosmetic brushes purchased from retail stores (photo 5). The rationale for “brushing” rather than “puffing” on the dry silica gel was to minimize drift and “blow-back” when the dust was applied to non-void areas. Another reason for treating in this manner was that if non-professionals wanted to use desiccant dusts to control bed bugs, they would not have ready access to commercial dusting equipment. The tools we used — rudimentary by industry standards — were nonetheless an improvement over the squeeze bottle-type dispensers typically accompanying dusts sold to the public. For liquid silica gel application, the CimeXa label advises mixing 1 pound of powder per gallon of water. However, based on the previous lab findings and handling considerations, we chose to apply 4 ounces of the powder per gallon of water, using a hand-held, 1-quart sprayer (B&G Equipment Co., Jackson, Ga.).

Application of both the dust and spray were thorough, targeting areas where bed bugs were found or likely to occur especially along seams and edges of mattresses, box springs, bed frames and upholstered furniture. The amount of CimeXa dust applied in six apartments assigned to this treatment was about 1 to 3 ounces. The intent was to apply a fine deposit while leaving no discernable accumulation of powder on surfaces. The amount of CimeXa applied in four apartment as a liquid ranged from 2 to 18 ounces of spray dilution. Some units were treated only once while others were spot treated in some areas a second time.

Follow-up inspections of apartments were generally performed weekly or bi-weekly, recording the number and location of live bed bugs on each visit.





Results. CimeXa dust caused a rapid decline in bed bug numbers in treated apartments (Figure 5). Compared to the average initial bed bug count (390), an 82.3 percent reduction was noted after one week and 98.1 percent fewer bugs were found by the final evaluation. These results were markedly better than what we saw when apartments were treated in a similar manner with diatomaceous earth (Potter et al. 2013) and compare favorably to former trials utilizing liquid sprays of Temprid and Phantom (Potter et al. 2008, 2012).

When silica gel was applied as an aqueous suspension, the average reduction in bed bugs after one to two weeks was 35.1 percent; Unit 3 actually had a small (5.4 percent) increase in numbers. By the last observation 3.5 to 5 weeks after initial treatment, the average percent reduction was 33.9 percent, with Unit 2 showing an increase of 6.6 percent. Apart from the diminished efficacy, the spray left a distinct white deposit on treated surfaces (photo 6). Such deposits would likely have been even more evident if the aqueous suspension of silica gel had been applied at the labeled concentration of 1 pound rather than 4 ounces per gallon.

Decreased effectiveness of silica gel applied as an aqueous suspension also was reported by Ebeling (1971). Mixing the dust with water apparently reduces the amount of material picked up by insects crawling over treated surfaces. All four study sites treated with the aqueous suspension of CimeXa were terminated and treated conventionally after four to six weeks, as per our agreement with the occupants.



Summary and Implications.

The findings clearly show that silica gel is a more potent bed bug killer than diatomaceous earth. Abbreviated exposures (as brief as a few seconds) to barely visible deposits resulted in 100 percent mortality of adult bed bugs. Rapid and complete mortality occurred even with highly resistant strains that could not be killed with Temprid the most widely used liquid insecticide for bed bugs. Lab and field tests further indicate that silica gel is more effective applied as a dust than an aqueous suspension. Although CimeXa’s label includes directions for mixing the powder with water and applying it as a spray, the milky suspension leaves a distinct deposit on many indoor surfaces.

It remains to be seen whether brush application of silica gel has utility for bed bug management. Utilization of dust insecticides for this pest has typically involved puffing materials into wall, bed and furniture voids, beneath perimeter edges of carpet, etc. To minimize blow-back and drift of particles, a different approach was needed for treating seams, tufts, folds and crevices, where the majority of bed bugs reside.

Applying dust with a brush has its challenges. The treatment is more tedious than insecticide sprays, and can be messy if not applied with precision. If utilized by non-professionals, it would be crucial to provide clear treatment instructions.



Treatment as Prevention?

Perhaps most intriguing is the prospect of using silica gel for prevention. Studies have shown that bed bugs are highly mobile within and between living units (Wang et al. 2010, 2012; Potter et al. 2013). Adults and nymphs are routinely captured in monitors placed in sleeping and seating areas, as well as around room perimeters. Recent genetic studies also have revealed that infestations in multi-unit buildings are more often due to active dispersal than repeated introduction by building occupants (Booth et al. 2012). Bed bugs can pass through walls, floors and ceilings via cracks and utility openings. They also infest neighboring units by traversing hallways and gaining access under entry doors.

Based on what we observed, it seems likely that propagation and spread of infestations could be reduced by applying an ultralight deposit of silica gel around the perimeter (baseboard areas) of living units. Depending upon risk of infestation, proactive application also might be warranted under and around beds, sofas and recliners, along common hallways/corridors, and beneath unit entry doors. In the future, we hope to assist in developing tools to make such applications clean and efficient. If not diminished by vacuuming or obscured by household dust, the deposit would likely have a long residual, perhaps more than a year. Resistance would be less likely since pests seldom become immune to desiccant insecticides.

Although silica gel has low mammalian toxicity, the powder is light and dusty. Airborne particles can be irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract, and the dust also has a drying effect on skin. Nonetheless, label directions permit application to the entire bed complex, including the mattress. As with any insecticide application, pest management professionals must decide, based on the circumstances, whether application is prudent.

When it comes to bed bugs, there is an escalating need for effective, low-cost, sustainable solutions, especially for underserved populations that are disproportionately suffering. Silica gel, one of our most timeworn insecticides, could be one such solution.

As in the letter vitamin picture, China dominates the supply of amino acids, Schultz said. The supply picture there is changing, with traditional production methods being put under pressure by new modes that offer both cost and quality advances.

Duck feathers?

“Back in the day, all the amino acids were being produced via a hydrolyzed process. They used human hair or duck feathers for a raw material. That was very commonplace. It was a good process, conducted by mature manufacturers,” ?Schultz said. “But it could be less consistent in assay, and there was more concern with heavy metals and with water pollution.”?

Using fermentation as opposed to hydrolysis offers some advantages, Schultz said. For one, the inputs are potentially ‘cleaner.’

“This process starts from corn, so it is a vegan type material. It has great traction in the marketplace. ?In the beginning the fermentation products were more expensive than the hydrolyzed. But over time as they have kicked in efficiencies and new plants came on board, not only is the pricing becoming attractive but the customers we sell to are yelling pretty loud about the contamination issues,”? Schultz said.

“Fermentation in the end could be cheaper because it is more eco friendly than hydrolysis,”? he said.

The move toward fermentaiton has as yet not had a huge impact on the cost of these ingredients, as GWI’s survey shows prices remain fairly steady across the board. But it is a long term trend that over time will transform the market. Most of the amino acids are amenable to a fermentation approach, Schultz said. Among those that must still come from hydrolysis are L-cysteine and L-cystine and L-tyrosine.

GMO issue?

It is still unclear how far down the supply chain the issue of the labeling of genetically modified ingredients will reach. When using corn as an input for fermented amino acids the question becomes, is that corn GMO? And is that important one way or the other? Schultz, for one, is not taking chances.

“We are looking into it as we speak. We have some auditors out there going into corn fields to find out in light of almost all the US corn being GMO. I have been told the Chinese corn is non GMO. If it becomes a problem, producers could possibly look into a different raw material, whether it’s rice or tapioca,”? Schultz said.","Fri, 01 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/bundles/wrbmgbsite/images/favicon/nutraingredients_usa/favicon.ico,"['supplier', 'schultz', 'supply', 'corn', 'process', 'amino', 'acid', 'revolution', 'transforming', 'fermentation', 'market', 'acids', 'gmo', 'material', 'hydrolysis']", ,none

Not a boot print left behind. It was cold and nearly moonless, a fine night for a raid, so he hiked about an hour to the Pine Tree summer camp, a few dozen cabins spread along the shoreline of North Pond in central Maine. With an expert twist of a screwdriver, he popped open a door of the dining hall and slipped inside, scanning the pantry shelves with his penlight.

Candy! Always good. Ten rolls of Smarties, stuffed in a pocket. Then, into his backpack, a bag of marshmallows, two tubs of ground coffee, some Humpty Dumpty potato chips. Burgers and bacon were in the locked freezer. On a previous raid at Pine Tree, he’d stolen a key to the walk-in, and now he used it to open the stainless-steel door. The key was attached to a plastic four-leaf-clover key chain, with one of the leaves partially broken off. A three-and-a-half-leaf clover.

He could’ve used a little more luck. Newly installed in the Pine Tree kitchen, hidden behind the ice machine, was a military-grade motion detector. The device remained silent in the kitchen but sounded an alarm in the home of Sergeant Terry Hughes, a game warden who’d become obsessed with catching the thief. Hughes lived a mile away. He raced to the camp in his pickup truck and sprinted to the rear of the dining hall. He peeked in a window.

And there he was. Probably. The person stealing food appeared entirely too clean, his face freshly shaved. He wore eyeglasses and a wool ski hat. Was this really the North Pond Hermit, a man who’d tormented the surrounding community for years—decades—yet the police still hadn’t learned his name?

Hughes used his cell phone, quietly, and asked the Maine State Police to alert trooper Diane Perkins-Vance, who had also been hunting the hermit. Before Perkins-Vance could get there, the burglar, his backpack full, started toward the exit. If the man stepped into the forest, Hughes understood, he might never be found again.

The burglar eased out of the dining hall, and Hughes used his left hand to blind the man with his flashlight; with his right he aimed his .357 square on his nose. ""Get on the ground!"" he bellowed.

The thief complied, no resistance, and lay facedown, candy spilling out of his pockets. It was one thirty in the morning on April 4, 2013. Perkins-Vance soon arrived, and the burglar was placed, handcuffed, in a plastic chair. The officers asked his name. He refused to answer. His skin was strangely pale; his glasses, with chunky plastic frames, were extremely outdated. But he wore a nice Columbia jacket, new Lands’ End blue jeans, and sturdy boots. The officers searched him, and no identification was located.

Hughes left the suspect alone with Perkins-Vance. She removed his handcuffs and gave him a bottle of water. And he started to speak. A little. When Perkins-Vance asked why he didn’t want to answer any questions, he said he was ashamed. He spoke haltingly, uncertainly; the connection between his mind and his mouth seemed to have atrophied from disuse. But over the next couple of hours, he gradually opened up.

His name, he revealed, was Christopher Thomas Knight. Born on December 7, 1965. He said he had no address, no vehicle, did not file a tax return, and did not receive mail. He said he lived in the woods.

""For how long?"" wondered Perkins-Vance.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://media.gq.com/photos/558c22fda5449ebf2fc810a4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-454070160.jpg","['hughes', 'man', 'pine', 'curious', 'strange', 'used', 'plastic', 'hermit', 'key', 'left', 'tale', 'perkinsvance', 'tree', 'true']", ,none

Nearly 2,500 people gathered to memorialize Michael Brown, the teenager who was shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri

ST. LOUIS -- Michael Brown's relatives said goodbye Monday to the 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a police officer, remembering him as a ""gentle soul"" with a deep and growing faith in Christianity and ambitions that one day ""the world would know his name.""

Thousands of mourners filled the massive Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis for the funeral, which began with upbeat music punctuated by clapping. Some mourners danced in place, and ushers passed out water and tissues.

Eric Davis, one of Brown's cousins, urged the crowd to go to the polls and push for change, saying the community has had ""enough of the senseless killings.""

Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, described Brown as a ""big guy, but a kind, gentle soul."" He recalled his nephew once telling the family that someday his name would be known by the wider world.

""He did not know he was offering up a divine prophecy at that time,"" Ewing said.

Another uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, said in his eulogy that Brown's ""blood is crying from the ground, crying for vengeance, crying for justice.""

Among the mourners was Will Acklin, a black man from Little Rock, Arkansas.

""It's important in that as a child I was pushed by police, mistreated by police, cursed by police, and I was a good kid,"" said Acklin, who is 63. ""I was an honor student. When I heard this, I felt compelled to come here and show my respects.""

Angela Pierre, a machine operator who once lived in Ferguson, where the shooting happened and fueled nearly two weeks of street protests, said she hopes the funeral helps turn a page and eases tensions. Most important, though, she hopes it provides healing for Brown's family.

""I really wanted to just be here today to pray for the family and pray for peace,"" said Pierre, 48, who is black. ""When all of this dies down, there still a mother, father and a family who's lost someone. Sometimes a lot of the unrest takes away from that.""

The Rev. Al Sharpton spoke at the funeral and reflected the frustration many feel over Brown's death.

""No community in America would tolerate an 18-year-old laying in the streets,"" Sharpton said. ""The value of this boy's life needs to be answered by somebody.""

The church's sanctuary, which seats about 2,500, filled quickly. Overflow rooms holding another 2,000 were full, too.

With the church at capacity, many people could not get in and instead waited outside, crowded into shady areas on a day when the temperature was expected to come close to 100 degrees. Ambulance crews were on hand in case of any heat-related illnesses.

Poster-size photos of Brown, wearing headphones, were on each side of the closed casket, which had a St. Louis Cardinals ball cap atop it. Large projection screens showed a photo of Brown clutching his high school diploma while wearing his cap and gown. He had been scheduled to start training at a technical school two days after his death. He wanted to become a heating and air-conditioning technician.

Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., has asked protesters to take a break Monday and observe a ""day of silence"" so the family can grieve.

""Tomorrow all I want is peace,"" he told hundreds of people Sunday in St. Louis' largest city park during brief remarks at a festival that promotes peace over violence. ""That's all I ask.""

Early Monday morning, Brown's request appeared to be honored. At the Ferguson Police Department, where a small but steady group of protesters have stood vigil for two weeks, a handmade sign announced a ""break for funeral."" The West Florissant Avenue commercial corridor was also devoid of protesters, whose ranks have typically swelled as days turned to nights.

Brown was unarmed when he was shot Aug. 9 by officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A grand jury is considering evidence in the case, and a federal investigation is also underway.

Police have said a scuffle broke out after Wilson told Brown and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. Police said Wilson was pushed into his squad car and physically assaulted. Some witnesses have reported seeing Brown's arms in the air - an act of surrender. An autopsy found Brown was shot at least six times.

A quarter-million has been donated to Brown's family, but legal defense funds for Wilson have raised $388,000

CBS News correspondent Vladimir Duthiers reported that the face of protests in Ferguson is changing, with organized demonstrations and a more diverse crowd. In oppressive, 100-degree heat, more than 200 demonstrators gathered for a rally Saturday afternoon. They were led by children in a silent march down West Florissant Avenue, the site of so much violence just days ago.

""For years during the civil rights movement it was a question of, 'Can I get in this college to go to Harvard?'"" said demonstrator John Gaskin. ""Now we have black men in America and the question is, 'Can you stay alive to get into Harvard?'

KC Smith says she is concerned for her the future of her son, Damian and feels a connection to the Brown family.

""Once he is 17 years old running around, doing what African-American teens are supposed to, will he be mistaken as a criminal or thug? That worries me,"" she told Duthiers outside the church.

Family members denounced a video released by police, who say it shows Brown snatching some cigars in a convenience store just before he was killed. In the video, the person said to be Brown is seen grabbing a clerk by the shirt and forcefully pushing him into a display rack.

Family and friends say Brown was an aspiring rapper with a gentle, joking manner who dubbed himself ""Big Mike."" He was good at fixing things, liked computer games, the rapper Lil Wayne, Drake, the movie ""Grown Ups 2,"" and the TV show ""Family Guy.""

""We don't want anything tomorrow to happen that might defile the name of Michael Brown,"" Sharpton said as he stood next to Brown's father on Sunday. ""This is not about our rage tomorrow. It's about the legacy and memory of his son.""

President Barack Obama sent three White House aides. Others in attendance included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, moviemaker Spike Lee and entertainer Sean Combs, as well as many local and regional civil rights leaders. The Rev. Al Sharpton was also expected to speak.

Monday also marked the first day back at school for students in the Ferguson-Florissant School District. Classes were scheduled to begin Aug. 14 but postponed due to safety concerns.

School personnel have received training in how to deal with students who may be experiencing stress related to the shooting and its aftermath.

""I'm excited,"" said Marcus Baker, a junior at McCluer South-Berkeley High School. ""We're ready to move forward. But we're still going to remember him.""","Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/25/e56cad8b-315d-4310-b270-b81146302788/thumbnail/1200x630/c781bb8f95060010223378851a82dea1/casketap987819430149.jpg,"['school', 'wilson', 'draws', 'ferguson', 'brown', 'louis', 'shot', 'michael', 'browns', 'family', 'thousands', 'sharpton', 'missouri', 'funeral']", ,none
86,86,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Air Transat near-disaster aids understanding of PTSD - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/air-transat-near-disaster-aids-understanding-of-ptsd/article20066798/,"Thirteen years ago next week marks what could have been a grim anniversary: Air Transat Flight 236, bound for Lisbon from Toronto, crash-landed on an island in the Azores off Portugal after running out of fuel over the Atlantic. While all 306 passengers and crew survived the dead-stick landing, those on board had spent a harrowing 30 minutes as the crippled plane glided over the ocean, not knowing whether they would live or die.

Their hair's-breadth escape on Aug. 24, 2001, not only turned potential tragedy into celebration, it also provided researchers with a unique opportunity to study the effects of trauma and the role that memory plays in dealing with such an ordeal.

In a study published online Wednesday in the journal Clinical Psychological Science, researchers had 15 passengers who'd been on the flight relay their memories of the event, as well as those related to the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. that occurred soon after.

Something else about the study was also likely unprecedented: Margaret McKinnon, one of the researchers, was a passenger on that flight, travelling with her husband to Lisbon for a honeymoon.

McKinnon, now a psychologist in the mood disorders program at St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, said she remembers the flight crew's announcement that the plane was going to have to ditch in the ocean and that passengers should don life jackets. Shortly after, the oxygen masks above the seats dropped down as the cabin began depressurizing.

""There were countdowns until that would happen,"" she said of the excruciating half-hour as occupants inside the darkened plane waited for their expected crash into the water. Then somebody – she isn't sure if it was a passenger or crew member – yelled that land had been sighted, ""and they sounded quite surprised.""

Pilot Captain Robert Piché was able to glide the plane into a hard landing on an island airstrip. ""The passengers all cheered,"" she said, then everyone evacuated the aircraft using emergency chutes and ran as the plane's blown-out wheels caught fire. ""I think for me during those 30 minutes, I sort of imagined that this was likely to be the end. I know not everyone felt that way, but I did,"" said McKinnon, then a 26-year-old graduate student at the University of Toronto. ""So it sort of gave you time to prepare for that.""

The 15 passengers who took part in the study each had their own set of memories from the event, said senior study author Brian Levine, a senior scientist at Baycrest Health Science's Rotman Research Institute in Toronto.

Tapping into their recall of events as they unfolded moment to moment, the researchers were able to probe both the quality and accuracy of passengers' memories along with those of two other events – Sept. 11, 2001, and a neutral event from the same time period – and relate their findings to the presence or absence of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

Compared with the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the neutral event, the amount of information recalled around Flight TS236 ""was very rich,"" Levine said.

Story continues below advertisement

""For example, when we asked these same people to recall 9/11, they produced between 100 and 150 details; when they recalled the Air Transat event, they produced anywhere from 250 to 350.""

Researchers were not surprised by this finding because emotionally charged events typically produce greater recall. What was not expected was a finding that passengers who subsequently developed PTSD and those who didn't showed no difference in the amount of detail they remembered or its accuracy.

""We thought people with PTSD might have more vivid recall because they have more intrusions, they're thinking about it more, ruminating about it more,"" he said. ""But that was not the case."" However, those affected by PTSD relayed more ""external"" details – comments that were not specific to the event, but might involve thoughts or perceptions, such as, ""Wow, I never thought we were going to make it,"" or, ""I've never flown Air Transat again.""

This pattern was observed across all events tested, suggesting it is not just memories of the trauma itself that are related to PTSD, but rather how a person processes memory for events in general.

""What our findings show is that it is not what happened but to whom it happened that may determine subsequent onset of PTSD,"" said Levine, adding that an inability to shut out external details is related to mental control over memory recall.

""The big question here is why – when you've got this plane full of people, at least in our sample – half got PTSD and half didn't?

Story continues below advertisement

""To me, that's the most important finding of the study,"" he said, noting the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting altered memory processing may be a vulnerability factor for PTSD.

Dr. Ruth Lanius, a professor of psychiatry at Western University in London, Ont., who specializes in PTSD, said the study shows that memories of a traumatic nature are more vivid than other memories, consistent with other research findings.

""A lot of people who have had traumatic memories experience them in the form of flashbacks, they're experienced in a timeless form,"" said Lanius, who was not involved in the study.

Lanius said in order to help a person heal from a traumatic event, the nature of their memories needs to be changed. ""We don't want people to be haunted by the memories; we want people to experience them as normal memory of the past that you recall but not relive.""

McKinnon, who was not one of the study subjects, said she developed post-traumatic symptoms as a result of her experiences aboard the Air Transat flight.

[10:00] Now, let’s take a look at the host city, Nanjing.

Nanjing, having been called Jinling in ancient times, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, together with Beijing, Xi’an and Luoyang.

[9:40] The official theme song of the 2014 YOG – “Dreams Never End” was released on June 27, 2014. The song was chosen from a competition that went on for six months and involved more than 5,000 participants. Click here to listen.

[9:20] Cicka said:

I was inspired by the athletes’ track which, to me, means the base of the Youth Olympic Games. So I put it into my concept and used different shapes to represent the winning athletes and the podium. And finally I called it The Track of Winners.”

The judging panel comprised of world-renowned designer, Thomas Heatherwick, the man behind the iconic Olympic cauldron at the London 2012 Olympic Games; Youth Olympic Games 400m hurdles gold medalist Aurelie Chaboudez (FRA); Olympic short-track speed skating champion Yang Yang (CHN); Youth Olympic Games Ambassador Yelena Isinbaeva (RUS); Olympic fencer and IOC Athletes’ Commission Chair Claudia Bokel (GER); and IOC Olympic Games Executive Director Gilbert Felli.

The panel also selected two runner-up designs. They were ‘A Hug From Lele!’ by Hugo Fernandez, 29, from Spain; and ‘Stripes of Victory’ by Csaba Szitas, 28, from Slovakia.

[9:10] The medal for Nanjing 2014 is designed by Matej Cicka, a 23-year-old young sports fan from Slovakia.

The winning entry, “Track of Winners”, was chosen from a pool of over 300 entries from over 50 countries by a prestigious IOC jury who described it as “modern, fresh and dynamic” when they were brought together from around the globe to pick the winner.

See more photos of the Medals here.

[8:55] Nanjinglele was inspired by the Rain Flower Pebble which can be found naturally in all shapes and sizes, reflecting the beauty of nature and bringing us closer to nature.

Recognised as a decorative pebble since ancient times, the Rain Flower Pebble has been praised by the Chinese as a “national treasure bestowed from heaven”. The selection of the Rain Flower Pebble as the Nanjing 2014 mascot illustrates to the world, the unique charms of Nanjing as a modern, green city that embraces nature and sustainable development. These values correspond with the key values of Nanjing 2014 which advocates a natural and healthy lifestyle among global youth.

[8:45] In the name of the Nanjing 2014 Mascot, “Lele” literally means happiness in Mandarin and also refers to the sound of stones banging. In ancient times, people frequently banged stones as a form of entertainment when they quarried or built roads. Hence other than joy and happiness, the word “le” also signifies a pioneering spirit.

The slogan for the First Youth Olympic Games in Singapore was ‘Blazing the Trail’, whereas “Lele” signifies how youth forges ahead courageously in their exploration of the Youth Olympic Movement at Nanjing 2014, creating a “Nanjing model” of the YOG and ultimately bringing together, youths from around the world to this very special place that is Nanjing.

[8:30] On 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games.

The slogan of the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games is “Share the Games, Share our Dreams”.

[8:10] Just like the Olympic Games, the Youth Olympic Games are held every four years. The first summer edition was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010, and the first winter edition was held in Innsbruck, Austria, from 13 to 22 January 2012.

The 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games will be held in Nanjing and the 2nd Winter Youth Olympic Games will be held in Lillehammer, Norway, in February 2016. The 3rd Summer Youth Olympic Games will be held in Buenos Aires in Argentina in 2018.

[8:06] The Youth Olympic Games aim to bring together talented young athletes aged from 15 to 18 from around the world (205 National Olympic Committees participated in Singapore 2010 and 69 in Innsbruck 2012).

The Summer Youth Olympic Games feature over 3,500 athletes and are held over a 12-day period, while the Winter Youth Olympic Games feature over 1,100 athletes and last 10 days.

Non-athlete participants, namely the Young Reporters, Ambassadors and Athlete Role Models, are also an integral part of the Youth Olympic Games experience.

[8:02] The Youth Olympic Games are an elite sporting event for young people from all over the world. An event distinct from other youth sports events, as they also integrate a unique Culture and Education Programme (CEP), based around five main themes: Olympism, Social Responsibility, Skills Development, Expression and Well-being and Healthy Lifestyles.

The sports programme is based on that of the Olympic Games, with 28 sports featured on the summer programme and seven on the winter programme. In addition, the programme also includes exciting new disciplines and formats, such as 3-on-3 basketball, ice hockey skills challenge and mixed gender and mixed National Olympic Committee (NOC) events.

Away from the field of play and through a variety of fun and interactive activities, workshops and team-building exercises, the CEP gives the participating athletes the opportunity to learn about the Olympic values, explore other cultures and develop the skills to become true ambassadors of their sport.

[8:00] The second Summer Youth Olympic Games will run from August 16-28 in Nanjing, East China.","Sat, 16 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://live.china.org.cn/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/favicon.ico,"['youth', 'opening', 'olympic', 'games', 'yog', 'updates', 'young', 'events', 'major', 'chinaorgcn', 'chinese', 'ceremony', 'athletes', 'live', 'nanjing']", ,none

90,90,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Stem-cell transplant eases symptoms of rare ‘stiff person syndrome’: study - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/stem-cell-transplant-eases-symptoms-of-rare-stiff-person-syndrome-study/article20202937/,"Canadian doctors have begun using stem cell transplants to treat ""stiff person syndrome,"" a rare neurological condition in which a patient's leg and other muscles suddenly contract painfully, often leaving them immobilized like a tin soldier.

The disorder, which affects an estimated one in a million people, occurs when the immune system turns against a person's own tissues, in this case attacking cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Stem cell transplants have been used to treat patients with other auto-immune diseases, among them multiple sclerosis, scleroderma and Crohn's disease, but this may be the first time the procedure has been employed to alleviate the symptoms of stiff person syndrome, or SPS, the researchers reported Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology.

SPS is characterized by episodes of stiffness in the muscles and painful muscle spasms, which can be brought on by stress, loud noises or emotional distress. Some people with the disorder are so disabled they are unable to walk or move and may isolate themselves at home to avoid triggering an attack.

""Sometimes this happens when they're startled,"" said Dr. Harry Atkins of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the Ottawa Hospital, who headed a team that transplanted stem cells into two women with the disease.

""So you can imagine walking across the street and someone honks the horn and you can't move, or you start falling and because your muscles can't move, you just fall and you hurt yourself,"" Atkins said Monday from Ottawa.

""It really does provide a barrier with just going on with your life.""

Tina Ceroni of Toronto is one of the two SPS patients who had the stem-cell transplant — and she said it has given back her life.

The personal fitness trainer, now 36, started getting severe symptoms in her late 20s. Initially she was diagnosed with hyponatremia, or low blood sodium, thought to be related to her heavy training schedule for a half-ironman competition.

But when she tried to water-ski at a friend's cottage and had to be helped from the water because she was unable to move, Ceroni ""knew that there was something definitely not right.""

Story continues below advertisement

""My legs stiffened up like they were two complete boards. I had no ability to relax the muscles. They started to constrict to a point where I thought a bone might break or a tendon might rupture, and I was in pain for about eight hours.""

She eventually was diagnosed with stiff person disease, which not only affected her legs but also the muscles in her arms and torso, leaving her unable to breathe properly when the muscles that control respiration would contract and go into spasm.

The year before her stem-cell transplant, she was rushed to the hospital 47 times because of life-threatening respiratory distress.

Ceroni had been living with her twin sister in Toronto but had to move back with her parents in nearby Burlington, Ont., because she couldn't be left alone.

""I started to withdraw from social events and social gatherings or being in a situation that was slightly unpredictable or if there was a potential for a loud noise, even walking down the street,"" she said. ""If a car drove by and honked its horn and I was startled ... within minutes I could be on the ground.

""I wasn't able to live a normal life at all. The disease was dictating my life entirely. It became very, very isolating.""

Story continues below advertisement

Ceroni had her stem-cell transplant in May 2011, and she said her symptoms have disappeared.

""My body doesn't react to noise. I can go to concerts now. I have no sensitivity to the triggers anymore.""

The other patient, who was not identified, had her transplant in 2009, and she too has seen her symptoms abate, allowing her to return to work and resume activities such as skiing and cycling, the researchers reported.

""I think for the period we've commented on for both patients, they've done very, very well,"" said Atkins. ""And it's nice to see them back enjoying life.""

Conventional treatment involves a number of medications, including anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants and pain relievers. Intravenous immunoglobulin can also reduce muscle stiffness and lower sensitivity to noise and other triggers. While such treatments can ease symptoms, they don't cure the disorder, and not all patients get relief from the drugs.

Still, Atkins stressed that not every patient with SPS would be considered for a stem-cell, or bone-marrow, transplant, which requires that the person's immune system be destroyed with high-dose chemotherapy before their previously removed and purified stem cells are reintroduced to create a new, disease-free immune system.

Story continues below advertisement

""It should only be considered where nothing more conventional is working ... the symptoms have to be severe and the impact on their life very, very profound because there are risks associated with this,"" he said, adding that one in 20 patients who receives a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia, lymphoma or an auto-immune disorder will die of a complication.

""And we don't think stiff person syndrome patients ... would have a lower risk,"" he said.

There are also other complications from the chemo, including infertility and premature disorders such as heart disease and diabetes.

""I think for the right patient it might offer some benefit in helping them improve, but it's too early to say that this is the answer to stiff person syndrome. It's a pretty dramatic treatment and we need to keep thinking about better ways to do what we're doing — getting rid of the immune system perhaps with less toxicity and being able to grow back a new one more quickly.

""So I think there are a lot of unanswered questions yet.""

Despite the risks, Ceroni said she had no qualms about going ahead with the transplant.

""I saw it as my only hope for a better future and my only hope to even lessen the disease. Any kind of improvement would have been remarkable for me.

""I saw this transplant as being given a gift of life, literally.""","Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/nnDBdOeVNzVQw2PwMaCy_rXZ5iQ=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FMEF3NZYBJEXNBJB55J2STD5BI,"['eases', 'patients', 'muscles', 'rare', 'stemcell', 'person', 'symptoms', 'syndrome', 'disease', 'continues', 'think', 'study', 'transplant', 'stiff']", ,none

The fish can be bred and the aquarium created in your home.Homestead ornamental fish-keeping holds good potential and fisheries scientists of the Indian Institute of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Old Goa, are training aspiring entrepreneurs in breeding the fish and manufacturing aquariums.“Any farmer or even a homemaker can breed and sell the fish. We can help them with the basic knowledge required for the enterprise,” fishery resource management scientist Manju Lekshmi N said.ICAR director N P Singh said, “Ornamental fishery has good scope as there is demand from corporate offices, schools and the tourismsector for it. Watching fish swim in aquariums helps relieve stress.”Goa has 20-odd shops selling aquariums and other material. “The demand is good and a sizeable clientele comprises offices and households,” Panaji aquarium shop owner Maria Socurina Vaz said. She sources the requirements for the aquarium from across the country. “It is difficult to obtain everything in one state and we get the fishes, plants and pebbles from Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu,” Vaz said.ICAR has set up a nursery to breed and promote entrepreneurship in the state. “We breed goldfish, guppy and gouramies, sword tail, mollies and a few other fish species,” Lekshmi said.Breeding ornamental fish is neither capital intensive nor requires much space or labour. A FRP plastic tank with a water connection, good brooders of fish and hands-on training and experience is all that is required for the enterprise.Good quality brooders are taken up for culture in a nursery tank and then transferred to a rearing tank. Once they grow to a desired size, they can either be retained as brooders or sold in aquariums.The fabrication of glass frames for the aquarium is relatively easy and aspirants can learn the skill in a couple of days. Fabrication itself can be turned into a good business. An entrepreneur can buy the materials for approximately Rs 600, craft the aquarium and pack a few fishes to sell it at Rs 1,500 per piece, scientists said.There aren’t many takers for this business yet. “Most farmers prefer to do it only as a hobby,” Lekshmi said. Marketing is what poses a hurdle, as entrepreneurs lack resources to transport and sell their products. “The question often asked by trainees is: Where do we sell the products once we make them?” Lakshmi said.ICAR scientists suggest that the state step in to help the entrepreneurs. “Fisheries department can roll out a scheme to offer a subsidy and help in marketing the produce,” ICAR (agronomy) subject matter specialist H R Prabhudesai said.Fisheries department does plan to start training in ornamental fishery. “Maybe we will have to consider the marketing aspect later,” fisheries director Shamila Monteiro said.","Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-40352159,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-209607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['saidicar', 'sell', 'tank', 'scientists', 'breed', 'stressbusting', 'state', 'ornamental', 'training', 'aquarium', 'fish', 'good']", ,none

When the rest of his Bravo Two Zero patrol was killed or captured in Iraq, SAS hero Chris Ryan was lucky to make it home alive.

But it wasn’t just his friends he lost in the desert.

His extraordinary escape cost Chris and his wife Jan the chance to have more children after he was forced to drink water contaminated with nuclear waste.

Chris, 53, says: “When I got home I went to Woolwich Hospital for tests.

As we were leaving, the surgeon asked us, ‘Are you planning on having any more children?’

“I told him ‘yes’, so he said, ‘I wouldn’t do that, not in the next year’. We were stunned.

""My wife was a nurse in the Army, so asked him to explain. He said he couldn’t.

""He said, ‘I just wouldn’t if I were you.’ ”

It had taken Chris eight days to cross the 200 miles to Iraq’s Syrian border during the First Gulf War in 1991.

Three of his patrol died and four were captured.

But Chris refused to give up, driven on by his determination to get home and see his two-year-old daughter Sarah again.

It was the longest-ever escape trek by a British soldier and earned Chris the Military Medal.

But he had to find water to stay alive and was forced to drink from a creek downstream from a factory making toxic uranium powder called yellowcake.

At the time the poisoned water burned his throat and made him retch.

It wasn’t until later that he found out it could cause severe deformities in any future children.

Chris, originally from Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear, says: “We were never sure what damage it had done so when the doctor warned us about more children that was it for me.

""I wasn’t prepared to risk it. ”

Asked if he ever wonders what might have been, Chris simply shrugs his broad shoulders.

He saw two of his patrol die of hypothermia in the freezing desert and he has seen more friends driven to suicide by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

That makes it easier to be philosophical.

He says: “I could think, ‘I wish I never drank that water’, but that’s the way the dice rolled.

""Sometimes you just have to count your blessings.”

Without doubt his greatest blessing is his family.

Chris is just back from three weeks hiking in the Alps with daughter Sarah, now 24, who recently finished studying for a Masters Degree in English Literature at Exeter University.

But it was nearly very different. His own battle with PTSD after his escape made him increasingly paranoid and aggressive.

Convinced that family life was getting in the way of his work, he split from Jan for two years, though they later got back together.

Chris says: “I knew things weren’t right, but couldn’t admit what was going on in my head.

Something would just flick inside my brain and I was back on the run in Iraq.

Then one morning I woke up on a training exercise in the jungle in Brunei and it felt like a weight had lifted.

When I looked back at my behaviour and the way I treated people I was ashamed.”

Soon afterwards Chris left the Army. He was training SAS recruits at the time and his first student, Corporal Fergus Rennie, had just been killed in Bosnia in 1994.

Chris says: “I had been to the funerals of 18 colleagues and I was with quite a few of them when they were killed.

""But losing a student was like a close relative dying.”

He never wants to suffer that pain again, especially as he now knows what it’s like to wait at home with a loved one on the front line.

His brother is a Regimental Sergeant Major in the Parachute Regiment with three Afghanistan tours under his belt.

Chris says: “The last time he was out there I really feared we would lose him.

It’s so much more difficult now than when I was out there. I hate to think what it would be like if I had a son on the ground.

“I remember talking to a 19-year-old paratrooper in Colchester who had just come back from Afghanistan.

In six months there were just three days when he hadn’t been shot at. It’s unbelievable.”

After leaving the Army Chris led a private bodyguard team of ex-SAS men before launching his own security training company in the USA, where the law lets them practise with weapons.

Even though he has made a career out of working with firearms, he still dislikes the gung-ho American attitude to guns and he has to – in his words – “wind my neck in” to avoid constant arguments about their gun laws.

He says: “My neighbour there is a car salesman and he asked me to go out for dinner, so I offered to pick them up.

""When he came out of the house he said, ‘Don’t worry, I’m packing and so’s my wife’.

""I thought, ‘We don’t need a gun to go to the steak house’. I sat through dinner feeling really uncomfortable.

“Over there they sell ammunition that can go through two layers of ceramic armour.

""Those are cop-killing bullets. There is no reason for civilians to have them unless rabbits start running around in Kevlar jackets.”

Chris launched a successful career as a writer after his book about his escape in Iraq , The One That Got Away, became a bestseller in 1995.

He has since written a string of hit military fiction novels.

His book Strike Back was turned into a TV show and he was a consultant on ITV drama Ultimate Force, starring Ross Kemp.

It is not an experience he is keen to repeat.

“Most TV shows about war are terrible,” he says.

“Ultimate Force was more like Ultimate Farce and Strike Back just seems to be about sex and violence.

""I had so many arguments with the producers, I just don’t need the heartache.”

Chris has also decided he is now too old for survival shows.

“I did a screen test, but they asked if I would consider getting my hair dyed,” he says, laughing.

“I sat in my car looking in the mirror feeling depressed.”

Nowadays Chris’s biggest passion is encouraging children to read.

Whenever his publisher sends him to a high-flying school to speak to its pupils, he also insists on visiting a struggling school nearby.

He says he feels humbled when kids there are interested in what he has to say.

Children usually ask him the same three questions: what is your favourite weapon, have you ever killed somebody and what is the grossest thing you’ve ever eaten?

But in Portsmouth a girl of 14 asked him if there were any women in the SAS.

He told her there were four attached to the regiment, who went on missions with men so they could pose as married couples.

He chuckles: “The next thing I know she asks me, ‘Do you get to s*** them as well?’

“I nearly passed out. The whole school erupted. I looked at the headmaster and he said, ‘Even I saw that one coming’.

“Well I didn’t.

""You spend years in the SAS training to spot danger a mile off – and then a schoolgirl catches you completely off-guard.

“It just shows, you can never take anything for granted.”

93,93,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Mercury pollution in upper ocean has tripled since Industrial revolution - Blue & Green Tomorrow,https://blueandgreentomorrow.com/environment/mercury-pollution-in-upper-ocean-has-tripled-since-industrial-revolution/,"The amount of mercury in the upper ocean has tripled since the industrial revolution, according to a new study that leaves little doubt that humans are to blame.

Mercury, which is made as a byproduct in human activities such as fossil fuel burning and the mining, is toxic not just to marine life but also to us.

Using data collected data 12 sampling cruises over the past eight years; the study found that mercury levels in the upper 100 metres of the ocean have increased by a factor of 3.4 since the 1700s. The Arctic and North Atlantic oceans are the worst affected.

“It would seem that, if we want to regulate the mercury emissions into the environment and in the food we eat, then we should first know how much is there and how much human activity is adding every year,” said Carl Lamborg of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, an author of the study.

“At the moment, however, there is no way to look at a water sample and tell the difference between mercury that came from pollution and mercury that came from natural sources. Now we have a way to at least separate the bulk contributions of natural and human sources over time.”

When mercury builds up the bodies of fish and other edible forms of marine life, which are then consumed by people, it can be extremely harmful. Scientists already warn that pregnant women should avoid eating certain species of fish for this reason.

The authors of the new study stress that it is unclear how much damage this trend has done to marine life, or might do to us. But the results are alarming.

“You’re starting to overwhelm the ability of deep water formation to hide some of that mercury from us, with the net result that more and more of our emissions will be found in progressively shallower water,” Lamborg explained.

“That increases the odds that mercury levels in key food species will rise, increasing humans’ exposure.”

Don Rice, director of the Chemical Oceanography Program, added, “Mercury is a priority environmental poison detectable wherever we look for it, including the global ocean abyss.

“These scientists have reminded us that the problem is far from abatement, especially in regions of the world ocean where the human fingerprint is most distinct.”

Thompson singled out the Australian prime minister for criticism while on a visit to the remote island of Spitsbergen. She is pictured holding a sign that reads: “Tony Abbott climate change is real, I’m standing on it!”

Abbott previously called the science of climate change “crap” but has recently been at pains, while leading the world’s first repeal of a carbon price, to stress his acceptance that human activity is altering the world’s climate.

Thompson visited the Smeerenburg glacier in the north-west of Spitsbergen, which is part of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.

The double Oscar-winning actor is travelling in the region, along with her 14-year-old daughter, on the Greenpeace ship Esperanza to highlight the threat posed by climate change.

A study published in Nature last year found that Arctic sea ice had melted at a rate of 8% each decade over the past 30 years, driven by warming temperatures.

Thompson and Greenpeace also want a legal sanctuary to be declared to protect the Arctic from oil drilling and industrial fishing.

Thompson said: “We’re told that it is all our fault, global warming – we want the fuel, we want our cars, and that the oil industry is merely responding to the needs of a greedy public.

“But that’s simply not fair. Most of us want to live cleaner lives, but our governments don’t make these things easily available.

“The changes we need, that the Arctic needs, must come from the top as well as the bottom. We need electric cars to be cheaper and more accessible. We want safer bike lanes in every big city.

“We want plastic bags to be banned for good. We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them, and to give us all an affordable chance to live our lives in a more sustainable way.”","Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/8/1407463753777/e1d14ef9-2fd9-4561-ad6d-e90892e80c64-620x372.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1762d02078ed797256d8d9e825d501de,"['need', 'needs', 'send', 'change', 'message', 'visits', 'oil', 'emma', 'arctic', 'spitsbergen', 'thompson', 'warming', 'abbott', 'tony', 'climate', 'worlds']", ,none

96,96,Drought_china_DR-2014-000109-CHN_water_stress,Manatees may soon lose endangered species status after US review - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/29/manatees-florida-endangeres-species-review,"As they do whenever they visit Florida, Greg Groff and his young daughter stopped by the manatee pool at Miami Seaquarium, where the speed bump-shaped marine mammals placidly swim in circles.

They noted the pink scars and disfigured tail on one manatee, damage from a boat propeller that left it unable to survive in the wild.

Florida’s manatees need even more stringent protections than their listing on the federal endangered species list, Groff said, adding that boaters should go elsewhere if they don’t like speed limits in waters where manatees swim.

“There’s plenty of places they can go faster,” the Chicago man said. “They can go out in the middle of the ocean if they want to go much, much, much quicker, and you won’t have to worry about them running the manatees over.”

Groff’s comments are representative of the environmentalist and general public side of an ongoing fight with a group of boaters, businesses and conservatives over whether the manatee should retain its 1967 federal listing as an endangered species, the most protective classification.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing whether the manatee should be reclassified as a “threatened” species, which would allow some flexibility for federal officials as the species recovers while maintaining most of the protections afforded to animals listed as endangered.

As part of the lengthy review process, the agency is seeking public comment on its finding that a petition to reclassify the manatee has merits. The deadline is Tuesday. A decision on whether a change is warranted won’t be made until the agency completes its review, which could take a year.

Manatees, also known as sea cows, are vegetarian giants that average nearly 10 feet long and 2,200lbs and live near the shore and in coastal waterways around much of Florida. The animal’s biggest threats are boats, cold water, toxic algae blooms and fishing debris like discarded lines and ropes.

“If we come to the end of this and decide reclassification is warranted, it’s good news because it means the manatee is recovering and no longer on the brink of extinction,” agency spokesman Chuck Underwood said.

Critics of the manatee’s current endangered listing say manatees are important to the state’s tourism industry and environment, so everyone wants them to thrive, but the species has recovered sufficiently over the last 47 years to be reclassified. Florida’s manatee population has grown from several hundred in 1967 to over 4,800 in this year. Under current regulations, boaters must avoid manatee areas or obey tight speed limits and fishermen can’t use some equipment.

Save Crystal River Inc and the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation petitioned the government in 2012 to reclassify the manatee, citing a 2007 federal review that recommended listing the species as threatened since the population is recovering. They say if the federal government followed its own rules, the reclassification should be automatic.

“The truth is the manatee is protected the same as threatened as endangered, but they no longer can use the species to take over sovereign lands and sovereign waters with arbitrary rules,” said Steve Lamb, vice president of Save Crystal River, a group that represents about 100 members that include recreational boaters, tour operators, dive shops and hotels. The river, about 80 miles north of Tampa on Florida’s Gulf Coast, is warmed by natural springs and is a favorite winter congregating spot for manatees.

According to the wildlife service, officials began working on the reclassification proposal in 2013, but those efforts were suspended amid funding constraints, the US government shutdown and concerns over recent spikes in manatee deaths, particularly during cold snaps. A record 829 manatees died last year, breaking the 2010 record of 766, according to state records.

The most worrisome deaths last year were not collisions with boats. A record 276 manatee deaths were caused by a toxic red tide bloom in the Gulf of Mexico. There were also the unexplained deaths of more than 100 manatees on Florida’s east coast, where pollution and algae blooms have plagued a vital lagoon ecosystem.

Save the Manatees Club Executive Director Pat Rose said that while the species has certainly rebounded, the jump in deaths, particularly during cold snaps, means more work is needed before they lose endangered status.

“The most compelling reason not to down-list them is the status of their ecosystems,” Rose said. “If you maintain good quality habitat, you can overcome catastrophic mortality events. If you are dealing with both catastrophic mortality events and unrelenting compromises to their aquatic ecosystems at the same time, that’s when you need to be acting very conservatively.”

But Lamb says the government is bowing to political pressure and emotion, highlighting conservation efforts at the expense of the law and business.

“Does anyone ever want to talk about how last year 1,000 manatees were born? Heck, no. All they want to talk about is how many died,” Lamb said.

The vast majority of comments submitted to the wildlife service plead with officials to continue listing the manatee as endangered. Florida residents cite the manatees they’ve seen with scars from run-ins with boats or fishing debris, while out-of-state commenters describe the thrill of spotting the unique marine mammals in the water.

Some say the manatee should be protected as a symbol, not just as an animal.

“In a world filled with war, deadly viruses and everyday violence ... the gentle manatee offers a vision of peaceful existence all would like to possess,” wrote one commenter.","Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/29/1409315020611/052518ab-f1b2-4fbf-b2f3-4f06f28fc986-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8a4129680c9dd9d140d9dc1050e057c6,"['species', 'federal', 'manatees', 'soon', 'listing', 'status', 'review', 'manatee', 'threatened', 'boaters', 'lose', 'deaths', 'endangered', 'wildlife']", ,none

In his most popular role, he was a highly in-demand cruise ship comedian who joined up to 25 ships a year to spin laughs in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and seemingly all ports in between.

Many comedians aspire to be club headliners and land on television, and that’s what Rich Ceisler accomplished. He appeared on HBO, Showtime, Comedy Central, and more, but he also sought a wider audience.

He was an “ambassador of comedy,” said his longtime manager, Dee Mura. “He was one of the most well-traveled comedians. He loved going places, and the more exotic they were, the more he liked them. His energy was amazing. He just had a marvelous sense of life and adventure.”

Mr. Ceisler, who was scheduled to perform soon in Fiji, Tahiti, and Bali, took ill on a ship off Haiti July 23. Diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which the nervous system is attacked, he was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Santiago in the Dominican Republic, where he died Aug. 4. Mr. Ceisler was 58 and lived in Wakefield.

His fiancée, Catherine Doyle, and his best friend, Comedy Connection cofounder Paul Barclay, flew to his side when he became sick. Doyle and Mr. Ceisler had planned to marry on Aug. 9. She had just left a public relations job in Montreal to move to Mr. Ceisler’s Wakefield home and prepare to travel with him during the next year.

“Rich’s material was clever, witty, clean, and he could get a laugh out of a 6-year-old or a 96-year-old,’” said Mike McDonald, a friend and fellow comic. “Sometimes on a cruise ship you play to a family of four generations, and he could do that.”

McDonald followed Mr. Ceisler into cruise ship comedy, as did Jimmy Dunn, another friend who is scheduled to appear this fall on the CBS sitcom “The McCarthys.”

“Rich was one of the first Boston guys to figure out that he could travel the world like a millionaire in exchange for performing on cruise ships,” Dunn said. “And he taught me the ins and outs of the cruise industry. He opened my eyes to a world I never thought I’d be part of.”

Mr. Ceisler would take friends and his sister, Lauri Vinick of Chestnut Hill, on some trips.

“We just went out in November on a big ship called Oasis of the Sea,” she said. “He was so excited to have us experience it, and he made sure they had a special birthday dinner for me.”

He led a “nomadic life, but he was so good at observing people and the country they were from, their customs, their food, their transportation,” said Mura, his manager. “He worked to make all of them laugh. No matter where we put him, he always did well.”

Mr. Ceisler helped other artists, too. Singer Amy Fairchild recalled how he invited her to be his opening act on a 2006 trip to China.

“We played in Shanghai and Beijing for ex-pats,” she said. “And we went to the Great Wall of China. It was one of the highlights of my life.”

Mr. Ceisler grew up in North Bellmore, N.Y., on Long Island. His father, Ralph, was a salesman who did impersonations, and his mother, the former Shirley Mendelson, was a Wellesley College graduate who wrote parodies.

They learned early that their son was arts oriented when he plunged into theater and emceed a school talent show.

“My mom and dad realized that this kid was not going to have an office job,” his sister said. “I don’t think he ever had a real job. He was always an entertainer.”

As an undergraduate, Mr. Ceisler studied theater at the State University of New York at Fredonia, and he received a master’s in theater from Virginia Tech. He joined a comedy/improv troupe in Buffalo and then moved to Boston to join a surge of standup comics, including Steven Wright, Bobcat Goldthwait, Denis Leary, and Lenny Clarke.

“He was one of the people who helped form the scene, and he was one of the most natural comics,” Barclay said. “Some guys would walk in with a notebook full of stuff. He’d walk in with almost nothing. He’d just be Rich.”

Mr. Ceisler’s sister said he displayed “a Seinfeld kind of observational humor. He had an everyman attitude and was wonderfully self-deprecating. He was self-deprecating about his weight as he got bigger, and about his lack of love before he met Catherine.”

His life changed seven years ago when he met Doyle on a cruise ship. She enjoyed his show and sat next to him in a ship’s bar, where he asked her to dinner. They pursued a long-distance relationship from their homes in Montreal and Boston, and she often joined him on trips.

“He was so good to me,” she said. “He would do anything for me. He was kind, gentle, and very intelligent. He traveled so much that we joked that on our honeymoon we would just stay home and watch TV.”

A service for Mr. Ceisler was planned for Sunday at 11 a.m. in Temple Beth Avodah in Newton. Doyle and Vinki were Mr. Ceisler’s only immediate survivors.

Everyone from Pepsi to the Harvard Business School sought out Mr. Ceisler, who enjoyed great success with his “corporate chameleon” role. Hired to appear as expert speaker, he often posed as his alter ego.

“I usually do the show as Dr. Richard Clark, a stress management expert,” Mr. Ceisler told the Globe in 1998.

“That’s my job,” he told the Globe in another interview nearly a year later. “To be a comic, you need to develop a personality; otherwise you’re just some person who tells jokes.”

Mr. Ceisler “was a big teddy bear,” his fiancée said. “There wasn’t an ounce of aggression in him. He had a blessed life. He got to do what he wanted in a field where not everybody can make it like that.”

At least two explosions rocked a boys’ school in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that had been designated as a United Nations shelter for Gazans fleeing days of fighting. Palestinian officials said at least 10 people were killed and about three dozen injured in blasts at the gates of the compound.

The Israeli military said it was investigating the incident, the latest of at least half a dozen deadly strikes on or near U.N. facilities in Gaza during nearly four weeks of fighting. Israel has acknowledged accidentally bombarding one school where people were sheltering, but has blamed other strikes on errant Palestinian rocket fire or said its troops were hitting back at a source of fire from suspected Hamas fighters.

“This madness must stop,” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has taken part in failed mediation efforts, said in a statement. However, he did not assign blame for the attack.

A strongly worded U.S. statement appeared to suggest Israel was to blame for shelling near the school run by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.

“The United States is appalled by today’s disgraceful shelling outside a UNRWA school in Rafah sheltering some 3,000 displaced persons, in which at least 10 more Palestinian civilians were tragically killed,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

“We once again stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties,” she said.

The State Department comments were among the strongest to date criticizing Israel for the rising civilian death toll. In previous statements, the Obama administration had been careful to avoid assigning blame and frequently focused on Israel’s right to respond to Hamas rockets.

The stronger rhetoric may reflect a growing U.S. frustration with the reluctance by both sides to resolve the conflict.

Last week, after Hamas was blamed for breaking a cease-fire agreement and killing three Israeli soldiers, the U.S. called the attack an “outrageous violation.”

With the latest deaths, the overall Palestinian death toll was closing in on 1,800, most of them said to be civilians — a figure surpassing the total combined deaths in Israel’s two previous Gaza offensives over the last five years. At least 64 Israeli troops have been killed, Israel’s biggest wartime losses since a monthlong war in Lebanon eight years ago.

Israeli officials suggested that the ground operation in the Gaza Strip, focused on destroying Palestinian militants’ “attack tunnels” and rocket-launching capabilities, was winding down, but they emphasized that all options remained open.

“In the next 24 hours we will continue ongoing activities and redeployment of some of our forces” in Gaza, Israeli army spokesman Peter Lerner said during a news briefing. He said the military was “extremely close” to achieving its aims, but that “the reality on the ground can take us either way.”

Witnesses in Rafah, a bedraggled town on the Egyptian border that has been the scene of intense battles since Friday, described a chaotic scene after explosions hit Palestinians lined up for much-needed supplies outside the school. The facility was used as a U.N. shelter, and thousands of displaced people were taking refuge there. Some inside the grounds were hurt as well, medics said.

Children were among the dead and injured, witnesses and officials said. Television video showed overwhelmed medical personnel cradling limp, blood-soaked bundles, able to offer only rudimentary open-air treatment to some of the wounded. Palestinian women wailed and slapped their faces in grief.

“Blood was mixing with spilled water, like a waterfall,” said Aboud Nijem, who lives close to the site of the explosions.

Palestinians said the death toll in Rafah was expected to rise as bodies were dug from the rubble of battles of recent days. The town and its environs have been pummeled by Israeli airstrikes since militant fighters emerged from a tunnel on Friday morning, ambushing and killing two Israeli soldiers.

A third, 2nd Lt. Hadar Goldin, had been feared captured. But early Sunday, the Israeli military said that based on evidence gathered from the scene, he had been declared dead. His funeral Sunday drew thousands of Israeli mourners.

He was eulogized by his father, a Tel Aviv University professor; his twin brother, also serving in the army; and his fiancee. “I so wanted to be your bride,” she said through tears. Three other Israeli soldiers were buried Sunday afternoon as well.

Israel’s minister of defense, Moshe Yaalon, also revealed a familial tie to Goldin, which was withheld while the soldier was missing but not yet declared dead. Yaalon’s grandfather was brother to Goldin’s great-grandmother, he said on Twitter, and he had known the lieutenant since he was a child.

On the periphery of the Gaza Strip, Israel withdrew more ground troops and repositioned others, even while continuing fierce bombardment of what it described as militant targets — more than 100 strikes in the 24 hours ending Sunday morning.

Hamas has painted the Israeli pullback that has taken place so far as a victory, and spokesman Sami abu Zuhri vowed that Israel would suffer whether or not its troops remained in Gaza.

Successive international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire have failed, with the latest truce effort collapsing Friday. Egypt invited international mediators and other parties for another round of talks, but the combatants — Israel and Hamas — were absent.
